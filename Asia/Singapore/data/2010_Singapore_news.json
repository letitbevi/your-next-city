The plant&apos;s closure marks the culmination of a tough year for the scotch whisky industry which has been forced to slash jobs in the face of a deep recession. As with many of its consumers, scotch producers partied through several bumper years only to face a major financial headache last year. Demand for the spirit began to slow in early 2009 and cracks began to appear in some of the industry&apos;s traditional export markets. Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) figures show sales, by value, were down 3.5% at \u00a32.1bn for the first nine months of 2009. After the high of three boom years, which culminated in record exports of \u00a33.1bn in 2008, last year was one of the toughest in recent memory for the industry. Diageo prompted union fury by pushing through restructuring that will eliminate 900 jobs and end Johnnie Walker&apos;s historic links with Kilmarnock. Whyte &amp; Mackay, owned by Indian billionaire Vijay Mallya, cut a third of its workforce, while in November the Edrington Group announced plans to mothball Tamdhu, the Speyside distillery \u2013 whose malt is a main component of Famous Grouse \u2013 for only the second time in its 112-year history. But SWA public affairs manager David Williamson says the figures for 2009 were &quot;encouraging&quot; as conditions had improved after a &quot;tough&quot; first quarter: &quot;Scotch whisky has been recession-resilient if not recession-immune.&quot; A surge in exports to countries such as Venezuela, which jumped 83%, helped offset problem markets such as Singapore where sales slumped 20%. Diageo says the restructuring of its Scottish operation was not a defensive move but the magnitude of the global recession is seen to have hastened its progress. Johnnie Walker sales fell 11% last year while J&amp;B, a favourite tipple of Spaniards when mixed with Coke, was off 13% as whisky exports to the recession-ravaged country plunged 26%. Edrington said the mothballing of Tamdhu was to &quot;rebalance its distillation capacity&quot; after the downturn &quot;flattened&quot; sales. It is not the first time the industry has faced a hiatus. In the late 1970s, exuberant sales estimates resulted in the so-called &quot;Whisky Loch&quot;. But distillers were forced to turn down production and mothball sites after growth fell short of expectations. Exports also slumped during the Asian economic crisis: dropping from \u00a32.4bn in 1997 back to \u00a32bn in 1998. About 9,500 people, many in economically deprived parts of Scotland, are employed directly by the industry \u2013 though the UK supply chain has more than 60,000 workers. Geography was a significant factor in the political firestorm that followed Diageo&apos;s decision to close the Johnnie Walker bottling plant in Kilmarnock and the Port Dundas grain distillery in Glasgow, even though 400 new jobs are being created at its Cameron Bridge grain distillery in Fife. The bitter six month-long dispute was only resolved in recent days when workers voted to accept the redundancy package. Diageo says history is not repeating itself and that its strategy remains unchanged despite straitened times. &quot;The industry got it badly wrong in the 70s,&quot; says Ken Robertson, head of corporate relations at Diageo Whisky, who says consolidation and sophisticated forecasting methods mean the industry is a leaner, more efficient beast today. &quot;The restructuring was not driven by the recession but by a long-term view of our business and the way we see investment panning out in the future.&quot; Scotch accounts for a quarter of Diageo&apos;s sales with the lion&apos;s share of its whisky output, which also includes Bell&apos;s, Bushmills and Benmore, destined for export. &quot;We need to get our business to a place where we can meet long-term sustainable growth,&quot; adds Robertson. He says the industry learned a harsh lesson from the &quot;Whisky Loch&quot; years as they were followed by two decades of tough love, when growth bumped along at 0.5%. It was only five years ago that flowering demand from India, China and emerging markets gave the industry grounds for optimism. &quot;We have had to put on capacity to meet long-term demand and I&apos;d argue that is the right call to make,&quot; says Robertson, who adds that the company has factored several recessions into its growth plans. &quot;Individual companies will be making adjustments based on what they see ahead and the amount of stock they are sitting on.&quot; The SWA insists that scotch producers still have a bright future. The export figures for 2009 will not be available for several weeks but Williamson says the final quarter is an important period accounting for 40% of malt sales and 30% of blended scotch. He adds that making whisky is a marathon not a sprint: to be labelled scotch whisky, the spirit must mature in oak casks for at least three years. &quot;It is a long-term business,&quot; he says. &quot;What is distilled today will not be scotch whisky by law until after the London Olympic Games [in 2012] \u2013 or bottled by the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016.&quot; Despite the gloom that descended last year, SWA figures suggest investment is running at its highest level since the early 1970s, with more than \u00a3500m earmarked for new distilleries, extensions and bottling plants in the past two years. After the drastic cuts in the 1980s the number of licensed distilleries has risen to 109, with a further seven in prospect, including Diageo&apos;s new malt whisky distillery at Roseisle in Speyside, which will open in the spring. The export potential of scotch has been boosted by sophisticated marketing that has helped shed the bagpipes-and-shortbread image and acquire a luxury cachet. Mallya&apos;s \u00a3600m acquisition of Whyte &amp; Mackay in 2007 was viewed as a defensive measure ahead of the eventual opening-up of the vast Indian market, where just 1% of whisky drunk is scotch, and there is a burgeoning middle class. &quot;Right now things are difficult on a global basis,&quot; adds Robertson. &quot;The industry has to hold its nerve and keep its long-term perspective.&quot; New world whiskies put Scottish pride on the rocks A tough year for exports of scotch whisky coincided with some big blows to Scotland&apos;s distilling pride. In the awards stakes, 2009 was a year of success for overseas whiskies and Scotland&apos;s claim to be the world&apos;s finest producer came under threat from distilleries in America, Japan, India and even England. Early this year international whisky authority Jim Murray named 18-year-old Sazerac Rye from Kentucky in America the finest whisky in the world. Its top billing in Murray&apos;s 2010 Whisky Bible pushed Ardbeg Supernova from Islay into second place, while there was further upset for the scotch industry with his third place choice \u2013 it went to a single malt distilled in Bangalore called Amrut Fusion. Japanese producers have also been enjoying widespread acclaim for their malts, piling up awards and exporting their whiskies around the world, including onto the shelves of UK supermarkets. England got in on the act in 2009, as the English Whisky Co bottled the first English whisky for more than a century at its distillery in Norfolk and has even been shipping to Scotland.

While you wait for Andy, why not relive the final day of that Test by reading Barney Ronay&apos;s over-by-over report? Meanwhile here&apos;s a preview of today&apos;s match, with England hopeful all-rounder Paul Collingwood will be fit to play. Elsewhere Vic Marks has written about how England have flourished under the tutelage of Andy Flower. He reckons Flower and his captain, Strauss, have done magnificently well to salvage a year that began in chaotic style. And after his heroics in the second Test, why not find out how Graeme Swann has matured from a joker into a key man for England?  Morning everyone. It seems my lung-busting late dash to the office this morning - thanks very much Transport for London - has been in vain. Because it is raining in Cape Town. Or at least it has been. The latest news is that the covers are coming off now, but the toss has been delayed  all the same and will take place at 9.25am.  Phew. At least I can take a moment to recover then.  I&apos;ve had a little bit of team news through from the ground: South Africa have bitten the bullet and decided to drop the knacked old lag of their attack, Makhaya Ntini. He has been put in the back of the van with Boxer and packed off to the glue factory, replaced in the side by Friedel de Wet. So South Africa look like this: Graeme Smith, Ashwell Prince, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Mark Boucher, Paul Harris, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Friedel de Wet.  &quot;Is that a photo of Swanny enjoying what Barney Ronay described as &apos;the Broadinator and his rearing bumpers&apos;?&quot; asks James Debens, somewhat bafflingly to anyone who hasn&apos;t been keeping up to speed with Barney&apos;s columns over Christmas, myself included. &quot;My fear is that we&apos;re about to receive the same in cricketing terms, especially from Graeme &apos;Biff&apos; Smith.&quot;  They&apos;re aiming for an 8.45am start, but it seems to have started drizzling again over Mike Atherton&apos;s shoulder. Athers reckons that whoever wins the toss will want to bowl first, because the ball has been swinging around in practice this morning. As Duncan Fletcher pointed out in these pages the other day though, Newlands is a very hard pitch to read.  And yes, Paul Collingwood is playing for England. They are, I assume, unchanged from the last match, but if you really want to read a team listing I&apos;ve cut-and-pasted from the news wires, well, who am I to deny you? AJ Strauss, AN Cook, IJL Trott, KP Pietersen, PD Collingwood, IR Bell, MJ Prior, SCJ Broad, GP Swann, JM Anderson, G Onions.  So, you take a few days off for Christmas and when you come back... everyone seems to think that England are the best team in the world, and the lead singer of Dr Comfort and the Lurid Revelations is suddenly the no3 ranked Test bowler in the world, the most dazzling debutant spinner England have had since, umm, Monty Panesar.  For Swann, everything is going to get harder from here on in. I think the same may be true for England. As you may have read by now, South Africa have won 14 of their 20 Tests at this ground since they returned to Test cricket in 1992. Of the other six, three have been drawn, and three lost, all of those last to Australia. It is a formidable record.  England were 1-0 up after two matches in the series when they last played here, back in 2004/&apos;05. And duly got thumped by 196 runs, routed by a combination of Charl Langeveldt (5-46) and Jacques Kallis (149). And that&apos;s before we even being to think about Headingley &apos;09. Strauss, at least, has been making all the right noises, as he always does: &quot;There have been a lot of people patting and telling us how great we were. It&apos;s important we don&apos;t read too much into that. It&apos;s very much a case of being desperate to win again and I like the feeling in the dressing room at the moment.&quot;  The rain is holding off for the moment, and the toss will take place in ten minutes&apos; time, at 8.45am.  &quot;I&apos;m here in a miserable Co. Wicklow with my baby daughter,&quot; writes a rather glum-sounding Gary Gibson, &quot;catching snippets of the discussion, when she will allow me flick over from Ben and Holly&apos;s Little Kingdom (which is actually quite watchable). Anyway, while noting the discussion about Broad&apos;s agression, I cant help thinking of a Munster Rugby mantra - (one of the many noble statements that those turnip munchers probably lifted from somewhere else) - &apos;Fire in the belly, Ice in the Mind&apos;.&quot; Mmm, like a man trying to sure a cold by eating a curry?  I knew there was something I meant to mention, but what was it now? Oh yes, this: hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah Australia have been dismissed for 127 by Pakistan in the first innings of the second Test ahahahahahahaha.  Oh my sides.  This tells you all you the need to know about Andrew Strauss&apos;s approach to captaincy: England have won the toss and chosen to bowl first. The decison raised a roar from the crowd, and caused Graeme Smith to stride off in a funk. He admits afterwards that he wanted to bowl first himself. England, 1-0 up, have taken a risk here, but it is the right one: they&apos;re going for the throat.  England need to use that new ball well. The pitch, and the conditions, could easily have become far more mellow by the end of the day.  Curses! Botham says that the pitch is bowler-friendly, well grassed and tinged green. We can almost certainly expect South Africa to be 400-1 by stumps then.  Back to the SCG for just a moment - what a brilliant performance that was by Pakistan and Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Sami, who took 9-68 between them.  Phil Withall will be relieved anyway: &quot;Having spent a lazy day watching the Aussies capitulate to Pakistan having won the toss and electing to bat I&apos;m hoping that Strauss doesn&apos;t &apos;do a Ponting&apos; and follow suit. The sight of Ricky getting out for a Golden almost makes Brisbane&apos;s 96% humidity liveable...&quot;  This is quite exciting isn&apos;t it? Amazing what a week off will do for one&apos;s spirits. This morning&apos;s play should be fascinating, what with the decision taken by Strauss and the amount of movement that seems to be on offer for the bowlers...  &quot;I&apos;m sat here in Wellington, New Zealand, waiting for the match to start,&quot; writes Sam Lister as the players come out onto the pitch, &quot;having spent the entire day glued to the telly cheering on the inspired Pakistan bowlers - trying (and failing) to encourage my girlfriend to cheer with me. It was made all the better by a commentary box filled with Warne, Healy, Taylor, Slater etc... all struggling to come to terms with the turkey shoot. Now I fear that my punishment will be for England to throw away that series lead.&quot; Butterfly effect Sam - a single movement from you could result in a dropped catch in Cape Town. I suggest you sit absolutely still for the next seven hours, just in case...  1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Smith 1, Prince 0) Anderson, a grin on his face, opens the attack. He&apos;s looking for swing, his first ball is full but fades down the leg side, and Smith pats it away for a single to leg. Distressingly, the Barmy Army are bellowing out Jerusalem in the background. Phew - Anderson&apos;s second ball zings off the pitch, swinging past Prince&apos;s outside edge and then...!  WICKET! Prince 0 c Prior b Anderson Prince falls for a duck to his third ball! And what a brute it was! The ball spat off the pitch, flicking Prince&apos;s gloves as it swang away from him. It looks like he was actually trying to leave the ball, but it seemed to follow him. Prior took the catch, and South Africa are 1-1. What a start by England. The pressure coming down on the South Africans now is going to be crushing to bear.  2nd over: South Africa 9-1 (Smith 9, Amla 0) Dropped! First ball! Swann fluffs a simple catch at second slip! Oh dear! Smith plays a loose drive at a wide ball from Onions, and the ball snicked off the edge straight into Swann&apos;s midriff, but he bungled it. Seems he was still rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. Collingwood is not fielding in the slips, by the way, because of his finger. Frustrated, Onions drops short and Smith smashes four through leg, a pull played with palpable relief. Bah. The next ball is a similar length, and again Smith stands up and clouts four through long leg.  3rd over: South Africa 11-1 (Smith 10, Amla 1) The look Onions shot at Swann after that drop was utterly disdainful. He was furious. &quot;Less of the ahahahahhaa journalism please,&quot; is the polite request of Poppy McNee, &quot;that Aussie innings is still smarting! I wouldn&apos;t be insanely bouyant going into this game If I were you, Asif and Sami did amazingly, but can you really see England following suit?! Really?&quot; After those first two overs, I&apos;m tempted to answer &apos;yes&apos; to Poppy&apos;s email, which is why I chose to publish it I suppose. Still, there are no jaffas from Anderon in this over, which sees Amla and Smith swap singles.  4th over: South Africa 13-1 (Smith 12, Amla 1) Smith strides out and pushes two runs through cover with a firm drive. Onions brings the next ball back in towards him though, and it thumps Smith in the stomach. The &apos;oofff&apos; that escapes his mouth as the ball hit was clearly audible. Onions shrewdly pitches the next ball up, looking for the yorker, but Smith is equal to it. What a damagaing drop that could turn out to be from Swann. Smith is not the kind of man you want to give second chances to, especially when he must be hell-bent on battling his way to a big score. It also seems to have drawn a little of the vim and vigour from England. &quot;I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m right but was Swann trying to protect his &apos;family jewels&apos; rather than catch the ball from Smith?&quot; asks Phil Withall, &quot;Surely a series win over the Saffars is more important than any personal gains.&quot; Or losses Phil, to be more precise. I suppose a man can&apos;t be blamed for obeying his natural instincts...  5th over: South Africa 16-1 (Smith 12, Amla 3) &quot;25% of Amla&apos;s dismissals have been dismissed,&quot; Bumble tells us, after getting his tongue in a tangle. One for Colemanballs that. The third delivery of Anderson&apos;s over is a no-ball. Astonishingly, it is the first that England have conceded in the entire series. The sixth ball flies off the outside edge of Amla&apos;s bat and disappears through the gap between slip and gull, running away for two runs.  6th over: South Africa 19-1 (Smith 15, Amla 3) &quot;I wonder, do you or any readers know how to make the Guardian iphone app update for the OBO?&quot; asks Ian Simons. Ian, I&apos;m afraid that the last I heard the iphone thingymajig only updated itself every 15 minutes, so you have to wait a little longer for your OBO fix. Smith, meanwhile, has cut three runs out to deep point.  7th over: South Africa 19-1 (Smith 15, Amla 3) England have brought Luke Wright on to field in place of Broad, who is presumably doing a little off-pitch preparation for his first spell of the match. I expect he will come on for Onions, who has not really recovered from the frustration of that fumble. Anderson continues, testing Smith with a fuller ball. Smith walks away to the leg side, snorting at Anderson from underneath his helmet. It&apos;s a maiden over, the best delivery being the sixth, which Smith played at but missed.  8th over: South Africa 24-1 (Smith 15, Amla 3) Onions gives up four leg byes, the ball ricocheting away off Amla&apos;s pads. The next four deliveries are straighter and shorter, but none of them trouble Amla especially, who either leaves them alone or pats them out to the off side. The sixth produces another leg bye.  9th over: South Africa 28-1 (Smith 15, Amla 7) &quot;I&apos;m following this online from Singapore, only problem is all I can get is the damn South African commentary - can&apos;t find Sky/TMS anywhere. Imagine my delight when Boycs just came on for a stint! Can anyone give me any info on his commentary during SA&apos;s 4th day collapse in Durban?&quot; asks Phil White, &quot;Comedy gold apparently.&quot; Indeed it was - he was giggling like a schoolgirl at a funfair, in fact he was enjoying it so much he even asked if he could stay on and commentate for a longer stint. It was another episode in what seems to be the ongoing personality breakdown he has been suffering on his TMS spells over the last year or so. Amla tucks four off his pads and away through fine leg.  10th over: South Africa 28-1 (Smith 15, Amla 7) And here is Stuart Broad, who, as Tom Lutz astutely points out, seems to have had a haircut between the last match and this. It makes him look rather like Luke Wright. Broad starts with a maiden over, and that is drinks.  11th over: South Africa 29-1 (Smith 15, Amla 8) These two have batted well since they came together. The pause to think and collect a few thoughts during that drinks break may just have helped England regroup. Anderson settles on a line outside off stump to Amla, keeping the ball fullish and trying to lure him into a drive. Shaun Pollock suggests Strauss has got his field wrong, and that England should remove point and bring him in to be a second gully.  REFERRAL! Amla 8 c Prior b Broad (12th over: South Africa 29-1) England appeal for a catch behind off the outside egde after a drive from Amla. The umpire turns it down and, almost immediately, Strauss refers it. Given that there is no hotspot, nor a snickometer, it&apos;s a fairly futile exercise. The microphone suggests that there was a noise as the ball passed the bat, but that&apos;s not evidence enough to over-turn the decision and the Amla continues at the crease. It&apos;s another maiden over. England though are convinced that they should have had a wicket in that over. If the referral system is designed to &quot;eliminate glaring errors&quot; England clearly don&apos;t think that it is working. &quot;During Boycott&apos;s last TMS stint (9th over) I actually heard him laughing &apos;hee hee hee&apos;,&quot; writes John Starbuck, &quot;I thought it was just a literary convention but Boycs proved me wrong.&quot;  13th over: South Africa 29-1 (Smith 15, Amla 8) Onions is back on now, at the other end. And that is a screaming, roaring heartfelt appeal for an LBW from England. They think they&apos;ve got Smith, but the umpire doesn&apos;t. England, perhaps still rueing their last referral, decide to accept the decision. A wise choice, just, Hawkeye shows the ball was just clipping the top of off stump. &quot;Can you explain the referral rules in place?&quot; asks Jon Vaughan, &quot;it seems with the Aussie / Pakistan match there is hotspot in use - is it not the same in this match?&quot; Sadly, no it&apos;s not. The South African TV company who are providing the footage of the series can&apos;t afford to use the equipment needed to provide hotspot. If they could, Amla would have been given out on referral. That discrepency makes the system more than a little farcical. To be frank, I&apos;ve had enough of it already - it&apos;s more than a bit rubbish because, as we&apos;ve just seen, it clearly doesn&apos;t work as it is supposed to.  14th over: South Africa 35-1 (Smith 15, Amla 14) Broad gives up his first runs of the morning, Amla flicking two through sqaure leg. Broad&apos;s spell broken, Amla then carves the next ball through cover for four.  15th over: South Africa 40-1 (Smith 20, Amla 14) Smith wallops four through cover as Onions offers up a wide full toss. He steals a single from the next ball.  16th over: South Africa 45-1 (Smith 25, Amla 14) The clouds are slowly disappearing over Newlands, and the sky starting to brighten. It&apos;s all a little ominous for England. Smith lumps two runs out to the on side, and then threads Broad&apos;s next ball away through cover for three. Broad then hammers down a pair of bouncers at Amla.  WICKET! Amla 14 LBW Onions (17th over: South Africa 46-2)  Amla goes! LBW to a full, straight delivery that leaves no room a referral. He looked up at Smith to see if he should ask for a review, but Smith only gave him a curt shake of his head. It was as plum as a pudding, the ball going on to hit the middle of middle. Amla was undone playing across the line, his head dragging his balance over towards the off side. He fell in very similar fashion in the first innings at Durban. Jacques Kallis is in.  18th over: South Africa 49-2 (Smith 26, Kallis 0) A key moment in the series this, as Atheron sagely suggests. With South Africa&apos;s two key batsmen in, and the score finely poised in the first innings of this crucial Test. England have tended to get Kallis cheaply or not get him at all, his scores in this series being 120, 4, 75 and 3. He plays out four dot balls here, after being put on strike by a single to fine leg from Smith.  19th over: South Africa 51-2 (Smith 29, Kallis 1) Kallis collects his first run, and Smith then pats two to fine leg to raise his team&apos;s fifty. There&apos;s a smattering of applause, and the next ball ends the session. What an interesting one it has been.  That is lunch then. England will still be rueing that dropped catch at slip by Swann, especially given that Smith has hardly given them a sniff of a wicket since. If he settles in, this could be a long day&apos;s yakka indeed. I&apos;m off to forage for food, and I believe Sean Ingle will be here at 11am or so to talk you through the afternoon session.  LUNCH  Good afternoon everyone, wherever you are in the world I know it&apos;s a statement of the obvious, but this could be a crucial session in determining the fate of this series: the pitch is offering plenty of nip and dart, but the weather is brightening and South Africa&apos;s two obdurates, Smith and Kallis are in. Interestingly(ish), both perform better at Newlands than their Test average. Smith, averages 54.94 in Tests here (compared to 49.62 in all Tests) while Kallis averages 65.86 in Tests (compared to 54.57 in all Tests).  The umpires have confirmed that this session will last two-and-a-half hours to make up for the time lost due to rain this morning. Meanwhile this from Poppy McNee. &quot;Does any kind OBOer know where I can buy, or is willing to sell me the glorious trio of talking Beefy, Boony and Merv from the infamous VB Boonanza campaign? I have a terrible need to own them, which is strangely the only ridiculous consumerist purchase I am willing to make to Do My Bit to Halt the Recession.&quot; Can anyone help? And if you want to tell me what you&apos;re doing to Halt the Recession, I&apos;m all ears ...  20th over: South Africa 51-2 (Smith 30, Kallis 1) Stuart Broad (5-1-12-0) gets proceedings underway after lunch. On commentary, Ian Botham - sorry, Sir Ian Botham - thinks the ball will still seam and might even swing now the weather is considerably warmer. No sign of that yet, however. Broad is generally pitching six inches outside off-stump, with Kallis content mostly to leave, although he has to react fairly sharpish to a bouncer that whistles over his head. Maiden. Meanwhile here&apos;s Paul Weaver&apos;s report from the morning session.  WICKET! Smith c Prior b Anderson 30 Superb from Anderson, who strikes with his first ball after lunch. It was a standard left-hander dismissal, Smith pushing forward to a delivery slanted across him, getting the edge, and the diving Prior taking an excellent catch just in front of Strauss at first slip.  21st over: South Africa 52-3 (Kallis 1, De Villiers 1) A heart-in-mouth moment for Kallis there, as De Villiers goes for a sharp single off the first delivery. The throw hits the stumps, but Kallis was well in. Meanwhile your emails about what you&apos;re doing to beat the recession are trickling in. &quot;Yesterday I bought a new bed,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;I&apos;m not sure how far it helps us beat the recession, though as, after shopping around, I got one from the factory outlet instead of a regular retailer, which means I paid just a little over half the regular price. I&apos;ve been living in Yorkshire for nearly twenty years and I think it&apos;s beginning to affect me.&quot;  22nd over: South Africa 59-3 (Kallis 5, De Villiers 4) De Villiers&apos; block-prod through third man has three England fielders chasing it. It seems, comically, to almost gather pace as it races down the hill, but Strauss is able to cut off the boundary. Later in the over, Kallis clouts Broad&apos;s late-swinging delivery through the covers for four. &quot;Once he&apos;s got rid of the rest of the SA batting line-up (ie, Kallis) then recession-busting is the next task on Swann&apos;s list,&quot; suggests Ian Copestake.  23rd over: South Africa 61-3 (Kallis 5, De Villiers 5) Anderson continues to probe outside off stump, although one bouncer that&apos;s higher than Renata Tebaldi hitting a top note is given a wide by Tony Hill. &quot;Just to let Poppy McNee know that I have a pair of said Beefy and Boony dolls,&quot; says Tom Bowtell. &quot;And am very much in love with them. When their batteries go low, Beefy says, understandably: &apos;Beefy&apos;s batteries need changing&apos; and Boonie then chides him for whinging.&quot; Any chance of a picture?  24th over: South Africa 65-3 (Kallis 5, De Villiers 9) Chance! AB Villiers slashes at a wider Broad delivery outside offstump and it flies narrowly over Swann&apos;s outstretched arms. The Sky commentary team don&apos;t think that was much of a chance, but surely Collingwood would have got a lot closer to it? &quot;What recession?&quot; chuckles Dave from Perth, Western Australia.  25th over: South Africa 70-3 (Kallis 9, De Villiers 9) Kallis slashes a boundary off Anderson through third man, but is otherwise content to watch. &quot;Please tell Poppy McNee that there was no Merv Hughes doll during the VB Boonanza promotion and Sir Beefy wasnt actually Beefy doing the voice (Boony was f&apos;real though),&quot; says Matthew Davies. &quot;However they were genius in many ways - they actually reacted to events that were happening on the cricket in real time and would actually do little ditties between them answering each others jibes. Quality all round. This year&apos;s pop-up pub does&apos;t look bad either. However I really dont want to have to drink VB to get one ...&quot;  26th over: South Africa 76-3 (Kallis 15, De Villiers 10) Shot from Kallis! Broad overpitches, and is thrashed through long on. This pitch is starting to look a little easier to bat on - the ball is certainly seaming less than it was. &quot;We are driving back to London from the Lake District and have somehow ended up with a complicated competition where points are awarded for fulfilment of responsibilities - cricket updates, driving and handing out of snacks respectively,&quot; says Kat Petersen. &quot;I can only get a point for every wicket England take, but I apparently win the entire thing if this email gets published. I don&apos;t exactly understand it either, but the M6 is quite tedious...&quot; Oh go on then ...  27th over: South Africa 83-3 (Kallis 16, De Villiers 16) Anderson (10-1-26-2) continues, and so do the runs with De Villiers guiding a sweet cover drive to the boundary. Seven off the over and this partnership is now 32 off 40. &quot;I beat the recession by getting myself a DVD set of The Wire, Complete Series - all 60 episodes,&quot; says Sunil X. &quot;The wife got herself more shoes. Our Xmas gifts to each other was exchange of 2 x $100 bills.&quot; Who says romance is dead?  28th over: South Africa 85-3 (Kallis 16, De Villiers 18) Swann replaces Broad. Everyone is expecting the South Africans to be more aggressive when facing him, and De Villiers&apos; paddle-sweep around the corner is perhaps a sign of that. Two off a decent first over. Meanwhile this from Tom Van Der Gucht. &quot;David Tennant&apos;s sign-off as Doctor Who reminded me of the self-satisfying backslapping that followed all of the Aussie champions retirement at the end of the 2006 Ashes. He took too many laps of honour showing everyone just how important he thought he was. Hopefully the series won&apos;t go into a post-Tennant decline in the same way the Aussie team subsequently have, Matt Smith better not be the Doctor Who equivalent of Phil Hughes! And for the record, Christopher Eccleston was the Doctor who equivalent of Steve Waugh, paving the way for their replacements success and subsequently not recognised sufficiently for their empire building work.&quot; Don&apos;t watch the show myself, Tom, but my wife used to work in TV and pretty much everyone who worked with David Tennant reckoned he was a wonderful, down-to-earth bloke - and certainly not one for self-satisfied back-slapping.  29th over: South Africa 91-3 (Kallis 21, De Villiers 19) The runs are coming perhaps a little quicker than England would like here. Six more off Anderson&apos;s over and Kallis and De Villiers have now put on 40 from 53 deliveries. &quot;VB is possibly the most undrinkable of all the pantheon of beers, hence why they need such an incredible advertising campaign as riffing mustachioed cricketers,&quot; says Poppy McNee. &quot;If I say VB is my favourite tipple will they send me a set of dolls? I will sellout for that, and even drink the stuff.&quot;  30th over: South Africa 93-3 (Kallis 22, De Villiers 20) The battle between Swann and Kallis is shaping up to be an intriguing sub-plot: Kallis is trying to impose his will, but Swann - who has mid off and mid on pushed up - refusing to blink. Two off the over. &quot;As a Sussex fan its good to see Prior avoiding almost every headline,&quot; says Nic Clarke from Brighton. &quot;I think he&apos;s had a good time behind the stumps so far ...&quot; Wouldn&apos;t disagree with that, Nic.  31st over: South Africa 99-3 (Kallis 27, De Villiers 20) Onions replaces Anderson, and starts with a leg-stump loosener that Kallis plunders to the boundary. Onions is generally bowling quite short to Kallis here. I wonder if he&apos;s struggling to get his length or whether it&apos;s a tactic. Drinks. &quot;I believe there&apos;s footage on YouTube of Sunil X and his wife exchanging gifts,&quot; says Mac Millings, before offering this clip.  32nd over: South Africa 101-3 (Kallis 28, De Villiers 22) Swann contimues to mix things up nicely - he&apos;s getting plenty of drift and bowling anywhere from 53mph to 59mph - but he&apos;s unable to stop South Africa bringing up the 100, or the 50 partnership between these two (Kallis 27 off 37 deliveries, De Villiers&apos; 22 off 33).  33rd over: South Africa 102-3 (Kallis 29, De Villiers 22) &quot;Interesting about Prior,&quot; says Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;His glovework seems to have got better, but his batting seems quite indifferent of late. And the original logic of selecting him was that his strong batting made up for his weak keeping, compared to say Read who was a better keeper but a worse bat. As Prior morphes into Read, will he in fact undermine his own raison d&apos;etre and reopen the interminable debate about the role of the modern keeper?&quot; Surely it&apos;s a little early to start worrying about Prior&apos;s batting - he scored 60 in the last Test, still averages 42.12 in Tests and has made just two single-figure scores in his last 12 innings? One off Onions&apos; over.  34th over: South Africa 104-3 (Kallis 30, De Villiers 23) We&apos;ve got used to the sight of Swann skipping down the pitch after taking a wicket early in his spell, but for all his variety and accuracy, the South Africans are playing him well at the moment.  35th over: South Africa 104-3 (Kallis 30, De Villiers 23) An oh-cripes moment for De Villiers as Onions&apos; delivery cuts back and leaps like an annoyed lion at a schoolchild who&apos;s been banging on his cage. De Villiers, however, is quick enough to get some bat on it and deflect the ball to safety. Apart from that delivery, Onions is unusually scattergun - with too many deliveries too far outside off stump. Still, maiden.  36th over: South Africa 107-3 (Kallis 32, De Villiers 24) Swann leaps up before stifling an appeal after beating De Villiers with one that kept straight. Later in the over there&apos;s a longer bellowing appeal - with Prior convinced that De Villiers&apos; had nicked it behind. The umpire isn&apos;t buying it but replays seem to show there was definitely a nick. De Villiers might have been stumped too. Still, England don&apos;t refer and AB survives. &quot;Re: Doctor Who, Tom Van Der Gucht (over 28) has a point, but it was writer/producer Russell T Davies who was the self-indulgent one rather than the lovely David Tennant,&quot; reckons Hugh Barker. &quot;RTD&apos;s ego clearly got the better of him at the end and he went out with a big self-congratulation session. KP as England captain is probably the closer analogy, a complete inability to take criticism and failure of perspective.&quot;  37th over: South Africa 107-3 (Kallis 36, De Villiers 24) Onions screams in frustration after bowling short and wide outside off-stump, allowing Kallis pulls him to the boundary. Onions&apos; response is excellent though: first startling Kallis with one that jumps up at him and then having him playing and missing with a fullish delivery just outside off stump.  38th over: South Africa 117-3 (Kallis 37, De Villiers 29) Another over, another boundary: Swann tries to push one through a little flatter and is chopped away to the boundary. &quot;Please tell Poppy McNee \u2013 unless she is (as she sounds) a kids TV character or some invention forged from the psychotic crucible of your lively mind, Sean \u2013 that she can get at least two of the Boonanza figurines here, says Kieron Shaw.  39th over: South Africa 119-3 (Kallis 37, De Villiers 30) A better over from Onions, just one from it. Saying that, his final delivery was short and wide, Kallis went to cut, but it didn&apos;t bounce as he expected and he nearly edged it behind. England will be frustrated that they haven&apos;t kicked on after taking three early wickets. Still, the pitch is doing just about enough to keep them interested and there was also the De Villiers wicket that never was ...  40th over: South Africa 127-3 (Kallis 39, De Villiers 36) This session isn&apos;t going as planned for Swann: the pitch is offering him less than in the first two Tests and, with the field pushed back, Kallis and De Villiers are finding it easy to take singles. A boundary off the final delivery over from De Villiers takes this partnership to 76 off 119.  41st over: South Africa 127-3 (Kallis 39, De Villiers 36) Good first over from Broad earns a maiden, but England need a wicket here. &quot;Right, assuming England win this series,&quot; begins David O&apos;Hare, a little presumptively, &quot;Where should that leave them in the Test rankings? I&apos;d have them second behind India.&quot; That might be over-optimistic, David - the current rankings are: 1) India, 2) South Africa, 3) Australia, 4) Sri Lanka, 5) England, 6) Pakistan - but what do others think?  WICKET! De Villiers c Strauss b Swann 36 (South Africa 127-4) Swann strikes! The ball didn&apos;t seem to do a great deal, but De Villiers sloppily clipped it to short midwicket and Strauss took a straightforward catch.  WICKET! Duminy c Strauss b Swann 0 (South Africa 127-5) Duminy goes first ball! Swann gets a little drift, followed by a sharp amount of spin and bounce, Duminy gets the faintest of edges, and Swann is on a hat-trick. Incredible scenes!  The hat-trick ball ... England&apos;s fielders swarm around the bat - there are five of them, I think - but Boucher fends it off.  42nd over: South Africa 131-5 (Kallis 40, Boucher 3) Boucher gets off the mark, aggressively pushing Swann for three off his second delivery, but South Africa are in desperate trouble here ...  43rd over: South Africa 131-5 (Kallis 40, Boucher 3) Kallis is risking even less than usual and Broad earns another maiden. Drinks. &quot;Congratulations for your reverse-mockers curse on Swann in over 40,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;Perversity lives!&quot;  44th over: South Africa 131-5 (Kallis 40, Boucher 3) Swann (9-1-29-2) continues to tease and torture, but Boucher blocks him out. Maiden. &quot;Regarding David O&apos;Hare&apos;s question about where England stand in the rankings, I would say that they are surely behind India and Pakistan in the pecking order mainly because of their weak batting,&quot; says Arvind Ramanan. &quot;I do not see how Cook, Strauss, Bell and co would survive Mohammad Asif. Umar Gul was bowling at half-pace and Aamer isn&apos;t even playing. England need two more Trotts. Just take a look at today&apos;s Australia v Pakistan highlights.  45th over: South Africa 136-5 (Kallis 41, Boucher 7) Broad, who has bowled better than his figures of 12-5-34-0 would suggest, strays on leg stump, allowing Boucher to relieve the pressure with a welcome boundary. &quot;Is it right to suggest that, India apart, there are no great Test sides around at the moment,&quot; suggests Luke Richards. &quot;Or am I just getting old?&quot;  46th over: South Africa 141-5 (Kallis 46, Boucher 7) The Kallis v Swann battle continues. It&apos;s fascinating stuff, with Swann varying his line and his pace, but Kallis being more than a match for him. Interestingly, Kallis hasn&apos;t left a single ball from Swann: when he&apos;s not blocking him, he&apos;s tickling and nurdling and working the singles.  47th over: South Africa 143-5 (Kallis 47, Boucher 8) This pitch continues to offer the occasional surprise to the batsman - that over it was Broad&apos;s shortish delivery which spat unexpectly at Kallis&apos;s face. He played it expertly, one hand on bat, but downwards to safety. Two off the over.  48th over: South Africa 147-5 (Kallis 47, Boucher 12) Lots of &apos;Ohhhs!&apos; from the England fielders around the bat, more in hope than expectation, after Boucher padded away Swann&apos;s delivery outside off-stump. Swann straightens up next ball and watches as Boucher lifts him over the top for four.  49th over: South Africa 150-5 (Kallis 48, Boucher 14) Broad, whose new prep-school haircut makes him look a little like Luke Wright (as my colleague Andy Bull pointed out earlier) gets it to reverse swing for the first time today, but his delivery is a little to full and Boucher flicks him away to bring up the 150. &quot;Are my eyes deceiving me, or is this England team really rather good,&quot; asks David Acheson. Steady David, steady. Remember Centurion ...  50th over: South Africa 152-5 (Kallis 49, Boucher 14) Kallis edges ever closer to his 50 with a leg-side flick for a single. &quot;Not sure there are any great teams out there at the moment,&quot; says Paddy Blewer. &quot;I might be entirely wrong, but the great Windies and Aussie sides just had that bit more. Particularly real pace attacks. Perhaps the Pakistan side of Imran, Wasim and Waqar (very brief if ever in Tests) as well. Where are all the real pace bowlers?&quot; I hope it&apos;s partly cyclical, Paddy, but flatter pitches are surely to blame as well ...  51st over: South Africa 153-5 (Kallis 49, Boucher 19) Anderson, who replaces Broad (14-5-39-0), starts with a decent first over back apart from a leg-side delivery that Boucher hits for a boundary. This partnership is now 29 off 58. Meanwhile the fretful emails are starting to trickle in. &quot;Boucher and Kallis is the one partnership that can really kill off the England attack,&quot; warns Mark Hooper, who thinks England need a wicket here. I think England will be very happy with their position here - especially with batting expected to get easier on day two.  52nd over: South Africa 165-5 (Kallis 50, Boucher 31) After Kallis brings up his fifty (106 deliveries, six 4s) with a single off the first ball of Swann&apos;s over, Boucher goes on the attack, cutting one delivery to boundary, hitting the next - a full toss - through long off and, for good measure, adding a third successive four in a similar area. Thirteen off the over.  53rd over: South Africa 171-5 (Kallis 51, Boucher 31) A single and a leg-bye off Anderson&apos;s over. &quot;I would love to see how the Indian batsmen handle the new-and-improved Swann,&quot; says Arvind Ramanan. &quot;It really is a mouth-watering prospect. Though I suspect Sehwag would just step out and whack him out of the ground, with that blank expression on his face.&quot; I&apos;m sure several Australia and South African batsmen thought they&apos;d do the same thing before facing Swann, Arvind ...  54th over: South Africa 173-5 (Kallis 51, Boucher 31) &quot;Come on lads, big 20 minutes here,&quot; screams Matt Prior as Swann (14-1-55-2) steps in to bowl his 14th over in a row. But Swann can&apos;t guile a wicket and this partnership is now now 46 off 76 balls. We have eight minutes left before tea.  55th over: South Africa 177-5 (Kallis 53, Boucher 34) &quot;Fresh afternoon, another Swann virtuoso performance, OBO on top form and Leeds one up against Utd. What more could you ask for?&quot; asks Guy Hornsby, before answering his own question. &quot;Kallis out, actually. I&apos;m on the way to Upton Park to see Arsenal&apos;s kids lose (as if) so I&apos;m hoping we can tear through the middle order in time for four and the perfect sporting day will be complete.&quot; England&apos;s day was nearly made even better there - Anderson got one to reverse back sharply, it beat Boucher for pace, but it clipped his pad just outsiude the line. Boucher plays and misses at Anderson&apos;s next delivery before bringing up the fifty partnership (Boucher 33 off 47, Kallis 15 off 33 balls) with a single.  56th over: South Africa 180-5 (Kallis 54, Boucher 35) Kevin Pietersen replaces Graeme Swann, to loud boos from the crowd. &quot;You&apos;re the people&apos;s champion,&quot; a laughing Matt Prior tells him. Three off an utterly unthreatening over.  57th over: South Africa 183-5 (Kallis 55, Boucher 37) James Anderson is getting the ball to perform all sorts of jiggery-pokery at the moment and Boucher is struggling to pick him: he plays and misses at a springy outswinger before only just spotting a slower inswinger. He survives the over, but this has been England&apos;s session (38 overs, 132 runs, three wickets). Thanks for all your emails and be sure to join my colleague Andy Bull in 20 minutes. Cheers, Sean.  TEA  Afternoon everyone. What an absorbing day it&apos;s been so far. I was talking to an old friend during that session, and he was asking me if I knew which player Mike Atherton was talking about when he wrote this in his last column: &quot;My abiding memory of Swann&apos;s first tour (I was still a player then) was the toilets of the team hotel in Johannesburg, from where Swann emerged towards the end of the tour with a cut lip that had been administered by one of his colleagues (not this one).&quot; What a tantalising little tibit that is from Athers. Sadly he hasn&apos;t let on who the culprit was, leaving us all to take our pick from the players in the squad at the time...  So, in true Cluedo style, we know that the victim was Swann, the loocation was the toilet in a Jo&apos;burg hotel and the weapon was a fist, the question is: who was the aggressor? A quick look at the old Cricinfo page for the tour reveals this list of suspects: Nasser Hussain, Chris Adams, Mike Atherton, Mark Butcher, Andy Caddick, Andrew Flintoff, Darren Gough, Gavin Hamilton, Dean Headley, Darren Maddy, Alan Mullally, Chris Read, Alec Stewart, Graeme Swann, Alex Tudor, Phil Tufnell, Michael Vaughan.  So who is your money on readers?  58th over: South Africa 192-5 (Kallis 59, Boucher 42) I think we can rule out Atherton, unless he was making an elaborate double bluff to throw us off the scent. Mark Butcher and Alan Mullaly, a pair of song-writing, guitar-strumming laid-back layabouts surely couldn&apos;t be responsible for such an aggressive act, so they&apos;re out of contention. Swann presumably didn&apos;t thump himself in the face. Chris Read always seemed much too meek to do anything so self-assertive, and Gavin Hamilton probably had more important things to worry about, like his disastrous lack of form and fortune. So that leaves: Nasser Hussain, Chris Adams, Andy Caddick, Andrew Flintoff, Darren Gough, Dean Headley, Darren Maddy, Alec Stewart, Graeme Swann, Michael Vaughan. Of those I&apos;d doubt very much whether Vaughan would be guilty - the man would never lose his cool like that. Back on the pitch, Onions has opened the attack after Tea. He gives up four to Boucher off an ugly-looking outside edge, and four more to Kallis off an altogether more authentic-looking pull through mid-wicket.  59th over: South Africa 194-5 (Kallis 60, Boucher 43) Swann comes on at the other end. Paul Frame is fingering Andy Caddick: &quot;Didn&apos;t Andy Caddick once threaten to see a spectator behind the pavilion on his first senior England tour to New Zealand?&quot; he recollects, &quot;The spectator in question was having a go at Caddick due to his Kiwi origins from ball one of the Test and Caddick decided to front up to this spectator, who then issued an apology.&quot;  60th over: South Africa 199-5 (Kallis 63, Boucher 45) OBO has its very own Deepthroat: &quot;It was...&quot; an anonymous but well-placed source writes, &quot;a senior bowler, but I&apos;ll say no more in public. Meet me in the carpark later.&quot;  61st over: South Africa 200-5 (Kallis 64, Boucher 45) Kallis taps a single out to leg to raise South Africa&apos;s 200. &quot;Rule out Alec Stewart too;&quot; suggests Alex Harris, &quot;he&apos;s far too much of a gentleman to do that sort of thing.&quot; Well, in the light of our tip-off in the last over, we&apos;re down to no more than three suspects: Caddic, Gough, and, at a push, Dean Headley. Unless we&apos;re being fed a red herring to throw us off the scent.  62nd over: South Africa 206-5 (Kallis 70, Boucher 45) Here&apos;s Kat Petersen: &quot;The poll from our car on Swann&apos;s cut lip is one vote for Darren Gough, one for Phil Tufnell and one for Swann punching himself in the face. We&apos;ve been playing a 1986 edition of Des Lynam&apos;s Sport Trivia all weekend, so we&apos;re hoping for a decisive answer...&quot; Ohh. Kallis almost gets himself out hooking here. Onions dropped short, and Kallis made a right mess of the shot, squirting it up and over the &apos;keeper. Strauss, running back from first slip, can&apos;t get there either. His next shot is a suitable riposte though, as he cracks four behind point with a firm cut shot.  63rd over: South Africa 211-5 (Kallis 72, Boucher 48) &quot;Don&apos;t quote me on this,&quot; requests another anonymous tipster, &quot;but I do believe Darren Gough called Our Hero &apos;a ducking fickhead&apos; and thought he was too much like Phil Tufnell, which makes him a serious suspect.&quot;  64th over: South Africa 213-5 (Kallis 73, Boucher 49) The circumstantial evidence seems to be mounting: &quot;Gough once pretend headbutted a batsman during a game,&quot; recollects Ian Copestake, &quot;so perhaps he was practising and followed through.&quot;  65th over: South Africa 213-5 (Kallis 73, Boucher 49) &quot;I wouldn&apos;t rule out Chris Adams,&quot; suggests Phil Rebbeck, &quot;I reckon that Swann&apos;s antics would get right up his nose. I reckon Grizzly could be your man.&quot; Lashing out in thinly-veiled frustration at his failing Test career, you think? Stuart Broad is back into the attack now. Kallis takes a leg bye to short fine leg, but umpire Hill decides to strip him of it, thinking that he didn&apos;t make a genuine effort to play at the ball.  66th over: South Africa 216-5 (Kallis 73, Boucher 51) Boucher raises his fifty, from just 79 deliveries. This has been a fine stand of 86, the two old hands hauling their team out of trouble once again. Time to put you all out of your misery: the perpetrator of Swann&apos;s fat lip was indeed The Dazzler Darren Gough. Michael Vaughan, I&apos;m told, let the cat out of the bag when he told the story on TMS earlier in the tour.  REFERRAL! Boucher 51 LBW Broad Broad rips his second ball back from outside off into Boucher&apos;s back pad, beating an attempted on drive. It looks out to me, and up goes umpire Hill&apos;s finger. Boucher calls for a review. Much good it does him. The ball was going on to hit, no doubt about it and the decision is upheld, so that&apos;s... WICKET! Boucher 51 LBW Broad (67th over: South Africa 216-6) That came just in the nick of time for England. The innings was beginning to slip away from them, drifting towards the new ball. Steyn is in.  68th: South Africa 225-6 (Kallis 76, Steyn 6) So Steyn has been pushed up the order above Morne Morkel on the grounds, I guess, of his knock of 47 in the first at Durban. Our Deepthroat source is back, confirming that &quot;Deep throat won&apos;t name miscreant but his name rhymes with cough.&quot; Aha. &quot;It was an argument over someone who may or may not have been involved in an onboard catering capacity with Virgin airlines. Allegedly.&quot; So now you know readers. Steyn slices an edge away for four and then takes a sharp single to put Kallis on strike. He guides three through the slips from the final ball.  69th: South Africa 233-6 (Kallis 84, Steyn 6) &quot;Perhaps you&apos;re all missing the point,&quot; muses  Hercule Poirot  Mac Millings: &quot;Swann was emerging from the hotel toilets. So the question is, who did Swann think he was matey enough with to go on a joint trip to the lavvy? Someone devious enough to fake-befriend (frenemise?) someone just so he could get close enough to punch him in the face. My vote&apos;s for Flintoff. Are we sure, when he put his arm round Brett Lee, that he wasn&apos;t punching him in the face with his other fist?&quot; Kallis strikes successive fours off Broad, the first thrashed through point, and the second pulled through mid-wicket.  70th: South Africa 233-6 (Kallis 85, Steyn 6) This magnificent innings from Kallis continues with a single to the off side. This man is doing the most convincing impression of Atlas I&apos;ve seen on a cricket field since Shiv Chanderpaul was in his pomp. Steyn almost plays into his own stumps, but is saved by his boot, which takes the brunt of a deflection off his inside edge.  71st: South Africa 237-6 (Kallis 87, Steyn 6) Drinks!  72nd: South Africa 239-6 (Kallis 87, Steyn 7) Swann comes on for a final fiddle before the new ball. Steyn takes a single through square leg.  73rd: South Africa 242-6 (Kallis 89, Steyn 8) &quot;Kallis must have a bit of a quandary on his hands at the minute: which does he play for the ton or his average?&quot; Aahhh, give me a break Max Banjo, Kallis-baiting went out of style along with Starbucks some time back in the mid to late 2000s. He and Steyn swap singles.  74th: South Africa 244-6 (Kallis 90, Steyn 9) The lights have come on, and there seems to be a little drizzle in the air as the evening closes in in Cape Town. &quot;I predict SA making 315, despite the new ball,&quot; says Poppy McNee. England would settle for that I feel, given that the weather is due to improve in the next two days making conditions easier for batting, and also remembering what happened in the last match after South Africa made 340-odd. On top of which, the average first innings score here in the last twenty years is, I believe, 328.  75th: South Africa 246-6 (Kallis 91, Steyn 11) Kevin Pietersen comes on to provide a little bit of filler until the new ball comes around. The crowd jeer loudly, causing Matt Prior to bellow back at KP &quot;Come on the people&apos;s champion! Come on the people&apos;s choice!&quot;  76th: South Africa 249-6 (Kallis 94, Steyn 12) Swajnn hustles through another over, South Africa taking three runs from it.  77th: South Africa 254-6 (Kallis 95, Steyn 16) Pietersen drags a delivery down short, and Steyn wallops four through mid-wicket.  78th: South Africa 255-6 (Kallis 96, Steyn 16) Swann is coing around the wicket now. Steyn has responded well to being moved up the order. He&apos;s playing sensibly, not taking any risks.  79th: South Africa 262-6 (Kallis 101, Steyn 17) Pietersen floats up a rank full toss which Kallis smears through cover for four. That brings up his 33rd Test, and 50th first class, century. It&apos;s taken him 173 deliveries, and while it hasn&apos;t been thrilling to watch, has still been stately in style. Pietersen completes the over from around the wicket.  80th: South Africa 266-6 (Kallis 104, Steyn 18) The last over before the new ball. These two have milked the spinners with real ease. Here Kallis steers two more away fine to third man, and then pushes another single down the ground.  81st: South Africa 272-6 (Kallis 105, Steyn 23) Right then. That was a soporfic little spell there, but England have ten more overs with a new ball to sharpen the atmosphere up a touch. The partnership is worth fifty, and Jimmy Anderson is back into the attack. His first ball swings away from Steyn&apos;s outside edge, though the ball was short and wide, which is enough to tempt Strauss into bringing Jon Trott into third slip. Anderson&apos;s next delivery is a good one, also swinging away. The next squirts away off Steyn&apos;s edge for an irritating four through long leg. And that is dropped! by Trott at slip. It was a very tough chance, wide away to his right. He leapt across one-handed, and hot his fingertips to it but could not cling on.  82nd: South Africa 275-6 (Kallis 107, Steyn 23) And at the other end it&apos;s Onions. He takes a long, measured run to the crease, back ridgidly upright, and hurtles down a full ball at Kallis&apos; tip-toes. He blocks away a single. Steyn is starting to back away to leg now as he tries to deal with this newer, harder ball. I&apos;d be surprised if he sees the day out.  83rd: South Africa 279-6 (Kallis 108, Steyn 26) These two have put on a rather tiresome 60 together now. Steyn eases three runs out towards mid-wicket and at the end of the over the umpires meet for a little talk about the quality of the light.  84th: South Africa 279-6 (Kallis 108, Steyn 26) Onions bangs down a bouncer, which has Strauss shaking his head in irritation because all it&apos;s done is force the umpires to meet again and this time they offer the light to the batsman. They nod their heads toward the boundary and that&apos;s it, everyone is trooping off. England have a little grumble at the umpires, but to no avail. Given that there are only 6.4 overs left in the day that, I suspect, is that.  Well, an interesting day&apos;s play comes to an early end. I&apos;ll hang around long enough to confirm that the game is up for the day. The scheduled close is at 4pm, so if there is any play the light will have to get better pretty sharpish.  Those two wickets from Graeme Swann were really the crucial point of the day&apos;s play. A good thing for him, because until then it looked as though his dropped catch off the seventh ball would be the defining moment. Without that two-wicket burst, South Africa would be on top. As it is, I suspect England will be ever so slightly the happier of the two teams, if only because the weather is due to improve tomorrow so they have probably enjoyed the best bolwing conditions of the match. And, of course, they&apos;ve used them to get rid of all but one member of the top six.  Yup, that&apos;s all folks. We&apos;re done for the day. I&apos;ll see you back here tomorrow. Thanks for your emails and company, and cheerio for now."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jan/03/peter-diggory-obituary", "sentences": ["British abortion reform had a domino effect in India, Singapore, Zambia, Australia and the US, giving Diggory&apos;s leadership in contraception and safe abortion an international impact."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-03T18:28:01Z", "title": "Peter Diggory obituary", "tags": ["Abortion", "NHS"], "article": "Peter Diggory, who has died aged 85, was a talented and concerned obstetrician/gynaecologist who served generations of women at the Kingston hospital, Surrey, and the Royal Marsden hospital in London. In his quest for modern family planning and safe abortion he also helped establish policies and practices that helped millions of women around the world who would never know his name, but for whom he had helped open a door on the fundamental right to decide whether, and when, to have a child. Diggory was born in Titley, Herefordshire, the son of a stationmaster and the youngest of five children. He won a scholarship to Worcester Royal grammar school and earned his first graduate degree, in mathematics, from University College London. After graduating he was drafted to join a team of young researchers developing radar. At the end of the second world war he returned to UCL for a second degree, in medicine. Diggory was elected president of the British Medical Student Association, played chess for the university, and began his postgraduate training, first becoming a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and then of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In the 1960s, criminal abortion cases were not routinely admitted to the Queen Charlotte&apos;s hospital, where Diggory trained, and doctors were not examined on contraception or abortion. When he was appointed the NHS consultant gynaecologist at Kingston hospital in 1961 he found himself ill-prepared to care for the 400 women admitted annually because of complications resulting from illegal abortions. Under a law dating from 1861, even the intention to perform an abortion was a felony, and so this huge area of reproductive health was simply ignored. From 1938 the legal precedent set by the Bourne case enabled doctors to terminate the unintended pregnancies of women whose mental health could be shown to be at risk; in practice this applied only to those who could afford to pay a psychiatrist as well as a gynaecologist, and abortion remained outside mainstream medicine. Diggory had a Harley Street practice beside his NHS work and he alone had the integrity to publish his clinical findings. In a landmark paper on 1,000 cases, published in the Lancet, he showed that abortion could be clinically and emotionally safe. While the president and the majority of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists fellows opposed reforming the 1861 law, Peter had the courage to join the Abortion Law Reform Association. I still remember his stunning speech at the 1966 Family Planning Association Conference on Abortion in Britain. It was the first time an experienced gynaecologist had talked openly about abortion. He compared the rich women getting safe private operations with the poor women admitted to an NHS hospital whose neighbours had injected soap, whisky or even toothpaste into the uterus. A few months later, the young Liberal MP David (now Lord) Steel introduced a private member&apos;s bill to reform the 1861 law. Diggory co-piloted this revolutionary step, attending every committee discussion for the next 17 months. His clinical experience had taught him that most abortions are for social reasons, and he worked closely with Steel to ensure social indications for abortions were included in the new law. British abortion reform had a domino effect in India, Singapore, Zambia, Australia and the US, giving Diggory&apos;s leadership in contraception and safe abortion an international impact. He attended international meetings and published widely, including co-authoring two books, Abortion (1977) and Textbook of Contraceptive Practice (1983). Diggory&apos;s life was characterised by an unalloyed kindness and generosity. He married Patricia McConnell in 1952. They shared an interest in the theatre, especially the fringe, and were trustees of the children&apos;s theatre company Quicksilver. In addition to their two children, Paul and Jane, Peter and Patricia had an extended family of close younger friends. Even vagrants knew that the Diggorys&apos; house in Campden Hill Square, west London, would supply food and help. The same gentle warmth that drove Diggory to champion safe abortion also made him support the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. Poignantly, his last years were burdened with diabetes and vascular dementia \u2013 but even when he could not remember what he had had for breakfast, he could still play an excellent game of chess. Patricia died in 2002. Peter is survived by Paul and Jane. \u2022 Peter Lionel Carr Diggory, obstetrician and gynaecologist, born 6 January 1924; died 22 November 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/04/flavio-briatore-formula-one-ban-appeal", "sentences": ["Briatore, the former principal of the Renault Formula One team, was banned for his involvement in the race-fixing scandal that saw Nelson Piquet Jr deliberately crash during the 2008 Singapore grand prix in order to help his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, win the race."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-04T15:15:56Z", "title": "Flavio Briatore crosses fingers for verdict in F1 life ban appeal", "tags": ["Flavio Briatore", "Formula One", "Renault", "Ferrari", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "The outcome of Flavio Briatore&apos;s appeal against his lifetime ban from motor racing will be announced in Paris tomorrow. Briatore, the former principal of the Renault Formula One team, was banned for his involvement in the race-fixing scandal that saw Nelson Piquet Jr deliberately crash during the 2008 Singapore grand prix in order to help his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, win the race. Briatore and Pat Symonds, Renault&apos;s director of engineering, left the team prior to a hearing by the FIA on 21 September 2009. The sport&apos;s governing body barred Briatore from all of its championships and imposed a five-year ban on Symonds, who has also appealed. Piquet was granted immunity in return for his evidence. Renault received a suspended two-year ban. Ferrari&apos;s team principal, Stefano Domenicali, has said that neither Piquet nor Briatore should be allowed back. &quot;F1 should not reduce itself to a world of nostalgia,&quot; he told La Stampa. &quot;It&apos;s not right that Piquet should be allowed to return after what he did, and Briatore will not [be welcomed back] in the same capacity; people don&apos;t like reheated soup \u2013 he will have to find another opportunity.&quot; Briatore described the FIA decision as a &quot;legal absurdity&quot; and filed his action with the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris in late November. He later clashed with Max Mosley when he claimed that the former president of the FIA had been &quot;blinded by an excessive desire for personal revenge&quot;. The leaking of private documents concerning the trial and published by the Guardian infuriated Mosley, who vigorously denied Briatore&apos;s allegation. &quot;Briatore should be the last person to complain that the FIA has not treated him fairly,&quot; said Mosley. &quot;The FIA has repeatedly given him the benefit of the doubt. &quot;Once the FIA had a sworn statement from Nelson Piquet Jr confirming that he was ordered to crash, a full professional inquiry conducted by outside lawyers was inevitable. That inquiry, like Renault&apos;s own investigation, established Briatore&apos;s responsibility beyond question. The suggestion that all this was somehow manufactured for reasons of personal vengeance is a desperate and unsustainable argument.&quot; Robert Kubica, meanwhile, is set to remain with Renault, according to the Polish driver&apos;s manager. Kubica joined the team in October but Renault&apos;s decision to sell a significant stake to the Luxembourg investment group Genii Capital raised doubts about his future. &quot;We are going in the right direction,&quot; Daniel Morelli said. &quot;There were no doubts, really, but it was very important we understood who were in the key roles in the team and of course also the budget \u2013 it is fundamental you have that for the updates to the car.&quot; Kubica raced for BMW-Sauber last season and signed for Renault after BMW decided to withdraw from the sport, but it is likely he had an escape clause in his contract which covered a change of team ownership."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jan/04/airport-body-scanners", "sentences": ["&quot;But we&apos;re hoping for more direction from the Department for Transport soon.&quot; Rapiscan is a subsidiary of a much bigger, California-based company, OSI Systems, with branches in Finland, India, Malaysia, Singapore and the UK."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-04T17:31:37Z", "title": "Body scanners: threat to children's rights | Christina Zaba", "tags": ["UK security and counter-terrorism", "Transport policy", "Transport", "Gordon Brown", "Politics", "Privacy", "Children", "Data and computer security", "Data protection", "Air transport"], "article": "The prime minister would have us believe that body scanners in airports are the latest catch-all for catching potential terrorists. Perhaps he wasn&apos;t looking when Manchester Airport launched the trial of the new Rapsican Secure 1000 Single Pose x-ray on October 13 2009. Within a few hours of the announcement that the next generation of &quot;convenient, hassle-free travel&quot; was about to hit the security lanes, child protection campaigners were informing Manchester Airport management that any creation of an indecent picture of a child \u2013 &quot;indecent&quot; meaning showing the genitalia, and &quot;child&quot; meaning someone under 18 \u2013 is a criminal offence. Director of Action on Rights for Children Terri Dowty noted that the Protection of Children Act 1978, as amended by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, makes it an offence &quot;to take, permit to be taken, or to make any indecent ... pseudo-photograph of a child&quot;. That includes &quot;an image, whether made by computer graphics or otherwise, which appears to be a photograph.&quot; Consternation ensued. The airport&apos;s PR department backpedalled furiously, with their spokesperson Sarah Barrett saying live on BBC Radio: &quot;Imaging technology does not allow security staff to see passengers naked ... these images cannot be linked back to an individual. Children will be asked to take part in the trial, but only with their parents&apos; consent.&quot; But in law, a parent cannot give consent to the making of an indecent image of their own or any other child. Union officials representing 6,000 of the 20,000 workers at Manchester said no one had even told them that the scanner was being trialled, let alone that using it could leave working people, as well as as the airport itself, potentially facing serious charges and criminal prosecution. The managing director of Manchester Airport, Andrew Cornish, promised to respond fully to the points raised. Today, Unite&apos;s national officer for civil aviation, Steve Turner, told me that as far as they knew, the Manchester trials were still suspended pending advice on the legality of the scanner machines. However, a spokesperson for Manchester Airport confirmed that the trials have in fact been resumed, with some 500 passengers already scanned. &quot;Under-18s can&apos;t go through at the moment \u2013 there&apos;s a grey area in the legal system,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;But we&apos;re hoping for more direction from the Department for Transport soon.&quot; Rapiscan is a subsidiary of a much bigger, California-based company, OSI Systems, with branches in Finland, India, Malaysia, Singapore and the UK. British MEP Philip Bradbourn is among those arguing at the European Union level that use of devices such as Rapiscan&apos;s would be &quot;disproportionate&quot; to the security threat faced. The MEP also believed, his spokesman later told me, that these whole-body scanners offered &quot;very little increased benefit for security&quot;. Other members of the European Parliament agreed: in the face of an EU Commission proposal to establish a regulatory framework for the use of full-body scanners at EU airports, the parliament passed a resolution criticising the devices in the autumn of 2008. This, and strong opposition from some member states, forced the Commission to back away from such plans, though a spokesman has made clear in recent days that the Commission continues to see such scanners as a &quot;useful additional tool&quot; in impeding terrorists. [See footnote.] In a world of increasing electronic surveillance \u2013 where computer images can be stored, hacked, replicated and passed around the world instantly, and where airport scans link to other ID details about passengers, from passports equipped with RFID chips with the capability to contain enormous amounts of electronically readable personal information \u2013 the privacy and data-sharing implications of body scanners are huge for all passengers, let alone children. Can there ever be any guarantee that images of children would indeed be safe, and instantly destroyed? ARCH&apos;s legal adviser, barrister Ian Dowty, has no doubt: it doesn&apos;t matter whether the image is kept or not \u2013 it&apos;s the making of the image itself that is the offence. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 and 6 January 2010. The original quoted an MEP appearing to say that the EU Commission had withdrawn a proposal to use the Rapiscan whole-body scanner at a European level over a year ago after finding the scanner offered &quot;very little increased benefit for security&quot;. This view on security was, rather, that of the MEP being quoted, Philip Bradbourn. The EU Commission has issued no finding on a specific company&apos;s scanner. The story text has been corrected accordingly. The original article also named the MEP as Andrew Bradburn.

Speculation&apos;s run rife over the past couple of months about a new handset from Google - just the latest in what seems like a never-ending about the company&apos;s plans to become a significant force in mobile. Why does an internet company want a piece of your mobile phone? Is it just hi-tech hubris? As I told Guardian Daily podcast, Google craves data - and trying to make its Android mobile system ubiquitous is an attempt to place itself at the centre of the world&apos;s information. Phones are increasingly the way that most of the planet interacts with computers, and Google wants to be there so that it can sell stuff to us along the way. There&apos;s not a great deal we don&apos;t know about the Nexus One, at least in terms of hardware - particularly given that the blog Engadget got a review unit and posted detailed videos and a writeup. But there are still some unknowns: when will it go on sale? How much will it cost? Are there any other services included? Will Google be partnering with British phone networks? Will it only go on sale through Google itself? A lot of people have wondered why it&apos;s creating so much interest - after all, there have been plenty of &quot;Google phones&quot; before, and the company has worked very closely with networks and manufacturers in the past. So is it a big deal? Well, in terms of the phone itself probably not. The handset is good, but just another iteration of the Android system. But this is Google, and the important thing is their long-term strategy. Yes, the company had previously worked on other handsets - but it always took a back seat, publicly, and let its partners do the visible work. This time Google&apos;s taking the reins - and if you want any bigger signal that the company intends to be the boss this time around, then just remember that the press conference is being held at its headquarters.  So. Does Google have any surprises up its sleeve? We&apos;ll find out shortly: the announcement starts around 10am Pacific time - that&apos;s 6pm in the UK - and is expected to last about an hour and a half. Internet connection willing, I&apos;ll be bringing you the details as they&apos;re announced.  5.34pm: We&apos;re now inside Google HQ, but the small gaggle of press that&apos;s turned up for the event - a mix of camera crews, reporters and gadget bloggers - are being held outside the press conference room. Five minutes until we can get in apparently.  5.35pm: I&apos;m told that whatever is announced today will be available in the UK soon.  5.40pm: And we&apos;re in. A fairly intimate gathering of media in a small room - plenty of cameras lined up to take a look at whatever emerges on the little stage. Still no word on the announcement itself, which is due to begin in about 20 minutes.  5.44pm: Sometimes at these events you try to divine what&apos;s going on by the music that they&apos;re playing. You know, a bit of Paint it Black by the Stones might indicate (shock) that whatever&apos;s being announced is BLACK. Smart, eh? It&apos;s like reading tea leaves, and just as accurate.  Today&apos;s soundtrack? We&apos;ve had a mix of Official Chart Hits - a bit of Cascada&apos;s dirgeful Evacuate The Dancefloor. Then something that sounded suspiciously like emo scenesters Fall Out Boy, and now Katy Perry&apos;s Waking Up In Vegas. A nod to Sin City&apos;s Consumer Electronics Show, where I&apos;m heading this afternoon? Suggestions for how to read the runes on these tunes in the comments, please!  5.48pm: Scanning around the room, I can see Vic Gundotra, Google&apos;s vice president of engineering. He&apos;s masterminding the company&apos;s entry into mobile, as well as becoming the face of Google at an increasing number of events. The twist? He was poached from Microsoft a few years back - something that the big boys in Seattle are probably regretting these days, but also a sign of how the balance of power in the technology industry is shifting. Commenter Bauhaus suggests waiting for the Nexus Six. Nice.  5.53pm: For anyone who didn&apos;t get the Nexus Six joke, give yourselves a slap on the wrist and go and watch Bladerunner. Immediately. Well, as soon as I&apos;m finished this.  6.00pm: Now we&apos;re listening to the Killers. Because it&apos;s an iPhone killer, see? OK, I&apos;ll stop there. I hate the phrase &quot;killer&quot; anyway.  6.01pm: OK, it&apos;s officially past 10am here on the Pacific coast, and gone 6pm in London. A dribble of people are still coming in through the secret Google entrance, but hopefully things will kick off shortly. The media&apos;s been accused of hyping this event, but if you want excessive then take a look at this comment by G00GL3L0V3R: &quot;The Nexus One will change the way we think about Smartphones. I applaud Google, as I always have. Kudos.&quot; Erm... is that you, Eric Schmidt?  6.05pm: And the music fades out, the lights turn up and...  6.07pm: Apparently, we&apos;re about to hear &quot;a series of short presentations&quot;. Mario Queiroz, a vice president of product management based in Britain, who has apparently been one of the forces pushing this project through. &quot;Today we&apos;ll unveil the next stage in the evolution of Android,&quot; he says. &quot;But before that I want to take a quick step back.&quot; He&apos;s giving us a history lesson on Google&apos;s intentions towards mobile phones - the Open Handset Alliance and so on.  6.11pm:  Queiroz continues by saying how quickly Google&apos;s mobile ambitions are growing. From a single device - the G1 last year, Android now boasts more than 20 devices n 58 carriers in 48 countries and 19 languages.  6.13pm: The blurb continues, but I&apos;m not going to worry you with the details - it&apos;s really just Google saying &quot;this is still an open platform... even though we&apos;re in charge of it&quot;. Commenter HobMcD says there looks to be one major thing missing from the Nexus One, as we know it so far: &quot;Wake me up when Google add Multitouch to the Nexus. Call me crazy, but I don&apos;t want a 3rd-party phone, and I don&apos;t want a interface that changes drastically phone by phone... which I why I stick to my homogenised iPhone...&quot; It&apos;s certainly a big downside. Anyone else?  6.17pm: &quot;What if we worked even more closely with our partners to bring devices to market which are going to help us showcase, very quickly, the great software technology we&apos;re working on here at Google. We&apos;ve done just that, and today we&apos;re announcing the Nexus One.&quot; Tada! It&apos;s &quot;where web meets phone&quot;, apparently. And they&apos;re trying to coin a new term - forget phones, forget smartphones, this - they say - is a superphone.  6.20pm: Peter Chou, the chief executive of HTC - which built the phone - has taken the stage to talk about how it was made. &quot;We were actually very happy working with Google,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s one of the best designed phones... it&apos;s very thin, it feels very good in your hand and has a beautiful, gorgeous 3.7 inch OLED display.&quot; As we already knew, it&apos;s powered by a Snapdragon processor and runs Android 2.1 software.  6.21pm: After posing for a few pictures, Chou steps down from the stage. Queiroz returns to introduce some demos of the handset. Is this all we&apos;re going to see? On Twitter, enthuso-blogger Robert Scoble (who is here today) suggested that Google may launch more than one device. I think they definitely need a surprise, given that the scoop on the Nexus One really came when they gave Engadget a review unit.  6.25pm: Somebody bring me coffee! It&apos;s nice enough to go through the specs (for example, it glows different colours depending on what&apos;s happening - blue for Bluetooth and so on) and hear how very thin and light it is. But there&apos;s a certain flatness to announcing something that everybody already knew. Thins you may appreciate, however: it&apos;s got active noise cancellation, a 5 megapixel camera with flash, and weighs just 137g - &quot;less than a Swiss army knife&quot;.  6.31pm: &quot;With the hardware, we think we have half the story - but it&apos;s not about hardware alone,&quot; says the guy who is doing the demo. &quot;It&apos;s the combination that makes the package so amazing.&quot; &quot;Nexus One is running on Android 2.1. Applications like Google Maps navigation, Facebook integration... but we&apos;ve also included some new innovations.&quot; He runs through a number of interface adjustments that have been brought in for this handset; scroll sideways between different widgets and screens of information.  6.34pm: Seems like the idea of a &quot;superphone&quot; has got a few people sniggering. Analyst Michael Gartenberg wonders Do super phones need secret identities? , while MacWorld editor Jason Snell can&apos;t help but see the irony that superphones might need to change costumes in phone booths.  6.37pm: Now things are getting a little more snazzy. The Nexus One will sport a few different 3D viewing, . These things don&apos;t make a great deal of difference - the 3D helps you navigate a little, but doesn&apos;t significantly alter the overall concept. The company has worked with CoolIris to build some new viewing modes - they look nice. More interestingly, though, they&apos;ve included some really good search options that will let you zip to the right picture by looking for date. That could be handy.  6.39pm: Now, perhaps, one of the more interesting areas of development: voice. &quot;Voice is such an integral part of a phone,&quot; he suggests. It&apos;s amusing that smartphones (sorry superphones have ignored improvements in this area. Under Android 2.0, we hear, you can do the following: tell the phone something like &quot;Ikea&quot;, and it understands what you say, does a Google search on the term and matches it against your GPS location to give you turn-by-turn driving directions to that location. Just two taps and you have the directions spoken back.  Now, however, Nexus One will now have full voice enabling for every text field: so that you can write text messages, emails and other simply by speaking.  The demo sentence comes out perfectly, in just a couple of seconds: &quot;Check out this new voice keyboard! I just hope this demo works.&quot; Fast, and accurate - at least under these conditions.  6.43pm: Now they&apos;re giving a sneak preview of the forthcoming Google Earth application for Android. Simply speak a location to it (their example is &quot;Mount Fuji&quot;) and the app will fly you, virtually, to your destination and display it back in 3D graphics. That gets a round of applause from the Googlers, though frankly it seems like window dressing.  6.47pm: &quot;We&apos;re also pleased to announce a new, through a google-hosted web store. The objective of Google&apos;s new consumer channel is to provide an efficient way to link consumers with Android devices. A simple purchasing process, a simple offering of plans from operators, a simple worry-free delivery and startup of your device.&quot; &quot;Through the web store you can choose to buy a phone without service, or with service from one of Google&apos;s operator partners. At launch, from www.google.com/phone, you can purchase a Nexus One with service from T-Mobile USA. We expect to add more devices and more countries to the programme.&quot;  6.48pm: This is an interesting move, and while not entirely unexpected, we hadn&apos;t expected Google to sell phones in partnership with phone networks. For British users, Queiroz says Vodafone are joining the programme in the near future.  6.49pm: The Google phone store, doesn&apos;t look particularly shiny. It&apos;s a website, largely text, where you select the handset and the deal that you want. The prices for the Nexus One in America are pretty much what was expected: $529 if you buy an unlocked phone, or $179 if you get a contract. This coming spring, we will be bringing the Nexus One to market together with Verizon Wireless [in the USA].&quot; &quot;Vodafone in Europe will also be added to our site, starting again in Spring 2010. We&apos;re working as hard as we can to make sure that the store is ready for business, but also to make sure we offer the different flavours of the phone with these different operators later this spring.&quot;  6.53pm: Here&apos;s a fun little extra: if you buy the Nexus One through the web store, you can get two lines of laser engraving on the back of the phone - across the little metal bevel that sits about two thirds of the way down.  And if you can&apos;t wait for Vodafone to launch the phone in Britain, you can buy the unlocked version through the US store and get it shipped to the UK, Singapore or Hong Kong. &quot;In the future there will be more operators, there will be more devices, there will be more countries.&quot;   6.56pm: They&apos;re preparing for Q&amp;A from the floor. If you have any questions, please leave them in the comments - or tweet them to @bobbiejohnson  6.57pm: For a company that has always been proud of how it grew through non-traditional means, Google&apos;s been doing a lot of very traditional things recently: billboard advertising, TV advertising, sales and so on. Questions coming.  7.02pm: Why only 512MB for app storage?Andy Rubin: It helps protect applications against piracy. In the future we&apos;ll increase the storage space. If you order today, does it ship today?Yes. Can you put any SIM card in it?Queiroz: In the US, you have to use a 3G SIM. There are different 3G frequencies in the US, but in Europe the same frequency is more common. Are you telling iPhone users that this is an alternative? Is it an iPhone killer?Rubin: Choice for consumers is a great thing, but this isn&apos;t for iPhone users - it&apos;s for consumers.Chou: It&apos;s a great phone.  7.05pm: Why was it necessary for Google to design the phone? Couldn&apos;t it have just been designed by HTC?RUBIN: It&apos;s inaccurate to say Google designed the phone. We&apos;re just merchandising it online, similar to any retailer. Working closely with Peter, we were able to help them get the new software first. Will these new features soon be coming to the Droid (or other Android handsets)RUBIN: Everyone will get that software within a couple of days. What will convince users to buy a phone that costs $530?QUEIROZ: They have choice. This is day one, hour one, of operation. We&apos;ve been very careful and very thorough.  7.09pm: Google is known for many things. Retailing is not one of them. How are you guys going to make that work?QUEIROZ: It&apos;s not about retailing. It&apos;s about working closely with our partners to bring out a great phone. Please clarify what the revenue opportunities are for Google. Do you get a piece of each phone sold on the website?RUBIN: Our primary business is advertising. The superphone category is a great way to access the internet, and along with that comes our normal business model of advertising on the internet. There is an opportunity to make margin on unit sales, but that&apos;s not what we&apos;re doing here.  7.16pm: Went a little quiet because I was queueing to ask a couple of questions: This is apparently your best phone - and it doesn&apos;t have a physical keyboard. Does that mean the keyboard is dead?CHOU: What HTC believes is that there are different people who have different preferences. Our strategy is to have a product portfolio to let people select what they want and what is the best fit for them. This design really focuses on the screen and the form factor that has one of the best on-screen keyboards - for those people who like this kind of product, this is the best choice for them. We also have keyboard designs for those people who are heavy email or text users.RUBIN: There&apos;s voice input too, it&apos;s a middle thing that gives consumers options. Is this going to lead to Google selling more than just phones online - what about other products?RUBIN: Small cars, lava lamps, electric vehicles. QUEIROZ: We&apos;re not going to comment further on that.  7.19pm: Why is this just a US play?RUBIN: We&apos;re shipping to three other territories outside the US. As soon as we can get the web store to .co.uk, .de, we will. Will there be multitouch on these phones? There is multitouch on the Motorola Milestone, but not on the Droid (which is the same phone, essentially)RUBIN: We leave the option open. It&apos;s a software thing... we&apos;ll consider it.  This is a nice phone, but it&apos;s not a revolutionary step. Why put all your energy behind all this? Why is the pricing structure so boring when you&apos;ve talked about rolling out an ad-supported phone in the past? RUBIN: Before we can revolutionise the world, you have to have a mechanism by which you&apos;re selling product. The first baby step is getting an online store going and putting best-in-class products on that store... then we can work out how to make it better.  What&apos;s the difference between superphones and smartphones?RUBIN: The definition of superphone for us, it&apos;s the evolution of the platform - it&apos;s such that the openness of the platform and the applications, downloads and so on. The gigahertz processors, more memory, gigabyte storage - these didn&apos;t exist two years ago. We just thought the industry needed a new term to describe it; these are as powerful as your laptop was four years ago.  7.28pm: Some reaction in the comments, from different perspectives: Fleetwood Max: &quot;The only innovation here is the voice control, which isn&apos;t really selling it to me. OLED &amp; 5mp cameras are all well &amp; good, but where&apos;s that killer feature? It&apos;s ugly as well.&quot; DavidAZ: &quot;I am following this on my Verizon Droid (USA), which I like a lot. I am a bit miffed that I got this device on release weekend (November 5) and this is coming out TWO MONTHS later, and will be available soon from Verizon! But I am glad I will be getting Android 2.1 over the air soon.&quot; I think the big move here is really the idea that Google is selling products directly to the public. It could easily be the first step in a wider retailing strategy, but they didn&apos;t really want to answer that question, hence the (eventual) glib response.  7.32pm: Questions have been flooding in via Twitter: I&apos;ll try and get them answered, either in this Q&amp;A or in the demos afterwards. Dude, I&apos;ve been typing so fast my hands feel like legs of ham.  Now I&apos;m thinking about ham. Should have eaten some breakfast, I suspect.  7.34pm: What&apos;s broken with phone sales at the moment? What do operators think about handing over an important part of their businessRUBIN: In the same way that web stores revolutionised the sale of digital cameras, and now you don&apos;t need to go into the shop and look through the viewfinder - you trust the sites that review the cameras. We think that online sales of phones will work the same way.As far as efficiencies go, when you cast a wide net and have TV advertising and so on, it&apos;s expensive. That leads to increased device prices, increased service plan prices, and so on. We won&apos;t have some of those overheads.  7.35pm: Questions are starting to trickle away now. That&apos;s good news for me and good news for you: I&apos;ll get my hands on one, and give my fingers a rest for a few minutes.  7.37pm: Commenter Wikipedia asks &quot;So Bobbie, did they let you use the Nexus One to check out the nearby restaurants and shopping?&quot; Not yet. But we&apos;re heading out of the press conference shortly, which should give me time to play and find some ham sandwiches. I&apos;ll write a hands-on later this afternoon as I head out to the Consumer Electronics Show.  7.38pm: Oh, and the questions are still going on - but I&apos;m not going to inflict them on you because they&apos;re boring.  7.40pm: One useful clarification from Andy Rubin, who says that not all Android phones will automatically be upgraded to the latest version of the system - because some phones just can&apos;t handle it. &quot;My old laptop won&apos;t run Windows Vista and Windows 7,&quot; he says.  7.41pm: Apparently, the brave few of us who ventured down here will get our own Nexus phones - which should give me a chance to play on it a little more outside the confines of the Googleplex. With that, the press conference is over - thanks for joining me and leaving your comments and questions. Always a pleasure, never a chore."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/05/flavio-briatore-fia-court-decision", "sentences": ["Briatore was excluded from participation in all forms of international motorsport for his part in fixing the outcome of the 2008 Singapore grand prix, during which Nelson Piquet Jr was told to crash into a wall in order to improve the chances of his team-mate Fernando Alonso."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-05T21:49:02Z", "title": "FIA vows to stop Flavio Briatore returning to Formula One", "tags": ["Flavio Briatore", "Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Motor sport&apos;s governing body tonight vowed to find a way to prevent Flavio Briatore from returning to Formula One, despite the Italian overturning a lifetime ban for his part in the Crashgate scandal in a French court yesterday. The FIA indicated that it will appeal against the judges&apos; ruling in favour of the former head of Renault&apos;s Formula One team. Briatore reacted to his victory by opening the door to a sensational comeback but the FIA later suggested it would attempt to amend its rule book to keep him out and noted he remains banned until its appeal options have been exhausted. The governing body said it &quot;intends to consider appropriate actions to ensure that no persons who would engage, or who have engaged, in such dangerous activities or acts of intentional cheating will be allowed to participate in Formula One in the future&quot;. Briatore was excluded from participation in all forms of international motorsport for his part in fixing the outcome of the 2008 Singapore grand prix, during which Nelson Piquet Jr was told to crash into a wall in order to improve the chances of his team-mate Fernando Alonso. A French court today found that the FIA did not have the power to impose such a penalty and suggested there was a conflict of interest due to Max Mosley, the then president of the FIA, already being in dispute with Briatore. &quot;Let me take a little time to enjoy this moment of happiness after this difficult period,&quot; Briatore told Autosport.com, refusing to be drawn on when or whether he might return to the sport where he won championships with Benetton and Renault in a career spanning more than two decades. &quot;As concerns my possible return to F1, there is plenty of time to talk about this.&quot; The former Renault team principal, who also owns a majority stake in Queens Park Rangers, expressed &quot;great joy&quot; at the verdict and said it had been a &quot;difficult decision&quot; to take the case to the French civil courts but he had no other choice. &quot;The decision handed down today restores to me [my] dignity,&quot; he said. Briatore could not literally be banned as team principals do not hold licences but the FIA had forbidden all its licence holders from dealing with Briatore last September. Pat Symonds, Renault&apos;s former technical chief, also had his five-year ban lifted. Briatore had sought damages of \u20ac1m (\u00a3890,000) but was awarded \u20ac15,000 in compensation as well as Italian fails asking that the sentence be lifted. Symonds was awarded \u20ac5,000. &quot;It is almost exactly what we had asked for, this is obviously an exceptional outcome for Mr Briatore,&quot; his lawyer Philippe Ouakrat said. Ouakrat claimed that the judgment was &quot;extraordinary&quot; and could have serious implications for the future of the FIA. He said it was not a question of the length of the ban or the fact that it limited Briatore&apos;s ability to earn a living but simply &quot;an issue of fair justice&quot;. Ouakrat believed it would be &quot;very difficult&quot; for the FIA to win an appeal. &quot;I think the decision is very well-structured. It is going to be very difficult for the FIA to appeal against it. It&apos;s a great feeling to see that everything you say is considered right by the court.&quot; He said there remained &quot;a door open&quot; for further legal action. In its judgment, the court said: &quot;The FIA ... can sanction licence holders, leaders, members of the ASNs [national sporting authorities], but it cannot with respect to third parties take measures equivalent to a sanction. The [FIA] World Council, by forbidding FIA members and licensees to work with Messrs Briatore and Symonds, on the one hand added a negative condition \u2013 to not work with them \u2013 which is not provided for within the FIA statutes.&quot; The judgment added: &quot;The decision of the World Council was presided over by the FIA president, who was well known to be in conflict with Briatore, with Mr Mosley having played a leading role in launching the inquiry and its investigation in violation of the principle of separation of the power of the bodies.&quot; Attempts to contact Mosley tonight failed. The panel of three judges noted that Briatore had been summoned via an email only three days before the FIA hearing, had not been told why he had been charged and that the governing body had not sent him any documents regarding the scandal. Had the ban been upheld, Briatore could have been forced out of Queens Park Rangers under Football League fit and proper person rules, which prevent anyone who has been banned by another sports governing body from owning a club. The verdict will allow Briatore to continue managing the Formula One drivers Mark Webber and Heikki Kovalainen and, in theory, could led to his return to the pit lane. Briatore will not return to Renault, the Anglo-French team today announcing his full-time replacement. Eric Boullier, a 36-year-old Frenchman with no F1 experience, is as different from Briatore as it is possible to be. Briatore specialised in the commercial aspects of F1 and knew nothing about the technical side. Boullier&apos;s extensive background in the junior formulae, including GP2 and A1GP, focused on engineering and team management. Boullier&apos;s appointment allows Bob Bell, the temporary team principal, to return to his role as full-time technical director at Renault F1."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/06/fia-flavio-briatore-crashgate", "sentences": ["The FIA is considering the move, which would force it to review the entire Crashgate scandal from scratch, as an option in the wake of a French court&apos;s annulment of Briatore&apos;s lifetime ban for his part in ordering Nelson Piquet Jr to drive into a wall during the 2008 Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-06T18:28:21Z", "title": "FIA considers fresh disciplinary case to restore Flavio Briatore ban", "tags": ["Flavio Briatore", "Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "World motorsport&apos;s governing body may launch a fresh disciplinary process against Flavio Briatore in an attempt to prevent the former Renault team principal from returning to Formula One.

It is also likely to appeal against the verdict in the French courts. In a further sign that the saga, which many in the sport believed had been brought to a conclusion last year by the decision to ban Briatore and the then Renault technical director Pat Symonds, may have a long way to run. The triumphant Italian has said that he is also considering legal action against Piquet. Briatore said he would &quot;very probably&quot; sue Piquet, who launched an emotional attack on his former manager and team principal in the wake of the original World Motor Sport Council verdict last September, saying he drove him &quot;to the lowest point I had ever reached in my life&quot;. Briatore also said he would consider suing Heikki Kovalainen and Lucas Di Grassi, the other drivers he managed who parted company with him in the wake of the FIA&apos;s decision. &quot;Apart from Heikki Kovalainen and Lucas Di Grassi, my relationship with the other drivers has never changed,&quot; he told Gazzetta dello Sport. &quot;Now we will look at the situation with lawyers to see if we can take legal action against those who have broken contracts with us.&quot; Asked if he would take action against Piquet and his father, he said: &quot;That&apos;s very likely. The bad that has been done to me won&apos;t be forgotten in one day.&quot; Briatore had previously threatened the Piquets with legal action in the wake of their initial claims that he had played a key role in ordering the Brazilian driver to crash in order to benefit his team-mate Fernando Alonso. But after he was forced to quit Renault over the allegations, the threat was not repeated. The French court ruled that the FIA&apos;s decision was &quot;irregular&quot; because it had no jurisdiction over Briatore and Symonds, who had his own five-year ban overturned. The French court also said the long-standing enmity between Max Mosley \u2013 the then FIA president \u2013 and the Renault team principal meant the process was not guaranteed to be impartial. It also criticised the FIA for only letting Briatore know about the Monday hearing on the previous Friday, via an email that did not give him details of the proceedings or the precise charges against him. The FIA believes that because the court ruled against the process but did not consider the decision that resulted, it stands a good chance of being able to find a way of ensuring that Briatore and Symonds cannot return to the sport, whether through a fresh disciplinary process under a redrawn rulebook or a legal appeal. The FIA&apos;s rules will almost certainly be redrawn in any eventuality in an effort to make explicit its jurisdiction over anyone involved with the sport in any capacity. Jean Todt, the new FIA president who was Mosley&apos;s preferred choice to replace him, promised during his election campaign to review the organisation&apos;s governance arrangements and set up an independent disciplinary panel. The Football League has said it is waiting for &quot;formal clarification of the court&apos;s decision&quot; before considering the implications for Briatore&apos;s position as co\u2011owner of Queens Park Rangers. Its rules state that anyone banned by another sports governing body is forbidden from being a director or holding a majority stake in a club under its fit and proper person test. Yesterday&apos;s verdict appears to remove that threat, but the Football League is likely to wait to act until the appeals process has been exhausted before its board considers the matter again."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/07/sir-alex-ferguson-manchester-united-city", "sentences": ["But not to those Formula One fans who were duped by the efforts to fix the 2008 Singapore grand prix, during which Nelson Piquet Jr was told to crash in order to improve the chances of his team-mate Fernando Alonso."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-07T00:10:01Z", "title": "Shifting sands at Eastlands give Manchester United a new headache | Lawrence Donegan", "tags": ["Premier League", "Manchester City", "Manchester United", "Sir Alex Ferguson", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "That most elusive figure, the neutral observer, is drawn towards the underdog. Anything for an interesting time. Anything to escape the status quo. Anything to give the bully a bloody nose. This is true in life and it is true in sport. It has been especially true in Manchester football over this past week, where the confluence of two disparate events \u2013 Leeds United&apos;s 1\u20110 FA Cup victory at Old Trafford, and the announcement that City&apos;s owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan has in effect gifted the club \u00a3395m \u2013 has been spun into a heart-warming tale of a world turned upside down. Where once City were the cash-strapped underdogs, destined to live in the shadow of their richer, more glamorous neighbours, it is now United&apos;s turn to be cast as the paupers (relatively speaking, of course). Throw in the respect and admiration many have for City&apos;s strong local roots and their fans&apos; noticeable good humour in the face of some lean years, and then measure it against the ill-will many feel towards United \u2013 either because they are suspicious about the dilettante inclinations of the prawn-sandwich brigade or simply fed up with the long run of success under Sir Alex Ferguson \u2013 and no wonder there is glee in the air at this latest turn of events. Yet if it is easy to understand why many are happy at the prospect of watching the mighty take a fall, it is probably wise to offer a word or two of warning. After all, as my colleague Daniel Taylor pointed out here the other day, we have been here before with United, in 2005, when Roy Keane made his infamous appearance before the MUTV cameras to decry the efforts of his then team-mates. Two and a half years later Keane was retired and Rio Ferdinand and Co were in Moscow, picking up the European Cup. The difference this time is that two or three years hence Ferguson is unlikely to be around. Even if he was, it is hard to imagine, given his current squad and the obvious financial constraints that now apply at Old Trafford, that even he could fashion a side capable of beating the best in Europe. A more likely scenario is that the great Scot will be retired and on a golf course, while the club he built will have settled into some form of decline. Obviously, nothing is certain in football but if the recent history of the game has taught us anything it is that while talent, guile and luck matter, what matters most of all is money. The more you spend, the more you increase your chance of success. In which case we should perhaps ready ourselves for the era of City dominance. If Sheikh Mansour doesn&apos;t flinch when asked to hand over \u00a3395m in the first 18 months of his ownership of the club, it is hard to believe he will be disturbed at the notion of spending double that amount, or triple it, when it comes to assembling his own collection of sky blue gal\u00e1cticos. Should the sheikh succeed with his ambition to build a team that will dominate England, and Europe, it is to be hoped that the neutrals who find themselves inclined to celebrate City&apos;s current ascent will have woken to the pernicious reality of what is actually taking place at Eastlands. After all, here is a company which yesterday announced an annual loss of \u00a393m. Next year, the losses will be even greater. After that, who knows? What we do know is that Mansour&apos;s pockets are as deep as the oil reserves of Abu Dhabi are vast and that, consequently, his stewardship of City is remarkably similar to the profligate early years of Roman Abramovich&apos;s ownership of Chelsea. How strange it is that while the Russian was the target of widespread criticism for his spending habits, the sheikh has been lauded as the man most likely to break the long monopoly held by England&apos;s big four. Call this good luck, or call it a serious oversight on the part of those who have long called for reform in football&apos;s finances. But if \u2013 or, more likely, when \u2013 City finally do establish themselves as the leading club in the land, just don&apos;t call it a change for the better. It is just more of the same, in different colours. Coyle may be misguided but he is not disloyal Clarets Mad, the website for those who support Burnley FC, has a new word of the week and that word is Judas. As in Owen Coyle is a Judas. This is quite a comedown for Coyle, who not so long ago was a messiah \u2013 a description he acquired after guiding the Turf Moor club into the Premier League and making a more than respectable effort at sustaining a place there. We will never know if Coyle would have kept Burnley in the top division for more than a single season. The minutiae of contract negotiations notwithstanding, the Scotland-born manager is off to Bolton \u2013 a career switch that has led to the comparisons with the aforementioned Mr Iscariot. The frustration of the Burnley fans at losing their talented young manager, especially to a club who are arguably smaller in stature, is understandable. Accusations of disloyalty, however, are not. They never are when it comes to football managers, who are asked to display the kind of loyalty to clubs that clubs would not show to them were circumstances different. For proof of this, we need look no further than Alan Irvine, who led Preston to the play-offs last season, was forced to get rid of his two best players at the start of this season and was then sacked last week after a run of mediocre results. Coyle has made a very odd career choice but the fact is he has every right to make it. Vanity Fairway exposes golf&apos;s elitist pretensions If nothing else, the sight of a semi-naked Tiger Woods on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine offered final proof that the world of professional golf will never be the same again. The elitists&apos; game is mainstream now; fodder for the scandal sheets, both highbrow and lowbrow. No doubt some will find this notion abhorrent but, by and large, these are the same people who perpetrate the far more pernicious &quot;scandal&quot; of race and sex discrimination at golf clubs. Frankly, golf is perceived to be boring because many of those who run it, play it and write about it make a real effort to keep it as boring as possible, believing controversy of any kind is anathema to the spirit of the game. This ludicrous notion is based on the idea that golf is somehow morally superior to other sports, like football and cricket. It is nothing of the sort, which is why, like these other sports, it should embrace controversy, scandal and debate. Whatever it takes to capture the public&apos;s imagination. Briatore about-turn hardly a formula for fair play Those who travel through life with the assumption that the law is an ass will have taken comfort from the French court ruling that overturned Flavio Briatore&apos;s lifetime ban from Formula One. Dignity has been restored, said Briatore. But not to those Formula One fans who were duped by the efforts to fix the 2008 Singapore grand prix, during which Nelson Piquet Jr was told to crash in order to improve the chances of his team-mate Fernando Alonso."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jan/08/students-higher-education", "sentences": ["Ultimately Sydney University were the victors, to the delight of the rest of the Australian contingent, while the best speaker was an up-and-coming member of Singapore&apos;s political elite representing Oxford."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-08T09:00:00Z", "title": "'I took part in the world student debate finals'", "tags": ["Students", "Higher education", "Student politics", "Education"], "article": "This new year period I was one of over a thousand university students participating at the World Universities Debating Championships. Worlds, as it is known, was the thirtieth event of its kind to be held \u2013 this year in Antalya, Turkey and hosted by Ko\u00e7 University. It&apos;s an opportunity for young people from all over the world to engage in discussion on issues of social and political importance. In round one I found myself in a small room with teams from the Philippines, Israel and the US, discussing whether labour unions should be abolished. Quotas for women in university in the developing world; making communities responsible for honour killings; subsidising Twitter in authoritarian countries \u2013 the pros and cons of each of these and more were hurled back and forth across nine rounds. Almost four hundred teams had shrunk to just 32 by the final stages \u2013 which my team was fortunate enough to make this year at my third attempt. Ultimately Sydney University were the victors, to the delight of the rest of the Australian contingent, while the best speaker was an up-and-coming member of Singapore&apos;s political elite representing Oxford. Debating has become increasingly &apos;professionalised&apos; in terms of the preparation undertaken by teams serious about doing well at Worlds. Numerous warm-up tournaments occur in Europe, North America and Australasia, with teams keen to gain a reputation with adjudicators prior to arriving at Worlds. A peace-themed tournament in Malaysia even has cash prizes. With only fifteen minutes to prepare for each debate and no access to the Internet in that time, debaters must develop a very broad knowledge base. Highly specific topics this year on partitioning Sudan and on military involvement in Sri Lankan politics rewarded the well-prepared, some carrying around hefty tomes with every topic under the sun neatly indexed. My approach is the easiest and most pleasurable \u2013 reliable consumption of the Guardian Weekly. Worlds has grown so large in part because of the active participation of many students whose first language is not English, mostly from continental Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The cultural and linguistic diversity of the tournament generates both benefits and challenges. There are separate finals series for &apos;English as a Second Language&apos; and &apos;English as a Foreign Language&apos; teams, this year won by Tel Aviv University and Moscow State Institute of International Relations respectively. These help to acknowledge that while debating is about open dialogue, when it is necessarily done in one common language the playing field is by no means level. The cultural parameters in which a debate occurs can be less obvious. Worlds is held in a British Parliamentary style, with two teams on both government and opposition, and each team having a seven-minute speech for each of its two speakers. Points of information, which are a kind of interjection, are included, with the optional anachronism of posing as if you are holding your wig with one hand and the bill you are referring to with the other. Motions typically commence with the phrase &apos;That this house would\u2026&apos; \u2013 the implicit meaning of &apos;this house&apos; is very often Western liberal democracies. Debaters from, say, China, must work hard to establish common ground on which to build a persuasive case. Even American teams often struggle to adapt to the very particular format which is different to their domestic competitions. British, Irish and Australian institutions consistently perform well, feeling more at home in the style. Next year the tournament will be held in Botswana, very much a newcomer to the world university debating scene, but it is hoped that African participation will benefit from the accessible location. Of course Worlds isn&apos;t only about the debating \u2013 in fact the participants&apos; intellectual feats are miraculously performed despite nights filled with drinking, dancing and little sleep. Spending New Year&apos;s Eve at a beachside &apos;full moon party&apos; with unlimited free alcohol (and dancers on podiums pushing the limits of good taste) was enough for many debaters not to mind much whether they were on the list of finalists announced just after midnight. More than a few Worlds debaters could be spotted around the tourist traps of Istanbul \u2013 myself included \u2013 marking a brief hiatus before one of the great institutions of student life carried on into 2010."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jan/08/complaints-choirs", "sentences": ["There are four complaints choirs on the west coast of Canada alone and 10\u00bd choirs in Sweden, including a singularly dark version in Ume\u00e5; there are boisterous versions in St Petersburg and Singapore, a cacophony in Rotterdam, individual takes in Helsinki, Hamburg, Budapest, Philadelphia, and \u2026 anywhere you care to look, really."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-08T14:29:07Z", "title": "All together now: 'Don't clip your nails next to me at work'", "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "article": "     In Finnish, there is an expression, Valituskuoro (&quot;complaints choir&quot;), which is used to describe situations where a lot of people complain simultaneously.

So they travelled to Birmingham where a choir was assembled in only two weeks via flyers and small posters. Led by local musician Mike Hurley, the members detailed numerous gripes (including &quot;I want to complain about the giant advertising billboard on the site of Birmingham town hall&quot; and &quot;I want to complain about fat women driving in yellow sports cars like they own the world&quot;) culminating in the raucous chorus: &quot;I want my money back/My job is like a cul-de-sac/And the bus is too infrequent at 6.30.&quot; Performed in front of a handful of bemused onlookers on deckchairs, accompanied by acoustic guitar and splitting into what seemed like an inadvertent call-and-response harmony at the finale, the rousing polyphonic melody wouldn&apos;t have been out of place in Oliver!

The Liberal Democrats are in the lead in this area. The Conservatives have been reticent.

He asked our two groups, Index on Censorship and English PEN, to nominate one among our number to sit on his group. When I found out that they had invited Carter-Ruck and Schillings, two major law firms which feast on chilling the free speech of scientists, authors, NGOs and journalists, I suggested to Straw&apos;s people that the two authors of the libel report, Index&apos;s editor, Jo Glanville, and PEN&apos;s director, Jonathan Heawood, should both be members of the inquiry team. As it stood, the composition ran against Straw&apos;s &quot;apparent desire to be seen as a reformer&quot;, I suggested. They quickly relented, arguing that my term &quot;apparent&quot; was unfair.

Perhaps this time Straw may deliver positive change. If he doesn&apos;t, we won&apos;t be bashful in our response. Talking of inquiries, the Chilcot review of the Iraq war is back in full flow. I&apos;ve had mixed feelings as I&apos;ve followed the ins and outs. After the disgrace of Hutton and the lost opportunity of Lord Butler&apos;s inquiry, this is the third, and final, chance of a cathartic reckoning. If anything, anger at the massaging of the evidence has increased over the years. Britain has not, as Tony Blair would wish, &quot;moved on&quot;. The procedures have been dispassionate and erudite and, to a large extent, so far disappointing. Much of the testimony, claimed by some reports as new, simply confirms revelations we knew already from leaked memos and the various books. For example, people around the Prime Minister told me for Blair&apos;s Wars, published six months after the invasion, how he committed himself to military action with George Bush at his Texan ranch in April 2002. Also, I reported the memo Straw sent to Blair on the very eve of war, suggesting that the Brits stop short of deploying forces. This led Donald Rumsfeld to talk famously of &quot;workarounds&quot; in the event of UK non-deployment. Still, the inquiry team has uncovered new information which will be useful for academics. The problem is not the individuals, more the way the inquiry was set up, a point I have made recently on Radio 4 in a Profile programme on Roderic Lyne, one of its members, a former ambassador to Moscow, and a man for whom I have considerable respect. Lyne and his four colleagues will be severely tested soon when they question Alastair Campbell. Will he and will Blair, who follows shortly after, run rings round them? One of the justifiable criticisms of journalists is that they spend all their time writing and talking about what others do, while doing little themselves. For just over a year, I have been chair of the board of Turner Contemporary, a project that is helping to regenerate Margate and other parts of east Kent that have suffered greatly in recent decades. Last Sunday, I showed around my sister, who lives in the Basque country in Spain and who thus knows a thing or two about art galleries and their role in coastal towns (Guggenheim and Bilbao). In exactly 12 months since construction started, the gallery has risen resplendently on the sea front \u2013 on time and on budget. In spring 2011, the south-east will have one of its most impressive contemporary art galleries, courtesy of architect David Chipperfield. I hope it will serve as a magnet for the town where Turner spent much of his time, painting the views out to sea with an intriguing light that comes from a north-facing coastline. Preparation for the exhibitions programme devised by the gallery&apos;s director, Victoria Pomery, and her team is now almost complete. The project had a difficult start, abandoned when an earlier design overshot its budget, leading to ill feeling among many in Margate. Much of that has now gone and I was pleased to see that just in the space of a few weeks a new boutique hotel and a number of quirky shops in the old town have opened. Things are really beginning to happen. Green shoots? Dangerous talk\u2026 From Margate to Mumbai. I&apos;ll be in India speaking about the themes in my latest book, Freedom for Sale, about the trade-offs people have made during the last two decades of globalisation between freedom on the one side, and the thirst for material wealth and the demand for total security on the other. Each audience brings its own insights. In Brussels, I was reminded how many in continental Europe are relaxed about state incursions into privacy, such as identity cards. In Oslo, I was struck by growing concerns about the collective postwar consensus of the Nordic countries. My most intriguing trip was to Singapore, the land of my birth. I cite Singapore as the model for a pact in which private freedoms, notably the freedom to earn and spend money, appear prized far more highly than public freedoms such as free expression. I had been denounced several times by the government, leading my parents to worry that I might be arrested, Polanski-style, at Changi airport. Instead, the seminar I was invited to give at National University was conducted robustly but fairly. This was followed by a one-page feature on the book in the government-controlled Straits Times. One blogger suggested I had allowed myself to become &quot;the perfect straw man&quot;, allowing the authorities to use my example to counter accusations of authoritarianism. Of course that danger exists, but I prefer to err on the side of optimism and to wonder whether the city-state might be opening up, just a little."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/jan/10/ten-bargain-breaks-winter-sun", "sentences": ["THAILAND AND MALAYSIA  Departing 28 January, Bales Worldwide (0845 057 1819; balesworldwide.com) has a nine-day trip, combining two nights in Bangkok, two nights in Singapore and a three-night journey on the Eastern and Orient Express between both cites, from \u00a32,450 (saving \u00a3400), including flights from Heathrow, transfers, B&amp;B accommodation in the hotels and full board on the train journey."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-10T00:07:39Z", "title": "Ten bargain breaks with winter sun", "tags": ["Morocco holidays", "Marrakech holidays", "Barbados holidays", "Thailand holidays", "Malaysia holidays", "Bangkok holidays", "Singapore holidays", "Heathrow", "Maldives holidays", "Cambodia holidays", "Hawaii holidays", "Jamaica holidays", "Tanzania holidays", "Mexico holidays", "India holidays", "Delhi holidays", "Hotels", "Beach holidays", "City breaks", "Travel"], "article": "HAWAII Bon Voyage (0800 316 3012; bon-voyage.co.uk/spotlight) has seven nights&apos; room only at the Outrigger Hotel on Big Island from \u00a31,155 (saving \u00a3185), including flights from Heathrow and car hire.

With about 2,500 attendees, a combined total of 9,000 participants worldwide (via live streams), and an array of features that no other conference in the world can match, it was very much a milestone. A bit on the word &quot;hacker&quot;, as I know the term might be bothering some of you. I am not using it in the stereotypical way mainstream society often does, to refer to criminal and malicious activity. The hackers I am talking about go back to the origins of the word: one who tinkers, one who deconstructs out of a natural curiosity about how something works and how it could be made to do something it wasn&apos;t originally intended to do. Such abilities are akin to the skilled locksmith, and do not automatically make a hacker a criminal. Unfortunately for many who work in mainstream media, the word has been hijacked to be synonymous with &quot;electronic evildoer&quot;. Yet, like many words that have been used to keep minority groups down, hackers are taking the label back. Announcements such as the GSM encryption crack may have made international headlines last month, but something much more significant is clear: throughout the world, hackers have come out from their bunkers and opened up community spaces. They go by various names (co-working spaces, clubhouses, hideouts, space stations) and are a global-scale breakthrough for a community that for decades has not always been willing or able to go public. By opening up, they&apos;ve not only gone public, but have also opened their doors to anyone curious or interested in the world of technology and how things work. This phenomenon may be bigger than it has ever been, but in some corners of the world, it is not altogether new. Groups of German hackers have long organised themselves as officially recognised clubs and taken on challenges of a technical (or non-technical) nature. In North America, the movement has seen its greatest expansion in the past few years, with spaces such as NYC Resistor in Brooklyn, Pumping Station: One in Chicago and Noisebridge in San Francisco providing a creative space for a rapidly growing membership. The hacker space movement includes clubs in different parts of Latin America, as well as in South Africa, Israel, Iran, Dubai, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and Australia. Every month, the list gets longer as more groups come forward and post their details online at hackerspaces.org, a central hub and wiki for all info about spaces, including how to start one. Among the attendees at the 26C3 conference were the people behind wikileaks, the wiki clearinghouse for leaked documents. In its first few years wikileaks has come under attack by governments and other large institutions who fear its growing influence and has made international headlines on several occasions, including when it was ordered to shut down by a California court in 2008 after documents were leaked related to offshore bank activities. Presenting at this year&apos;s congress, their goal was to explain how this project could become an essential tool for journalists throughout the world who seek sources and secure methods to protect the identity of those with access to \u2013 and brave enough to leak \u2013 sensitive information. Also present was Bre Pettis and his Makerbot Industries. The knob on your dishwasher broke off? Trying in vain to contact customer assistance and find some way to get a replacement part? Well Pettis had a better idea, and by using a 3D printer, produced his own replacement knob. His tinkering with 3D printing has resulted in the founding of his very own company, Makerbot, which has actual employees and its own manufacturing space in Brooklyn, shipping Makerbots all over the world. Pettis didn&apos;t tell us to buy his stuff, but talked about what other people have been building and how he envisages a future where people aren&apos;t just consumers: he dreams of a return of the tradition of people making things. It is hard not to be in awe of what this group of hackers was able to build for a four-day conference: its GSM network, an internal Dect phone system, a radio station, its own all-volunteer first aid and emergency rescue team and an indescribably fast network with capacity that no conference or municipality in the world can compete with. It is no wonder spaces are popping up everywhere, as hackers come out of the cupboards and stand proudly as the talented explorers and critical thinkers that they are."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jan/14/tefl-singapore", "sentences": ["Singapore set to test foreign workers&apos; English skillsForeigners seeking visas to work in Singapore&apos;s service sector will have to sit a test of English from later this year as part of a government campaign to raise English standards."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-14T09:00:00Z", "title": "Europe's language business worth $12bn and growing", "tags": ["Tefl", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Business generated by Europe&apos;s translation providers and other language teaching services is estimated to have been worth $12bn in 2008, according to research published by the EU last month. The report, commissioned by the EU&apos;s translation service, said that the language industry is growing faster than any other sector in Europe, with expansion estimated to continue at 10%. But researchers warn that because the industry is so diverse, spread across activities ranging from in-company translation, software development and subtitling of films and television programmes, its impact is often overlooked. One indication that this could change comes from evidence that investment companies are showing growing interest in the sector, the report&apos;s writers say. They point to evidence from eastern Europe where a small number of players are dominating translating services. The report also highlights a growing acceptance of machine translation tools. This is in response to a shortage of human translators and improved accuracy of computer-assisted translation. The translation and interpreting sector dominates the language industry, with an estimated value of $8bn in 2008, while language teaching was the next biggest sector, estimated to be worth $2.3bn. Singapore set to test foreign workers&apos; English skillsForeigners seeking visas to work in Singapore&apos;s service sector will have to sit a test of English from later this year as part of a government campaign to raise English standards. Details of the test have yet to be revealed but Lee Yi Shyan, minister for manpower, told the Straits Times newspaper that the move was aimed at raising English language skills in the retail, food and beverage and hotels sectors. It comes after prime minister Lee Hsien Loong decried foreigners in service jobs who could not distinguish between phrases such as &quot;chilli&quot; or &quot;no chilli&quot;. The government will also offer employers the opportunity to reduce a levy on foreign employees from $170 to $100 if they can prove that new staff are proficient in English. Malaysia speeds return of BahasaBahasa Malay will replace English as the medium of instruction in maths and science classes in Malaysia&apos;s schools in 2011, a year earlier than scheduled, said education minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. The government had the resources to implement the policy sooner than planned, he said. Muhyiddin said that English language standards had not benefitted from the use of the language for teaching. &quot;[Students&apos;] proficiency in the language currently should not just be average and drastic measures are needed to address this problem,&quot; Muhyiddin told the Bernama news agency last month. He said foreign teachers would be recruited to act as &quot;master teachers&quot; to improve standards of English language tuition alongside new textbooks and language labs. Dutch eyes in Sweden&apos;s schools anger unionsSweden&apos;s schools inspectorate has called in a Dutch education consultancy to review English language teaching at 30 secondary school, angering Swedish teaching unions. A team of inspectors from Cito, the international assessment and testing company based in the Netherlands, will assess English language teaching for 11- to 16-year-olds under a contract worth $700,000. Teaching unions expressed surprise at the decision. &quot;I question how a Dutch firm can study a Swedish school.

Not a usual career path, certainly. But this is no usual person. Everyone&apos;s agog at the appointment of Sir Fred Goodwin as a senior adviser to the international architecture practice RMJM. Why? What use could he be? Surely the man who led the Royal Bank of Scotland to implosion is unemployable? Even if someone did want to employ him, as Odgers wanted to employ Johnny Cameron, formerly the head of RBS&apos; investment banking division, then would they, like Odgers, feel the wrath of the public and the government and hold back from tarnishing their reputation with his? Does RMJM not understand the meaning of shame? At the risk of being lynched, I have to say that this doesn&apos;t look the silliest move to me. Fred Goodwin became CEO of RBS in 2001, when he was only 43, and oversaw what everyone agreed at the time was a very successful domestic and international expansion. Sure, he paid too much for ABN Amro \u2013 most of the \u00a348bn that the consortium had to fork out for the Dutch bank \u2013 but, again, that was one decision against many acquisitions that other business leaders wished they had secured. He may have made an error of judgment, but which of us has not? Now, Goodwin&apos;s behaviour is held responsible for the loss of thousands of jobs and the part-nationalisation of the jewel in the crown of Scotland&apos;s financial services industry. Like \u00adRijkman Groenink of ABN Amro, Fred is seen as having squandered the national inheritance and is vilified by his countrymen, with some justification. Many of the very same Scots who were proud to host the fifth largest bank in the world \u2013 built, acquisition by acquisition, by Fred Goodwin \u2013 would now cross the road to avoid the man who was once held up as a national hero. But this is not about arguing for someone to be given a second chance. Fred Goodwin doesn&apos;t need pity, and Peter Morrison, chief executive of RMJM Europe, is not in the business of philanthropy. In his mid-30s, he is a young man who, having, with his father, bought into a large and complex architecture practice, is seeking to pursue a policy of international expansion. I am sure that many members of the public will wonder why he would want to sully his \u2013 and their \u2013 reputation by hiring Fred. Objectively, I would say that for him it is a bit of a coup to have someone with Fred&apos;s experience in his toolkit. Fred has probably accumulated more air miles than almost any other businessman of his age. He has an &quot;Alpha grasp&quot; of finance and a keen eye for detail. When RBS&apos;s new HQ outside Edinburgh was being built, he had a cabin set up for him at Gogarburn and involved himself right down to the choice of wallpaper. You might question this level of engagement, but it does suggest that he might be of some use to a firm of architects. Morrison, in the internal memo he sent to his staff, refers to RHJM&apos;s &quot;international expansion strategy&quot; and says that he looks forward to Fred becoming an &quot;integral member&quot; of the team. I can buy that. Fred knows who is important around the world and who is not, how to greet people, how to secure their support and how to be an ambassador for an international company with its roots in Scotland. I suspect that may prove pretty useful to an ambitious thirtysomething who is looking beyond his domestic market. In Shanghai, Seattle, Singapore and Seoul, they have never been much interested in Fred&apos;s pension pot. RHJM is not the first company to recognise the skills and experience of those involved in the financial crisis. Tom McKillop was chairman when the decision was made to buy ABN; does that make him less useful to UCB, where he has recently become a non-executive director? Andy Hornby will only be 43 on Thursday \u2013 Alliance Boots is said to be delighted with its young and energetic CEO and grateful for the experience he brings from having run a large retail bank such as HBOS, even if it did collapse, under his leadership, into the arms of Lloyds. Is there such a thing as pariah status, really? Although I suspect Peter Cummings may be beyond \u00adrehabilitation\u2026 But that may be because I have a personal gripe about Cummings or, rather, his vehicle, the Bank of Scotland. It turned me down when I wanted a loan to buy my business, which, like RHJM, had been set up by two respected practitioners who were \u2013 and still are \u2013 revered both within and without the office walls. Five years on, I still consult those of my acquaintances who are older, and more experienced, in acquiring and running businesses in such a way that you keep the best of the old while introducing the new. That advice is invaluable. Fred had such a mentor in the form of Sir George Mathewson, and will well understand the part he will be expected to play for Morrison. The majority of Britons might be appalled, but I am not, and Peter Morrison will recognise the benefit of working with someone who has faced adversity. The transfer of RBS to majority government ownership might not have been any fun, but it would have taught Fred, the son of an electrician, some lessons. Morrison, by contrast, was part of a wealthy family before he even knew what a bank \u2013 or an architecture practice \u2013 was. His vision in recognising what Fred could bring to his firm is controversial, and brave, but could prove to have been inspired. Like others before him, he looks like he has recognised the talent behind the tarnish. Also, he&apos;ll have got all that experience for what I will wager has been a knock-down price.

As part of a push to make teaching &quot;the noble profession&quot; attracting the &quot;best brains&quot;, a Tory government would deny state funding for training to graduates who achieve a third. Students who achieve a 2:1 or above in maths or a &quot;rigorous science subject from a good university&quot; could apply to have their student loan written off. This definition would exclude mainly graduates from most former polytechnics, renamed universities in 1992. At the launch of the education section of the Tories&apos; draft general election manifesto, Cameron will declare that he hopes to emulate Finland, Singapore and South Korea, which have attracted some of the brightest graduates into teaching by making it a &quot;high-prestige profession&quot;. The Tory leader will say: &quot;They are brazenly elitist \u2013 making sure only the top graduates can apply. They have turned it into the career path if you&apos;ve got a good degree \u2026 We should be equally bold here. So we will end the current system where people with third-class degrees can get taxpayers&apos; money to enter postgraduate teacher training. &quot;With our plans, if you want to become a teacher \u2013 and get funding for it \u2013 you need a 2:2 or higher. And we will also make sure we get some of the best graduates into teaching by offering to pay off their student loan. As long as you&apos;ve got a first or 2:1 in maths or a rigorous science subject from a good university, you can apply.&quot; Cameron, who took a first in politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, will set out his thinking at a city academy school in London. Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary who took a 2:1 at Oxford, has long campaigned for the Tories to raise standards in teacher training. The decision to allow graduates who achieve a good degree in a &quot;rigorous science subject from a good university&quot; to apply to have their student loan written off shows that the Tories have no qualms in admitting that some universities are stronger than others. Lord Patten of Barnes, the former Tory chairman who is now chancellor of Oxford University, called over the weekend for a return to the old division between polytechnics and universities. Patten told the Times that Britain should follow the example of the US, which has community colleges, state universities and the Ivy League. &quot;We are trying to provide the same universities for everyone as the number of students increases,&quot; Patten said. &quot;It&apos;s all about equality of esteem, all universities have to do the same thing. That&apos;s preposterous, insane.&quot; Under the Tory plan, a panel would be set up to define &quot;a good university&quot;. The pool would number in the &quot;low dozens&quot; and would be larger than the 20-strong Russell group of elite universities. Most former polytechnics would be excluded, although some with strong science courses, such as Derby University, could be included. Cameron&apos;s speech will also focus on the Tories&apos; &quot;Broken Society&quot; theme of how drugs and family breakdown are leading to social dislocation. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, Cameron warned of a &quot;darker side to parts of Britain&quot; highlighted by the killing of Sukhwinder Singh, who tackled alleged muggers. The Tory leader pledged to help families by pressing ahead with his controversial plans to recognise marriage in the tax system and to increase the number of health visitors. Labour will make clear that families will be at the centre of the election campaign with the launch this week of a green paper on the family. The party aims to enhance the role of young fathers by teaching them how to help their partners with breastfeeding and be more involved in the early years of their child. Ed Balls, the family secretary, said on BBC1&apos;s The Politics Show: &quot;I&apos;ve talked to the Royal College of Midwives and what they&apos;ve said is that we haven&apos;t done enough in the past to support dads and their role in childbirth in the months and weeks beforehand, even though we know this is the most vulnerable time for a couple. If dads aren&apos;t engaged and involved that can be the time when they walk away \u2026 This will mean, for 800,000 dads this year, when a child is born they will get information and support as well as the mother.&quot; Gordon Brown will focus on social mobility when he announces that the government will endorse most of the proposals in a recent report by the former health secretary Alan Milburn, including giving students from lower income backgrounds greater opportunities to secure internships in the professions. \u2022\u00a0The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column on Tuesday 19 January 2010.

You probably saw the recent IMF paper &quot;A fistful of dollars; lobbying and the financial crisis&quot;, which showed the more a bank spent on lobbyists, the riskier its lending. You are allowing yourself to be used as a wholly owned lobbyist of the British Bankers&apos; Association and the Corporation of London \u2013 and if and when the balloon goes up again with another financial crisis, you will be left high and dry. If Britain allows its banking sector to grow as rapidly over the next decade as in the last, with so much of its revenue diverted not to building up its capital but to paying extravagant bonuses, when the next crisis comes it will overwhelm the British state. We could just about get through this crisis with \u00a31.3 trillion of liquidity, guarantees and capital injections into the banks. Next time round \u2013 in five or 10 years&apos; time if nothing changes \u2013 Britain simply could not pay the bill. We would have to print money or endure an even deeper recession, and that will include Londoners. Andrew Haldane, executive director of the Bank of England, calls it a &quot;doom loop&quot;. Of course we want a vibrant banking sector in London, but we also need it to be sound. For more than a decade, banks and investment banks have got used to paying out routinely up to 50% of their revenues as bonuses. As the Bank of England says, if they had paid just 20% less in bonuses and dividends between 2000 and 2008 they would have had \u00a375bn more capital \u2013 more than the taxpayer put in. They must change in future. Tax on bonuses is part of a much bigger story, of trying to create a sounder banking industry. Bankers may think there is some escape \u2013 but to where? Smaller financial centres like Singapore or Hong Kong lack the economic muscle to support big banks when things go wrong, so depositors will vote with their feet. The banks&apos; business will dissolve. There is nowhere in the EU with a better infrastructure or regulatory/tax framework kinder than London&apos;s. And President Obama has announced a 10-year levy on banks because of their &quot;obscene&quot; bonuses \u2013 hardly friendlier than here. You are being taken for a ride. We may lose a few bankers as the sector shrinks, which is what happens in capitalism when businesses make mistakes. But instead of defending the indefensible, why not be on the side of a sounder banking system and a more diversified London economy \u2013 a great legacy as mayor? Best, Will Dear WillOh come off it. You ask how I have been somehow conned into sticking up for London banking. I do so for the same reason that I fight for any other sector. I defend financial services for the same reason that I have championed the London Living Wage, given cut-price travel to jobseekers, frozen City Hall&apos;s council tax and built 20,000 affordable homes in the last 18 months. I will fight for the interests of Londoners who work in banking for exactly the same reason that I fight for the interests of those who work in tourism or the media or in public transport. I do so because I sincerely and passionately believe it is in the interests of London. Of course I deplore, like you, the current orgy of excessive bonuses \u2013 and in case you think I am just saying this to suit an Observer readership, let me direct you to an article I wrote in that proud capitalist organ, the Daily Telegraph, on 19 October. In fact, let me quote a chunk of the concluding bombardment: &quot;The decision of these banks to hand out these bonuses as though nothing has changed is unbelievable. The only reason these bankers are still in jobs is because the taxpayer bailed out the system. &quot;These banks can no longer talk glibly about the need to offer competitive salaries to star bankers, and the operation of the free market. Their irresponsibility almost brought the free market crashing to its knees. How can they pretend that the world hasn&apos;t changed? What blindness, what deafness, what Asperger&apos;s afflicts them?&quot; And I went on to warn the banks that if the bonus bonanza continued, and if they continued to seem so heedless of wider society, then the pressure for fiscal retaliation would be overwhelming. I was proved right, of course, and the issue now is not whether banks will face new taxes, but to what extent these measures can be globally concerted so as not to disadvantage London. I agree with you, by the way, that an international accord should oblige the banks to insure themselves against the consequences of their risk-taking. We must somehow end this implicit taxpayer guarantee that makes the current bonus round so outrageous. But if I read your letter correctly, that is not enough for you. Oh no. You want to go further. You actually want to &quot;rebalance&quot; the British economy by an unspecified process of shrinking or pruning the financial services industry. You want a &quot;more diversified&quot; London economy. This may or may not be a good thing, but I am not sure how you achieve it. The financial services industry contributes about 9% of GDP, and every job in the sector is estimated to add \u00a3117,000 to the London economy. The taxes generated by the hedge funds and private equity alone are enough to pay for 200,000 nurses or 165,000 teachers or the entire Olympic budget. How else are you going to find that money, Will? And what about all the London families and individuals who depend more or less directly on the wealth and energy of the City? What about the lawyers and the accountants and all the other professions involved in the deals? What about the builders and the taxi drivers and the waiters? What do you say to all these millions of people when you brilliantly decide to sabotage one of the main flywheels of the London economy? What do you say to your friends in the arts world when their operas and their galleries are no longer able to call upon the philanthropy of these despised masters of the universe? Suppose you were to accomplish your Pol Pot-style purge, and remove \u2013 say \u2013 one banker in 10. Which sectors do you think would miraculously sprout to fill the gap? I don&apos;t think you have a clue, and certainly no evidence for thinking that these people would pop up in, say, manufacturing. Perhaps you would prefer more people became journalists or the heads of think tanks. As even the Work Foundation [of which Hutton is the executive vice chair] may be about to discover, there is a limited amount of taxpayers&apos; money to fund endless studies into this or that, and it&apos;s no way to run an economy. London is blessed with a world-beating industry that is of colossal importance to the UK economy. We are agreed that the present bonus round is a huge own goal. We are agreed that the system needs reform. But to set out to attack the City of London, to reduce it in scale, to diminish its share of GDP, in the delusive hope that some other sector will supplant it in a &quot;more diversified&quot; economy \u2013 that strikes me as positively barmy. Best, Boris Dear BorisSwashbuckling stuff \u2013 but which Boris am I debating with? There is Boris A, the D&apos;Artagnan of the City, firing off letters to the chancellor about the impact of the bonus tax and warning of thousands of bankers set to leave London. Then there is Boris B, the wise financial statesman worried about bankers&apos; orgy of excessive bonuses, and the need for reform. Here we make common cause. But the financial statesman reverts to D&apos;Artagnan with a blink of an eye. Since we began this debate, Obama has raised the stakes massively with his proposal to stop banks running trading desks where they speculate in so-called derivatives, or owning and sponsoring private equity groups and hedge funds to whom banks have lent hundreds of billions of dollars. Obama has reversed three decades of financial policy making, and struck at the pyramid of securitised lending, with its interconnected credit default swaps and derivatives. I support his move \u2013 together with banks carrying more capital and paying an insurance levy, I think the banking system could be made a great deal safer, and the intolerable risk of taxpayers picking up the bill while insiders walk away with grotesquely high bonuses will be greatly reduced. Do you agree? But this has big implications. Blowing the whistle on pseudo profits and the accompanying bonuses is not a &quot;Pol Pot&quot; weeding of the ranks of City employees. British bank assets doubled in the decade to 2007 as the capital underwriting them fell and they exploited regulatory holes they&apos;d lobbied for. That can&apos;t happen in the next decade, or if it does, as I repeat, the next crisis could overwhelm the economy. Putting this right is not barmy \u2013 it is correcting what has become a tax on the rest of the economy. That figure of \u00a3117,000 for every City job you use takes none of this into account. Do the economists who produced the estimate assume that the alternative for talented people working in the City is unemployment or making zero economic contribution, which would be pretty unlikely? Do they net out the cost of bailing out banks? We&apos;ve ended up with too many banks, lawyers, estate agents and the like \u2013 and not enough hi-tech companies, designers, advertisers, software houses, health companies and all the other opportunities out there. We have too little productive entrepreneurship generating jobs and wealth beyond financial services. It now puts London at risk. I applaud your support of the London Living Wage and cut-price travel for job-seekers, but you could go even further. How about launching a London network of &quot;Johnson&quot; institutes whose job is to scan the horizon for new scientific and technological ideas and connect them with dynamic young companies who don&apos;t have the resource to do such scanning themselves? George Osborne has talked about developing banks that are more supportive of business. How about a London Business Bank? Health is becoming a boom area; how about getting behind London&apos;s great teaching hospitals to promote and entrench London as the leader in world health? I don&apos;t think it&apos;s barmy to think in these terms. I suspect Boris B doesn&apos;t either. But what about D&apos;Artagnan Boris A? Best, Will Dear WillI had got most of the way through your latest when it suddenly hit me that you may not even be aware of the basic shape of the London economy. Of course everyone is obsessed with bankers and their bonuses. Everybody wants to bash them and to bash anyone so rash as to defend their very existence. But what you seem to ignore is the many other London sectors that are globally dominant and which seem \u2013 on the face of it \u2013 to be completely out of scale with our population. London not only has four of the world&apos;s six largest law firms. We have more of the world&apos;s top universities than any other city, with two of the top five, and with billions in revenues from foreign students that are crucial for the higher-education economy. We have a huge creative, culture and media sector, with 30% of the UK workforce and a bigger advertising industry than New York. We have the biggest constellation of medical science centres outside America, a stunning treasury of intellectual riches. And yes, since you ask, I met representatives of the three key players \u2013 King&apos;s, Imperial, UCL \u2013 last October, and we agreed that our new Promote London Council would make medical science a central part of the message to the world. We have the biggest tourist industry of any metropolis, with more visitors than either New York or Paris \u2013 which is not surprising since we have twice as many bookshops as New York and more museums than Paris, and, oh yes, it rains more in Rome. Now let me ask you: do you believe that any of these gigantic London sectors are somehow &quot;too big&quot;? Is it a &quot;tax on talent&quot; that so many bright minds are drawn to teach at London universities, so that we have become the Athens of the modern world, with foreign fees pouring in to subsidise the impecunious natives? Would you say that those who work in our tourism industry are somehow generating &quot;pseudo-profits&quot;? Of course you wouldn&apos;t. You don&apos;t disapprove of people coming here to make millions from London&apos;s thriving and cosmopolitan film industry, do you? You wouldn&apos;t want to kick some of them out, or reduce the number of movie millionaires. So why are you so determined to make London less attractive for financial services and to reduce the number of bankers? You are making two fundamental mistakes: first, in thinking that London is entirely dependent on financial services, when that is plainly not true. Second, you seem to imagine that London&apos;s financial services industry should be somehow &quot;proportionate&quot; to the rest of the London economy, with each limb \u2013 manufacturing, media, transport, whatever \u2013 assembled with the harmony of some ancient statue. That is to misunderstand what London is, and the role it plays in the world. Financial services are part of a global industry, and 75% of London&apos;s banking and insurance products are sold overseas. Ever since we got rid of the anti-enterprise mentality of the 1970s, London has been a global talent magnet. My worry now is that we \u2013 or rather you and the Labour government \u2013 are starting to sound hostile to the kind of wealth creators who have come here in the last 25 years, attracted by our energy and our diversity and what used to be our fairly low tax rates. I repeat: Obama is right to say the banks need reform, though it is hard to know what he means when he says he wants to stop retail banks doing proprietary trading &quot;unless it is necessary for customer services&quot;. That seems a fairly large loophole. I agree that we need a healthy banking sector, and I repeat that these outlandish bonuses should not be given with the luxury of a taxpayer guarantee. But what I don&apos;t understand is your seemingly implacable desire to shrink banking for the sake of it, to stop people going into it and to corral them into other professions. I feel I need to know the psychological origins of this rage against the kulaks. Is it not time Observer readers had the full backstory of banker-bashing Will Hutton? Best, Boris Dear BorisWe&apos;ve just lived through one of the most frightening and dangerous periods of British economic life since the early 1930s. British banks \u2013 with loans five times our national output, which was on a near Icelandic scale \u2013 were days away from collapse. New Labour had presided over a bubble economy stimulated by the banks who were making pseudo, illusory profits. The aftermath \u2013 rebuilding sound banks, unravelling the hundred of billions of now largely worthless loans, consumers rebuilding their savings, lowering unemployment and getting public finances back in order \u2013 will take a decade. And it was an avoidable disaster. I welcome that we agree the case for reform \u2013 yes, let&apos;s close down any loopholes in Obama&apos;s proposals. This is what you&apos;re suggesting, isn&apos;t it? Because when I make the case, you accuse me of banker-bashing, shrinking banking for the sake of it, etc, etc. You say you want sounder banks; but you recoil from the consequences \u2013 throwing invidious charges around like confetti but trying to dodge any flak yourself. It is not a lovely sight. I am keenly aware of London&apos;s strengths beyond banks which I celebrate too, and of the structure of the London economy. But over the past decade London became disproportionately dependent on financial services. The difference between London&apos;s global pre-eminence in cultural and creative industries, health and universities and its pre-eminence in finance is that none of those have the same capacity to grow what amounted to gigantic pyramid selling schemes or ask for trillion-pound cheques when things went wrong. Capitalism is the best system yet devised to generate wealth. But when it gets too unfair it becomes dysfunctional, which is what we have witnessed. It is what I want to put right. It would be great if a politician with your flair for expression shared that aim \u2013 and its consequences. Best, Will Dear WillLet me give you an example of why we need a London banking sector that is big, dynamic and willing to experiment with new products. The recent cold weather has driven households to spend huge sums on heating, in many cases more than they can afford. It is more urgent than ever, therefore, to help people install the measures \u2013 the lagging, the insulation \u2013 that can so dramatically reduce bills and, of course, reduce emissions of CO 2. The trouble is that these measures are expensive. There are long-term savings, but there may be big upfront costs. Where do you go when you have a big upfront cost but an excellent prospect of recouping it over time? You go to a bank. We want the banks to help us come up with a financial instrument that will allow Londoners to retro-fit their homes. I want London to be at the heart of green banking, so that we create jobs not just in retro-fitting but in the financial services that make retro-fitting possible. We think the numbers look good for the banks. On the buildings that City Hall has retro-fitted, we will make money in eight years. But of course there is a risk. Perhaps \u2013 though it seems unlikely \u2013 world energy prices will collapse, and take the saving out of retrofitting. The key thing is the risk should be borne by the bank. As you rightly say, Will, the problem we face now is not so much the initial crisis as the consequences of our response. Those banks took demented risks, and though a couple went down the tubes we bailed the rest of them out. Which means they all know in their heart of hearts that they can do it again. And we agree that it is outrageous that the current round of bonuses is made possible by a taxpayer guarantee. But the solution is not to demolish the banks. The solution is to ensure that if a greedy, bonus-hungry, testosterone-fuelled banker takes a stupid risk \u2013 then he cops it, or his bank cops it, and not the taxpayer. That is why we need these people to insure themselves. Of course I accept that if this reform is mishandled it may damage the sector and lead, as you suggest, to significantly more job losses. Where we differ is in the way we would view such an outcome. You actively want to reduce the size of the banking industry, your former employer, dear Will. You relish the prospect of some sort of retribution, after the boom years of &quot;pseudo-profits&quot;. I reject that concept. These bankers didn&apos;t just invest in catastrophic sub-prime mortgages. By lending money at risk, they made possible every betterment of the human race from the iPod to new treatments for Alzheimer&apos;s. Those weren&apos;t pseudo-breakthroughs. And the staggering sums they pay in taxes \u2013 that isn&apos;t pseudo-money. Those weren&apos;t pseudo-lunches they bought and those weren&apos;t pseudo-jobs they generated in everything from building to IT to piano lessons. London&apos;s financial services industry is big because London happens to have a large share of one of the most complex, fast-growing and intellectually challenging industries in the world. That is a tribute to the inventiveness of Londoners and the attractions of the city, and I am proud to defend it. Best, Boris"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/25/church-loses-40m-in-new-york", "sentences": ["Among the big losers are Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund and California&apos;s huge state pension fund, Calpers."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-25T20:50:00Z", "title": "Stuyvesant Town gamble costs Church of England \u00a340m", "tags": ["Housing market", "Credit crunch", "Business", "New York", "US news", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "The Church of England has lost \u00a340m from a disastrous investment in a buyout of two vast Manhattan housing complexes, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, that collapsed into default after struggling under huge debts incurred at the peak of the US property bubble. Home to 25,000 people, the two redbrick housing estates comprise 56 buildings along New York&apos;s East River. Completed shortly after the second world war, they are known as one of the few remaining bastions of affordable living among the multimillion-dollar tower blocks of lower Manhattan. They were bought for $5.4bn (\u00a32.86bn then) in 2006 by a consortium led by a New York investment firm, Tishman Speyer, and the fund management group BlackRock, in the biggest US residential property deal on record. But after struggling for months to keep up repayments on loans attached to the buyout, Tishman today handed over the entire estates to its creditors, making the deal a landmark victim of the plunge in property values. Financial backers of the deal will see their investments largely wiped out. Among the big losers are Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund and California&apos;s huge state pension fund, Calpers. The church commissioners, who manage the Church of England&apos;s assets, revealed that they are writing off &quot;around \u00a340m&quot; put up for a 4% stake in Stuyvesant Town in June 2007. &quot;The commissioners are looking carefully at the lessons to be learnt from the loss, as well as from the impact of the financial crisis generally,&quot; said a spokesman for the church&apos;s financial arm, which is chaired by a former editor of the Independent, Andreas Whittam Smith. The hit amounts to less than 1% of the church&apos;s asset portfolio. But it was a large layout for a single investment and it comes on the back of other setbacks in the recession, which caused a sharp drop in the value of the church&apos;s investment portfolio from \u00a35.7bn in 2007 to \u00a34.4bn in 2008. Residents of the 11,000 flats in Stuyvesant Town were staunchly opposed to the Tishman buyout, which was highly leveraged by debt and predicated, in part, on cutting the number of tenants paying below-market rates under &quot;rent controlled&quot; deals. Popular among soldiers returning from the war when the flats were completed in 1947, the blocks, which together are the size of a small town, are surrounded by pedestrian pathways and leafy parkland. Over the past three years, Tishman has become deeply embroiled in litigation to get veteran residents to pay more rent and has even used private detectives in an attempt to catch tenants suspected of breaching leases that require them to use the flats as their primary residences. Tishman and its partners failed to make a $16m loan repayment this month. In a statement, Tishman said it had spent the last few weeks &quot;negotiating in good faith to restructure the debt and ownership&quot; of the properties but concluded that surrendering ownership was the only alternative to bankruptcy. &quot;We make this decision as we feel a battle over the property or a contested bankruptcy proceeding is not in the long-term interests of the property, its residents, our partnership or the City,&quot; said Tishman. Experts say the valuation of the estates has slumped to barely $2bn. Ben Thypin, of Real Capital Analytics in New York, said the 2006 buyout was at the &quot;height of the foolishness&quot; at the peak of the American property boom: &quot;They paid way too high a price. It was purchased at the peak of the market with too ambitious assumptions.&quot; The church commissioners, whose investments are intended to support the Church of England&apos;s running costs and pay the pensions of clergy, defended their involvement, saying Stuyvesant Town was an opportunity to diversify the church&apos;s portfolio through a partnership with a &quot;respected world-class manager and with strong international partners&quot;. The commissioners&apos; spokesman said the church carried out detailed due diligence with professional advisers but admitted: &quot;The investment was made in June 2007, which with hindsight was at the top of the property market and immediately before the credit crunch. The investment was affected by the sharp fall in residential property values, and a legal ruling that many apartment rents would continue to be regulated regardless of value or the income of residents.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jan/27/corrections-clarifications-max-mosley", "sentences": ["We stated that the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile, chaired by Max Mosley, was &quot;clearly blinded by an excessive desire for personal revenge&quot; when it excluded Mr Briatore from involvement in motor sport in connection with Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s deliberate crash in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-27T00:01:00Z", "title": "Corrections and clarifications: Max Mosley", "tags": [], "article": "Corrections made on theguardian.com on 27 January 2010 \u2022 Gylfi Sigurdsson goal keeps Reading in FA Cup at expense of Burnley was amended because the original referred to the &quot;Marie&quot; Celeste.

The economist Nouriel Roubini, known as Dr Doom, argues we should look to Spain for a truly toxic economy. Almost in the same breath he name-checks Italy, hampered by high debts and low productivity, Greece and Portugal as economies in need of life support. Other economists argue the US and Germany face a more painful decade than commonly supposed as they struggle to export their way out of recession while still struggling with massive asset price bubbles in commercial property, as yet uncovered. Yet while all these experts can argue the case for this or that western nation being more exposed than others to a double dip recession, a flight of investors, or worse, defaulting on their debts, the main message should be that all developed economies are in deep trouble and mainlining a strong cocktail of stimulating drugs just to keep going. Every western government without exception has put in place measures to artificially boost investment and consumption to protect their economies from collapse. And all have pursued their policies with varying degrees of success. The problem for them all is how to scale back the value of property assets and any other investments that are still over-inflated in value, without putting more companies out of business and more workers out of a job. Rebalancing economies and cutting government debt without creating further pain, especially for the poorest workers, is further complicated by investors who are busy creating asset bubbles across the world, in different markets, as they seek to regain some of their lost savings. Traditionally these savers were the super rich in search of further wealth. However, investors, at least those with any clout, are now pension funds and government-backed savings funds in places as far flung as the middle east, Norway, Singapore and California \u2013 in search of cheap assets that can be inflated and sold at a profit. There are currencies, commodity markets and bonds that are over-inflated simply because investors have, in their search for profit, piled in. Even the UK residential property market remains over-priced. How can a government boost its economy with cheap money, which is what most have done, while reckless investors (and that includes pension funds) insist on using it to buy assets and inflate their value. Economist Nouriel Roubini, believes these cross currents could defeat efforts at recovery. He is gloomy because asset price bubbles may persuade governments to switch off their cheap money programmes before their economies have navigated their way to safe ground. David Blanchflower, the economist and former rebel member of the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee, is of the same mind. He has consistently argued that most western economies are in a worse state than they are letting on and cheap money should remain on the table to protect companies and jobs. Bond trader Bill Gross has picked on the UK as one to avoid. But he should, by his own measure, be avoiding all western economies. For that reason, there will be demand for UK government debt, just as much as there was demand for Greek government debt and most likely every other western government&apos;s debt. Bond traders don&apos;t boycott countries, they just demand a higher interest rate. Continued demand for government bonds, however, should not disguise the battered state of most rich nations and the unhelpful lust of those people who still have assets. Their need to generate returns when the situation for everyone else is precarious can only be destabilising."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/28/haiti-fundraising-ingenious", "sentences": ["And bridge players Anna Gudge and Mark Newton have linked 90 British bridge clubs with others in Japan, Thailand, Dubai, Latvia and Singapore, for a series of simultaneous games this week \u2013 and have so far raised more than \u00a35,000."], "publicationDate": "2010-01-28T00:05:08Z", "title": "How Haiti has inspired our fundraisers", "tags": ["Haiti", "Charitable giving", "Charities", "Americas"], "article": "George Clooney has manned the phones, Jennifer Aniston has pledged $500,000, and Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis have vowed to record an intriguing version of I Put a Spell on You.

China has yet to respond to news of the agreement, thought to be the first European sale to Taiwan&apos;s armed forces since the early 90s. Taiwan&apos;s defence ministry spokesman Martin Yu said the island would buy EC-225 search-and-rescue helicopters. The $111m contract with Eurocopter, a subsidiary of EADS, is for three helicopters, with an option to buy up to 17 more. The move could fray Sino-European ties, already under strain over trade and currency issues. Yesterday China filed a complaint to the World Trade Organisation over the EU&apos;s anti-dumping tariffs on shoes. The arms deal could also affect Beijing&apos;s relations with Taipei, which have improved markedly since President Ma Ying-jeou took office on a platform of improving ties two years ago. However, others believe that China could remain silent or issue only a muted response if it is satisfied that the helicopters are not for military tasks. &quot;If it&apos;s for a pure civic purpose that would be no problem, but if it belongs to the defence ministry then I think it could be,&quot; said Jin Canrong, professor of international studies at Renmin University. The Taiwanese defence ministry said it was not an arms order and the EC-225 is a civilian model. But the Taiwanese armed forces have bought non-military helicopters in the past and customised them with equipment suited to military models. Jing Huang, an expert on Asian security and visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said China&apos;s response was likely to depend on the exact nature of the order. &quot;I would be surprised if China makes a big fuss and if Eurocopter had not considered China&apos;s interests in its sales to Taiwan,&quot; he added, pointing out that the mainland was a much bigger client. &quot;China may think it&apos;s better not to fight on two fronts [given its anger at the US deal].

China&apos;s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to questions on the helicopter sale. Calls to the Taiwan Affairs Office rang unanswered. China hit back unusually hard following last week&apos;s announcement of the US&apos;s $6.4bn arms package, which includes Patriot missiles, naval minesweepers and Black Hawk helicopters.

I sighed and let my guard down for a moment: &quot;Yes I have \u2026 yet now I find myself in a place where faith, trust and obedience don&apos;t always seem to work in the way that they should&quot;.  Jon leaned back in surprise. &quot;You mean you pray and the Lord doesn&apos;t order circumstances as you&apos;d hoped?&quot; he asked gently.  &quot;Yes I suppose so. Well, I mean, it&apos;s partly that, though there are other things I don&apos;t understand either&quot;. I found myself telling him about Emmeline and her disappointment over Adam. &quot;She thought they had been together for over two years and that he was just being wise by meeting up in groups, rather than seeing her alone&quot; I said. &quot;Yet suddenly he was engaged to Cindy following what seemed to be a short, email based courtship&quot;. &quot;Grace \u2013 listen to me&quot; Jon leaned across the table. &quot;You come from a godly missionary family so you can understand. Many western Christians allow the world to creep into their thinking. They are influenced by immorality in Hollywood films so they want to experience love and romance \u2026 so there are so many wrong relationships. Love and romance is not God&apos;s primary plan for marriage.&quot;  He spoke as if he had considered these things for a very long time in solitude: &quot;Many people say they are Christian \u2026 but they are not really! Also those who are Christian can get beguiled and go astray because of wrong relationship.&quot; He was trying to keep his voice down now with a visible effort &quot;Christians need to look for the most suitable person for them, get married and work hard at it. Who knows \u2026 maybe love and romance follow, maybe not. But love is a choice&quot; A girl at the next table looked round sharply. Jon stiffened and whispered again &quot;This is why many countries have arranged marriages&quot;. I didn&apos;t know what to say. I said I needed to get to my next class. We finished our cooled soup and left. As we walked, towards class Jon continued telling me of people he had tried to rescue from enslaving passions. &quot;The Lord told us to be fishers of men but many fish drop back into the river of iniquity. One fish I caught \u2026 her name was Judith \u2026 sadly dropped off the end of my fishing rod. She met a very, very handsome man \u2026 he looked like movie star!&quot; he said loudly and excitedly &quot;After that, she was with him all the time and did not go to Church any longer. She was beguiled, Grace: beguiled by passion and superficiality.&quot;. He stopped, and I stopped too. He looked at me intently under the fluorescent strip light of the corridor. &quot;Why do you wear make-up? You don&apos;t need it: you could have been movie star \u2013 but you gave it all up for the Lord!&quot; I scurried into my next class unsure whether to be flattered. I could still see his face pressed against the glass as I took my seat. Eventually he waved, smiled and went on his way (presumably to continue writing about George Eliot&apos;s fall into sin). I felt very flat. Verity, I always thought if someone was the right person, God would put love in both hearts and that you used that as a guide, together with observing the character of the person and knowing that you both had the same spiritual vision and purpose. (Must get some sleep now, though I&apos;m anxious. I&apos;m almost certain I don&apos;t want to see Jon again as he scares me and I feel under pressure and scrutiny. However, the thought that keeps recurring is that perhaps this is God&apos;s provision for me, though I do sincerely hope it&apos;s not \u2026) Saturday evening Verity, I have had such a strange time since I last wrote to you. On Friday I received a six page letter from Jon. He wrote: &quot;I&apos;d like us to continue meeting for fellowship as friends. Then after short time, we will begin proper courtship but there will be no physical contact! Then after the long summer break, in September, I will ask you to be my wife. We will have short engagement, still with no physical contact, until we are joined in holy, conjugal bliss&quot;. I got into such a panic that I phoned Emmeline, who is in the midst of a drama herself (I will tell you about that in my next letter). She was very concerned and suggested I tell Mr and Mrs Barron. I took her advice but they are already very fond of Jon, having known him for some years through their son and are delighted at this development. Maybe I&apos;ve got the problem \u2026? In fact Odele, a French friend told me of a case in her home Church, where a lady was approached by a brother that she really was not attracted to in any way. She just couldn&apos;t imagine that this was God&apos;s will for her. When I asked what happened, Odele explained &quot;She became bulimic until she understood that it was him that was intended for her; She married him and was cured&quot; she added flatly. I must sign off now Verity. Maeve has invited me and Emmeline to a &quot;retro music evening&quot; next week which she assures me will be completely harmless. I&apos;d like to go along for a change of scene but won&apos;t mention it to anyone in case they have weak consciences. Please don&apos;t worry Mum and Dad with anything I&apos;ve told you.

She&apos;d been bombed out in the war and she was still there when she died and I was 14. The other grandmother used to rotate \u2013 state visits \u2013 so I absorbed, almost subconsciously, that the \u00adfamily was not just Mum, Dad and two \u00adchildren. This influenced the \u00adattitude I took towards my own mother: she nursed her mother, she cared for my \u00adfather and after he died she came to live with me until she died at 95. Apart from a bit of war work, she was a full-time wife and mother. She did the most important job on earth. If she&apos;d had her choice, I&apos;d have married and had children \u2013 had a &quot;normal&quot; life. She was a very kind soul who \u00adalways helped other people. I really did \u00adadmire her. From my father, I got drive and ambition. From my mother, I got a fairly charitable nature. My father was in the admiralty and he rose to a very senior position. He was very formidable; a bit grumpy, but I loved him dearly. Neither my brother Malcolm nor I were ever smacked by him, but he had a good line in shouting. My brother is 10 years older than me. Prewar and postwar or as he would say, quality and utility. We really \u00adbecame closer when we were older. I always used to plague my mother about having a sister. My father wouldn&apos;t have any children during the war: he said there was too much going on. My mother always said bringing me up was a tiring business, which I \u00adbelieve. For instance, when we lived in Singapore, the Chinese staff used to leave their slippers at the bottom of the steps. Every night, I used to go and remove their slippers. I stopped being tiresome at about 14. I&apos;d left home in my 20s and apart from briefly going in for flat-sharing, hadn&apos;t lived with anyone at all until my 50s. My mother came to live with me precisely because we did get on. I was shadow home secretary, and she wasn&apos;t quite prepared for what she found. When she first came to live with me, I thought I was having a second \u00adadolescence: my clothes would be hanging up; she&apos;d make me a cup of tea. She lived with me for eight years, and we were a bit like sisters. I remember taking her to a Conservative ball and sharing lipsticks; it was great fun. The whole family was religious. \u00adBelieving in God was something I took as much for granted as the air I breathed. Religion wasn&apos;t something that came out of a box on Sunday. We&apos;re a close-knit family. I think every\u00adone should have a maiden aunt, or a bachelor uncle: they take you out and spoil you, and then they hand you back. I&apos;ve got grown-up nieces and nephews, and great-nieces and great-nephews. I like being a great-aunt. I think a sense of family, of commitment to family, and of helping each other and standing by each other, are essential. I pity anyone who doesn&apos;t grow up with that. Not having a family of my own was a matter of \u00adindifference. I didn&apos;t consciously reject marriage. If Mr Right had come along, I&apos;d probably have married and you&apos;d never have heard of Ann Widdecombe. But families have informed my writing. People say, how can you write so well about families? I say: &quot;You silly ass.

The relationship was already effective and smooth on trade, Taiwan and global warning. With two firm multilateralists, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, now in power, it would be positively strengthened and constructive, the official mouthpiece opined. How different the picture looks today \u2013 and how wounded the official tone. China sent a deputy foreign minister to negotiate with Mr Obama in Copenhagen, scuppering the deal that not just the US but many other countries wanted. Next came the cyber-attacks on Google. Then the White House approved a decision to sell patriot missiles to Taiwan, announced that Mr Obama would meet the Dalai Lama and lectured China on its overvalued currency. Forget the metaphor of resetting relations, which the US used recently with Russia. Hardly a month goes by when the US and China can resist pushing each other&apos;s buttons. Is China&apos;s assertiveness and Mr Obama&apos;s hardened attitude all down to economics \u2013 to the former&apos;s impressive performance during the global recession and the latter&apos;s much weaker one? Economists reckon the Chinese currency, which has remained at the same value since July 2008, is undervalued by 25% to 40%. Even on the lower figure, the effect of a correction on the currencies of neighbours like Malaysia, \u00adSingapore, and Taiwan would be major and would collectively help cut the US deficit by $100bn and create 700,000 jobs. \u00adReopening the battle with China over its currency is not a bad move, therefore, as Mr Obama faces difficult midterm elections in November. Both the US and China are trying to power their way forward with export booms and each requires a low valuation of its currency to do that. But politics matter too. China&apos;s foreign policy has become more assertive as nationalism becomes dominant. For all the lip service to multilateralism, China is more hostile to sanctions on Iran than Russia. A nationalist China is, however, more tied into the global economy than ever before. Two-thirds of China&apos;s $2.4 trillion currency reserves are held in dollars. If it dumped the US treasury bonds and shares in which these dollars are invested, China could trigger a collapse of the dollar, and world markets, and another global recession. To whom would China be able to export then? Certainly not to the US or the EU. China&apos;s key economic interest lies in continuing to fund US debt. So there are limits to the current US-China jousting. Each is repainting its red lines and stepping over the other&apos;s. But at some point national interest says this must stop.

Manager, Mark Carpenter, has spent the closed period selling properties so that the fund has enough cash to meet selling requests from investors, and is confident it can meet these while maintaining a cash buffer of between 15% and 20% - large enough to cope with a future rush of redemptions. At its peak the fund was worth \u00a3700m; now it is less than \u00a3300m and has just 12 properties across six countries. To put this in context, M&amp;G&apos;s UK property fund has invested almost that much in the last six months alone. So should investors stick with the fund? They have certainly suffered during the lock-in. While other property funds have grown by an average of 11% over the last year - and the best, from specialists such as Scottish Widows and Aviva, are up 48% and 30% respectively - New Star&apos;s has fallen 31%, according to figures from Trustnet. However, unlike New Star, these funds invest predominantly, if not exclusively, in UK commercial property, which has rebounded sharply in the last few months, having suffered steep falls since the market high in 2007. Indeed, the property funds monitored by industry specialist IPD registered a record return of 10.4% in the last quarter of 2009. Some specialists warn such dramatic rises cannot continue. Fiona Rowley, manager of M&amp;G&apos;s property fund, said the recovery was due to property being oversold in 2009, and that it has been concentrated in prime properties in good locations with blue-chip tenants. It is also predicated on a gradual recovery in the economy. She believes the best is now over and warns of further falls if economic growth is worse than expected. Property funds will return to their tradition of providing most of their returns through yield, rather than capital growth, she added. So what hope for improved performance at the New Star fund? Carpenter points out its core markets are in continental Europe (30% of the fund&apos;s assets) and Asia (70%), which have not endured as sharp a downturn as the UK property market and are lagging the recovery here. He believes there are good prospects for growth and is keen on Spain, Germany and the Nordic countries in Europe, plus Australia and Singapore in Asia.Indeed, Carpenter is optimistic the fund will attract money from investors, rather than be handing their cash back. &quot;It is our ambition to grow, and quite dramatically,&quot; he said. Since the fund was launched in June 2007, New Star has been acquired by Henderson, which has a team of 190 staff managing almost \u00a310bn of property, which means Carpenter has a big team to consult. His fund is also one of few ways for investors to get access to overseas property directly because most international funds buy shares in property companies, rather than buildings, which perform more in line with stock markets. But the small size of the fund makes it risky. If one property plunges in valuation it will have a big impact on the fund. The yield, estimated at 3.1% when it reopens, is in line with its peers. Ben Yearsley, an investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there is no need to rush into property but adds that the Threadneedle UK Property fund is the best bet. Those who want international exposure would be better off in a fund which buys shares, such as Fidelity Global Property or M&amp;G Global Real Estate."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/feb/09/tim-etchells-performance-cambodia", "sentences": ["Based in Singapore, Keng Sen&apos;s Theatre Works outfit has been\u00a0running these exchanges \u2013 predominantly Asian in focus, but with routes out in all directions \u2013 for something like 10 years.", "To call this latter group diverse would be an understatement: our trip saw passports from Indonesia, Slovenia, Turkey, South Africa, India, UK, Lebanon, Singapore, USA and\u00a0Austria, among others, landing on the immigration desk in Phnom Penh."], "publicationDate": "2010-02-09T15:57:34Z", "title": "Tim Etchells on performance: Cambodia's beat goes on", "tags": ["Dance", "Theatre", "Stage", "Heritage", "Culture", "Cambodia", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "I&apos;ve recently returned from two weeks in Cambodia,\u00a0travelling with 18 other artists, dancers, choreographers and performance-makers at the invitation of Ong Keng Sen&apos;s Flying Circus Project. Based in Singapore, Keng Sen&apos;s Theatre Works outfit has been\u00a0running these exchanges \u2013 predominantly Asian in focus, but with routes out in all directions \u2013 for something like 10 years. The intention varies with each incarnation, but the broad hope\u00a0is for a two-way artistic exchange between invited and local artists, and between the invited artists themselves. To call this latter group diverse would be an understatement: our trip saw passports from Indonesia, Slovenia, Turkey, South Africa, India, UK, Lebanon, Singapore, USA and\u00a0Austria, among others, landing on the immigration desk in Phnom Penh. Highly organised and efficient on one hand, Flying Circus also courts a creative openness that at times borders on chaos. The logic for Keng Sen is that the encounter must have its own energy, that the group itself must conjure something new from the situation. An approach like this takes time and nerve, but it undoubtedly pays off. Looking back, it&apos;s hard to say what made the biggest impression on me. The country itself remains blighted by poverty, and still in recovery from the devastation of the Pol Pot era and subsequent years of civil war and instability. Culturally, there&apos;s a determined attempt to recover what the Khmer Rouge tried to wipe out in its brutal five-year drive to Year Zero, which involved \u2013 alongside much else \u2013 killing intellectuals, artists, teachers and anyone who spoke French. For this reason, there&apos;s much talk of archives, of remembering and preserving. Around 300 feature films were made in Cambodia before 1975, of which as few as 30 now survive. They have been gathered in the last five years and preserved along with other film, sound and photographic materials at the Bophana archive in Phnom Penh, our base for half of the workshops. The situation is equally dire in the performing arts, since only a handful of classical Khmer dancers survived the killing fields. These old masters are now a precious resource, teaching new generations techniques that otherwise would have slipped away for good. Back home in England, I generally run a mile from people attempting to rescue traditional forms; but in Cambodia, the initiative made more sense \u2013 the difference, perhaps, between a past that is dying from irrelevance or lack of interest, and one that has only recently survived assassination. What I sensed in the younger artists and dancers we worked with, though, was a desire to move forwards with the past, and not to retreat into it. These Cambodian twentysomethings are savvy and hungry, and well aware that their country is opening up, and that internationally financed redevelopment and tourism have been following the inflow of NGOs. They know that they&apos;ll need new approaches in the arts, and new political voices to meet the challenges ahead. I asked Keng Sen what he feared the most from his project. We talked about economic and political dangers (artists as the vanguard for property developers) and about the cultural dangers (Cambodians caught in retreading western postmodern art practice). Then we talked about the positives: the meetings, the collisions, the insistence on and the articulation of differences. There was one moment in the workshops that crystallised these possibilities for me. Tarek Atoui, Lebanese sound artist, ran a session with the Khmer participants that involved sounds collected by the dancers played out from a laptop and a complex array of homemade sensors, motion triggers and pressure pads. It was late in the afternoon when the dancers from Amrita Performing Arts, our hosts for half of the project, took to their feet and began to move in and around Atoui&apos;s machinery. What happened was tentative at first, then suddenly too much. It was as if the dancers wanted to play the system, or make music with it, rather than dance with it. My heart sank. Then all at once they turned a corner and were dancing again \u2013 the turning wrists and fingers, lowered centres of gravity, eye contact, pantomime pauses and forward rolls all instantly recognisable from Khmer classical forms. They weren&apos;t dancing for the electronics, nor were they dancing with them exactly; they were dancing with and against them, entering and refusing, insisting on and moving through. There was tension in the dancing and music that afternoon, just as there should be on occasions of meeting. It was a privilege and an inspiration to be there."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/11/wired-uk-debut-circulation", "sentences": ["The magazine has launched local versions in Brazil and India and plans launches in France, Spain, Singapore, the Philippines and Argentina."], "publicationDate": "2010-02-11T13:36:00Z", "title": "Wired UK posts debut circulation of nearly 50,000", "tags": ["ABCs", "Magazines", "Consumer magazines", "Conde Nast", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "article": "Wired UK, the glossy technology magazine that launched in April last year recorded a debut circulation of 48,275 in the second half of 2009, the Audit Bureau of Circulations said today.

Radio Times, New!, Reveal, Front, Private Eye, Heat, Women &amp; Home, Esquire and BBC Focus were also among the titles that recorded rising circulations in the traditionally more robust second-half of the year compared with the previous six months, raising hopes that the industry may be weathering the recession. The BBC Magazines managing director, Peter Phippen, was optimistic. He said: &quot;We are absolutely thrilled with our performance in the past six months. &quot;The recession has had an impact on our ad revenues, which have certainly been hit. For our sales both at the newsstand and in terms of subscriptions there really isn&apos;t any discernible impact at all.&quot; &quot;Unlike most sectors of the economy there&apos;s no evidence there has been any reduction in demand for our magazines at all.&quot; Richard Desmond&apos;s New! gossip magazine leapt 35.6% year on year to sell 600,741 copies each week, a 50.1% jump on the first half of 2009. That made it the sixth-biggest circulating magazine in the country \u2013 and in the process it leapfrogged its stable mate OK!, which sold 588,546, up 15.7% year on year. The good figures were due in part to cut-price sales and multipacking \u2013 combining two titles together and selling them at a premium. The New! editor, Kirsty Tyler, said: &quot;We consistently deliver great exclusives for our readers and the fact that we&apos;re now number one is testament to the hard work and dedication not just of our team but also of our fantastic celebrity columnists.

BBC Magazine&apos;s Radio Times bounced back in the past six months to climb back over the 1m barrier. It sold 1,000,648, up 3.6% on the first half of 2009 but down 2.2% on the year. In men&apos;s magazines, Men&apos;s Health was stable at 250,577, while Bauer&apos;s FHM arrested its decline to record an average monthly sale of 231,235, down 1.6% on the first half but down 15.2% on the year. Private Eye had a circulation of 210,218, up 3.4% on the year \u2013 and an 18-year high. Its editor, Ian Hislop, said: &quot;The Eye&apos;s circulation figures are like John Terry&apos;s shorts. In the past they may have been down \u2013 but now they are firmly up again&quot; The National Magazine Company had a slew of good results. And while rivals hit out at the company for multipacking tactics , NatMags denied the practice was responsible for its solid performance. Among NatMags&apos; best performers was Reveal, where circulation soared by 22.6% year on year to 330,911 \u2013 a rise of 4.8% on the first six months of 2009 and welcome news for its new editor, Jane Ennis. Former Best and Now editor Ennis took over at Reveal in October. The Vogue publisher, Stephen Quinn, fired a salvo last week in anticipation of NatMags title Harper&apos;s Bazaar&apos;s improved circulation. He said: &quot;Fashion upstart Harper&apos;s Bazaar dances with the fishes by offering value packs at UK news stands to bolster sales. &quot;This packaging of inappropriate titles such as She and Coast with Harper&apos;s Bazaar, bundled in plastic bags, will allow Bazaar to boost their numbers in the forthcoming ABCs. Without these inappropriate value packs to boost sales, the ABC posted by Bazaar would show a greatly reduced total.&quot; Saga magazine, which jumped the gun on its ABC release before the strictly midday embargo, said its circulation rose to 655,728, up less than 1% on the year and the preceding period. Reader&apos;s Digest, whose future in the UK is under a cloud due to its massive pension liability and where editor-in-chief Gill Hudson took over in August after leaving Radio Times, had an average headline circulation of 465,028, down 22.8% on the year and down 14.1% on the first half. Britain&apos;s oldest women&apos;s weekly, The Lady, which had a full colour revamp last year before Rachel Johnson took over as editor in July, enjoyed circulation growth of 9.3% on the year to 28,782 copies a week. BBC travel magazine Lonely Planet was up 10.7% to 45,052, with 92% of circulation actively purchased. &quot;Our ambition is to become the biggest actively purchased travel magazine in the UK and then globally,&quot; Phippen said. The magazine has launched local versions in Brazil and India and plans launches in France, Spain, Singapore, the Philippines and Argentina. Sky Magazine remained the biggest distributed magazine in the country, going to 7,423,570 BSkyB subscribers. Magazines recording a debut ABC figure included free women&apos;s magazine Stylist, with 410,674. Paid-for magazines making their ABC debut included BBC Who Do You Think You Are?, selling 20,266 copies an issue, H Bauer&apos;s Eat In, selling 22,173, BBC Waybuloo with 38,908, Triathlete&apos;s World with 13,062 and 220 Triathlon with 21,210.

An installation of four banners by the Chinese artist Ko Siu Lan on the exterior of the Beaux-Arts building in central Paris featured the words &quot;earn&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, &quot;work&quot; and &quot;more&quot; as a play on Sarkozy&apos;s phrase &quot;Work more to earn more&quot;. The now notorious slogan was used by the president when he ran for election in 2007. In a country reeling from recession, it has since become a symbol of what critics say are his rightwing agenda&apos;s failures.

Promethean, based in Blackburn, makes a range of hi-tech educational kit, including whiteboards and handheld classroom devices for children, and is expected to confirm next week \u2013 possibly as early as Monday \u2013 that it is pressing the button on an initial public offer likely to value the business at up to \u00a3500m. Advisers to the company, which is chaired by Graham Howe, co-founder of mobile phone company Orange, are understood to have sounded out potential investors and the reaction has encouraged the firm to go ahead despite volatile market conditions. Although Promethean is backed by Apax, which invested in 2004, unlike other companies with private equity investors who have abandoned their IPOs in the last three days \u2013 New Look, Travelport and Merlin Entertainment \u2013 Promethean has not been saddled with massive debts. Apax is expected to sell its entire stake, which will be worth \u00a3100m-\u00a3125m. Promethean has carved itself a profitable niche in the educational technology sector and is second in the whiteboard market behind Canada&apos;s Smart Technologies. It leads the embryonic market for handheld classroom devices for pupils. The company also has an online community of more than half a million teachers worldwide who use its portal \u2013 Promethean Planet \u2013 to swap lesson plans and teaching tips. They can also download paid-for lesson plans. Profits almost doubled to \u00a326m in 2008. Last year&apos;s accounts have yet to be published. While 70% of classrooms in the UK have whiteboards, penetration is far lower in the US at about 30%, and some European countries, such as Spain, are only now starting to invest in the technology. Promethean has been expanding overseas and now has about 80% of its business outside the UK with offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, the US and in Europe. It is being advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Cazenove on its flotation. The company was founded just over a decade ago by Tony Cann, now vice-chairman, who owns just over 50% of the business. Howe and chief executive Jean-Yves Charlier, former boss of Colt Telecom, hold about 10% between them.

The Fiver has always believed in the primacy of glory, and not only in the morning as we stagger blindly out of our bedroom and into the eyeline of our horrified housemates. Glory is what children get into football for; to win trophies and script stories for the grandchildren. And the Fiver, as always, is thinking of the children. Particularly after it was exclusively revealed in your exclusive daily exclusive Guardian that the Premier League is considering setting up a play-off system for the final Big Cup place. Nihilo sanctum estne? The system, which would need the approval of 14 of the league&apos;s 20 teams, would involve the sides who finish between fourth and seventh. The Champions League was already about as aptly named as Tim Lovejoy; now it could potentially include a team that finishes below the team that finishes below the team that finishes below the team that finishes below the team that finishes below the team that wins the competition. There is also a palpable absence of justice - in 2007-08, for instance, there were 18 points between Liverpool in fourth and Blackburn in seventh; and as keen as we are to live through another outbreak of indignant frothing on Merseyside, that just isn&apos;t fair. Nor is it an isolated case: in 2001-02 there was an 18-point gap between Newcastle in fourth and West Ham in seventh. After the laughable proposal for a 39th game a couple of years ago (and really, these play-offs will be games 39, 40 and 41, probably played in Asia, or in the back garden of the Big Brother house, or on a bouncy castle), we look forward to the other innovations the Premier League will come up with. A play-off between the top four to decide who are champions? Away goals counting double if they&apos;re scored from outside the area on a Tuesday? Football on ice? Each team required to include either Adrian Chiles or Christine Bleakley in the starting XI? A relegation play-off played in an airless cage with a marmot placed inside the jockstrap of each player?

I spent the summer picking and eating peaches and fishing with the locals. Net result: minimum ecological damage, maximum cultural exchange, and a tad fewer octopuses in the Mediterranean. In today&apos;s terms, this was as green as travel gets. Now you can get to Gumusluk in a few hours and spend a month there without hearing a word of Turkish. The fish may come from Singapore, the\u00a0hotels are owned by the British, the\u00a0villas by the Dutch, and the yachts that call in are in the million-dollar bracket. The place has changed unimaginably in a generation and, as one of the village&apos;s first tourists, I hold my hand up. Had I known then what I know now, should I have gone? Yes. Green travel is not just what happens at the destination, or indeed how you get there. It does not demand that you eschew air travel altogether or hotels or comfort, or that your holiday is within 10 miles of your home. Rather, it asks you to pack your brain as well as your swimsuit, and to assess and then act on the impact of your visit. At its best, it&apos;s kind to both place and people, and rewards the host as much as the tourist. It is mostly small-scale, unique and personal. It certainly appeals to the intellectually curious, the ecologically and socially responsible, and to the politically aware. It seeks to add to the sum of knowledge and improve, or at least not harm, the natural world. It can be on the other side of the world or down your road, in a forest or in the city. Even flying can be justifiable, if you take a plane only occasionally and are sensible about it. The golden rule must be that if our actions hurt in one way, then we should compensate in another. Dave Martin, who helps run community-owned Bulungula Lodge in South Africa, argues that rather than cutting out flying, we should be selective about where we visit. Africa is the least polluting continent on Earth but most needs the income, jobs and good development that inspired tourism brings. &quot;Cancel your holidays to the rich world and save up for a worthwhile holiday to the developing world,&quot; he says. At its worst, green travel is a cynical lie, told by travel agents, tour operators, airlines and cruise lines claiming to be green but actually peddling mass, crass tourism. It has been used to cover any encounter with indigenous peoples, any foray into a forest or trip by bicycle. Happily that is changing. Hotels used to call themselves green if they offered not to change the towels every day; these days, people demand evidence of real commitment to community, place and the environment. That is exactly what the 75 companies in Guardian Green Travel List do. Some cater for the adventurous, others for those who like their creature comforts. But they are phenomenally diverse; some are community-run, others are owned by international hotel chains. They range from the English Midlands to the deepest jungle of Ecuador. When I finally left Gumusluk, I was asked if I would like to buy the 15 empty homes at the end of the village for about \u00a350 each. &quot;But why would anyone need 15 homes overlooking the Mediterranean?&quot; I said. That may have been the beginning of wisdom, but it was the end of a possible career in green property development.

Swingeing cuts in university and research budgets will force the most talented British scientists to find jobs in the US, Singapore and other countries that are continuing to invest in science throughout the global recession, said Ralph Cicerone, president of the US National Academy of Sciences at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Diego yesterday. In December the UK government announced cuts worth \u00a3600m in university and research budgets, but whichever party wins the general election in May, deeper cuts are expected to follow. News of the cuts announced last year was met with dismay from scientists, particularly in the face of repeated reassurances from Gordon Brown that the science budget was &quot;ring-fenced&quot; and of critical importance to the UK as it emerges from the global downturn. &quot;You might not see anything immediately, but you will begin to see a movement of scientists over time. They will go to where the opportunities are, to the US and to places like Singapore that have invested heavily in science, and are hiring from all over the world,&quot; said Cicerone. Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, revealed in his pre-Budget report in December that there will be a substantial reduction in the higher education, science and research budgets between 2011 and 2013. The Conservative science spokesman, Adam Afriyie, has said major science budget cuts are &quot;inevitable&quot; regardless of which party wins the forthcoming election. The cuts have raised concerns among the Russel Group of large research-intensive universities that they will no longer be able to compete with other top-ranking universities around the world. They also come as leading academic centres in the US are being supported by stimulus funds, some of which are being used specifically to attract foreign students and qualified scientists. Professor Cicerone&apos;s comments were backed by Peter Agre, winner of the 2003 Nobel prize for chemistry and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. &quot;The politicians that are going to be cutting funding and discouraging young scientists can thank themselves for damaging a generation of science, not just science next year. And that isn&apos;t a political statement, that&apos;s the reality,&quot; Professor Agre said. &quot;When we have booms in scientific funding, young people devote their careers to this, and then we have busts and they can&apos;t afford to pay the rent and they are forced to quit. And when they quit, they&apos;re extinct \u2013 they quit forever,&quot; he added. &quot;The nations that fund science are investing in the future, but those that cut funding are hoping for the best.&quot; Professor Agre said Singapore, which has no natural resources , is thriving as a science-based economy and is likely to pull further ahead in economic hard times."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/feb/23/fernando-alonso-interview-ferrari-formula-one", "sentences": ["And last year, even more damagingly, it was proved that Alonso&apos;s team-mate at Renault, Nelson Piquet Jr, had crashed his car deliberately at the 2008 Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2010-02-23T07:00:02Z", "title": "Fernando Alonso: 'My father was right \u2013 Ferrari gives you a special feeling'", "tags": ["Fernando Alonso", "Ferrari", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Renault", "Lewis Hamilton", "Flavio Briatore", "Sport"], "article": "At the end of another draining day Fernando Alonso has one last gauntlet to face. As the winter sun fades across an empty track at Jerez, an hour south of Seville, a \u00adchattering throng of men and women huddle outside the Ferrari garage. They are Italian and Spanish; and their fervour is uniform. When the door finally opens, and the two-time world champion and new star of Ferrari emerges, they engulf him. Alonso has worked relentlessly all day, \u00ad completing 132 laps of testing in a car that has encouraged many bookmakers to install him as a narrow favourite to win this year&apos;s drivers&apos; championship. Yet his walk to the Ferrari motorhome looks more taxing. The 28-year-old smiles politely, stopping every few steps to accept an embrace from a Spanish supporter or to have his photograph taken alongside an entranced Italian fan, but his relief is obvious when he escapes. In an office tucked away at the back of Ferrari&apos;s gleaming enclave, Alonso shakes his head. He might have won \u00adsuccessive titles for Renault \u2013 in 2005 and 2006 \u2013 and been subsequently embroiled in the &quot;Spygate&quot; and &quot;Crashgate&quot; \u00adcontroversies that scarred \u00adFormula One, but driving for Ferrari is an unusually intense experience. &quot;My father always told me this would happen,&quot; Alonso remembers. &quot;He said, &apos;If you race for Ferrari then you can retire. Your life is complete.&apos; So after I won my two championships for Renault I said, &apos;I&apos;m happy now \u2013 my career is complete.&apos; And he said, &apos;No, no, if you drive for Ferrari people will forget the championships. They will remember you as a Ferrari driver.&apos; I said, &apos;OK, Papa, we&apos;ll see.&apos; Now I think he was right. Ferrari gives you a special feeling.&quot; A low-key day of testing offers only a fleeting snapshot of all that awaits Alonso when the new season starts two weeks on Sunday in Bahrain. At least he is suitably equipped to withstand the scrutiny, for he has galvanised a previously non-existent Spanish zeal for Formula One. His fame now prevents him from living in Spain but Alonso derives real pride from the fact that 36,400 fans watched him dominate a routine practice day at Valencia this month, outnumbering those who had attended last year&apos;s Turkish grand prix. &quot;It was a hard battle when I started,&quot; Alonso says. &quot;There was nothing. When I raced at Minardi in my first year [2001] my family had to watch me on German TV. In Spain there were no TV rights for Formula One. Now I think the attention on me here will go up even more. But the biggest difficulty will be outside Spain. When I race in Australia or Korea or Japan I know it will be a big change for me because Ferrari fans are worldwide. It&apos;s very nice if you win but it&apos;s not so good if you lose. All this is part of being a Ferrari driver.&quot; Alonso believes his bruising experience in 2007, when partnering an apparently favoured rookie in Lewis Hamilton at McLaren, will help him to adapt to \u00adFerrari&apos;s pressurised environment. &quot;2007 was very difficult but I learnt a lot personally. It was good for my career to take that step of\u00a0joining them and growing up. I learnt how to work with a team and also to \u00adwithstand the media pressure. The difficulties I had were coming from the team and the media. Now I am much more prepared for everything in Formula One \u2013 and in life as well. &quot;But at the time McLaren and Ferrari were fighting each other and it was very close. In the end I think we had the better car but we finished \u00adsecond and third [with Hamilton and Alonso both just one point behind Ferrari&apos;s Kimi Raikkonen]. Unfortunately we did something wrong.&quot; Bitter infighting cost McLaren the championship, while an engineer&apos;s appropriation of technical data from Ferrari almost brought down the entire company. &quot;With the spy history I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,&quot; Alonso says. &quot;But I was very happy to help the FIA discover everything.&quot; As a result McLaren were excluded from that season&apos;s constructors&apos; championship and were fined a record $100m. And last year, even more damagingly, it was proved that Alonso&apos;s team-mate at Renault, Nelson Piquet Jr, had crashed his car deliberately at the 2008 Singapore grand prix. That blatant \u00adcheating forced the introduction of a safety car, and Alonso was the unwitting \u00adbeneficiary as he went on to win the race. Alonso&apos;s position was muddied further by the fact that Flavio Briatore, Renault&apos;s team principal, was his manager. Briatore has just won an appeal against his permanent expulsion from the sport but Alonso agrees that &quot;it was a bad season for F1 last year&quot;. He adds: &quot;Crashgate was not easy. Flavio is a friend. I have been working with him many years now. So for all the [legal] decisions that go well for him I am happy. But I don&apos;t know everything about his case.&quot; Does he expect Briatore to return to the sport? Alonso looks down and shrugs. &quot;I have no idea.&quot; Surely he was shocked that Briatore, Renault&apos;s chief engineer, Pat Symonds, and Piquet could resort to such squalid and dangerous tactics? &quot;It is in the past,&quot; Alonso murmurs evasively. But Felipe Massa, his new team-mate at Ferrari, remains mortified that the debacle cost him the 2008 drivers&apos; title by a single point. Has he discussed the implications of Crashgate with Massa? &quot;No,&quot; Alonso says. That answer is predictable \u2013 especially against a typically gossipy Formula One backdrop which implies that the relationship between Alonso and Massa is strained. &quot;People are only writing these things because they know we are very strong. Felipe and I work for the team.&quot; They have, however, had many fierce battles in the past. &quot;I have the same with everybody else,&quot; he smiles. &quot;After so many years of course I have battled with Felipe. It&apos;s the way it is \u2013 and we&apos;ll keep having these fights. But Michael Schumacher and [Nico] Rosberg will have fights at Mercedes. I am sure Lewis and Jenson Button will have fights. Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel will have fights at Red Bull \u2013 in fact they were fighting last year already. But no one talks about this. They talk about it with Ferrari because we are in a good position.&quot; Button, like Alonso, arrived at McLaren as the reigning world champion and it is easy to imagine tensions between him and Hamilton. &quot;We&apos;ll see,&quot; Alonso says. &quot;Obviously I don&apos;t know how McLaren is now but if he arrived in my time then, for sure, it would be very tough for him. But, hopefully, it&apos;s now better for Jenson because I learned a lot from that season and McLaren did as well.&quot; The return of Schumacher will be as intriguing a sub-plot as the rivalries within McLaren and Ferrari. &quot;I was very surprised when I first heard Michael was coming back. But our lives are so intense that when you are at home it&apos;s difficult to get used to a normal life. So if you get an opportunity to come back after three years maybe you can&apos;t say no. And it&apos;s true that since Michael left I haven&apos;t won any championships. So hopefully this is a good sign for me. Maybe there is some relationship between Michael and my success.&quot; Alonso&apos;s good humour can be attributed to the fact that he believes his Ferrari is the best car he has ever driven \u2013 and that he has escaped a dispiriting situation at Renault where, last year, he finished a distant ninth in the championship. &quot;I knew I was only fighting for seventh or eighth but it was important to learn from that. I have no doubt I am a better driver now.&quot; He is also stimulated by his outside interest in creating a new Tour de France team with his friend Alberto Contador, who won the race in 2007 and 2009. &quot;It&apos;s a project for me \u2013 a kind of dream I have because I love cycling. Creating a top team and being in a position to win the Tour de France will give me a nice feeling. But I know it is not easy to create a top team from zero. You need good riders, good staff, a lot of preparation and, most important, a lot of sponsors. So I don&apos;t think we are in the right moment to start a project like this, because of the world economy.&quot; Would he wait until he has retired from Formula One before he attempts to fulfil his Tour fantasy? &quot;No, it can happen at the same time. It is something Alberto and I can work on. As I said I&apos;m very open. I know this year he is with Astana but from next year onwards, for sure, if there is an opportunity I will be very interested. I think he will be interested as well.&quot; Did he train alongside the remorseless Contador in the winter? &quot;He invited me to train with him a couple of times but I was always trying to have something else to do that day! I trained with the Olympic champion Samuel S\u00e1nchez, who is from my city [Ovideo], and with some of \u00adAlberto&apos;s team\u2011mates from Astana.&quot; Before he can chase down a possible Tour triumph as a team director, Alonso looks ready for the most absorbing Formula One season in years. &quot;I expect Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes and Red Bull to be big contenders. But we are very happy where we are at Ferrari.&quot; Even some British bookmakers have made him favourite for the title, ahead of the last two world champions in Hamilton and Button. Would it be wise to put a bet on him? Alonso laughs and stretches out his hand. &quot;Put the money on me now\u2026&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/26/antarctica-iceberg-global-ocean-circulation", "sentences": ["In 2007, a iceberg roughly the size of Singapore broke off from the Pine Island glacier in west Antarctica."], "publicationDate": "2010-02-26T12:19:58Z", "title": "Giant Antarctic iceberg could affect global ocean circulation", "tags": ["Glaciers", "Antarctica", "Oceans", "Marine life", "Environment", "Science", "World news", "Polar regions", "Water"], "article": "An iceberg the size of Luxembourg that contains enough fresh water to supply a third of the world&apos;s population for a year has broken off in the Antarctic continent, with possible implications for global ocean circulation, scientists said today. The iceberg, measuring about 50 miles by 25, broke away from the Mertz glacier around 2,000 miles south of Australia after being rammed by another giant iceberg known as B-9B three weeks ago, satellite images reveal. The two icebergs, which both weigh more than 700m tons, are now drifting close together about 100 miles north of Antarctica. Rob Massom, a senior scientist at the Australian Antarctic Division and the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre in Hobart, Tasmania, said the location of the icebergs could affect global ocean circulation and had important implications for marine biology in the region. The concern is that the massive displacement of ice would transform the composition of sea water in the area and impair the normal circulation of cold, dense water that normally supplies deep ocean currents with oxygen. &quot;Removal of this tongue of floating ice would reduce the size of that area of open water, which would slow down the rate of salinity input into the ocean and it could slow down this rate of Antarctic bottom water formation,&quot; Massom told Reuters. Mario Hoppema, chemical oceanographer at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, said that as a result &quot;there may be regions of the world&apos;s oceans that lose oxygen, and then of course most of the life there will die&quot;. B-9B is a remnant of a 2,000-square-mile iceberg that calved in 1987, making it one of the largest icebergs recorded in Antarctica. It drifted westwards for 60 miles before becoming grounded in 1992. It has recently re-floated itself and rotated into the Mertz tongue. The Mertz glacier iceberg is among the largest recorded for several years. In 2002, an iceberg about 120 miles long broke off from Antarctica&apos;s Ross ice shelf. In 2007, a iceberg roughly the size of Singapore broke off from the Pine Island glacier in west Antarctica."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/feb/27/england-in-bangladesh-2010-england-cricket-team", "sentences": ["Anyone with any knowledge of bars in Singapore to help Richard Coopey out: &quot;Would any OBOers know where I can watch the cricket (and, for that matter, Spurs v Everton later today) in Singapore?&quot; Shakib looks pretty ropey out there at the moment, his timing&apos;s off and his bottom hand so dominant that he is finding it difficult to get any force into his strokes."], "publicationDate": "2010-02-28T00:01:19Z", "title": "Bangladesh v England", "tags": ["England in Bangladesh 2010", "England cricket team", "Sport", "Cricket", "Alastair Cook"], "article": " Rob Smyth will be here from 0745. Ish. Meantime Mike Selvey ponders the significance of the rumoured selection of South African born Craig Kieswetter: The figures are unarguable. When England play their opening one-day international against Bangladesh, it will be Craig Kieswetter \u2013 of Somerset but born, raised and cricket-nurtured in South Africa \u2013 who will open the batting and not Kent&apos;s Joe Denly. So much is right and proper. Denly&apos;s scores, since he was elevated to the England one-day ranks, have done little to enhance his case for continuing inclusion: 67 against Ireland first up but then 0, 11, 45, 25, 53, 5, 21, 5, 36, 0, 14, 1 and 5. Already his time was running out. Kieswetter, of course, has no international scores but his success with the England Lions, playing alongside Denly, has been notable not just for the runs scored and the rate at which they came \u2013 31 from 24 balls, 77 (52), 40 not out (42), 50 not out (32) and 81 (66) \u2013 but also for the increased confidence shown by the sequence. It was no surprise when, hastily added to the full squad for Bangladesh, he marked the first of the warm-up matches by scoring 143 from 123 balls. Equally unarguable, unpalatable though the situation may be to many, is his credential to represent England... Read the rest of the article here.  Good morning I&apos;m afraid Rob Smyth won&apos;t be with you this morning. After a late call-up I&apos;m having to fill those big shoes and despite being soaked to the skin on the way in I&apos;m looking forward to this Mirpur ODI and seeing how Alastair Cook copes with his elevation. I&apos;m just off to try and get dry with paper towels and attempt to jam my head into one of those Dyson driers. I&apos;ll be back for the first over. England have won the toss and put Bangladesh in. Teams: Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Aftab Ahmed, Shakib Al Hasan (Capt), Mushfiqur Rahim (Wkt), Mohammad Mahmudullah, Naeem Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Shafiul Islam. England: A N Cook (Capt), C Kieswetter, K P Pietersen, P D Collingwood, E J G Morgan, L J Wright, M J Prior (Wkt), T T Bresnan, S C J Broad, G P Swann, R J Sidebottom. Umpires: Nadir Shah and R J Tucker  The wicket is looking verdant but we&apos;re told it&apos;s going to be hard and should suit England&apos;s seamers. Morning to Gary Naylor: &quot;I was impressed with young Kieswetter in his interview,&quot; he writes. &quot;If he qualifies, he should be picked on merit. That England do not produce enough home-grown players is a different matter.&quot; Can&apos;t quibble with that Gary but I think he might as well have the gloves as well if they&apos;re going to use him. Bumble has just been interviewed sitting in an auto-rickshaw, proclaiming, &quot;Start the rickshaw&quot; as he sets off on his quest to head for the Himalayas.  1st over: Bangladesh 5-0 (Tamim 5, Kayes 0) Ryan Sidebottom gets us off and he&apos;s on the mark with his first delivery but the second is too wide and Tami slashes it hard for four over the head of where fourth slip might be. The wicket looks flat, low and slow. Tamim pushes a single to midwicket to bring the other left-hander to face and Sidebottom stands Kayes up with the last ball off the over.  2nd over: Bangladesh 10-0 (Tamim 5, Kayes 4) And it&apos;s an all Yorkshire-born opening attack as Bresnan takes the other end. It&apos;s his 25th birthday today but he hasn&apos;t found any swing to go with his cake as yet. No lift either as the ball dobs through at toe-height to Prior. Bresnan is pretty much on the mark, fixing his line on off and middle but when he tries a short one Kayes top edges a pull that goes over Prior&apos;s head for four.  3rd over: Bangladesh 15-0 (Tamim 9, Kayes 4) An email arrives from David Hopps, our man in Mirpur. He&apos;s received one of those emails that merits quoting: &quot;I&apos;m sick and tired of what Test cricket has become. I&apos;m also flabbergasted at the glib, cheap, disposable way in which each of you has elected to defend what is becoming of English cricket. First David Hopps on 22nd February: &apos;But if young cricketers born and raised in England are repeatedly shown not to be up to it, to criticise Kieswetter for achieving higher standards seems to be conducting the wrong sort of investigation.&apos; Then on 26th it&apos;s over to Mike Selvey: &apos;Meanwhile worrying about qualifications though is merely to treat a symptom. The disease itself needs addressing.&apos;Oh joy. Surely, if you examine your arguments beyond the imperative of the coming deadline you can see how blithe, how limp and how submissive these positions are?&quot; There&apos;s more: &quot;I am so often accused of being a lousy patriot that it often staggers me how few people give a flying stuff about this issue when I find myself despairing of it, but surely to goodness you can each see that a crap England side is infinitely better, more real, appropriate and reflective than an England (&amp; Wales) that is not, in any real sense, England?Fine, take pot shots at the system that produces Bells rather than Pietersens, or Boparas rather than Trotts, but please do not offer deadline stressing perspectives that denigrate those who would rightly question the legitimacy of these transfer players and make it all about development when in fact it is about a system that is rolling over and dying in the face of something noone has the verve, gumption or determination to resist.So England are a better side with Pietersen, Trott and this latest import \u2013 so bloody what. They&apos;d also be better with Ponting and Tendulkar and England would win more matches but then, that would be ridiculous wouldn&apos;t it?The point is, where is the pride in an England victory, where is the concern about all those apparently inferior England players who don&apos;t now get to play for their (really, it is &apos;their&apos;) country, the satisfaction on producing a decent player internally... There is no pride in watching Kieswetter, Pietersen or Trott score runs for their pretend country \u2013 none at all, mere satisfaction for some that &apos;England&apos; are doing well, without any sort of reflection on quite what &apos;England&apos; has become.&quot;Well, let&apos;s come back to that at our leisure. Tamim is dropped at cover by Eoin Morgan \u2013 it looked a pretty straightforward chance and Sidebottom, never the most forgiving of bowlers, kicks the turf.  4th over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Tamim 10, Kayes 5) Bresnan is pretty much on the mark - the slips have gone and he hits a perfect length on this pitch. Morning to Niall Taylor and Liam Doyle who wonders why Gary Naylor has forgotten his usual anti-Wenger rant in his email. I&apos;m staying out of this one.  5th over: Bangladesh 27 (Tamim 20, Kayes 5) Sidebottom varies his length and drops one short and Tamim shovels it around the corner as it stayed too low then drives with theatrical flourish straight to Broad at mid-on. Sidebottom gets one above wasit-height but Tamim lets it go through to Prior then creams the next one through the covers for four. Then finds his range and whacks the last ball for six over mid-on. &quot;Sixer,&quot; as Mark Nicholas would say. Bobby Willis opts for &quot;wowee&quot;.  6th over: Bangladesh 31-0 (Tamim 21, Kayes 9) Bresnan is the pick do far. Speaking of euphemisms for six, I think the worst is &quot;Maximum!&quot; which is quite commonplace these days. Ian Healy, I&apos;ve noticed, has picked up on Billy Bowden&apos;s daft signals and says &quot;Billy&apos;s putting the horns up&quot;. Bowden&apos;s got the horn, what an unpleasant image. Good save on the boundary from Sidebottom but the batsman gets two. Bresnan recovers by giving Kayes a smell of the leather.  7th over: Bangladesh 36-0 (Tamim 26, Kayes 9) Broad, with his new crop, replaces Sidebottom. Gary Naylor thinks Bresnan is progressing well as a blossoming ODI talent: &quot;I&apos;m very impressed with Bresnan&apos;s development as a one-day bowler, but this immaculate line and length at a pace well below full throttle won&apos;t help him into the Test XI. His discipline is useful in all forms of the game though.&quot; Unimprovably put, Gary. Broad drops his second ball short and Tamim top-edges a hook over the keeper&apos;s head for four. This is already Bangla&apos;s best first wicket partnership against England. Broad decides to take a leaf out of Bresnan&apos;s book and hits the right length, just short of full. Better - the last three balls are dots.  8th over:Bangladesh 47-0 (Tamim 31, Kayes 14) A wide from Bresnan after all the praise and a harsh one at that. A cross-bat hoik from Tamim gets four through midwicket and he then takes on Collingwood&apos;s arm and gets home for a well-run single. Kayes then punches a cut for four. This is a brilliant start from Bangladesh.  9th over:Bangladesh 63-0 (Tamim 45, Kayes 15) Tom van de Gucht is worried by Sidebottom&apos;s travails: &quot;Does anyone else have the niggling worry that Sidebottom is no longer up to it? In my mind he seems to resemble more and more Boxer the old work horse from Animal Farm towards the end of the story when he was no longer fit for purpose but kept on chugging along with ever diminishing results. Perhaps it&apos;s Cook&apos;s opportunity to stage a Napoleon style coup and take him off to the glue factory.&quot; He&apos;s certainly lost his nip, ever since he was forced to labour through the 2008 season with that dodgy hip. Sad scenes. Tamim larrups another short ball from Broad for four to wide mid-on. Poor thinking from Broad. PITCH IT UP. He then steers the next one to fine leg for four. Where&apos;s Napoleon Cook and his captain&apos;s advice now? Aggh! Wide. Finishes off with an agricultural six over mid-on. He did pitch it up this time but this is shoddy stuff.  Wicket!! Kayes c Wright b Bresnan 15 Spoons up a catch to midwicket where Wright makes decent ground to pouch it.  10th over:Bangladesh 68-1 (Tamim 50, Siddique) It was actually a very good slower ball from Bresnan that earned the wicket nand took the leading edge. Tamim brings up his 50 off 32 balls with a very low cut-steer to third man. Kahdemul Islam says he has to wonder why &quot;English players so snooty? They famously look right through the Bangladesh players off the field, and when on the field - outside Bangladesh - give the impression that it&apos;s a chore playing Bangladesh,but whddyado with such a suckhole also having become a Test playing country...&quot; Do you think it&apos;s arrogance that&apos;s making them bowl generally such a dire length?  WICKET! Siddique c Kieswetter b Broad 0 Bangladesh 71-2 Clipped Broad&apos;s second ball off his toes to Kieswetter at square leg.  11th over:Bangladesh 73-2 (Tamim 54, Aftab 1) Much better from Broad, bowling now with a scrambled seam to get a bit more unpredictability out of the pitch. Just when you think you&apos;re going to write Broad off for the day, he does something clever like that.  12th over:Bangladesh 82-2 (Tamim 60, Aftab 2) Here&apos;s John Starbuck: &quot;I guess that as it&apos;s a Sunday the IT bloke who normally switches on the OBO&apos;s On Off display for automatic update isn&apos;t around today. We&apos;re back to old-fashioned F5 now, which is a swizz when one&apos;s eating pikelets for breakfast as the butter drips over the keyboard.&quot; Mmm, pikelets. Sorry it&apos;s my fault but untilo 10am I sail this ship alone. I&apos;ll get someone far brainier than me to sort it if they ever turn up. He continues: &quot;Re the non-English players in the team: yes, it&apos;s a disappointment when selection get to this degree but it isn&apos;t novel. Leave aside all the 1970s-1980s South African players, the same thing happened at the turn of the last century when English and Australian players were repeatedly poached to play for the other side. Give up whining and concentrate on scouting and coaching for the next generation.&quot; Tamim plants his front foot and swings at Bresnan&apos;s fourth ball and carves it for four. It&apos;s a fairly rudimentary technique but effective as hell if there&apos;s no swing.  Wicket!! Aftab run out 2 Pietersen was hanging around on the edge of the circle at mid-on and quickly gathered the ball and ran Aftab out by an inch with a deft underarm throw.  13th over:Bangladesh 88-3 (Tamim 65, Shakib 1) Staright after the wicket, which the third umpire took an age to give despite the first replay showing it perfectly, Tamim resumes with another four. It&apos;s been a peach of an innings, mixing power with precision, some wristy shots and Blutoesque forearm blows.  14th over:Bangladesh 89-3 (Tamim 65, Shakib 2) Alex Doherty has girth on his mind: &quot;Not being a regular cricket fan I&apos;m very surprised at how portly some of the lads look out there. Does cricket rank alongside darts in terms of athletic prowess?&quot; You need a big backside to be a bowler, Alex and there&apos;s some big ones out there. But if you think this selection is plump, have you not seen Robbie Key in his pomp? Sidebottom&apos;s back and his first three balls to the captain find a better line - perhaps with a touch of reverse. His line&apos;s tighter and the ball has got softer, meaning the batsman needs to really belt it to pierce England&apos;s ring of four from point to mid-off. A quick single to mid-on finishes the over.  15th over:Bangladesh 89-3 (Tamim 65, Shakib 2) Shakib can&apos;t find his range in this last over of the bowling powerplay, his bottom hand overpowering the top and skewing too many shots off the true. Broad tries a slower ball, then a yorker. Pietersen throws the ball to the wicketkeeper and Tamim at the non-striker&apos;s end looks a bit peeved as he had to swerve out of the way. Broad completes a maiden - and the longer they starve Tamim of the strike, the better England look.  16th over:Bangladesh 94-3 (Tamim 69, Shakib 3) Sidebottom pins Shakib back on his crease with this line, looking for an inside edge played-on. It hasn&apos;t been successful yet but there&apos;s enough of a gate there to sneak through. Tamim steals an overthrow when Pietersen wastes his good work to save a four by aiming it at the stumps anyway.  17th over:Bangladesh 98-3 (Tamim 72, Shakib 5) Drinks then a problem with a sightscreen are followed by a couple of easily stolen singles off Broad&apos;s bowling. Anyone with any knowledge of bars in Singapore to help Richard Coopey out: &quot;Would any OBOers know where I can watch the cricket (and, for that matter, Spurs v Everton later today) in Singapore?&quot; Shakib looks pretty ropey out there at the moment, his timing&apos;s off and his bottom hand so dominant that he is finding it difficult to get any force into his strokes.  18th over:Bangladesh 103-3 (Tamim 73, Shakib 8) Here comes Graeme Swann and he floats up his first two deliveries, both of which go for singles as Bangladesh post the 100. There&apos;s certainly turn out there, making England&apos;s decision to go with one specialist spinner only a bit of a mystery. They just milk Swann for five cannily, pushing for the gaps and strolling singles.  19th over:Bangladesh 110-3 (Tamim 78, Shakib 10) Collingwood&apos;s on now to make the batsmen really have to throw themselves into their shots to hit boundaries. Starts with one of his off-cutters, pushed for one. Third ball is a beauty that finds Iqbal&apos;s edge and goes for four. The batsmen seem quite happy to keep the scoreboard ticking over until the medium pacers come back on.  20th over:Bangladesh 112-4 (Tamim 78, Mushfiqur 0) Shakib is upping the rate with a nice sweep for two, full, of guile. WICKET!! Shakib st Prior b Swann 12 I put the hex on him there. Good line and perfect length from Swann inviting Shakib to have a dart. He tried to turn it to midwicket against the turn, it spun away from him and Prior took off the bails. Now they&apos;re saying it was out caught and the replays show he did nick it so Prior did him twice, caught then stumped just to make sure.  21st over:Bangladesh 112-4 (Tamim 78, Mushfiqur 0) Collingwood tosses up his second ball, varies his pace and is looking a real handful in this over. They look like the sort of induckers that used to be Geoffrey Boycott&apos;s stock in trade. Off-cutters, floaters, slower balls \u2013 it&apos;s Dermot Reeve light circa 1992. Maiden.  22nd over:Bangladesh 115-4 (Tamim 79, Mushfiqur 2) Mushfiqur gets off the mark with a sweep from way outside off stump and takes the single, hitting it with the spin. Bangladesh then take a tight single - yes, no, sorry \u2013 but Mushfiqur gets there with a sprawling dive. Tamim is trying to drop anchor now after the mini collapse and England have the upper hand while he&apos;s being subdued.  23rd over:Bangladesh 119-4 (Tamim 82, Mushfiqur 5) Back to Hoppsy&apos;s correspondent. Richard Finch hits several nails: &quot;There is a major problem with the development of young English cricketers, but this is mainly to do with the competition against rugby and football. Every couple of years there is a (football) European or World Cup that grabs the nations attention AND attracts and inspires young people to follow the game (not to mention the excessive year round coverage). The BBC show the Six Nations every year and a World Cup is shown on terrestrial TV every four years, cricket can&apos;t really compete with either of these - even if you include the Ashes publicity. A way to generate more interest would be to create a first class competition that lasts about five games, is held over bank holiday weekends (or long weekends) in the summer and doesn&apos;t clash with international cricket meaning the star players are able (and obliged) to play. Making a fuss of the domestic game is the solution.&quot; I see your point Richard but it&apos;s about the culture of laiking out these days, too, not just media coverage and subscription apartheid. Collingwood does what Collingwood does - gives away five in a tidy over, asks some questions but gets the right answers so far.  24th over:Bangladesh 124-4 (Tamim 83, Mushfiqur 8) The mid-innings longueurs are here. Clever bowling and batting but not much biff, bang, pow for the non-purists. &quot;Geoffrey swung his induckers a bit more than Colly and wore a cap,&quot; says Gary Naylor. I remember it well \u2013 the 1979 World Cup final was a bowling spell too far but he did well inh the tournament up to that stage. &quot;For the forthcoming World Cup on the sub-continent, England should field an attack of Dibbly, Dobbly, Colly, Timmy, and Swanny.&quot; Who can be dibbly and dobbly, though?  25th over:Bangladesh 128-4 (Tamim 84, Mushfiqur 9) Collingwood ties up Mushfiqur with his lack of pace and subtle tweaks. A couple of laps round the corner gets Bumble talking about cat and mouse. ODI chess without the yoghurt pot plots.  26th over:Bangladesh 135-4 (Tamim 86, Mushfiqur 12) &quot;What&apos;s up with Rob, Rob? Tell us it&apos;s nothing graver than a hangover...&quot; asks Philip Podolsky. I think it was a scheduling issue - he thought it was starting at 3.30am and then he could do it and go off for a prior engagement which may or may not have had something to do with Wembley. But with this start I needed to be issued with my call-up papers. The A team of Bull and Hannibal Smyth will be back for the rest of the series. England have done really well since the opening onslaught. Can we praise Cook for that? Collingwood and Swann have found the perfect conditions and Cook must be tempted to bowl them through.  27th over:Bangladesh 137-4 (Tamim 88, Mushfiqur 15) Tightish lbw shout from Swann to Tamim as he goes for a sweep but it pitched outside off. A short leg would have bagged Mushfiqur third ball as he pops up a catch from a viciously spinning Swann delivery but there&apos;s no one there. England may well find it difficult if the Bangladesh boys can make it turn like this \u2013 as Ian Whitchurch points out: &quot;And Shakib and Razzak can actually turn the ball - and Aftab bowls similar stuff to Collingwood.&quot; I&apos;m assuming there might be dew to contend with. Am I wrong?  28th over:Bangladesh 144-4 (Tamim 89, Mushfiqur 21) More Collingwood enforcement stuff after a first-ball short aberration pulled for a single. Then Mushfiqur late cuts a four, the first for an age. Too wide from Collingwood, who chastises himself by pulling his hair. It might be a result of havinng the grubby ball changed. This one doesn&apos;t appear as soft as the one they were using to slow Bangldesh down.  29th over:Bangladesh 145-4 (Tamim 89, Mushfiqur 22) Here&apos;s Ian with a dew update: &quot;My man in Bangladesh is reporting no dew for the last week. Carn the Tigers.  WICKET! Mushfiqur run out 22  WICKET! Mahmadullah c Collingwood b Swann 0  30th over contd:Bangladesh 147-6 (Tamim 90, Naeem 1) A senseless run out - a bad call from Tamim and Pietersen walked to smack off the bails as both batsman ended up at the non striker&apos;s end. then Mahmadullah turned his first ball which looked slower than the previous two and dollied it up to Collingwood who dived in from short mid-on.  31st over:Bangladesh 148-6 (Tamim 91, Naeem 2) Bresnan lollops back into the attack, pitches his first two balls just back of a length \u2013 Naeem clips the second off the outside edge for a single. They&apos;ve tied Tamim up brilliantly in the last few overs with some canny bowling and consistentloy good fielding. Andy Flower has made a huge difference in the field this past year. Lots of shots of the Bangla coach Jamie Siddons looking splendid in primrose but brooding and glowering quite threateningly.  32nd over:Bangladesh 153-6 (Tamim 93, Naeem 3) Swann continues and is rattling through the overs. They&apos;re taking singles but not using their powerplay yet. Surely it&apos;s time.  33rd over:Bangladesh 160-6 (Tamim 95, Naeem 8) Under edge off a cross-bat drive gets Naeem (from the halfway line) four of Big Bres but he can&apos;t cream the full toss that follows it and just gets one. Tamim hooks a single to get to 95, the highest Bangladesh score against England and it has been a marvellous innings to watch - apart from his calling. Bresnan finishes off with a wide and a dot ball. His feet are taking a heavy pounding in his delivery stride on this surface.  34th over:Bangladesh 166-6 (Tamim 100, Naeem 9) Pietersen, once the great white off-spinning hope circa 2003, comes on and sees his second ball dispetched over midwicket for four. Great footwork from Tamim and then he pushes a single to bring up his century.  35th over:Bangladesh 171-6 (Tamim 102, Naeem 11) Khademul Islam wishes the complaining would cease: &quot;Am reading Lawrence Booth&apos;s Cricket, Lovely Cricket, and there&apos;s a fair bit of moaning and whingeing about, like the Brits emailing to OBO, about the heartache of being an English cricket team fan. You guys should knock it off. Ever think of what we Bangladeshis go through, especially once the team starts to hit the self destructbutton this hard like it&apos;s doing now?&quot; Khademul, we&apos;re British. We wouldn&apos;t enjoy ourselves if we were deprived of the opportunity to whinge. It&apos;s what we do. Ryan Sidebottom comes round the wicket, but looks nothing like as adept as Wasim. But then, who is? Comes back over to Tamim and throws in a couple of slower ones, then a wide from round to Naeem. Five off the over as the lights start to glow.  36th over:Bangladesh 176-6 (Tamim 104, Naeem 12) Two scrambled after yet another mix-up in calls, Iqbal getting home by a hare&apos;s breadth. Pietersen doesn&apos;t seem to favour a consistent line, like Sidebottom trying to experiment with every delivery. Over, round, over, round. Does it make that much of a difference with the field he&apos;s got?  37th over:Bangladesh 188-6 (Tamim 111, Naeem 18) Tamim steers Sid&apos;s opening delivery down to third man. Sky are keen on going to shots of Cook to see how his body language is shaping up. Pretty positive so far - not many councils with the senior pros. He looks like his own man out there so far. Uppercut for four over the keeper as Sidebottom comes round the wiucket to Naeem again. He just doesn&apos;t seem to have the zip for this line of attack. Think Gough on this wicket. Last ball flat-batted for four by Tamim through cover. Awful over.  38th over:Bangladesh 192-6 (Tamim 113, Naeem 19) Josh Green has put on his anorak so we don&apos;t have to: &quot;Just a quick one, Tamim Iqbal&apos;s current 103* out of 175 puts him in 11th place in the table of players who have contributed the highest percentage of runs in a single innings, he&apos;s scored 58.8% of Bangladesh&apos;s runs! Viv Richards is first with 69% of the runs in a match against England in 1984, and funnily enough David Gower is in 10th. This is the kind of statistical analysis you get on the Surrey cricket blog.&quot; Thanks Josh. Broad comes back and hits a better length, making the bat do the work rather than the batsman&apos;s forearm strength. Still no powerplay.  39th over:Bangladesh 204-6 (Tamim 122, Naeem 22) Cook&apos;s shuffling his options and brings back Collingwood. And gets battered for six first ball over long on by Tamim, just as he did 30 overs ago. A two then a single. &quot;Surely you mean a hair&apos;s breath? In over 36&quot; write Geoffrey and Ulla Roberts. Sorry! Obssessed with hares in our house after the 999th reading of &quot;Guess how much I love you?&quot; last night. Excellent over for the Banglas. &quot;The Tigers are hanging in there,&quot; suggests Ian Whitchurch. &quot;Dragged over the line by Tanim. If the rest of the side can manage 120, it&apos;s a very defendable score.&quot;  40th over:Bangladesh 209-6 (Tamim 124, Naeem 24) Swann comes back to try and put the cork back in the bottle and manages it successfully for the first four balls tying them up for singles. They take five off the over.  41st over:Bangladesh 213-7 (Tamim 124, Mortaza 4) Luke Wright gets Cook&apos;s nod to turn his arm over and gets a WICKET! first ball Naeem c Morgan b Wright 25 Wright tempted him with a fairly juicy lossener, perhaps slower than Naeem expected and he dug up a short-armed drive to Morgan at cover who caught it above his head comfortably. Enter Mortaza after a year&apos;s injury hell and whips his first ball to long leg for four. Naeem&apos;s was more of a sliced drive from the slower ball on second look. Wright bounces back with a pair of identical deliveries just outside off stump that Mortaza misses.  42nd over:Bangladesh 214-8 (Tamim 125, Razzak 0) It seems there going to wait for Swann to finish before going for the batting powerplay. A single off the second brings Mortaza on strike and the crowd simply adores him. WICKET! Mortaza lbw Swann 4 It was certainly hitting the stumpsbut it looked to hit him outside the line. The crowd groans. Incidentally I hate that Rowntrees Randoms ad. So self-consciously quirky it makes you cringe.  43rd over:Bangladesh 214-9 (Shafiul 0, Razzak 0) Powerplay called. &quot;After the spelling errors (hair&apos;s breadth, please) you&apos;ll be calling the home team The Bangles next,&quot; says John Satrbuck. &quot;Cue your own puns.&quot; Am I only dreaming? Broad follows Tamim who stepped away to leg and pins him. No run. Slower ball next and Tamim turns down the single, wanting to farm the strike. He then hooks it one-handed but the ball falls short of Morgan at mid-on. WICKET! Tamim b Broad 125 He wanted to hog the strike, turning down a couple of singles then stepped across his stumps to try and flick the ball down to fine leg and loses his middle stump. Clever line from Broad - good strategy and execution. It was a superb innings, though, paced brilliantly. Broad nearly takes Shafiul&apos;s head off with his first ball.  44th over:Bangladesh 220-9 (Shafiul 5, Razzak 1) Bresnan, who started well and has outshone the wayward Sidebottom, comes in to bowl and gets cut for four third ball. That was a dross delivery, short, wide and eminently thrashable. He comes back well, finding his stock heavy ball outside off.  45th over:Bangladesh 226-9 (Shafiul 10, Razzak 1) There&apos;s been some excellent groundfielding by England today. Gone are the days when the big boot would come out \u2013 Wright, Collingwood, Pietersen have been throwing themselves around with abandon. They look like a genuine 10 and jack these two but Sahfiul then belts one arrow straight for four that almost took the umpire&apos;s head off.  46th over:Bangladesh 228 all out Sidebottom gets another chance, I&apos;m not sure why when Bresnan has overs left. Wright seems to have pulled his left hamstring when diving in the field last over and keeps prodding the back of his thigh. Milky milky Sidebottom for the first two balls then he wraps the innings up WICKET! Razzak c Cook b Sidebottom 2 The ball was outside off stump and Razzak leant back and hit it like a golf shot to Cook at mid off. &quot;Have Bangladesh been playing ODIs for 10 years or 10 minutes?&quot; poses Gary Naylor &quot;All sides are capable of the occasional collapse, but it happens too frequently to Bangladesh and squanders so much talent.&quot; They&apos;re very young, Gary, and play with a lack of expectation about them. I&apos;d say it takes longer than 10 years to come to grips with international cricket. All the signs suggest they&apos;re going to get there, though.  That&apos;s the innings break. In the words of the peerless Barry Taylor: &quot;Ta ta for a bit.&quot;  Break: Forgot to give Swann his proper dues. He bowled well and bravely given how much power Tamim had shown when he came on to bowl. I wonder, given his obvious intelligence, whether he wouldn&apos;t make a very good captain, particularly for the one-day side. Why do batsmen always get it and rotate their bowlers by numbers rather than give it to a bowler who understands the nuances better. Tamim demonstrated again what a fine eye he has and I was impressed by his maturity, his dreadful running apart. Lee James has a soft spot for Bangladesh, too: &quot;I must confess a serious liking for Bangladesh, very keen to see them make it as a test-playing nation. They look further along than the Lankans after a similar time and have huge room for improvement- the one series I don&apos;t mind England losing a few games in.Bresnan and Sidebottom hardly inspire do they? I hope we have some fast bowlers learning their trade somewhere in the Cape to help us out.&quot; Sidebottom is struggling, no doubt, but Bresnan did OK and used the pitch very well. Broad conjures up something routinely precisely when you&apos;re on the brink of having a rant at him. In some ways that makes him even more infuriating. Let&apos;s see what Kieswetter&apos;s made of, now.  1st over: England 7-0 (Cook 7, Kieswetter 0) Cook takes the first ball and scampers an easy two off Mortaza. A touch of swing then encourages Cook to clip it again through midwicket for two then an identical shot gets three to finish the over)  2nd over: England 14-0 (Cook 14, Kieswetter 0) Shafiul takes the new ball, and he&apos;s immediately quicker than Mortaza. Drops his second ball short, a filthy long hop, short-arm jabbed by Cook with that ugly pull of his for four. &quot;Five Live&apos;s innings break featured an Alastair Cook profile,&quot; messages Gary Naylor. &quot;Everyone thought he was lovely and spoke of him being polite and thoughtful as a youngster. Unlike profiles of Ricky Ponting and Stephen Waugh, nobody talked about how he dealt with the bouncers and sledging of grade cricket when just into his teens. Sings well though.&quot; Love the &quot;Stephen&quot; - very Australian. What does he sing? The Messiah? He works a two off his feet. This is loose stuff to start with from Bangladesh. He pinches the strike again off the last ball. Kieswetter, though, isn&apos;t chewing his handle yet.  3rd over: England 16-0 (Cook 16, Kieswetter 0) Mortaza is a bit of a bustler these days, arcing the ball in from Cook&apos;s off-stump, trying to fool him with the one that goes straight on. He hasn&apos;t managed it just yet and Cook prods the non-swingers, two of them, to point. Cook&apos;s inside edge is found, hinting that the gate is still wide open, but Mortaza doesn&apos;t look fast enough to make him pay for the space betwen bat and pad. Cook cuts the last ball for two and finally we&apos;ll see Kieswetter.  4th over: England 20-0 (Cook 16, Kieswetter 4) Shakib brings himself on to give it a twirl from the fourth over. Kieswetter&apos;s using a Puma bat, just like Pele would. Drives his first two deliveries to silly mid off, the first a bump ball that gets the crowd going. And edges the fourth ball for four, through Mushfiqur&apos;s legs. A great chance to bag him for a duck goes missing and he looked plum lbw from the arm ball - Hawk_eye sayd it would hit the middle of leg stump. Jammy sod. Twice.  5th over: England 34-0 (Cook 25, Kieswetter 9) Cook clips a single square of the wicket, allowing Kieswetter a pop at Mortaza. He comes down the pitch and punches a four through the covers. More settled against seam, he takes a single with a confident push. Mortaza trhen feeds Cook&apos;s favourite off-side shot, the open-faced Essex square drive. The choir boy bags another four with a backlift-light off drive.  6th over: England 41-0 (Cook 31, Kieswetter 10) Shakib is trying to unsettle the Somerset stumper with a very tight line to draw him down the pitch. He smothers the spin well and gets off strike. Cook takes a different tack, stands up tall, no foot movement and swings at it - and gets a two and a four, edged, for his troubles. Attempted a ludicrous run off the last ball but Kieswetter sent him back - the throw is wayward, though and Cook gets back. Good, loud shrieked &quot;NOOOOOOOOO&quot; from Kieswetter.  7th over: England 45-0 (Cook 34, Kieswetter 11) Spin at both ends as Abdur Razzak tries his left-arm spin. He looks a dead ringer for the captain as the bowler but has more flight. Kieswetter is a dancer when faced with spin. vgery ball he&apos;s been down the pitch to the spinners so far. No forward presser, he, but a remarkably positive, old school technique. He looks vulnerable to a stumping but then may be gambling that Mushfiqur has got iron gloves on. Cook unveils his slog sweep for two as the cakewalk progresses then copies it for a single. There is dew out there after all, the Bangladesh fielders slipping about a couple of times.  8th over: England 54-0 (Cook 43, Kieswetter 11) Naeem, the offspinner, comes on. Cook&apos;s cut jabbed for two and a slog-swept four starts the over. He then loses his balnace somwhat and is clipped on the pad, his head too far over, but the ball is missing leg. Two overthrows. Cook is playing it very late and looks vulnerable.  9th over: England 59-0 (Cook 44, Kieswetter 15) Tom van de Gucht reckosn its deja vu time all over again: &quot;This England ODI side has a very &quot;early 90&apos;s&quot; Vibe to it. KP and Kieswitter are the modern day Lamby and Smith, Cook has taken on Atherton&apos;s FEC mantle, Prior is filling Alec Stewarts boots, being shunted up and down he order. Sidebottom is an honest medium paced county trundler in the mould of Gus Fraser. Bresnan resembles Botham from his twilight years, portly and good at slogging. And finally we have also squeezed in a good old fashioned Dermot Reeve-ish bits and piece player in the form of Wright . Perhaps that&apos;s Flowers masterplan, a bit of retro cricket, that&apos;s the last thing the opposition are going to expect.&quot; Where&apos;s your Fairbrother and Hick, though, Tom? And what about the mercurial Lewis, De Freitas and Gladstone Small? Kieswetter again waltzes down the wicket and smashes Razzak for a straight four - he was trying the on drive but got squared up a touch.  10th over: England 61-0 (Cook 47, Kieswetter 16) Shakib brings himself back on. Bob Willis says, tongue firmly in cheek, &quot;is this Alastair Cook or Brian Lara out there&quot;. It&apos;s Cook, Bob. You can tell because he&apos;s only got three scoring shots \u2013 perfectly adequate today but for the long-term? An over of &quot;a-milking they will go&quot;, a dash of &quot;nicely nurdled, sir&quot; and some ugly slog sweeps.  11th over: England 65-0 (Cook 48, Kieswetter 17) Naeem hits a trickier length for Kieswetter&apos;s favoured modus operandi. He wants to come down the wicket but Naeem is trying to get him in two minds. Cook almost gets himslef out with a slog sweep which he misses and catches the outside of his front pad - missing leg stump.  12th over: England 70-0 (Cook 52, Kieswetter 18) Cook gets to 50 on his captaincy debut. &quot;Surely Paul Collingwood is this England side&apos;s Neil Fairbrother (even though he&apos;s right handed)? Freddie is the mercurial one. And Ian Bell is Graham Hick. The resemblance really is uncanny! I predict an England loss in the 2011 World Cup final. You heard it here first.&quot; Thanks Cory Hazlehurst for that and to Robin Hazlehurst for this: &quot;To carry on the 90s comparison, I think that Smyth of your parish was comparing Eoin Morgan to Fairbrother recently. And how about Owais Shah as a modern day Hick, just not doing what he really ought to at the top level. And Panesar as Tufnell, can&apos;t bat or field too well but spins it well and is seen as a bit of a comedy act.&quot; Any relation to Ronnie?  13th over: England 70-0 (Cook 52, Kieswetter 18) I think Collingwood does have Fairbrotherish tendencies, perhaps with the potential to do even more than the Lancashire imp. Morgan, though, is our Michael Bevan in the making. If England are to get to a World Cup final for the first time in 19 years, we&apos;ll need one.  Wicket!! Kieswetter st Mushfiqur b Naeem 19  13th over contd: England 74-1 (Cook 54, Pietersen 1) Kieswetter came unstuck, caught in no man&apos;s land by his happy feet and stranded by a good yard. He went for a masive slog and ended up looking flummoxed. Pietersen gets off the mark first ball.  14th over: England 74-1 (Cook 54, Pietersen 1) Tom Hopkins is taken by Tom VDG&apos;s analogy: &quot;But I would suggest that Gus Fraser was miles better than Sidebottom. He could take serious (ie Australian and, at the time, West Indian) wickets, which even pre-injuries I&apos;m not sure Sidebottom could, and I don&apos;t remember him ever looking as unthreatening as Sidebottom has against South Africa.&quot; Gus was a mumbling, grumbling class act. If only Martin Bicknell had been more trusted, what a pair they would have made.  Wicket!! Pietersen c Siddique b Shakib 1  14th over contd: England 75-2 (Cook 554, Collingwood 0) Pietersen got a faint edge as the ball snuck between bat and pad and ballooned to slip. There&apos;s a bit of confusion whether he was out lbw or caught. Snickometer suggests he didn&apos;t hit it and Pietersen certainly looked hacked off.  15th over: England 77-2 (Cook 56, Collingwood 1) Naeem has pegged England back in tandem with his captain. England are being lured to play big shots but are being very circumspect after the loss of those two wickets.  16th over: England 79-2 (Cook 57, Collingwood 3) I forgot to mention that with his catch in the Bangladesh innings Collingwood became the first Englishman to take 100 wickets, 100 catches and score 1,000 runs in ODIs. Cap doffed. The spinners are rattling through these overs. It&apos;s a great policy to churn through them when you&apos;ve got the upper hand. England, looking to consolidate, could look up and see five or six overs gone in 15 minutes at this rate.  17th over: England 83-2 (Cook 58, Collingwood 5) &quot;Comparisons are all good and fun, but surely Swann is better than Richard Illingworth? writes Paul Frame. &quot;Oh, and Gus Fraser wasn&apos;t the honest county trundler in 1992 it was Pringle. Why does nobody give one of the best English bowlers for the last 30 years the respect he deserves?&quot; If you mean Pringle I think it&apos;s because the memory of his first few years in the side has prejudiced the image of what a fine bowler he became under Gooch&apos;s captaincy. Collingwood rocks on to the back foot and carves Naeem through midwicket for a well-run three after three dot balls. Collingwood&apos;s textbook forward defensive off the last ball provokes Naeem into a fit of pique and he swings his foot and storms off to long leg. Odd.  18th over: England 91-2 (Cook 60, Collingwood 7) Four byes from Razzak&apos;s first ball. His hands are nowhere near low enough when he stands up to the spinners and relies on his legs to block if the ball doesn&apos;t carry.  19th over: England 91-2 (Cook 64, Collingwood 7) I&apos;ve misrepresented Paul Frame. Sorry! &quot;Rob I didn&apos;t mean Pringle, I was talking about Fraser when referring to one of the best English bowlers of the last 30 years.&quot; I loved Gus, too, Paul. Only the Dazzler has given me fonder memories and Devon Malcolm in 1994.  Wicket! Cook lbw Naeem 64  19th over contd: England 96-3 (Morgan , Collingwood 7) Hit on the pad after he forced a shot through the off side. It drifted in from round the wicket and appeared to straighten but the Hawk suggests it was missing leg by a (relatively) hefty margin.  20th over: England 100-3 (Morgan 0, Collingwood 12) Razzak is on and Bangladesh have called for their bowling powerplay. Collingwood tangles his feet for the first two balls and then comes down the pitch to belt it over midwicket for four. Razzak&apos;s lack of flight is causing problems for Collingwood who wants to get down the pitch to him.  21st over: England 106-3 (Morgan 1, Collingwood 16)  &quot;Talking of reviving the 80s, that LBW Cook got was like the old days on the subcontinent,&quot; opines Gary Naylor. It was a shocker but at least we have such accomplished neutral umpires these days that we can&apos;t become conspiracy theorists. They&apos;re just poor, now. England were in danger of finding the run rate creeping up and up as Bangladesh exert the pressure but Collingwood breaks free by carving a loose ball through point for four.  22nd over: England 106-3 (Morgan 1, Collingwood 16)  I sort of meant, Gary, and put it badly, that it&apos;s more about competence than integrity now. Razzak ties Morgan down but then again he often looks a bit lacklustre at the beginning of his innings. I don&apos;t know if he&apos;s a slow starter, or needs to find his range, or doesn&apos;t like these pitches. Maiden.  23rd over: England 110-3 (Morgan 1, Collingwood 20)  Shafiul comes back into the attack after 15 overs of spin and fires in a couple of pitched-up deliveries that Collingwood digs out on the off side. Collingwood comes on the charge to try and unsettle the bowler but again cannot pierce the off-side ring. So he goes leg-side and chips him over wide mid-on for four. When he looks as sternm as he looks today, Collingwood, facially, does resemble Alan Shearer when trying to appear sincere.  24th over: England 112-3 (Morgan 2, Collingwood 21)  Two off Razzak&apos;s over as Morgan continues to look bashful and Collingwood alternates blocks with biffs that don&apos;t quite come off. Sixteen off the powerplay.  25th over: England 115-3 (Morgan 3, Collingwood 23)  Mahmadullah takes the ball and has a touch of a dressage horse to his run-up. They can&apos;t hit him off the square so adapt by trying to glance him about. It keeps the scoreboard moving but it doesn&apos;t look too comfortable.  26th over: England 124-3 (Morgan 7, Collingwood 28)  Collingwood uses his feet to hit a four over deep midwicket then Morgan springs to life with his reverse sweep getting him his first four. The crowd falls silent. I&apos;d expected a bit more noise all the time instead of sporadic hubub when things are going well.  27th over: England 131-3 (Morgan 13, Collingwood 29)  Morgan survives an lbw appeal when trying to play that dinky periscope shot but he was a foot outside off stump at least. He then pulls it off properly to nip two and plays an orthodox cover drive for four. He takes his time but once he gets going he&apos;s capable of some breathtaking shots.  28th over: England 140-3 (Morgan 14, Collingwood 37)  England are beginning their charge now as Collingwood again uses his feet to bash Razzak for four over midwicket. It&apos;s the ODI boundary of choice. Nine off the over - Razzak looks tired now and England took advantage quite savagely.  29th over: England 144-3 (Morgan 14, Collingwood 41)  Drip, drip, drip. England squeeze a single here, a two there, just to ease Bangladesh&apos;s stranglehold.  30th over: England 148-3 (Morgan 16, Collingwood 43)  &quot;I think that one of the reasons Gus Fraser still takes a certain amount of stick is ironically due to his success,&quot; says Tom van de Gucht. &quot;He was just about England&apos;s best bowler at a time when there weren&apos;t many options and the selectors were randomly calling up seamers from the shires in the hope that they might unearth a gem. A lot of these players went straight back to county obscurity and subsequently when cricket fans look back on that period and joke about the trundlers who turned out for England the name that springs up is Fraser, purely because he stuck around for long enough to register in our memory.&quot; He hit every branch of the ugly tree of English bowling in the late 80s eraly 90s as he fell out. Damned by association with Messrs Taylor, Brown, Silverwood etc?  31st over: England 157-3 (Morgan 22, Collingwood 45)  Morgan is getting into his stride now, and cuts a ball in front of point for four but then has a brainstorm and sidles down the wicket and Mushfiqur misses the most basic of stumpings. That&apos;s three lives he&apos;s given England. It may well have been called by the bowler, Shakeeb, as he tempted Morgan six feet down the track and then pushed it wide.  32nd over: England 160-3 (Morgan 25, Collingwood 45)  Mushfiqur appeals for a catch which is turned down - the sound hints that it was a big inside edge on to pad. England were lucky there again  33rd over: England 166-3 (Morgan 26, Collingwood 50)  England aren&apos;t runningt away with it ny any means, simply semi-sadistically enjoying turning the screw. These two batsmen are experts at banishing hope - death by a thousand cuts, sweeps and lofted on-drives. Collingwood&apos;s rich vein of form brings him another 50.  34th over: England 177-3 (Morgan 31, Collingwood 56)  It&apos;s been a good match but has turned into the professional hunting down of a target with the minimum of fuss. England are showing that they can punish Bangladesh in the way other teams have slapped them down when they failed to bag a decent score themselves so often in the past. You can see there&apos;s real progress in the batting of Collingwood and Morgan, though. They are becoming battle hardened.  35th over: England 180-3 (Morgan 31, Collingwood 56)  It&apos;s a canter, now. Paul Frame&apos;s taem of the 90s: &quot;Since we&apos;ve mentioned the dearth of bowling talents that afflicted England in the 1990s, bear in mind there were good bowlers in that time, just shockingly poor selection decisions. Here&apos;s my best of the 1990s side: Stewart (capt), Atherton, Smith, Thorpe, Hussain, Hick, Russell (wk), Gough, Fraser, Caddick, Headley.&quot;  36th over: England 180-3 (Morgan 31, Collingwood 56)  That&apos;s your Test side, presumably, Paul. And you could make an argument for Gooch instead of Smith? Russell? (and let Stewart keep) No spinner wouldn&apos;t please Raymond Illingworth but there were so few that did anything that your only real option is Tufnell and I can see why you might not want to bother. Good shout on Headley \u2013 Cork won more matches but Dean always bent his back and had great potential.  Wicket!! Morgan c Atab b Naeem 33  37th over: England 188-4 (Prior 4, Collingwood 56)  Morgan drilled Naeem&apos;s wide tempter, a bit of a half-volley in truth, to extra cover, Prior comes in ahead of Wright who has kancked his hamstring and, standing stock still, looks to approach the spinners with French cricket techniques. He then confounds me by slog sweeping the last ball of the over for four  38th over: England 191-4 (Prior 5, Collingwood 63)  Nurdle, prod, turn the screw.  39th over: England 196-4 (Prior 5, Collingwood 68)  Collingwood has paced his innings with real intelligence, pushing the ball into gaps, chipping it over the infield anmd scampering singles. We should traesure him.  40th over: England 197-4 (Prior 5, Collingwood 69)  &quot;Surely all Morgan is doing with his &apos;slow start&apos; is playing himself in?&quot; says John Starbuck &quot;If you&apos;re not blessed with perfect vision like Viv Richards you&apos;ll take time to get used to the pitch and the ball. If Morgan does survive his first few overs he usually can wind it up pretty quickly in the short forms. Maybe KP should take note?&quot; He should indeed. My point was more that he looks so awkward while he plays himself in,as if he&apos;s playing with a bat that&apos;s too heavy for him or his shoelaces are tied together. It&apos;s like that old Blackadder quote of George not wanting to blow his own trumpetn and Edmund saying, &quot;you may at least have told us you had a trumpet&quot;. He looks so unlikley and then ... he charms you.  41st over: England 205-4 (Prior 10, Collingwood 71)  England play tip and run, Collingwood masterly at this tactic as ever, pushing for two to frustrate the field. Prior now has 1,000 runs in ODI with only IT Botham of his predecessors to make that mark to take more games to reach the milestone.  42nd over: England 207-4 (Prior 12, Collingwood 71)  Mortaza comes back into the attack and gets one to startle Prior by lifting up to head height and Prior fends it off with eyes wide and blazing. Three singles are taken.  43rd over: England 215-4 (Prior 19, Collingwood 72)  Blistering shot from Prior as he goes down on one knee and smacks the ball through cover for four. It looked a bit flashy because he didn&apos;t move his front foot but that&apos;s Prior all over. He takes risks.  44th over: England 217-4 (Prior 20, Collingwood 73)  Bangladesh have been hampered by the slow pitch \u2013 Swann got turn because he gave it a rip before the moisture came \u2013 but the home side have found it difficult to get fast turn with a damp ball. They hadsome pressure but Collingwood, far from prettily, just slowly prised the fingers off England&apos;s throat.  45th over: England 220-4 (Prior 22, Collingwood 73)  Collngwood and Prior calmly pick off runs, enjoying the time at the crease, keen to see it through. They&apos;ve been very unruffled - they only take the powerplay now because it&apos;s part of the regulations.  45th over: England 227-4 (Prior 30, Collingwood 75)  A four straight down the ground from Prior moves England to within four of the target and earns Razzak who moved like a three-legged mule the scorn of his captain for failing to cut off the boundary. Two follow to deep mid on and Prior looks keen to hit the winning runs of Mortaze. He levels the scores with another on-drive. He&apos;s put on 44 with Collingwood, hardly memorable, but valuable. Collingwood pats down his bat and squeezes the winning run to cover.  England win by six wickets  Well, England played very astutely. They picked off Tamim&apos;s partners very well and Swann bowled with real dash and later, composure. Cook astonished me with his limited repertoire but was very effective and then Collingwood and with valuable help from Morgan quickly put the Bangladesh spinners under the cosh by milking them. Collingwood is a very English star and has become this side&apos;s rock over the past couple of years. In truth, victory looked inevitable fairly early on but they did all that was asked of them very well. Bangladesh need bigger partnerships and more variety in their bowling attack if they&apos;re batting first in day-nighters. Otherwise they only ask the batsmen the same question over and over again. Thanks for all your contributions.

There was a bar on Palmyra Atoll, south west of Hawaii (population: 8); there was a bar on Willis Island in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland (population: 4). Ten minutes after he and I have arrived in Heligoland (population: a few hundred frozen Germans, and us) we are, therefore, sitting in a one-roomed pub, advertised by a gigantic wooden herring outside, and crammed inside with Dutch and German and English nautical knick-knackery. It is midday, and we have been on the road for four hours: first by car from Hamburg through fog and a blizzard to an airstrip at Uetersen. Then by eight-seater plane, which took off in a perturbing foot of snow, to an island called Dune. Then by roiling ferry across to here, Heligoland, holy land. It feels something like a pilgrimage for the insane and the desperate, and Veley, a neatly groomed, 44-year-old American, has been on the lookout for signs and wonders. &quot;This is part of my style,&quot; he tells me, gesturing around the bar. &quot;Heligoland: I had no idea about it. So when we got here I waited for something. I saw this piece of paper in the window saying Eiergrog \u2013 &quot;Egg grog&quot; \u2013 and it looked interesting, so I walked past the big wooden fish and came in. My philosophy for travel is this: always plan as if you are going to do a Japanese-style tour and every second is accounted for. But on arrival, abandon all that and do whatever feels right. Eiergrog felt right. And you walk in, there is a pretty girl behind the bar, and you start to understand the place.&quot; Iris, the pretty girl, has just placed two Eiergrogs on the table in front of us: hot, rum-based, raw-egg drinks whisked into a froth. Iris came here six years ago to do a seasonal job from Berlin, met a man, and stayed. &quot;It is,&quot; she says, nodding at the swirling snow outside, the boarded-up beach huts and shop fronts, &quot;better in summer.&quot; She has now met another man and plans to follow him to Australia. There is one other drinker in the bar, an 87-year-old named Herr Westerhaus, sipping glasses of hot gin. He has a daughter in East Anglia and was, he says, a radio signaller here for U-boats during the war. He had so many good memories he came back when he retired. Veley, who slips easily in and out of German, has stories for both Iris and Herr Westerhaus; he has been to all the places they have been. In fact, as it quickly becomes apparent, he has been to all the places anyone has been. Heligoland is number 806 on Veley&apos;s list of visited &quot;countries&quot;. He ticked off all the 193 UN-recognised nations eight years ago, and since then he has been collecting islands and atolls, provinces and protectorates. These days he runs a website called Most Traveled People, which has 8,000 members, mostly, like him, &quot;competitive travellers&quot;, trading stories about Mizoram, Kingman Reef and Rio Muni. He established it, he suggests, in an attempt to bring some rigour to these travellers&apos; tales, to rationalise the globe&apos;s possibilities (and, you imagine, to advertise his own unprecedented wanderlust). It hasn&apos;t, he concedes, always worked out like that. The world of competitive travelling is, well, nothing if not competitive. For a start, deciding what is and what isn&apos;t a separate &quot;country&quot; \u2013 &quot;a discrete geographical, ethnological or political entity&quot; \u2013 threatens to become almost a full-time job in itself. Border disputes are rife. &quot;People put forward nominations and I collect those,&quot; he says. &quot;And whatever has the most nominations becomes a candidate, and then there is a voting process. Spain and France and Italy and several others are now divided into semi-autonomous regions. So it&apos;s getting tougher\u2026&quot; He doubts anyone, not even himself, will ever get the whole list (which currently stands at 871). &quot;We are always adding new places. And there are already some really difficult places out there. Like Scott Island, a New Zealand island toward Antarctica; only six people have ever landed on it.&quot; He says this with a certain frustration. Beyond the attempt to quantify all the world&apos;s remotest corners, there are also ongoing qualitative arguments, mostly about what is meant by the word &quot;visit&quot;. Some travellers claim you must spend a night in a place; some argue it is enough to visit a lavatory there; &quot;others,&quot; Veley suggests, somewhat wearily, &quot;will say you have to sleep on a park bench or do it for less than $10 to make it real. And some people believe you must have cocktails at Annabelle&apos;s or wherever\u2026&quot; Veley has attempted to bring some order to this area, too. Just touching down while on a plane is not enough; Most Traveled People requires a photograph or a passport stamp or a credit card receipt. He recently, he says, personally defined the minimum requirements of what constitutes a &quot;landing&quot; on the North Sea island of Rockall (of shipping forecast fame). He&apos;d had a go at Rockall once before, with his friend, the clubbable castaway Ben Fogle, but the weather had been too tricky and they had turned their sailboat back. This time, with a different group, he set off from Benbecula, and it was beautiful, calm sailing for two days. When they got to Rockall, however, even in those perfect conditions, it was not clear exactly how they might land. &quot;The swell is 7 metres, maybe,&quot; Veley recalls, &quot;and the rock has sheer sides all round with powerful eddies beneath them.&quot; Veley and his fellow travellers circled the rock for half a day, waiting for a change in the sea. &quot;We eventually decided to have a go at one corner that was a bit more craggy and had a skirt of thick kelp attached to it,&quot; he says. Among the crew was a photographer from Stornoway, who donned a wetsuit and jumped on a surfboard. &quot;He timed the swell, grabbed the kelp, found the crag and hauled himself up,&quot; Veley says, &quot;and we were all cheering wildly.&quot; Then it was Veley&apos;s turn. It took him ages to get the wetsuit on. The swell seemed even wilder. He plunged in. &quot;I found the kelp, timed the surge, grabbed the crag, stood up on Rockall for maybe one and a half seconds before the next wave crashed over and knocked me straight back into the sea. But that counts, for sure\u2026&quot; We order two more Eiergrogs. Charles Veley grew up in Brooklyn and never left the United States until he was 18. His parents split up when he was young; money was tight and didn&apos;t extend to foreign holidays. Veley recalls sitting as a boy in the driver&apos;s seat of his father&apos;s car with the Rand McNally map on his knees, planning trips from coast to coast in his head, imagining himself always on the open road. His first attempts at escape came when he was sponsored through his computer science degree at Harvard by the Officer Training Corps of the US Air Force; this was the era of Top Gun and competition for places was intense. Veley topped his year as a trainee fighter pilot before being abruptly dropped from the programme when a routine medical discovered a minute scar on his retina. By that time he was pulling jets out of tailspins and imagining 10 years stationed in remote air bases. He responded to the disappointment by taking a flight over to the UK to see some friends at Cambridge, and from there his addiction to travel began. He took a Eurail pass and was hooked by the possibility. The last time he was in this part of Germany he got off at Hamburg train station and went running round town trying to eat a hamburger. &quot;I had never left the States and suddenly there were borders, passport stamps...&quot; Romance was a part of it, the prospect of unexpected encounters. &quot;I had a three-week coach pass around Britain, too,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I really wanted to go to Dorset because I loved Thomas Hardy, and I wanted to go to Scotland. I remember being in this overnight coach from Birmingham up to the Highlands and there was this redheaded girl sitting next to me. And I remember sort of in the middle of the night we were snogging suddenly. I had a lot of interesting seat mates on coaches.&quot; When he returned to the States, Veley joined with some friends in setting up a dot.com company creating software that delivered business intelligence, helping retailers to understand the buying patterns of consumers. He worked 100-hour weeks and managed some long-haul travel when he could. In 1999 the company, MicroStrategy, floated on the ballooning Nasdaq and the share price peaked at $333. Veley had 500,000 shares. He was about to get married, he was 35, and he decided to retire. &quot;I&apos;d always had a goal to speak five languages,&quot; he says. &quot;I was studying French, German and Italian at night school, and then I thought: why do this? Why not go and live in these places instead? So my wife Kimberly and I went and did a year abroad \u2013 this was 2000. We got two round-the-world tickets and we lived in France and then Germany and then we went down to South Africa, and the geography down there just blew my mind. I realised we could go to Malawi, Botswana. And then we took another year and went to South America. And then I learned about the Travelers&apos; Century Club, which has an entry level of 100 countries.&quot; At the same time he was getting more and more interested in round-the-world tickets. &quot;If you really get into the mechanics of them,&quot; he says, &quot;you can fly first or business and pay much less than economy, and that appealed to the computer side of me, puzzling over algorithms.&quot; Along the way, while he was in Tasmania, Veley discovered by turning on the TV that he was no longer a multimillionaire: the MicroStrategy share price had crashed to 40 cents, but he was too far gone in his travelling to turn back. He figured the shares would bounce back. He booked some more flights. It was when he and his wife were on the way to Hong Kong from Korea and he became excited when he realised they could stop in Taiwan for four hours that he knew he was hooked. For a few years after that Veley averaged around 100 countries per year. Some trips were more efficient than others. He flew to the South Pole in 2003 and took in Argentinian, Australian, British, Chilean, French, New Zealand and Norwegian territories without leaving the same spot \u2013 all countries disputing a single patch of land. The share price did rally somewhat, and he spent, he reckons, more than $1m on plane tickets and freighter passages and sailboat charters: 1m miles of travel in just three years, which took in every place you could name, and plenty you couldn&apos;t: Malyj Vysotskij Island, Zil Elwannyen Sesel, Ogasawara. For much of that time, Veley&apos;s wife accompanied him, clocking up 200 countries herself, but in 2004 they had their first child, and now they have three, aged six, four and two, all autumn births because the Antarctic exploration season ends in February, and by that time Veley had generally been away from home for more than three months. He insists that since his children have been born family has been his priority, but he still pursues his impossible itinerary. When we meet he is midway through a 16-stop round-the-world ticket, en route home for a week in San Francisco to catch the end of Valentine&apos;s Day and take the children off to Disneyland. Then he has a province of Argentina to collect. Veley is telling me all of this while we wander somewhat aimlessly in the sleet and knifing cold, fortified by Eiergrog, up to the high point of Heligoland, past a stark geometric church to a headland spiked with radio masts and overlooking rock stacks washed by the ocean. He takes it all in without too much comment. He doesn&apos;t collect souvenirs, or take photos beyond the odd snap on his iPhone, or jot down notes. Never does. I&apos;m intrigued, of course, by his motivation, but he can&apos;t explain the obsession much except in the blandest terms \u2013 proof positive that you are either a psychologist or an adventurer, but rarely both. &quot;If you want to have a complete worldview you have to go everywhere,&quot; he&apos;ll say. &quot;Every place you learn something new.&quot; Or: &quot;It&apos;s an investment in life experience. Whenever I meet anyone, no matter where they are from, I can always relate to them.&quot; Or: &quot;While I&apos;m alive I just want to see as much of the world as I can. I&apos;m organised; I have a computer background.&quot; When I mention the environmental impact of his travels, he brushes the question aside. &quot;I care about the environment just like you,&quot; he says. The challenge itself is sometimes enough of a motivation. Palmyra Atoll (population: 8; bars: 1) is maintained by Nature Conservancy in the US. In his enquiries about how he might get there, Veley was referred to a woman named Nancy at the Conservancy offices in Vermont. She suggested to him that the only people who ever got to go to Palmyra Atoll were those who made at least a &quot;six-figure contribution to Nature Conservancy&quot;. To Veley this was fighting talk. &quot;I can be quite persistent,&quot; he says, on deserted Heligoland, with a degree of understatement. In the end he chartered a boat out of Hawaii with a few others to share the cost. &quot;We finally arrived at Palmyra some days later,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The bar is a run-down wooden structure built 30 years ago and yachties had written stuff on the walls. I wrote a &apos;Poem to Nancy&apos;: &apos;Palmyra is nice/great palm trees and sand/please lower the price/from one hundred grand\u2026&apos;&quot; It seems almost redundant to ask Veley about his favourite places, though from time to time \u2013 he has a weirdly accurate memory for names and events \u2013 he will suggest how he had a fine time on St Kilda, or he&apos;ll let slip that everyone loves country and western music on Pitcairn. The strangest place he&apos;s ever been was the &quot;conference room&quot; between North and South Korea, in Panmunjom, two nations staring at each other. The scariest: Afghanistan on the first anniversary of 9/11. He once made a list of all the worst things that had happened to him: the time a tree frog urinated on his forehead in Tortuguero, or when his canoe capsized in the Zambezi, among hippos, or when he waited for three days for a boat out of Christmas Island, and when it arrived he went to introduce himself to the captain before their 1,000-mile voyage only to discover him drunk, stoned, naked and masturbating in his cabin. The urge to travel to Veley&apos;s extent, a kind of attention deficit on a global scale, has a medical diagnosis: dromomania, the addiction to new experiences, the vagabond neurosis. He&apos;s a curious case, though. While most dromomaniacs are permanently wedded to the road, Veley is both rooted and adrift, very settled, he insists, and almost permanently travelling. His rivals \u2013 nearly all of them acquaintances \u2013 have sometimes claimed that what Veley does is not really travel at all: it&apos;s too systematic, there&apos;s no depth to it, not enough danger. He became friendly with John Clouse, who for many years was the Guinness world record holder as the most travelled man (before Guinness decided to abandon the category, as there were too many conflicting criteria). Clouse, a lawyer from Indiana, went through six marriages before his death two years ago at 82. &quot;He tended to find a new wife and travel with her, and then she would realise what was involved,&quot; Veley explains. About three-quarters of the travellers on his website are men, though the &quot;leaderboard&quot; used to include a woman who claimed all sorts of incredible journeys. She had claimed, for example, that she had been to Mount Athos, the Greek monastic state into which only males are allowed, arguing that when she was a girl her father had cut her hair short and taken her in. Veley asked for proof of some of her exploits and she immediately removed herself. The table currently shows a man named Bill Altaffer slightly ahead of Veley, but though Veley doesn&apos;t doubt Altaffer&apos;s &quot;been all over the place&quot; he suggests that Altaffer refuses to always provide the evidence required, and that their paths don&apos;t cross too often, and &quot;it is, I guess,&quot; Veley says, &quot;not worth worrying too much about&quot;. One of the things that his years of waiting for planes and boats has taught him is that, try as you might, you can&apos;t force situations. &quot;I remember on my initial Euro trip it was late afternoon and I was in Rome and I couldn&apos;t go in the Vatican because I was wearing shorts. I remember thinking: this is the only chance I will ever have. I was wrong.&quot; The first time he tried to get to the North Pole on an icebreaker from Svalbard they got stuck in the ice at 86 and a quarter degrees latitude. He went back the next year and made it. &quot;Things will come round again&quot; is his mantra. His only assets, he suggests \u2013 beyond, that is, his financial resources \u2013 are patience and politeness in negotiating the world&apos;s officialdom. To that I would add a certain sure sense of restlessness, of giving the impression of being on the way somewhere else, of nowhere being a final destination. On the boat back to the airstrip on Dune we find ourselves in the cabin of the Heligoland ferry with half a dozen German men in their sixties, who appear to have been at the Eiergrog all day. Discovering we speak English they launch into a rousing version of &quot;What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor&quot; as the small boat pitches across the bay. They come here every year, one of the more sober members of the group explains to me as we approach the airstrip. Have been doing so for 40 years, always this weekend in February, always this place. &quot;Nothing changes. Friends, the same. Heligoland, the same. That&apos;s how we like it,&quot; he says. Charles Veley joins in with the singing, files away the experience neatly, but I&apos;m guessing he is also planning what to do later in Hamburg, and thinking about tomorrow morning&apos;s flight, and the one after, and the one after that. Novelty can have its own monotony, too.

Britain&apos;s biggest insurance firm confirmed that it has reached agreement to take control of AIA, following a weekend of negotiations. The deal will radically change Prudential&apos;s business, making it the biggest operator in the Asian insurance market. Prudential will pay AIG $25bn in cash plus $10.5bn in shares. To finance the acquisition, the company plans to raise $21bn from its investors, including around $1bn of fees to investment bankers to arrange the cash call. This breaks the previous record held by Lloyds Banking Group, which conducted a \u00a313.5bn ($20.2bn) cash call last November. Shares in Prudential plunged by 12% after the deal was announced, losing 64.5p to 538p. They had been suspended earlier this morning before trading began. Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Prudential, said the deal will create a &quot;unique life insurance business&quot;. &quot;This transaction is hugely exciting and a one-off opportunity to transform the group,&quot; said Thiam, who was appointed as CEO almost a year ago. &quot;Asia has been very clearly a major driver of value for Prudential for several years and in 2009 it accounted for 44% of new business profit after tax. The combined group would have 60% of 2009 new-business profit coming from Asia and puts us in a strong leadership position in all the critical growth markets in the region,&quot; he explained. Thiam also confirmed that Prudential&apos;s headquarters will remain in London, and said that the UK remained &quot;key&quot; to the company&apos;s future prospects. Once the deal is finalised, Prudential will combine AIA with its existing Asian operations. The combined company will be the leading life insurer in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. &quot;The significantly increased scale of operations is expected to enhance customer choice and service,&quot; Prudential pledged. AIG said that the proceeds of the sale will be used to pay off some of the $85bn bailout it received from the US government in September 2008."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/01/prudential-tidjane-thiam-profile", "sentences": ["Tidjane Thiam is already on the frequent flyer list at Singapore Airlines."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-01T18:44:28Z", "title": "Tidjane Thiam's journey from Ivory Coast to summit of global capital", "tags": ["Prudential", "AIG", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Tidjane Thiam"], "article": "Tidjane Thiam is already on the frequent flyer list at Singapore Airlines. In a couple of days the Prudential chief executive will be booking flights months in advance as he attempts to persuade staff at Hong Kong-based American International Assurance (AIA) that falling into the arms of a British insurer will be good for them. As much as 40% of his time over the next year could be spent addressing managers, staff, and major shareholders from Vietnam to the Philippines, he said . If it sounds like a gruelling schedule for the 47 year old, he said it was the least he could expect after embarking on a \u00a324bn takeover of an exclusively Asian business, albeit one owned by AIG of the US. Many of his managers are former AIA staff and are expected to ease the transition. But resistance could still be high among high-flyers who benefited from the tight-knit and reputedly aggressive selling culture at AIA. Thiam, who earns \u00a3875,000 a year with a bonus scheme which could double that, will see his diplomacy skills put to the test. Born in the Ivory Coast and educated in France, he embarked on a career in business, then politics and then back again. A stint in his 20s at McKinsey ended when he moved back to Ivory Coast and became a government minister. A coup saw him back in Paris after a spell under house arrest and back into the arms of McKinsey. He first came to prominence in the UK after a high profile move to Aviva, but a new chief executive meant the way to the top job was blocked. After only a few months as European boss, he switched to the Pru, where his predecessor Mark Tucker was preparing to quit. He took over last March amid a glut of profiles heralding the first black chief executive of a FTSE 100 company. Thiam has resisted the tag, which he believes presents him in a one-dimensional light. While he is not from the most privileged background \u2013 his father was a journalist who was imprisoned before fleeing with a four-year Thiam and family to Paris \u2013 his elegant manner and easy-going charm detracts from a classic rags to riches story. That said, he has needed to confront prejudice in his ascent to the top. He told the Guardian in 2007 that his frustration with job rejections led him to be increasingly blunt. &quot;I was tired of the usual answer, which is &apos;we like you, you are a great guy but this is a division with 10,000 employees and we just don&apos;t think they would understand having someone like you at the helm&apos;. I was told that a number of times and I was getting a bit tired.&quot; &quot;I said, &apos;frankly, you need to tell them that you found someone who is black, African, Francophone and 6ft 4&apos;.&quot; Pru insiders said the AIA deal had been a long time in the planning and was the brainchild of Tucker, who spent much of his working life in the far east. Thiam, the theory goes, was left to execute the deal. Tucker, a Chelsea fan, knew and recruited most of the Pru&apos;s directors in the far east and was equipped with the locker-room jocularity needed to bring opposing groups together. The Arsenal supporting Thiam, will rely, like his team, on silkier skills. The pressure will be on, especially knowing that countless business studies have shown that despite the initial euphoria most mergers and acquisitions fail to deliver anticipated benefits to shareholders, employees or customers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/01/prudential-american-international-assurance-merger", "sentences": ["The combined company will be the leading life insurer in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-01T20:58:15Z", "title": "Prudential gambles on Asia with $35bn deal", "tags": ["Prudential", "AIG", "Insurance industry", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Rights issues"], "article": "  Prudential, Britain&apos;s largest insurer, shook off the gloom that has dogged the City for the last two years with a record-busting financing package to fund a \u00a323bn agreed takeover of Hong-Kong-based American International Assurance. The acquisition signals a major push by the insurer into China and the Far East, where AIA was its main rival, with 20 million customers. In a show of financial strength, Prudential told investors more than two-thirds of the sale will be funded through a \u00a313.5bn rights issue \u2013 the largest ever seen in London \u2013 with the balance paid in shares and a \u00a33.3bn bond issue. With the cost of the takeover set at about $1bn in broker fees and insurance against currency movements, some traders said the magnitude of the deal partly accounted for the sharp fall in sterling today. Several City analysts welcomed the deal, which they said allowed the Pru a rapid expansion into the fastest growing markets of China, Korea and Indonesia, which have built up huge savings in recent years but have relatively undeveloped investment and insurance markets.. Others said they needed to know more about AIA before they could judge whether the takeover justified the rights issue, when the price of shares on offer would only be announced in May and proceeds will nearly equal Prudential&apos;s current market value of about $15bn. AIA was caught up in the collapse of AIG in September 2008 and has struggled to emerge from its shadow. An $180bn rescue package by the US Treasury has proved hugely controversial and the White House has been under pressure to retrieve taxpayer funds through sell-offs. In contrast, most UK insurers came through the financial crisis largely unscathed after they were forced to put aside large capital buffers following a stock market crash in 2003. The UK insurance market, the second largest in the world, is considered to be well placed to expand while rivals such as AIG are forced to sell off parts of their business. AIG had planned to float AIA in Hong Kong but said yesterday it would be quicker and give greater certainty to sell the business to Prudential. It said the proceeds of the sale would be used to repay some of the government bailout. Prudential shares fell 12% to 530p yesterday against a slightly higher FTSE 100, while AIG shares were up 6% at $26.30. &quot;(The deal) is going to be enormously dilutive,&quot; said ING analyst Kevin Ryan. &quot;No one knows exactly what AIA contains or how profitable it is, or how it overlaps with Pru&apos;s existing businesses.&quot; Pru chief executive Tidjane Thiam rejected concerns that profits could be jeopardised. He said: &quot;Transformational is an overused word, but this deal is truly transformational.&quot; He conceded that AIA&apos;s results last year were down and it was difficult for outsiders to measure the operation&apos;s success, but he claimed the AIA bosses had presented a &quot;clean&quot; business for sale. &quot;It is is true that it was less profitable than the Pru&apos;s Asian businesses and it is bouncing back from a very difficult year. But it is a business at an inflexion point, which is what I like about it. We are catching it at a very good time.&quot; Thiam said the wider picture in Asia, including the potential for growth in China, was a crucial reason for the deal. &quot;Asia has been very clearly a major driver of value for Prudential for several years and in 2009 it accounted for 44% of new business profit after tax. The combined group would have 60% of 2009 new-business profit coming from Asia and puts us in a strong leadership position in all the critical growth markets in the region,&quot; he said. Thiam also confirmed that Prudential&apos;s global headquarters will remain in London, and said that the UK remained &quot;key&quot; to the company&apos;s prospects.

The combined company will be the leading life insurer in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. It was unclear how the company would operate after Thiam said the AIA brand would remain. AIA has 320,000 tied agents who have long seen the Pru&apos;s 400,000 employees as their main rivals. Competition rules in some countries could also force the sale of some divisions. The insurer&apos;s results for 2009 emphasised the shift away from the UK to more lucrative foreign markets. Sales in the UK market fell 12% as the company refused to write unprofitable business or sell products backed by large amounts of capital. Pru&apos;s main UK rival, Aviva, has also looked abroad for profits, chiefly in the US and Europe, though it has a small but fast growing business in India and other countries in Asia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/02/singapore-travelfoodanddrink", "sentences": ["Singaporeans have two passions: shopping and eating.", "The many Chinese restaurants show Singapore is a melting pot of mainland Chinese."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-02T09:00:00Z", "title": "Singapore: Chinese herbalists cook up a storm", "tags": ["Singapore holidays", "Food and drink", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Singaporeans have two passions: shopping and eating.

The conventional answer is no. But elements of an Asian way are gradually emerging. Given Asia&apos;s growing influence, the world should pay attention \u2013 and may have much to gain. The key to understanding Asian approaches is their pragmatism. Asians constantly adapt and change. In the past, Asians put a premium on protecting their sovereignty and were wary of any multilateral approaches that could dilute it. Now, in response to global challenges \u2013 for example pandemics, financial crises and climate change \u2013 the vast majority of Asian countries understand that collective action does not erode, but instead protects, sovereignty. For example, despite losing faith in the International Monetary Fund after the region&apos;s financial crisis in 1997, they agreed to contribute billions to the IMF after the recent global financial meltdown. There has also been another significant shift in Asian attitudes. Instead of legitimacy, or simply getting more seats at the table to provide input, the discussion in Asia is increasingly about outputs: how to create institutions that are more effective. At the same time, reflecting their pragmatism, the Asians remain ready to accept continuing American leadership and domination of global institutions. Nor do they challenge the US-led security umbrella for the Asia-Pacific region. At a recent workshop that we co-chaired in Singapore, the inevitable question was raised: can Asians lead in meeting global challenges? The responses from the Chinese and Indian participants were striking. They argued that by taking care of more than two billion people \u2013 and taking care of them well \u2013 both China and India were already making a major contribution to global stability and order. That is a reasonable response. Indeed, if the vast majority of the four billion Asians continue to improve their livelihoods, the world would become a better place. Still, there are both positive and negative aspects of the Asian approach to the challenges of global governance. The positive aspects include respect for diversity and an emphasis on consensus-building over conflict, practical solutions over lofty principles, and gradualism over abrupt change. On the other hand, the desire to avoid confrontation can prevent meaningful agreements from being reached in a reasonable timeframe, and the appearance of consensus may merely mask the true politics at work. Drawing on the positive aspects of the Asian way suggests the possibility of more inclusive decision-making in the institutions of global governance. The danger in such an approach is that decisions may not be taken, or that those that are put rhetoric ahead of substance, thereby failing to resolve fundamental political challenges. So what might this mean in practice? Here are a few areas in which Asia \u2013 or, more properly, Asians \u2013 can contribute to solving some key global challenges: Peace and security Asia includes many new naval powers, such as China and India, which could help bolster the security of sea lanes by creating partnerships with traditional naval powers such as the US. Various Asian countries joined efforts to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia. China is developing a deployable police capacity that may provide an important new tool in peace operations in fragile states. Climate change Asia needs to build up innovative markets that enable technology transfer. China, Japan and Korea have become leading producers of green technology. Asian governments are in a position to take the lead in developing alternative energy sources. Financial regulation Asian countries need to take more leadership in regulating financial markets. China, questioning the wisdom of putting the fate of the world economy in the US dollar, has proposed the creation of a global currency. Progress has been made on the Chiang Mai Initiative \u2013 a multilateral currency swap arrangement among the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations members, China, Japan, and South Korea \u2013 and the possibility of an Asian Monetary Fund remains on (or at least not far off) the table. Health Asia&apos;s experience in dealing with Sars, bird flu, H1N1 and other diseases should be studied carefully \u2013 for both positive and negative lessons \u2013 with a view to developing a new global consensus on handling pandemics. Social enterprises Asia has emerged as a leader in social entrepreneurship. The successes of social businesses such as Grameen Bank and Brac in Bangladesh have contributed to renewed thinking about how social objectives can be fused with revenue-generating practices. In short, there is no coherent or systematic Asian approach to meeting global challenges. In response to each challenge, Asians respond pragmatically. But, given that some of the biggest challenges are the result of failed policies, pragmatism may offer a constructive way forward.

Photograph: Random House/PA    There have been so many journeys. The Journey was the title chosen in 2004 by diva Donna Summer to best describe a collection of her disco classics. Also a 1959 Hollywood potboiler starring Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner about the Soviet occupation of Hungary. Even now, it is the title under which the US self-help guru Brandon Bays offers &quot;cutting-edge transformation and healing work&quot;. And so Tony Blair should not have been surprised when politicians and publishers stood underwhelmed by his decision to call his memoir, the book that sparked the biggest political bidding war in British political history, The Journey. Where is the gravitas, asked some, perusing the celebrity tell-all cover picture of a half smiling Blair, dressed in a black jacket with an opened necked shirt? What does this tell us about him, asked the New Statesman; especially when set against accounts produced by other former prime ministers: Harold Wilson \u2013 The Making of A Prime Minister. Margaret Thatcher \u2013 The Downing Street Years? Still, the book, which was written by Blair himself rather than a ghostwriter and is scheduled for publication in September, has already earned him a colossal advance, said to be around \u00a35m. It will go on sale simultaneously in the UK \u2014 where it will sell for \u00a325 \u2014 the US and Canada, and with huge sales anticipated in all those territories, Blair is expected to garner significant royalty earnings. Translation rights have been sold to 12 territories. Blair will also create an audio version and publishers Random House will make an e-book available. He will then embark on an international publicity tour. But what will he say? Few clear pointers from the man yesterday. &quot;I have tried to write a book which describes the human as much as the political dimensions of life as prime minister. Though necessarily retrospective, it is an attempt to inform and shape current and future thinking as much as an historical account of the past. Most of all I want readers to have as much pleasure reading it as I had writing it.&quot; As expected, the description provided by his publisher, Gail Rebuck, was more effusive. The chief executive of Random House, is married to Lord Gould, pollster of choice throughout Blair&apos;s reign over Labour and at No 10. &quot;Tony Blair&apos;s The Journey will break new ground in prime ministerial memoirs just as Blair himself broke the mould of British politics,&quot; said Rebuck. &quot;His book is frank, open, revealing and written in an intimate and accessible style. As an account of the nature and uses of power, it will have a readership that extends well beyond politics.&quot; According to Sonny Mehta, his US publisher, the anticipation is just as great over there. &quot;Tony Blair is an extremely popular figure in North America. His memoir is refreshing, both for its candour and vivid portrayal of political life,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;We all knew Blair was an extraordinary statesman and gifted thinker. We can now add exceptional writer to that list.&quot; These blurbs do nothing to address the appetite to find out just how much detail Blair chooses to share about the Iraq war, his relationship with George Bush, his dealmaking in Northern Ireland, the intervention in Kosovo, his battles with Saddam \u2013 or his battles with Gordon. Still, commercially, he will be pushing at an open door. &quot;This is a book that people have been anticipating since the moment Tony Blair left office, and should be the bestselling political memoir since Margaret Thatcher&apos;s,&quot; said Andrew Lake, the politics buyer for Waterstones. It is astonishing that Blair found time to write the book at all. Since leaving office he surged ahead to a role as the envoy in the Middle East for the UN, the EU and Russia. In 2008, Blair launched his Faith Foundation. The following year, it was the Faith and Globalisation Initiative, launched with Yale University. There have been advisory roles and event appearances in Paris and Singapore and the US, a period that has led to speculation that he has made about \u00a310m since leaving office. For all that, there was an accord between Blair and Brown which ruled out the book&apos;s publishing before the next election. And with that in mind, is Gordon looking forward to it, reporters asked No10 yesterday? &quot;He hasn&apos;t specifically mentioned that book, but I know he has a wide-ranging interest in books,&quot; replied the prime minister&apos;s spokesman. Even tomes with dodgy titles."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/mar/05/prudential", "sentences": ["Both Qatar and Singapore&apos;s biggest fund GIC have both agreed to back the fundraising, which will be used to part-fund the Pru&apos;s \u00a323bn purchase of the far eastern businesses of AIG.", "The first reports that Qatar Holding LLC and Singapore Investment Corp have agreed to underwrite a &apos;significant portion&apos; of the rights issue."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-05T08:19:11Z", "title": "Prudential pushes higher as Qatar and Singapore back cash call", "tags": ["Prudential", "Business"], "article": "Prudential is pushing higher again following last night&apos;s news that two sovereign wealth funds have agreed to underwrite a chunk of the insurer&apos;s \u00a314bn rights issue.

Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said:  We note the announcement that an additional 30 banks are set to get involved with Pru&apos;s $20bn rights issue, to fund the AIA deal.

There is clearly a long way to go before completion of this deal, vulnerable as it is to the vagaries of the macro-economic environment\u2026be it pound versus dollar or the general economic climate in Asia.  However, to us, this announcement should allay any market fears over the potential demand for Pru stock in the placing, thus reducing the likelihood of aggressive &apos;shorting&apos; by hedge funds. This is especially the case with the confirmation that two major sovereign funds are keen to participate.

And what does it all mean? The 39-year-old, originally from Belgrade, passionately believes units of information \u2013 not particles \u2013 are the building blocks of humanity and everything that surrounds us. Information, he maintains, is what came before everything else. It is akin to God. Vedral has set out his argument in a new book, Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information (OUP), in which he explains faith, love and teleportation. What information is important at the quantum level, and how does it help us understand the origins of the universe?  At first sight, all types of information look very different from one another. For example, contrast thermodynamics \u2013 how chaotic a system is \u2013 with the information in your genome. You&apos;d say: what on earth is the relationship between these two types of information? One looks much more orderly, the living system, while the other is disorder. But it&apos;s actually one and the same information\u2026 you actually need very little to define the concept of information in the first place. When you strip out all the unnecessary baggage, at the core is the concept of probability. You need randomness, some uncertainty that something will happen, to let you describe what you want to describe. Once you have a probability that something might happen, then you can define information. And it&apos;s the same information in physics, in thermodynamics, in economics. Quantum physicists think of the universe as being made up of particles and strings. Are you suggesting that information is superior to these physical properties? It depends on what you ultimately aim to explain. In science, we start with a certain basic set of laws, like the ones described by particle physics. These laws rely on quantum mechanics and relativity and so on. We start from them and try to describe everything else \u2013 subatomic, atomic, larger objects and, ultimately, the universe. But the simple question raised at the end is: where do these laws come from? In science, we&apos;re criticised for being unable to go beyond these laws to explain their origins. It&apos;s what philosophers call an infinite regression: you give me an explanation, but I can ask where that comes from. We never seem to be able to end the list of questions. I think information is the only concept capable of almost explaining itself, of closing this circle. How are you not conflating information with a God or another deity? The common answer is that there was some kind of original creator of this information. The trouble is that this answer doesn&apos;t really solve anything because as a physicist I&apos;d also like to understand this being itself. I&apos;d like to explain the origin of God. And then you encounter the same infinite regression. For a scientist, &quot;Why is there a universe? Well, because something even more complicated created it the way it is&quot; isn&apos;t an explanation. We want a better answer than that. You can argue that science will never get there, that it&apos;s an open-ended enterprise. Maybe this is faith. But we also have a set of beliefs in science. We believe in one method of understanding the ultimate, secure truth: the scientific method. We make a conjecture. We try to refute it as far as we can. Those conjectures that survive longest are those that currently define the laws of nature. We&apos;re not dogmatic about it at all; if you have compelling evidence that something is wrong, we are very happy to upgrade ourselves to the new theory. Of course you can always challenge me and ask why I believe this is the only way to understand the world. The only answer is that it makes sense to me. I find it better than anything else. How can you explain the emergence of free will, of faith, of any subjective construct if information defined in your theory is binary, a yes or a no? The things you describe are far too complicated to easily derive within physics, but I do believe one day that we will be able to explain complicated phenomena such as love, for example. I just don&apos;t think anyone yet knows how to approach it. But quantum mechanics does bring all kinds of shades of grey between the binary digits. The perspective of classical physics governed by Newtonian laws describes the world as deterministic, and that there is no randomness. But the key concept behind information is probability: if you could compute and predict everything, as we could if the world really was classical, there would be no concept of surprise and there&apos;d be no information. Everything would be clear, from the beginning to the end of the universe. Somehow we need a genuine randomness that can&apos;t be explained by anything more fundamental. That&apos;s the key concept for explaining everything out of nothing. To reduce humanity to this idea of mathematical quantification implies that we can be recreated by having the right recipe and ingredients. We can take a particle of light, a photon, and we can recreate this photon in a different lab that&apos;s hundreds of kilometres away. We can do the same thing with an atom, and smaller objects. Human beings are ultimately nothing but a collection of atoms. If we apply this same teleport scheme, resulting in another copy of yourself somewhere else, what does that mean? Would you really be yourself? Or would the teleported self be another person with the same physical features who might not feel the same? As far as we know, this would have to be your self there. But we can only wait until an experiment is done to test this. Are we at an important point in our human history in terms of how we generate, synthesise and understand information? A good analogy is if you put yourself in the perspective of the people who, in the early 1920s, had just discovered the laws of quantum physics. They said it&apos;s extremely difficult to apply this to even the simplest of atoms. Then along comes someone else who says: &quot;I have a piece of solid \u2013 10 to the power of 24 atoms \u2013 and you&apos;re telling me you&apos;re finding it hard to understand a single atom? How on earth will we understand a whole solid?&quot; In fact, this happened very shortly afterwards. It&apos;s called solid-state physics and it&apos;s the basis of all modern technology. Being negative by saying that it looks too complicated has always been refuted by scientists. That&apos;s why I believe there is hope for us to understand more and more."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/08/f1-2010-force-india-team-guide", "sentences": ["Nick Heidfeld after their crash at Singapore said it was time Sutil got a brain."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-08T14:00:01Z", "title": "F1 2010: Force India team guide", "tags": ["Force India", "Formula One", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "In the green and orange corner Drinking.

But it was only after a number of technical glitches had been sorted out that the public was finally allowed aboard in March 2000 \u2013 10 years ago this week. Since then, well over 30 million people have taken the vertiginous but breathtaking half-hour journey, in air-conditioned capsules, up and around what was, until two years ago, the world&apos;s biggest ferris wheel. That honour now belongs to the Singapore Flyer; with a height of 165 metres, it outranks the London Eye by a full 30 metres. But, while the Flyer looks like a gigantic version of a 19th-century original (the first of the breed, designed by George Washington Ferris, began revolving at the 1893 World&apos;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago), the London Eye is a fighter jet to Singapore&apos;s biplane. The Eye has since become as much a part of tourist London as Westminster Abbey, the Tower and Big Ben; a friendly curiosity, an urban eye-catcher, and an engineering wonder to compare with the Eiffel Tower. When it was first announced, though, it was hard not to think that the London Eye was going to be some sort of Victorian throwback, an enormous music hall-era fun-fair ride among London&apos;s new wave of challenging millennium monuments\u2013 Tate Modern, the Millennium Bridge and the Millennium Dome itself. At the time of its opening, the joke went that the Eye was a perfect symbol of contemporary British political culture, going around and around uselessly and getting nowhere in the process. When, however, the design by the architects Marks Barfield was unveiled, most doubts were cast aside. The husband-and-wife team had come up with a striking and rather beautiful hi-tech big wheel. It wasn&apos;t just the high-spec design that drew attention, it was the bravura manner in which the Eye&apos;s prefabricated components were brought up the Thames on river barges to Jubilee Gardens, and the week-long drama during which, inch by inch, the giant wheel was raised from the river and up into place alongside County Hall. Now, every view in and through Westminster, and along the Thames, was changed. Suddenly, this spidery and beautifully resolved ferris wheel crowned Victorian terraces, filled unexpected views along avenues of plane trees and sat like a tiara atop government offices. Perhaps its best aspect is that it also offers awe-inspiring and uninterrupted views over London. From up top on a clear day, the entire city can be peered down upon and encompassed. The patterns of London&apos;s growth can be seen spreading into subtopia and the green belt like rings marking the age of venerable trees. Rides on the Eye in rain, snow or at night offer their own haunting attractions. Of London&apos;s deafeningly trumpeted rival millennium projects, the Eye has been, perhaps, the most endearing. The Dome was undermined by the unforgivably crass and soulless Millennium Experience exhibition of 2000; it was many years before it redeemed itself as today&apos;s O2 music venue. The Millennium Bridge linking Tate Modern and St Paul&apos;s Cathedral wobbled, and it was some while before its virtues could be discerned. Tate Modern became almost too popular for its own good, a heaving cultural souk \u2013 acutely in need of its planned extension \u2013 where art can occasionally be seen between massed heads and shoulders. Other millennium projects, such as the refurbishment of the Royal Opera House, were fine things, yet tame in terms of fresh design. The London Eye was always a brave and daring adventure, a throwback to 1951&apos;s Festival of Britain, held on the same site \u2013 an era when Britain could still claim to lead the world (just) in supersonic-era design and engineering. It looks to the past as well as the future."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2010/mar/08/londn-2012-olympics-kate-hoey-legacy", "sentences": ["Hoey has attacked the Government for forgetting the promises made about changing the sporting face of Britain when 2012 made their pitch to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore in 2005.", "Some people within government have taken their eye of the ball because they are concentrating on the Olympic Park and have forgotten the promises made in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-09T17:22:33Z", "title": "Uncertainty about Olympic legacy continues", "tags": ["London", "London politics", "Olympic Games 2012", "Boris Johnson", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "I was planning to fillet Kate Hoey&apos;s interview with Mihir Bose in today&apos;s Standard, but the Beeb&apos;s Adrian Warner got there first.

During the day nothing happens at Wembley. I&apos;m aware somebody has to keep their eye on football or the public purse will get literally screwed.  And then:  I think there has been a government failure on legacy. They have not said what they mean. Some people within government have taken their eye of the ball because they are concentrating on the Olympic Park and have forgotten the promises made in Singapore.  She&apos;s talking the sports participation legacy, of course - her job is to help make sure there is one. This is the aspect of the Games I&apos;m most pessimistic about. My grumpy expectation is that they will inspire almost no one to take up sport for much more than a week. If you want to invest in helping people to get fitter, how about funding more wardens in parks and ensuring fewer cars are on the streets?

The manifesto pulls together a number of technology proposals that the Conservatives have floated in the runup to the general election, including promising superfast broadband connections of 100Mbps to most Britons and opening up data on contracts and public sector salaries. The Tories are looking to outdo Labour by promising improved broadband speeds. Labour set a target of universal access of 2Mbps by 2012. The Tories promise 50 times that but to most citizens, not to everyone. Most current superfast broadband technologies are limited to short distances from central switching offices, and most companies focus on cities where the cost of deployment is offset by lots of customers in a relatively small area. Virgin Media has announced a trial using telegraph poles to connect rural areas to its fibre optic network, which will offer 50-megabit per second broadband to Woolhampton in Berkshire. If this proves successful, the company says that more than a million homes could be connected to its network via telegraph poles. The government is considering a change to planning guidelines that would allow for the large-scale building of overhead cabling for faster broadband, and the Conservatives have said part of their technology plans rely on changes to easing planning rules. However, the last mile will only be part of the challenge. Geoff Bennett, product director at network technology company Infinera, said: &quot;Without a complete examination of core (and metro, and so-called second mile) networks and a technology overhaul, there is a risk that the entire network would come to a screaming halt the day the 100 megabit access pipes were turned on.&quot; Rather than the controversial 50p a month levy on fixed-line phones proposed in the digital economy bill to pay for broadband rollout, the Tories promise to &quot;unleash private sector investment to build this superfast broadband network by opening up network infrastructure, easing planning rules and boosting competition&quot;. The party points to Singapore and South Korea, where such strategies have worked. However, Singapore is a city-state with the third highest population density in the world. Unlike the UK, it has very few rural areas. South Korea has a population density 10 times the global average and most its residents live in major cities, also making it much easier to deploy superfast broadband to most of its population. If private sector investment does not achieve the desired target, the Conservatives would consider taking some of the licence fee settlement from the BBC currently dedicated to digital switchover. In addition to trying to best Labour with their broadband plans, the Conservatives are trying to outdo the government&apos;s open-data plans, pledging to open up data on smaller contracts and information on public sector pay. Their technology proposals also include changes to IT procurement so that large projects would be broken into smaller components and opened to small and medium-size businesses. They also want to create a &quot;government skunkworks&quot; to speed the development of low-cost IT projects. The technology manifesto is couched in terms of economic development. Quoting Nesta, the Conservatives say their plans for a superfast broadband network will create 600,000 jobs and add \u00a318bn to Britain&apos;s GDP. For their open-data proposals, they cite new research by Dr Rufus Pollock of Cambridge University which says open-data programmes could create \u00a36bn in additional value to the UK. Apart from the internet and IT, the manifesto also called for the creation of a high-speed rail network and a smart electrical grid. The Conservatives&apos; technology manifesto contains little about controversial changes to copyright and the anti-piracy measures in the digital economy bill. It says only: &quot;We recognise the need to tackle digital piracy and make it possible for people to buy and sell digital intellectual property online. However, it is vital that any anti-piracy measures promote new business models rather than holding innovation back.&quot; The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for on digital rights issues, called the Conservatives&apos; plan &quot;contradictory&quot;. Its executive director, Jim Killock, said: &quot;These are welcome ideas, but it is totally contradictory to propose building a future dependent on the internet and support Labour&apos;s plan to disconnect families as a punishment. The Open Rights Group calls for Cameron to ditch support for disconnection, which would kill open Wi-Fi, damage businesses and libraries and punish the innocent.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/11/un-calls-war-crime-investigation-burma", "sentences": ["In a break with the past, Obama met General Thein Sein, the Burmese prime minister, at a regional summit in Singapore in November."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-11T19:02:22Z", "title": "UN calls for war crimes investigation in Burma", "tags": ["Human rights", "United Nations", "North Korea", "Aung San Suu Kyi", "World news", "War crimes", "Law", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "A senior UN official has called for Burma&apos;s military rulers to be investigated over allegations of crimes against humanity and war crimes perpetrated against Burmese civilians, in a move that will sharply increase pressure on the isolated regime ahead of controversial national elections due later this year. In a draft report to the UN Human Rights Council [pdf] in Geneva, Tom\u00e1s Ojea Quintana, special rapporteur on human rights in Burma, described &quot;a pattern of gross and systematic violation of human rights&quot; which he said has been in place for many years and still continued. &quot;There is an indication that those human rights violations are the result of a state policy that involves authorities in the executive, military and judiciary at all levels,&quot; he said. The draft, published on the council&apos;s website, goes on: &quot;The possibility exists that some of these [violations] may entail categories of crimes against humanity, or war crimes, under the terms of the statute of the international criminal court.&quot; In this context, Quintana said the UN security council should consider setting up a &quot;commission of inquiry with a specific, fact-finding mandate to address the question of international crimes&quot;. The unusually tough assessment came as the junta today published a tranche of new electoral laws that restrict the ability of opposition parties to participate in the coming elections. The special rapporteur said national elections, expected in October, provided an opportunity for positive change, but he was pessimistic that the junta would allow the chance to be seized. &quot;During his last mission [in February], the special rapporteur received no indication that all prisoners of conscience will be released, that freedom of opinion and association will be guaranteed in the context of these elections, and that ethnic communities will be able to fully participate,&quot; the report said. The pressure group Burma Campaign UK today welcomed what it said was an unprecedented UN intervention, calling it a &quot;major step forward&quot; that would increase pressure on the US, British and regional governments to take a tougher line with the generals. The US and EU have imposed limited sanctions on the regime. But since taking office last year, Barack Obama has pursued a policy of diplomatic engagement, holding several senior-level meetings. In a break with the past, Obama met General Thein Sein, the Burmese prime minister, at a regional summit in Singapore in November. Analysts say Burma&apos;s military ties to North Korea are a major concern for Washington. It fears the generals may follow Pyongyang in developing nuclear weapons. The possibility of war crimes proceedings against members of the junta may complicate US efforts at dialogue, which are already under hostile fire in the US Congress. Pressure to set up an international commission of inquiry into Burma has previously come from NGOs and activists involved in the country, and from Archbishop Desmond Tutu. In Britain, more than 170 MPs have signed a parliamentary motion calling on the British government to support an inquiry. Burma&apos;s main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD) led by the jailed Nobel peace prizewinner Aung San Suu Kyi, has repeatedly drawn attention to widespread, ongoing human rights abuses, including the jailing of 2,000 political prisoners. It also says the planned elections will not be free or fair. The junta&apos;s unveiling of new restrictive electoral laws today has strengthened the impression that the polls will be closely controlled and designed to lend the regime a veneer of democratic respectability. The new rules effectively prevent Aung San Suu Kyi and her jailed supporters from standing for election. They establish a government-controlled election oversight body with the power to prevent or annul voting in any part of the country for &quot;security reasons&quot;. The junta has also formally declared the 1990 elections, which the NLD won in a landslide, to be invalid. &quot;Instead of passing laws that strip away more of their rights, the Myanmar [Burmese] authorities should immediately release all political prisoners,&quot; Amnesty International said. It said it was concerned that &quot;activists are going to come under increased repression in the lead-up to the elections&quot;. By allowing the NLD to reopen 100 regional offices closed since 2003, the regime appears to be hoping that, despite the restrictions, a decapitated opposition will participate in the poll, boosting the junta&apos;s credibility. This has created a dilemma for those NLD leaders who are not in jail. &quot;I think they want us to take part in the election, but we still haven&apos;t made up our minds about this,&quot; said spokesman, Nyan Win. He described new electoral provisions, such as a requirement that parties uphold the generals&apos; gerrymandered 2008 constitution, as &quot;completely unacceptable&quot;. Tin Oo, the NLD deputy chairman, said the junta was trying to split the opposition. &quot;They have been trying to decimate the party and now they are doing it with utmost force. But the NLD will never collapse.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/11/sir-brian-pitman-obituary", "sentences": ["When he stepped down as chief executive in 1997, he took several non-executive directorships, including the chairmanship of the clothing chain Next (1998-2002) and seats on the boards of companies as varied as Carlton Communications (1998-2004) and then ITV (2003-08), the engineering conglomerate Tomkins (2000-07), Carphone Warehouse from 2001 onwards, and Singapore Airlines from 2003."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-11T22:21:31Z", "title": "Sir Brian Pitman obituary", "tags": ["Banking", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Sir Brian Pitman, who has died aged 78 after suffering a heart attack, was widely regarded as the most successful banker of his generation. In the 18 years up to 2001, as chief executive and then chairman of Lloyds Bank, he transformed it from the smallest of the original Big Four high street banks to one of the largest and certainly the most successful in financial terms. This success story was not without its pieces of good fortune, nor some high-profile mistakes. But a determination to succeed, and a rejection of the aggrandising ambitions that brought his competitors down, helped capitalise on the luck and overcome the failures. Pitman worked for the bank virtually all his adult life. He joined his local Cheltenham branch as a 21-year-old in 1952, so that when he finally stepped down as chairman, he was just short of a half-century. The extra year would probably have meant a lot to a man who was an avid cricket fan and no mean player in his youth. Indeed, cricket and music \u2013 he played the trombone \u2013 were his abiding passions, demonstrated by membership of the MCC as well as Yorkshire and his native Gloucestershire cricket club. But for unfortunate family circumstances, the lifetime banker might well have followed one of these professions. His father died in a car crash when he was only nine weeks old. He won a scholarship to Cheltenham grammar school, but when university beckoned at the end of the 1940s, Pitman decided he had better go out and earn some money instead. &quot;I felt I had been enough of a burden on my mother,&quot; he said. His ability was soon spotted, and he quickly moved to the head office in London. As head of Lloyds&apos; City office in the early 1970s, he was responsible first for backing adventurers such as Jim Slater and Sir James Goldsmith, then for helping work out how to save the banking sector when it was on the point of collapse after the property crash of 1973. He emerged with his reputation unscathed from this experience, just as he did subsequently after Lloyds&apos; loans to South American regimes went badly wrong. Pitman was in charge of Lloyds Bank International in the mid-1970s, when the supposedly rock-solid sovereign loans were made. Then, as chief executive of the group in the 1980s, he had to support the rescue package and write off \u00a31.8bn of bad debts. The result was a record loss at the time. But ironically, Lloyds&apos; failed international ambitions helped the determined chief executive avoid other mistakes made by his rivals and build a super-efficient domestic business. International business had been important for Lloyds, and historically it had held a strong position in South America. Pitman was not happy that his bank should be trailing behind Barclays, National Westminster and Midland. He wanted to get bigger, and he especially wanted to expand the bank&apos;s international coverage. His first attempt was a takeover of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1984. When that came to nothing he turned to Standard Chartered \u2013 an exclusively international bank with a strong presence in Asia and Africa. That bid, too, was blocked, but the defeat turned out to be extremely fortunate. The failure to internationalise, and the cost of the international bad debt, left Lloyds with little choice when its rivals were piling into investment banking during the late 1980s. Pitman avoided the temptation to follow them in buying stockbrokers \u2013 a strategy that rebounded on NatWest, Barclays and Midland. Instead he spent the 1990s pursuing a domestic strategy, creating the first broad retail financial institution with the acquisitions of TSB, Abbey Life insurance, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, and finally Scottish Widows. As a result, Lloyds TSB, as the bank became, overtook its main rivals. During Pitman&apos;s leadership its stock market value shot up from \u00a31bn to \u00a320bn, while Midland was acquired by HSBC, NatWest succumbed to Royal Bank of Scotland, and Barclays faltered, though retaining its independence. Unfortunately his swansong \u2013 a bid for Abbey National in 2001 \u2013 had to be abandoned in the face of resistance from the mortgage bank and opposition from the regulator. Three years later Abbey National went to a Spanish buyer, Banco Santander. Takeovers were not the only source of growth, however. Pitman was one of the first business leaders to adopt the mantra of &quot;shareholder value&quot;. Long before this became the byword of every chairman and chief executive, Lloyds was judging its success in terms of creating value for shareholders, rather than measures such as absolute size, which preoccupied most bankers. Sir Brian, as he became in 1994, did not measure the bank&apos;s performance against his banking peers. Instead he looked at the world&apos;s most successful companies \u2013 Coca-Cola, Walt Disney and General Electric \u2013 and drove his staff to match their performance. His determination and high expectations of staff attracted the sobriquet &quot;charming thug&quot;. But he was a private man. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he eschewed the limelight, avoiding publicity as far as possible and concentrating on doing his job at the bank. Indeed, in many ways he was a caricature banker, taking the early commuter train from his Weybridge home, devoting himself to building the bank. Cricket remained an abiding passion, and he was an excellent golfer. But business was his life. When he stepped down as chief executive in 1997, he took several non-executive directorships, including the chairmanship of the clothing chain Next (1998-2002) and seats on the boards of companies as varied as Carlton Communications (1998-2004) and then ITV (2003-08), the engineering conglomerate Tomkins (2000-07), Carphone Warehouse from 2001 onwards, and Singapore Airlines from 2003. When he finally resigned as Lloyds TSB chairman in 2001, Pitman became an adviser to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley and was still involved in banking there and elsewhere up to his death. He was associated with the Virgin Money consortium with which Sir Richard Branson hoped to take over Northern Rock in 2007, and last January became Virgin Money&apos;s chairman. Last November the Financial Services Authority made him one of five new advisers on corporate governance. Pitman is survived by his wife, Barbara, whom he married in 1954, and their children, Mark, David and Sally. \u2022 Brian Ivor Pitman, banker, born 13 December 1931; died 11 March 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/12/renault-mclaren-rear-wing", "sentences": ["The governing bodies need to be a lot stronger with these things.&quot; Bell, whose team is competing under a suspended permanent ban after a race-fixing controversy in the 2008 Singapore grand prix, said a protest by Renault was unlikely."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-12T20:45:06Z", "title": "Renault claim McLaren wing design on Formula One car is illegal", "tags": ["McLaren", "Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "The Formula One season was barely 30 minutes old when the first row of the season erupted. Almost inevitably, given the team&apos;s unfortunate history, it should involve the McLarens driven by Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. First practice for the Bahrain grand prix had just started when Bob Bell, the technical director of the Renault team, declared that a device on the McLaren was &quot;totally illegal&quot; and had &quot;opened up another arms race&quot; in the sport. Bell was referring to an internal tube carrying air that can affect the aerodynamics of the rear wing and provide extra speed on the two long straights on the Sakhir track. Bell&apos;s complaint is not with either the tube or the rear wing but with the fact that the driver, by using his left knee to block a hole in the tube, can accelerate the passage of air towards the rear of the car \u2013 but only at advantageous moments on the straights. The debate is over whether or not the driver&apos;s action with his knee is similar to activating a switch to change the aerodynamics \u2013 which is illegal. &quot;It&apos;s fundamentally clear that the McLaren wing design is totally illegal,&quot; Bell told the BBC. &quot;They have driven a cart horse through the spirit of the rules and regulations. They have opened up another arms race. It&apos;s going to cost everybody a lot of money. The governing bodies need to be a lot stronger with these things.&quot; Bell, whose team is competing under a suspended permanent ban after a race-fixing controversy in the 2008 Singapore grand prix, said a protest by Renault was unlikely. The FIA has been aware of the device from the moment McLaren asked the sport&apos;s governing body for their view when formulating the car&apos;s design. Race director Charlie Whiting will have given his personal opinion \u2013 not a definitive judgment \u2013 which must have been in the affirmative. The car then passed scrutineering in Bahrain on Thursday. The FIA&apos;s president, Jean Todt, said the decision would not be reversed: &quot;I totally trust the people that have to judge it.&quot; Bell added: &quot;I understand that Charlie is saying that article three of the regulations that would limit something like that don&apos;t apply to the driver, only to the car. But I do remember when our active ride car was banned, it was banned on the grounds that a piston in the strut was moving and by virtue of doing so was influencing the aerodynamic performance of the car. What I&apos;m told Charlie is saying is that Lewis or Jenson&apos;s knee, or whatever it is, is not part of the car.&quot; Button defended the design. &quot;Our wing is our wing, and that&apos;s the way it is,&quot; the world champion said. &quot;There&apos;s no problem with it as it&apos;s been passed by the authorities. It&apos;s an innovative design and it seems to be working well.&quot; Patrick Head, the technical chief at Williams, said his team would have to consider using the device. &quot;It is a bit of a problem because if one car is suddenly able to gain five or six kilometres an hour on the straight, then we&apos;ve all got to do it,&quot; Head said. &quot;If anybody comes up with a way to make their car 0.3 or 0.4 of a second quicker around the track that other people haven&apos;t done, then they&apos;ve been very clever. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s illegal but we&apos;ve just got to look at Charlie&apos;s interpretation. It&apos;s a bloody nuisance.&quot; Christian Horner, Red Bull&apos;s team principal, had been the first to air concerns about the McLaren device. &quot;We questioned it some time ago,&quot; Horner said. &quot;As the FIA have looked at it and deemed it to be OK, it&apos;s therefore a clever design as opposed to illegal design. So inevitably now there will be a wild goose chase with all the teams chasing that loophole.&quot; The unease would have aggravated had the McLarens been consistently and dramatically faster than the opposition during today&apos;s two free practice sessions. At the end of three hours of running, Hamilton was second fastest, nearly half a second slower than the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. Button was fourth, almost four tenths of a second behind Michael Schumacher, who had been consistently slower than his team-mate, Rosberg, throughout the day. &quot;I feel a little bit rusty, certainly on the one-lap issue I can do better,&quot; said Schumacher, making his comeback after a three-year absence. &quot;On long runs and consistent runs things are pretty good, I&apos;m quite happy. I will just use the rest of the weekend in order to tweak out the little bits. It&apos;s not a problem. It&apos;s just that for one lap I saw that Nico was four-tenths up and that is a bit too much for my standards. I&apos;ve got to raise my game a bit and I&apos;m sure I&apos;m able to.&quot; Button said he was reasonably happy with his car but, in common with most drivers, had trouble making his tyres last, particularly when the cars are heavy with fuel in anticipation of a new rule for 2010 preventing refuelling in the race. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult because the rear tyres go off quite quickly here, but it&apos;s the same for everyone,&quot; Button said. &quot;The basic car is quite good. The long runs seem to be reasonably good. There are areas we need to work on with set-up.&quot; There will be an hour of free practice this morning before qualifying in the afternoon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/13/tim-dowling-credit-bank-card", "sentences": ["&quot;So what do you think will happen in the end?&quot; There follows a long silence, which I pray will be interrupted by the woman telling me my Singapore fried noodles are ready."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-13T00:06:22Z", "title": "Tim Dowling: Googled out but still in credit", "tags": ["Family", "Life and style", "Credit cards"], "article": "The oldest one is watching TV when\u00a0my wife and\u00a0I get home. &quot;Guess which person was at the thing I was just at,&quot; I say to him. &quot;Which famous person, who made a\u00a0speech, and I was there, too.&quot; &quot;James May,&quot; he says. &quot;More famous.&quot; &quot;Nick Clegg,&quot; he says.

At the beginning of 1942, Japanese forces cut a swathe through the Malayan peninsula before sweeping into the strategically important port. Unwilling to risk the massacre of civilians, British commanders flew the white flag and defeat was followed by humiliation. Not only had Singapore been considered impregnable, but the Japanese had been written off as racially inferior types who would be easily crushed. For those who survived, it was the beginning of a season in hell. Among them was Alistair Urquhart, a young conscript soldier in 2nd Gordon Highlanders, one of the few British infantry battalions that had not faltered during the fierce fighting for the vital Singapore causeway. A lifetime after those disastrous events \u2013 he is now aged 90 \u2013 Urquhart has returned to his time as a soldier and the result is a riveting and frequently troubling account of what happens when an army accepts defeat. In his opening chapters, Urquhart insists that the loss of Singapore was not just a terrible setback, it also marked the end of Britain&apos;s imperial pretensions in the far east. He had arrived in the garrison a year earlier and his eyes had been opened to the reality of colonial life in its heyday. Private soldiers were treated with the same casual contempt the British settlers reserved for the Malays and Chinese, and provided you were white and well-connected social life still went with a swing. Above all, no one ever dreamed that the Japanese would have the temerity to attack this invincible bulwark of British interests in southern Asia. For the British and the blameless local population, it was a rude awakening. Urquhart provides chilling descriptions of the barbarities inflicted by the Japanese as they took control of the city. Marching into captivity in the notorious Changi prison, the men of the Gordons were confronted with &quot;a thicket of severed Chinese heads speared on poles on both sides of the road.&quot; Broken bodies bore witness to massacres in which people had been machine-gunned at will. Every scene spoke of devastation. For a time regimental discipline held, but all too quickly things fell apart. Much of Urquhart&apos;s story will be drearily familiar. His world became populated by monsters whose cartoon character nicknames would have raised a smile had they not been so horrific: the Black Prince, Dr Death, the Mad Mongrel, all sadistic guards devoid of pity or humanity. From Changi, Urquhart was sent north to work as a slave labourer on the notorious Burma Road railway where conditions were even worse. His life narrowed down to a round of pain and deprivation. Food was in short supply, beatings were regular, illness afflicted even the strongest and death was ever present. In that hellhole, which included a stint working on the bridge on the river Kwai, where conditions were so unlike the film of the same name as to make comparisons laughable, Urquhart found strength and resolution from his inner self. Whereas many men took solace in each other&apos;s company or survived by playing the system, Urquhart retreated into a dream world of music and songs. Before being called up he had enjoyed dancing and popular ballroom tunes populated his imagination. Often he was too weak to sing, but within his head he crooned the hits of earlier years when happiness was a foxtrot and a pretty girl in his arms. Urquhart had more horrors to face. While being shipped to Japan, his rust-bucket transport was torpedoed by a US submarine. He survived the sinking, but hard labour in a coal mine near Nagasaki almost did for him, as did the atomic bomb that exploded on the city to end the war. Peace took him on a long journey home through the US, but happiness was elusive and as the narrative folds in upon itself, Urquhart&apos;s final chapters describe the torment he faced on demobilisation. He returned to his native Aberdeen but found that he could not settle back into civilian life and repaid his family&apos;s many kindnesses with brutish hostility. Having lived within himself for so long, he could not embrace the old kindly world and spent his first months of freedom endlessly pacing the city streets, alone and fearful. Nightmares and flashbacks haunted him and would continue to do so throughout his life. Today, thanks to the work of charities like Combat Stress, we know more about the effects of post-traumatic stress syndrome, but in Urquhart&apos;s day veterans were just supposed to get on with their lives. This final section forms the cold heart of the story, but it should be read by anyone who wants to understand the reality of what soldiers suffer as a result of frontline service. There will be many other Urquharts in today&apos;s Iraq and Afghanistan. As for the Gordon Highlanders, the regiment has long since disappeared but its reputation lives on \u2013 and not just for its fighting but also its writing. Among those who wore the distinctive Gordon tartan were the poets Vernon Scannell and Alexander Scott and the novelists James Kennaway and George MacDonald Fraser. Now, with this powerful and thought-provoking memoir, Alistair Urquhart has fallen in beside them to join an elite band of first-rate soldier-writers.

The average volume of arms sales increased by 22% over the past five years, compared to the previous five-year period, says the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). The last two of these years were marked by worldwide economic turbulence which has far from stabilised, yet the arms trade is booming, it finds. The report does not give the cost of the arms trade because most governments no longer release the figures. Britain stopped publishing the cost of its arms sales last year. The US remains the world&apos;s top arms exporter, accounting for 30% of the total, followed by Russia (23%), Germany (11%), and France (8%). Britain, with 4%, saw a fall in the volume of its exports, as the delivery of 72 of its Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to Saudi Arabia was only just getting under way in the period covered by the report. Germany&apos;s arms exports have risen by more than 100%, mainly because of sales of armoured vehicles, says the report. Arms sales to South America rose by 150%, raising the spectre of an arms race in the region. Last year Venezuela received $2.2bn (\u00a31.4bn) in credit from Russia for the purchase of air defence systems, artillery, armoured cars, and tanks.

Instead, the Conservative plans unveiled last week would mean that urban constituencies, which form the core Labour vote, would be the first to get superfast broadband, while some rural constituencies might never see it, according to Point Topic, a research company specialising in national broadband usage and adoption. The two main parties have both targeted high-speed broadband as important to future economic development both in urban and rural areas. Such &quot;superband&quot; connections can transfer data at up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps), rather than the 4Mbps that average home connections now get. The Conservative &quot;technology manifesto&quot; published last week says a Tory government would encourage private sector investment by &quot;opening up network infrastructure, easing planning rules and boosting competition&quot; and that it would make the UK &quot;the first country in Europe to extend superfast 100Mbps broadband across most of the population&quot;, and that &quot;this is up to 50 times faster than Labour&apos;s planned broadband network&quot; \u2013 which under the digital economy bill aims for a 2Mbps minimum throughout the UK by 2012. High-speed connectivity requires expensive fibre-optic cable to replace the existing copper cable of standard telephone lines, which cannot transfer data at high speeds more than a couple of kilometres from the exchange. Distances from exchanges to users are typically much higher in rural areas, making it more expensive to install the fibre \u2013 but returns on capital are lower because there are fewer users per kilometre of line. That means telecoms companies will be reluctant to install fibre in rural areas \u2013 leading the Labour government to propose an annual &quot;landline tax&quot; of \u00a36 in the digital economy bill, to create a fund it says would raise between \u00a3150m and \u00a3175m a year, which would subsidise fibre installation in what would otherwise be low-return areas. However, Point Topic says the Tory proposals would mean rural constituencies missing out on such high-speed broadband. &quot;Put simply, Labour wants to push ahead as soon as possible with subsidies for areas that are unlikely to get superband through market forces, while the Tories want to wait until 2012 to see how well the market works and then provide subsidies if necessary to fill any obstinate gaps. Strangely enough, the Tories are opposing a policy which is likely to bring most benefit to the places they represent.&quot; Point Topic estimates that annual funding of between \u00a3130m and \u00a3170m should be enough to support the rollout of high-speed broadband to at least 90% of homes and businesses in the UK. Among the locations that would require the highest subsidies are not just the rural constituencies, but also suburban ones such Tunbridge Wells, Rugby and Macclesfield \u2013 held respectively by the Conservatives Greg Clark, the shadow energy and climate change secretary; the whip Jeremy Wright, and Nicholas Winterton. Constituencies that were Tory seats in 2005 would need a total of \u00a371m, or 51% of the \u00a3138m total required to upgrade to high-speed broadband, according to Point Topic&apos;s analysis \u2013 but that is precisely the method that the Tories are opposing. The Tories assert in the technology manifesto that their market-led approach &quot;has proved successful in other countries such as Singapore and South Korea&quot; but add that &quot;if the market does not deliver superfast broadband in certain areas, we will consider using the proportion of the licence fee dedicated to digital switchover to finance superfast broadband roll out under the new BBC licence fee settlement, starting in 2012.&quot; Point Topic says that government intervention and subsidy will be necessary almost everywhere. &quot;In more than half of [constituencies], 345 out of 650, anything from 20% to 90% of homes and businesses are unlikely to get superband just through market forces,&quot; it says. According to the analysis, it is not just rural areas that make up the Tory heartlands that most need subsidy to get high-speed broadband. Point Topic reckons that more than 7m homes and businesses will need some level of subsidy to get access to &quot;superband &quot;anytime soon. More than 3m of these are in urban areas. &quot;The key difference between the parties is that Labour is already working on government intervention and subsidy to promote the rollout of superband in less favoured areas while the Tories favour a &quot;wait and see&quot; policy,&quot; says Tim Johnson, chief analyst at Point Topic. &quot;Superband is not a huge issue on its own but it is a case study in the difference between the two big parties&apos; platforms for 2010,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;It&apos;s between &apos;keep spending to maintain growth&apos; and &apos;cut now to get market-driven growth going as soon as possible&apos;.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/mar/15/music-blogs-map", "sentences": ["With contributions by bloggers from Argentina (Zonaindie) to New Zealand (Counting The Beat), Singapore (I&apos;m Waking Up To) to Sweden (Swedes Please), MAP is a monthly global compilation tape from a not-for-profit musical cartel, one that exposes the bands (most untouched by A&amp;R or PR people) to new audiences and the blogs to more readers."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-15T17:13:46Z", "title": "How to put music blogs on the MAP", "tags": ["Music", "Blogging", "Music industry", "Culture"], "article": "     It was a weird day on 16 July 2009 for the Holy Roman Army, a tasteful, glitchy electronica duo from Carlow, Ireland. The brother and sister group are small-time, with just over 37,000 profile views on MySpace, 1,485 plays of their most popular song and two upcoming gigs \u2013 in Dublin and Dublin. Yet on that day, an Estonian dance group they&apos;d never met asked them to collaborate, an LA-based music supervisor showed interest in buying their tracks, and a total stranger, posting on a message board at ilxor.com , dreamed they had died and he had moved into their flat. Abruptly, bizarrely, The Holy Roman Army were an international prospect. Responsibility for the duo&apos;s globalisation lies with the Music Alliance Pact (MAP) \u2013 34 music bloggers from 34 different countries who, on the 15th day of each month (which means today), cross post an identical list of every member&apos;s local band of the moment, accompanied by a description and sample MP3. With contributions by bloggers from Argentina (Zonaindie) to New Zealand (Counting The Beat), Singapore (I&apos;m Waking Up To) to Sweden (Swedes Please), MAP is a monthly global compilation tape from a not-for-profit musical cartel, one that exposes the bands (most untouched by A&amp;R or PR people) to new audiences and the blogs to more readers. &quot;The logic behind MAP is that because each individual blog&apos;s regular readers would usually download and listen to the author&apos;s recommended songs, they would be more likely to download the MAP songs too, even though their source was another blog entirely&quot;, says Scottish blogger The Pop Cop, who founded MAP in October 2008 and still co-ordinates it today. &quot;One of the reasons I started MAP was because I was writing about great new Scottish bands to a predominantly Scottish readership, but I wanted to find a way for this music to reach a wider audience.&quot; A wider, and not a significantly larger, audience is the key. MAP operates on a system of borrowed trust. Each blog vouches for the others and therefore the target audience is dictated by the blogs The Pop Cop decides to incorporate into the group (membership is currently limited to one blog per country). While it&apos;s unlikely to send bands such as The Holy Roman Army to the top of the Venezuelan pop charts (the blogs \u2013 with an average readership of 12,000 unique visitors a month \u2013 don&apos;t yet hold enough sway) there&apos;s a better chance they&apos;ll be exposed to foreign like-minded listeners \u2013 that Hollywood industry figure or unexpected collaborative partner, as well as the occassional oddball. &quot;There really aren&apos;t many other channels that reach such a wide and varied audience&quot;, says Gabi Goldberg, author of Musical Mover and Shaker, MAP&apos;s representative in South Africa. &quot;We have bloggers from China to Finland to Peru, and each blogger brings something wholly different to the blog post every month.&quot; Geography ensures that each month&apos;s MAP features a diverse selection of music. The bloggers are far apart enough from each other to avoid them all plugging the same buzz band. A recent MAP featured Chinese shoegaze, bashy Indian art-punk and Peruvian reggae. It&apos;s rare to find such an eclectic selection on one music blog alone. For the bloggers, MAP is a fast and easy route to a wider readership. They post as they always have. The workload \u2013 the chivvying, the translating, the coding \u2013 falls on The Pop Cop, and grows every time another country&apos;s blogger is added. Not that he minds. In fact, he welcomes expansion and there are vacancies for many more African and South American contributors, while Russia is very nearly signed up. One place could be a little trickier though: &quot;The only continent that isn&apos;t represented now is Antarctica,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&apos;m not holding out much hope ...&quot; The next MAP launches on 15 March.

Lawyers representing Yong Vui Kong, a 22-year old Malaysian, argued that the mandatory death sentence violates international standards and human rights laws. Singapore executes anyone found guilty of importing more than 15g of drugs. It is one of the few countries in the world to impose mandatory death sentences for drug offences. &quot;This is a young man, only 22, who committed a non-violent offence,&quot; said Saul Lehrfreund, co-founder of the Death Penalty Project, a London-based legal program that appeals against death sentences. &quot;The court in Singapore has no choice by to impose death by hanging, regardless of the individual circumstances of the case. In this day and age that just seems ludicrous.&quot; Kong, whom lawyers describe as &quot;impoverished and vulnerable&quot;, was due to be hanged last December until lawyers obtained an emergency reprieve. He was convicted in 2008 of smuggling 47g of heroin into Singapore. The case is regarded by experts as an important challenge to the country&apos;s death penalty and has attracted media attention across Asia, where executing people for drug offences remains controversial. Taiwan recently absolished the mandatory death penalty. China, which continues to execute prisoners for 68 different offences including 44 non-violent crimes, allows judicial discretion in sentencing drug-related cases. Singapore has seen a big decline in its use of the death penalty since having the highest execution rate in the world in the 1990s, but the government is resisting any change to the law. Singapore&apos;s attorney general, Walter Woon, has argued that parliament has the power to show mercy in individual cases. Kong was refused mercy in December, and his lawyers are arguing that the courts and not the executive should have the discretionary power. &quot;It can&apos;t be right that an administrative body not amenable to judicial review effectively becomes the sentencing body,&quot; said Lehrfreund. &quot;There is a clear global trend away from sentencing people to death without taking their age, vulnerability and other powerful mitigating factors into account.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/17/deutsche-bahn-bid-for-arriva", "sentences": ["&quot;The UK transport space for good or bad was deregulated years ago and it made them go out and become robust international companies, so if you are SNCF or Deutsche Bahn and you want to buy a bolt-on company that will give assets around the world, then all of the UK companies are tailor-made.&quot; There has been speculation that ComfortDelGro of Singapore, which runs the Metroline buses in London, could also be interested in bidding for Arriva."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-17T18:41:51Z", "title": "Arriva shares soar as Deutsche Bahn reveals \u00a31.2bn bid", "tags": ["Arriva", "Rail transport", "Germany", "Transport", "National Express", "Stagecoach", "Europe", "Business"], "article": "Arriva, the company that runs the rail franchise between Penzance and Aberdeen, has received a \u00a31.2bn takeover bid from Deutsche Bahn, the German state-run transport group, just weeks after ending merger talks with French rail operator SNCF. Shares in the Sunderland-based rail and bus company soared 17% to 687p following a brief announcement earlier today that said it had received an unsolicited approached about a &quot;possible offer&quot;. The talks come amid a jockeying for position by the largest transport groups in Europe as they seek scale to take advantage of both the liberalisation of the market over the next decade and cash-strapped local authorities looking to attract private investment into their bus and rail networks. Deutsche Bahn, which has been earmarked for partial privatisation, has already made inroads into Britain, acquiring Laing Rail, the owner of Chiltern Railways and operator of services between London and Birmingham, and 50% stakes in Wrexham, Shropshire &amp; Marylebone Railway and the London Overground commuter service. The German company also owns freight operator English Welsh and Scottish Railways, bought for \u00a3280m in 2007, which among other things runs trains for the British royal family. In February a Deutsche Bahn division signed the contract to take over the running of the Metro light railway system serving Tyne and Wear. Mark Kelly, at Olivetree Securities, said the move on Arriva could be the beginning of a wave of consolidation. &quot;The UK transport space for good or bad was deregulated years ago and it made them go out and become robust international companies, so if you are SNCF or Deutsche Bahn and you want to buy a bolt-on company that will give assets around the world, then all of the UK companies are tailor-made.&quot; There has been speculation that ComfortDelGro of Singapore, which runs the Metroline buses in London, could also be interested in bidding for Arriva. Kelly said firms would need scale to give them the financial flexibility when bidding for contracts from governments across Europe, noting that National Express almost sank the company when it got its sums wrong on a single rail franchise because it lacked that financial bulk. &quot;Europe&apos;s rail and bus markets will look very different in 10 years&apos; time and you will be either a consolidator, or a consolidatee.&quot; The other London transport groups all closed higher today. Go Ahead was up 4% higher while National Express, Stagecoach and FirstGroup all ended at around 3% up. Arriva has built a presence across 12\u00a0European countries, carrying more than one billion passengers a year. It is one of the largest bus operators in London and runs most of the rail services in Wales, as well as the CrossCountry rail franchise that notoriously charged \u00a31,002 for a &quot;turn up and go&quot; first-class return from Newquay to the Kyle of Lochalsh. &quot;Apart from National Express, which is in Spain, Arriva is the only one of the five listed UK transport companies that has looked to Europe for growth,&quot; said Ken Burn at Shore Capital. &quot;That has been a drag on earnings but it could now all come good in the end if the deal goes through. If you are looking for that geographical footprint, then Arriva has that. Given that most other large groups in Europe are government-backed it is really the only option.&quot; Arriva reported profits of \u00a3121.7m last year, a 19% decline, as it struggled with the impact of the recession and higher fuel bills. Its revenues were 3.5% higher at \u00a33.15bn. Burn said Arriva had lacked the scale or the capital to properly invest in its European operations but that Deutsche Bahn had both. He said Arriva shareholders would be disappointed if the agreement did not happen.

Alistair Darling delivered his lines with a sure-footed comic timing when he said &quot;we are ready to sign tax information-exchange agreements with three additional countries \u2013 Dominica, Grenada and [pause] Belize&quot;. He waited for the waving order papers to subside before he added that the agreements would be signed in the next few days. It meant he would get more information from the central American state \u2013 and, by implication, Ashcroft \u2013 than the Tory leadership had managed in a decade. To emphasise his point, the chancellor warned that a general clampdown on tax would yield more than \u00a31.5bn. Another tax treaty with tiny Liechtenstein is scheduled to haul in more than \u00a3500m. Yet, according to tax experts across the political spectrum, the agreement with Belize will elicit little information about Ashcroft \u2013 let alone tax. His assets are safe from the British taxman unless he wants to declare them himself, which is not expected. Like most Belize residents, he is unlikely to keep any cash in bank accounts in his own name. Mostly, accounts are in the name of a company, which is in turn owned by a trust. Under the agreement with Belize, the British revenue would need to know the names behind the trust to ask for information. Without a register of interests, there is little way a tax inspector could find out who the ultimate owner is. Information exchange agreements are not retrospective so, by the time it comes into force, Ashcroft will be on the brink of becoming a UK taxpayer. Following the furore around his refusal to say where he paid tax, he renounced his non-domiciled status and said that, after the election, he would become a full UK taxpayer. The government has signed around 60 such deals, many of them with tax havens, with a view to stemming the flow of untaxed cash overseas. The Liechtenstein deal is tougher. Set up in August 2009, it runs until March 2015. It allows people with unpaid taxes due on investments or assets to settle their tax liability, including interest and penalties. It is estimated that, over the lifetime of the agreement, this will bring in \u00a3940m. Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton, tax accountants, said agreements like the one with Belize were fraught with difficulties. &quot;Clamping down on offshore tax avoidance is like catching a bar of soap,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m always sceptical when chancellors say it will bring in millions of pounds because fertile minds always find their way around the rules.&quot; Some experts believe the spotlight will soon fall on the fast growing financial centres of Singapore and Kuwait, which act as tax havens for increasing numbers of wealthy westerners. Yves Remedios, tax adviser at accountants BDO, said Belize was small fry. &quot;HMRC&apos;s success with its information exchange agreements in Europe has caused money to move away to the Middle East and far east. So the next moves will be further afield with agreements in financial centres such as Singapore that have continued to flourish.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/mar/25/live-horse-racing-march-25-2010", "sentences": ["He was only just beaten by the brilliant Sacred Kingdom in Singapore last year and he romped home on his comeback outing."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-25T11:28:31Z", "title": "Talking Horses: The best bets and lastest news plus our weekly tipping competition", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "12.30pm Lincoln favourite Penitent drawn in stall 1 Tony Paley: Ante-post favourite Penitent has been handed stall 1 in a maximum field of 22 for the William Hill Lincoln at Doncaster on Saturday.

An increase in taxes on the wealthiest households has been matched by an increase in benefits for the poorest, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said today following a long-term study of Labour&apos;s impact on incomes since 1997. The poorest 10% of households gained by 13% while at the same time the richest 10% saw their incomes cut by almost 9%. When households earning more than \u00a3100,000 were treated as a separate category, the figures showed they faced tax rises that cut their incomes by 15%. The IFS said the study showed that Labour had used the tax and benefit system to close the income gap. James Browne, an analyst at the IFS, said the poorest had benefited from steep rises in tax credit payments and the pension credit scheme, which provided a minimum income guarantee for pensioners and a top-up to modest retirement savings by the over-65s. An overhaul of tax credits in 2003 created a \u00a313bn system of benefits that rewarded families for taking a job and remaining in work. While the system has suffered administrative problems, it is widely applauded for boosting the incomes of low paid families. In the recession it has provided a safety net for many families and allowed them to accept part-time work when in a previous era it would have paid them to leave work and claim benefits. Families where the main wage earner is forced to take a large cut in hours will see their incomes largely maintained by tax credits. The government estimates that households with two children and an income of \u00a324,000 a year will receive more in tax credits than they pay in tax. Since 2003 the cost of the tax credit system, which includes child tax credits and the working tax credit, has soared. Figures from the budget showed the combined bill had reached \u00a320bn by 2008-09 and this year is expected to reach \u00a323bn. Low income pensioners have also gained from housing benefit and help with council tax payments. Until recently wealthy taxpayers paid only a slightly higher proportion of their net income than the poorest households. The government switched tack last year and imposed a 50p tax rate on people earning more than \u00a3150,000. Those earning more than \u00a3100,000 will lose their personal allowance. Both measures take effect from this April. The IFS said that while the tax and benefit system as a whole has redistributed from rich to poor, it has arguably had only a marginal effect on overall income inequality. &quot;Whether tax and benefit reforms have contributed to or counteracted the sharp increase in income inequality seen in the UK over the last 30 years is hard to determine definitively, in part because it depends on what is meant by reform,&quot; the thinktank said in a 2008 discussion of the topic. &quot;Within this period, though, Labour&apos;s reforms have been clearly more progressive than the Conservatives&apos;: Labour&apos;s reforms since 1997 have had a similar effect on overall inequality as increasing benefit rates in line with GDP, while the Conservatives&apos; reforms were roughly equivalent to increasing them in line with inflation.&quot; Only Singapore, the US and Portugal have more income inequality, according to UN figures. It says the richest 20% in the UK are seven times better off than the poorest 20%, while in Japan the richest 20% are only 3.5 times richer. According to the IFS, middle income groups have neither gained nor lost from tax and benefit changes over the 13 years. Most rightwing commentators described the budget as the last in a long line of attacks on middle income earners. But the IFS figures show that while households in the higher income groups lose out compared with lower income groups, the effects are only marginal. Where middle income groups have suffered is in their wealth rather than their incomes. One recent calculation found that the average household had lost at least \u00a320,000 from the recession, mainly through falls in house prices. The Taxpayers Alliance, which lobbies for lower taxes and a smaller government, said the era of social engineering through tax and spend needed to come to an end. &quot;Large spending cuts are essential for taxpayers and for the health of the economy but Gordon Brown only knows how to spend more, not less. We need a real Budget after the election that faces up to the serious realities of our situation,&quot; it said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/27/dubai-world-cup-meydan", "sentences": ["In terms of the entries, there is plenty of encouragement, with runners arriving from the United States, Japan, Singapore, Australia, Great Britain and France among others."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-27T00:37:06Z", "title": "Meydan and its millions set to banish gloom with $10m Dubai World Cup", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Sport", "Dubai World Cup"], "article": "There is a smell at Meydan racecourse that is difficult to escape.

So much has changed here since Sheikh Mohammed, right, Dubai&apos;s ruler, unveiled the plans for Meydan at a party beside the Burj Al Arab, his iconic hotel by the Gulf, in March 2007. Then, the idea of staging the world&apos;s first $10m (\u00a36.7m) horse race at the new track seemed a typically brash gesture (it was only pocket money for the Sheikh, after all). Now, Dubai is in hock to its neighbour Abu Dhabi after a debt crisis last November that threatened to bring the emirate to its knees, and take a fair chunk of the global economy down with it. They have even renamed the Burj Dubai, the world&apos;s tallest building, as the Burj Khalifa, in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, a telling sign of just how grateful, or desperate, Dubai was for Sheikh Khalifa&apos;s cash. Only yesterday, the Gulf News reported that another $9.5bn had been pumped into Dubai World, the government&apos;s corporate arm. Underneath was a report suggesting that people live longer if they smile regularly, and it was hard to see the placing as mere coincidence. Don&apos;t panic, everyone. Keep smiling and carry on. Such is the backdrop as Meydan prepares to welcome a crowd of \u2013 they hope \u2013 around 50,000 for today&apos;s Dubai World Cup. In addition to the $10m main event, there is another $16m spread over the six supporting thoroughbred events, including two on the turf track worth $5m apiece. Twenty-six million dollars in search of a new home \u2013 there has never been a race meeting quite like it. Some of the money will be staying in Dubai, as the Sheikh&apos;s Godolphin racing operation fields runners throughout the card, and will hope to achieve at least one morale-boosting victory, though probably not in one of the top three events. The bulk of the cash, though, seems marked for export, to South Africa, Japan or Europe, which some will see as another sign of the way things are going in Dubai. Elton John and Carlos Santana, booked to play at a concert after racing, are also likely to be leaving town with a seven-figure sum in the bank. What Sheikh Mohammed, and Dubai as a whole, will be hoping for is a sign that, in the words of Frank Gabriel, the chief executive of the Dubai Racing Club, who has overseen the entire project: &quot;We&apos;ve had problems, but we went through it.&quot; As Gabriel points out: &quot;We&apos;ve gone at a very fast pace [to build the track], but we were always conscious of what we were trying to do. This facility is a race track, but we also want it to be a destination year-round, so we also have facilities like the Meydan hotel that will be attractive not only during the racing season. &quot;We want to support tourism, which is a big factor in Dubai, and contribute to the whole economy.&quot; From racing&apos;s perspective, tonight&apos;s meeting is a chance to assess whether internationalisation can give the sport a truly global platform, and whether Dubai, with its position between the major racing nations of the east and west, is still the obvious stage. In terms of the entries, there is plenty of encouragement, with runners arriving from the United States, Japan, Singapore, Australia, Great Britain and France among others. But without the prize-money, they would not be here, and if the money ever dries up ... The first Dubai World Cup night at Meydan is certain to be a spectacle and an experience. And somewhere along the line, there will surely be fireworks, as no event in Dubai seems complete without them. But with the economics of it all suddenly in such tight focus, will every flash and bang be a sign of the start of something big? Or an all-too-literal example of another few hundred dollars going up in smoke?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/28/lucy-siegle-innovator-tom-mcmillan", "sentences": ["In 2008 they travelled from Scotland to Singapore in 85 days, using 22 buses, 14 trains, 11 boats and an unknown number of tuk tuks.", "When Tom researched the Singapore trip, every itinerary presupposed flights."], "publicationDate": "2010-03-28T00:05:03Z", "title": "The innovator:  Tom McMillan", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Travel websites", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Life and style"], "article": "   Tom and Lorraine McMillan.

The LHC accelerates two counter-rotating beams of protons - the subatomic constituents of atomic nuclei - to within a whisker of the speed of light, before steering them into one another. The head-on collisions release enough energy to mimic in microcosm the conditions that prevailed a fraction of a second after the big bang. The first collisions are expected as early as 8am this morning, but at Cern things can happen faster or slower than expected. A tentative schedule of the day&apos;s events is here. Alas I am covering the events from London. You can watch Cern&apos;s streaming coverage here. If you have work to do and can&apos;t sit around watching people chat about particle physics all morning, I&apos;ll follow it for you. The machine has already collided particles at a combined energy (call it centre-of-mass energy) of 2.36 trillion electron volts (TeV). One electron volt is the amount of energy the particle gains when accelerated across an electric field of 1 volt.  Slamming particles together at 2.36TeV in November showed the machine, and its four huge detectors, work well. It also claimed the crown for the LHC as the most powerful collider in the world, by pipping the US Fermilab&apos;s Tevatron collider near Chicago. Today is bigger news. Today the machine will go to half of its full energy, that is, colliding particles together with a total energy of 7TeV. In case you are worried, the world will not end.  7.45am: We&apos;re expecting the first attempt at collisions at 8am BST. Cern has historically shut down its major colliders over Christmas for routine maintenance, but things will be different with the LHC. The machine will run from today all the way through until the end of 2011, or thereabouts.  7.49am: The machine was loaded up with particles about 40 minutes ago. The LHC has ramped up energy to 3.5TeV in each beam, but no collisions as yet.  7.54am: The beam has just been lost. Maybe a power unit tripped. It takes thousands of components to work in unison for this to work. It sounds as though there&apos;s a problem with the cryogenics, that is keeping the superconducting magnets cool.  7.59am: The Cern engineers are trying to fix a glitch in the LHC&apos;s cryogenics. You can&apos;t accelerate or steer the beams without the cryogenics working, because the superconducting magnets have to be ultra-chilled to work properly.  8.06am: Speculative (and often ludicrous) doomsday scenarios have been kicked around since the early days of particle colliders. People have wondered about making greedy black holes; &quot;abnormal matter&quot; that&apos;s more stable than regular matter; magnetic monopoles that might cause proton decay and so on. My favourite, or more precisely, the one that intrigues me most, is vacuum decay.  The universe seems to be in a pretty stable state. There&apos;s been time for stars and planets to form and for life to arise. But what if the stable state of the universe was an illusion? It could be in a metastable state. And a big kick of energy somewere, anywhere, could knock the universe down into a more stable state. That&apos;s vacuum decay. What&apos;s staggering about the possibility is that it doesn&apos;t just mean curtains for us and all other life on Earth. It means no more life ever, anywhere.  Here&apos;s the late, great Sidney Coleman speculating on the prospect in, I think a 1980/81 paper: &quot;The possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate. Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature; after vacuum decay, not only is life as we know it impossible, so is chemistry as we know it. However, one could always draw stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain, if not life as we know it, at least some structures capable of knowing joy. This possibility has now been eliminated.&quot;Sidney Coleman. So, we&apos;d best get on and enjoy ourselves, eh?  8.10am: It&apos;s worth bearing in mind that the LHC is the most complex machine that&apos;s ever been built. Nothing quite like it has been made before. Last year&apos;s explosion - that led to a tonne of helium bursting into the collider tunnel - was the kind of incident that people half expected. An awful lot of things have to go right for it to work at all. Losing the beams today is a minor glitch.  8.11am: It could be two hours before they are in a position to collide particles. Good thing they&apos;ve started early.  8.14am: Ah judith. I hope you&apos;re joking. I&apos;ve never heard anyone other than a physicist say &quot;I&apos;m concerned about the cryogenics.&quot; Sounds like a line from an extra on Star Trek.  8.17am: Holger Bech Nielsen must be smiling.  8.21am: Steve Myers, head of accelerators at Cern, has just been speaking. They&apos;ve had two goes, both of which have failed. The first beams were lost at an energy of 2.2TeV when a power supply tripped. They&apos;ve reset it and that part seems ok. The second attempt failed due to a problem with the new magnet protection system. This is interesting, because the protection system is very new. It was added during the 18 month shut down to prevent another explosion like the one in September 2008. One of the magnets has quenched, which means it warmed up. That will need to be cooled down again before they can go for collisions. Collisions at 10am earliest.  8.23am: Britain pays \u00a380m a year in Cern subscriptions, the bulk of which goes on the LHC project.  8.27am: What the LHC might find:The Higgs boson (thought to give mass to fundamental particles)Supersymmetry (which doubles the number of particle species in the universe)Extra spatial dimensions (they must be tiny if they&apos;re there)Miniature black holes (and we&apos;re talking pin-prick sized)Dark matter particles And plenty more. I&apos;ll say more about the above in a mo.  8.36am: JerryTheDog: a good point re: what will 7TeV collisions mean if they achieve them today. Bear in mind that the American Tevatron collider has been operating at nearly 2TeV for quite a while, though it is colliding protons and antiprotons. For the LHC to see something soon (and I mean within months), there would have to be a particle or an interaction that is sitting just above Tevatron&apos;s reach and well within the LHC&apos;s reach. What are the chances? Who knows. There are theories that predict a heavy Higgs boson, but the odds seem very slim. Other theories suggest there could be supersyimmetric particles (heavy twins of the particles we know and love) that are within reach of the LHC. More than likely though, it will take many months to find clear evidence of anything. The reason is that new phenomena can easily be obscured by other well-known physics. Slamming protons together is a messy business, because each proton is made of three quarks, which means you can have all kinds of subatomic detritus smothering signs of something knew. My guess is that the Higgs boson won&apos;t be seen - by the LHC at least - before it closes down for major work in 2011. Finding supersymmetric particles, or extra dimensions though, would be staggering.  8.39am: The LHC had beams running at 3.5TeV no problem last night. I think the machine&apos;s got stage fright this morning.  8.43am: Phillipe Bloch, head of physics at Cern:&quot;We&apos;ve worked for almsot 20 years on this project...We have a lot of work in front of us for many years, so we can wait for a few more minutes.&quot;  8.46am: Right now, Cern staff are cooling part of the machine in preparation of injecting particles again. Once the particles are in, the energy will be ramped up to 3.5TeV. The ramp up usually takes about 45 mins. Then they have to make sure the beams are stable, that is circulating happily without wandering off axis or fading. Only then will they go for collisions.  8.48am: The protons hurtle around the machine in bunches. When the beams are crossed, some of these bunches smash into oncoming bunches, and some protons will hit others. You can get glancing blows, where protons simply deflect off each other. A direct collision will split the protons into their constituent quarks and gluons. The energy released on impact can condense into entirely new particles, so you see quarks, electrons and their heavier cousins, muons, all flinging out from the collision centre.  8.54am: The glitch with the cryogenics system seems to have come from electrical noise that hit a few sectors of the LHC and then vanished. Spooky, or not.Since you ask, Cern&apos;s previous machine, the Large Electron Positron collider, had teething troubles too. Weird signals came and went. They realised, eventually, that the machine was reacting to Earth tides: the pull of the moon on the Earth&apos;s crust was making the land around the collider heave up and down, causing a 1mm change in the circumference of the 27km collider ring.  And that wasn&apos;t the end of it.  More stray signals plagued the machine that seemed to come and go with even more regularity than the moon signals. Turned out that stray currents from the French TGV train at Geneva station were passing through the ground and getting into the collider, causing slight changes in the beam orbit. Once that had been cleared up, they found yet more signals that were traced back to the water level of Lake Geneva. These are big machines, but they are amazingly sensitive.  8.59am: Some pics from this morning&apos;s events so far...  9.08am: We&apos;ve just heard from Andrzej Siemko, the man in charge of the quench protection system at Cern&apos;s LHC. The system is there to alert operators to problems with the magnets, and to shut the machine down if it looks like a magnet is in danger of being damaged. It&apos;s really sensitive. The system picked up an electrical anomaly from two sectors of the machine and flagged a warning to operators. What&apos;s interesting - and it&apos;s good news I think - is that the problem it identified did not come from one of the LHC&apos;s 8,000 superconducting magnets. It picked up a load of electrical noise that was later spotted at other accelerators at Cern (the LHC is just the biggest and shiniest).Sounds like a glitch with the Cern power supply rather than a problem with the LHC itself. That said, if it&apos;s a generator problem, or a substation problem, it could be an annoyance.  9.09am: Friskydiscus says: &quot;When (if) they do manage to collide any particles can you mark it with a big bold Goooooooal!!!!!!!&quot;But of course. It would be my pleasure.  9.13am: BristolBoy asks: &quot;How long did it take them to discover that noise was coming from passing TGVs&quot; I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t remember quite how long it took to uncover. I don&apos;t think it was too long, because so many Cern staff pass through Geneva train station and they recognised the times when the anomalous signals were appearing. The fact that the signals came and went like clockwork Mon-Fri, and then at different times at the weekend helped. I wonder if anyone would have noticed if the collider was in the UK. Our trains seem to come and go as they please.  9.20am: Craignewzealand asks about the similarity between LHC collisions and those in the cosmos.  I think it&apos;s a fair question to ask, but it&apos;s one that gets short shrift from many particle physicists. Very quickly, the argument is that higher energy collisions have been going on for billions of years somewhere in the universe, and there&apos;s been no catastrophe yet. That we know of. In space, particles can have head on collisions, though a speeding particle slamming into stationary ion/surface is more likely. John Marburger, President Bush&apos;s former science adviser, told me these fears were like going for a swim in Scotland and worrying about being eaten by the Loch Ness monster. Theory doesn&apos;t rule out the Loch Ness monster, not absolutely anyway. No one has (really) ever seen it. And if it is there, we don&apos;t know if it likes the taste of people. I would go on, but I&apos;m probably boring people!  9.23am: Fresh beams expected in just under one hour.  9.27am: WendyZu, Apolloman: Not much to add re: the picture except that the yellow curved tracks are charged particles that are kicked out of the collisions and bent by the detector&apos;s magnetic field. Some of the other markings are due to the calorimeter in the detector being triggered - they give a measure of the amount of energy carried by the particles produced.This shot is taken looking down the beampipe or collision axis.  9.29am: In case you&apos;ve ever wondered what the Cern scientists have been up to since the LHC switched on at low energy in November...  9.33am: I&apos;ve been trying to think what this all reminds me of and I&apos;ve got it. Sitting at Kennedy Space Centre waiting for the shuttle to launch. I&apos;ve been three times and seen zero launches. Each time, the weather closed in or there was a technical glitch of some sort. The whole process is so complex and the price of beign careless and going ahead too early is so high, that everything moves at a (sensibly) cautious pace. Cern can&apos;t afford another huge accident like the one that shut this machine down for 18 months in September 2008. These guys have the patience of saints.  9.41am: So. The machine is still being cooled down so that it can take another filling of protons. These are injected as beams with an energy of 450 billion electron volts. Once those are whizzing around in the machine, the accelerator fields will ramp up, steadily spinning the particles up to 3.5 trillion electron volts per beam.In case you find this frustrating: In the final year of operation of Cern&apos;s last collider, the Large Electron Positron Collider, the machine was being pushed so hard, it tripped out roughly every 15 minutes. That is, it would run for 15 mins, then break down. The beams then had to be filled again, stabilised, and then steered into collisions again. No one said particle physics was easy...  9.48am: Lemon3: I refer you to the priceless exchange between Robert Wilson, former director of Fermilab, and Senator John Pastore, during a Congressional hearing over the value of building a new particle accelerator. Pastore is sure there must be something about the machine that can be steered towards a defence app: Pastore: Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator that in any way involves the security of this country? Robert Wilson: No sir, I don&apos;t belive so. Pastore: Nothing at all? Wilson: Nothing at all. Pastore: It has no value in that respect? Wilson: It has only to do with the respect with which we regard one another, the dignity of men, our love of culture. It has to do with, are we good painters, good sculptors, great poets? I mean, all the things we really venerate and honor in our country and are patriotic about. It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except perhaps to make it worth defending.  9.53am: Wilson is a tad pretentious in that exchange, I&apos;d say. The real question: why do particle physics is a fair one. To learn about the universe and its make-up is enough for me to chip in my tax quids. bear in mind that 25% of the mass of the universe is dark, that we don&apos;t know what it is. Plenty more is not understood at all. The history of physics is littered with experts claiming the end of physics is nigh; that we are on the brink of knowing everything. It&apos;s no more true today than it was in Lord Kelvin&apos;s day.Beams back in 20 mins.  SirTachyon: I do hope so!  9.55am: ieclark: Forgive me, I&apos;m an enthusiast. This thing costs the UK more than a million quid a week, I like to know how it&apos;s getting on!  9.59am: harmonyfuture: It depends if Hawking radiation works as advertised. Bear in mind you need an awful lot of matter to make a dangerous blackhole, and bunches of protons just aren&apos;t enough to do that. If you get teensy ones, and it&apos;s a huge if, they&apos;ll be fabulously hot and are expected to radiate themselves out of existence in the blink of an eye.  10.02am: Jacktatum: There&apos;s a proper science journalist covering this? Where?!The machine uses magnetic fields to steer the beams into head-on collisions at four points around the accelerator ring. Well, it&apos;s not a ring as such, but it&apos;s almost circular. The beams are crossed inside the four detectors: Atlas, CMS, LHCb and Alice.  10.08am: SirTachyon: I&apos;m not at all sure how you&apos;d go about looking for a tachyon. The buggers move faster than the speed of light, so I for one won&apos;t be able to catch one. You might get some joy here.  10.10am: New analysis shows that the glitch that&apos;s holding things up was due to magnetic coupling of the main circuits in super proton synchrotron (the injecting accelerator) and the LHC, not electrical noise. Or is it the Higgs particle wooing its way back in time and jinxing the machine. Again.  10.17am: New bunch of protons has just been injected. Where do they get all the protons from? Tis easy. Get a big can of hydrogen, put an electrical voltage across it, strip off the electrons and ditch them. Eeach hydrogen atom has one proton for a nucleus, and one electron orbiting it. Once you&apos;ve got rid of the electrons, you have positively charged protons, which you can steer and accelerate with fields.  10.21am: ieclark: It&apos;s a fair point. I was at Cern for &quot;big bang day&quot; in 2008. It was overdone by the media I think. Especially for poor listeners of the R4 Today programme who were treated to an audio explanation of a dot appearing on a screen. I haven&apos;t been asked to live blog this for the Guardian. I just wanted to. It&apos;s the biggest experiment in physics in a generation. It might well go badly wrong. I won&apos;t live blog every minute, but since I&apos;m going to be watching the coverage anyway, I thought I might write about it while I&apos;m at it. I do take your point about media overkill though. What does everyone else think?  10.26am: Gregmcdougall asks: &quot;What would the effect on living tissue (other than the assumed cold) of these high-energy beams be?&quot;A good question.In the mid-70s, a Russian physicist called Anatoli Bugorski was checking a faulty accelerator when the proton beam came on and hit his head. He says he saw a bright flash &quot;brighter than a thousand suns&quot;.His face swelled up and skin started falling off. He lost some hearing but otherwise his brain remained in quite decent shape. He could still function, but got tired quickly. It was a crazy accident to have happened.  10.27am: Proton beams are circulating. Now they have to be ramped up to high energy. You go slow and steady at this stage. If you go too fast and a power unit trips out, you basically slide back down that ladder and have to start all over again.  10.35am: SirTachyon: Bear in mind that around a billion protons will be colliding every second when the LHC is up and running. The detectors will look for different things, but there is plenty of overlap too. You can hunt for known particle decays-so the Higgs might decay into quarks of certain energies. But, so many other things can do that too, that you have to record a huge number of collisions before you can be sure you&apos;re seeing something on top of what you&apos;d expect without a Higgs existing. This isn&apos;t the kind of experiment that gives you an answer within hours or days or even weeks. You collect data and watch the statistics of different collisions. If a certain decay process happens more than is predicted, then it could be something new being created. The particles that are created are all unstable - otherwise we&apos;d be finding them down the back of our sofas all the time. So unstable particles decay soon after being created, into other more stable particles that are picked up by the detectors. You then collect these debris particles, measure their masses and energies, and work backwards to see what could have decayed into them. Apologies for rushing this - I&apos;ll do a proper explainer some time if there&apos;s interest.  10.45am: Lyn Evans, head of the LHC, speaking. They&apos;re going for ramping up in 1 minute.More to come from the DG Rolf Heuer.  10.50am: jacktatum: A good point - there is indeed stable dark matter. There could well be a whole family of dark particles, some stable, others not so. All of the particles we know of are the ones that either make us up, or interact with the ones that make us up. A guy called James Wells at Cern speaks well on this - and talks about particle physics being to anthropocentric. There is no reason why we should have a privileged view of the universe; that we should be able to see all, or even the majority of particles and forces at work in the universe. We might be privvy to a minority reality. It&apos;s all fun stuff.  10.58am: Someone asked: What if the LHC doesn&apos;t find anything.Frankly, it&apos;d be a disaster. But. The LHC absolutely should find something. Somewhere in the energy range it covers (up to 14TeV) there must be something that explains something called electroweak symmetry breaking. This is the process that separated the electromagnetic force (which allows us to see) from the weak force (that plays a role in sunshine production) a picosecond after the big bang. The process is thought to have been caused by the Higgs field, which in breaking the electroweak symmetry, gives mass to certain bosons (force carrying particles) and also the quarks and electrons that make up normal matter. Finding the Higgs boson (which could weigh the equivalent of 115 - 140 billion electron volts) will suggest that Higgs&apos;s ideas about the origin of mass are correct.But still. What if it finds nothing?That really would be a disaster for particle physics. Because I can&apos;t see governments readily funding another collider (for example, a giant linear collider) if existing theories have not been pruned back to reveal some promising avenues of discovery.Someone else asked about the giant size of these machines. I couldn&apos;t agree more. They are the most high-tech things we have, yet still seem a bit Space 1999. This machine, if you pulled it up from the ground and stood it up, would reach 5 miles into the sky. Whatever happened to miniaturisation&quot;?Progress is at hand. Physicists are working on ways of accelerating particles to huge energies over short distances. One technique, uses &quot;plasma wake fields&quot; to get particles &quot;surfing&quot; along a plasma wave at incredible speeds. It&apos;ll be a while before a collider built on this technology is built though.  11.02am: CuriousJohn: How would we recognise evil incarnate against LHC backgrounds?An aside.: when I was a student I asked Martin Bell (he of the white suit) if he believed in true evil. Turns out he does (or did back then). Like it&apos;s an entity. One for the philosophers I suspect. Back to reality:Ramping up of the beams is going on now. They expect to be at top energy, 3.5TeV, in 25 mins. The energy right now is 950GeV (billion electron volts). They began from 450 GeV.  11.07am: jacktatum: there are Higgsless theories, for sure. Some break electroweak symmetry using extra dimensions. Quick thing on electroweak symmetry breaking. Before it&apos;s broken, there are four bosons that are all massless and carry the electroweak force. They are the photon, W+, W- and Z bosons. After symmetry breaking, the Ws and Z become massive but the photon remains massless. That separates the two, because the photon, being massless, can still act over infinite distance. Because the W &amp; Z get so heavy, they make sure the weak force can only act over a tiny distance. It&apos;s so short range, it basically acts only on contact.  11.10am: tinylittlebear: Indeed. But on Friday I was speaking to woman who recently left Cern to work on particle beams for cancer treatment in Oxford. Charged particles dump their energy in tissue at a defined point, so by being tricksy, you can fire particles at a tumour and get them to dump their energy (heat) into the tumour and frazzle it. So what nearly did for Bugorski is a life extender (I&apos;m not sure life saving is possible) for loads of people. Another example of how pushing tech and science with projects like the LHC lead to full on benefits for broader society.  11.15am: Emptycan: For the larger part, the British scientists at Cern seem to have faired quite well, but others, such as the nuclear physicists, are in very real trouble. Across the board cuts are probably coming to science. Lord Drayson still talks of a budget ringfence for science, but universities are cutting PhD studentships already. The Chancellor announced \u00a3600m of cuts to higher education and research budgets last year.

Lord Coe today said the 25th Hour campaign will help London deliver on the legacy promises that he made in Singapore in 2005 and helped secure the Games. The Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, said it could also be a key factor in spreading the benefits and the inspirational effect of the Olympics beyond the capital. The campaign, to be launched in June in partnership with the Young Volunteers Service, will call on the public to pledge their time to local volunteering opportunities. In a letter to the Guardian, the heads of governing bodies including British Cycling, UK Athletics, the Football Association, the England and Wales Cricket Board and the Rugby Football Union join Jowell and Coe in backing the scheme. &quot;One third of people \u2013 and almost half of young people \u2013 say that they would give their time to an Olympic inspired activity,&quot; the letter says. &quot;Through the 25th Hour we will convert that national energy into meaningful action in communities all over the country.&quot; The scheme is separate from the 2012 volunteer scheme that will seek to recruit 70,000 volunteers during the Games and for which 300,000 people have already registered an interest. There are hopes that the 25th Hour initiative could be part of a renewed drive to establish a sports participation legacy from the Games by persuading volunteers to sign up as coaches and assistants in community sports projects. &quot;For anything to work at a national level it has to work at a local level and the most precious asset you have as an individual is your time and your expertise and experience,&quot; Coe said. The 25th Hour drive, also backed by charities and voluntary organisations, will initially be funded by government but it hopes to secure sponsorship. Two thousand and twelve &quot;25th Hour champions&quot; will be invited to a dress rehearsal of the Olympic Opening Ceremony. &quot;The vision we set in Singapore is very important for me because it&apos;s against that vision that we intend to deliver.

The list of poachers turned gamekeepers is not a long one, though it does stretch a long way back. Two of the first were the Newton Heath (latterly Manchester United) players Sam Black and Herbert Dale. &quot;Black was one of the earliest known Manchester United captains in the 1880s when they were Newton Heath,&quot; reckons Charbel Boujaoude. &quot;He later became a referee and on one occasion, he disallowed an Arsenal goal because the ball burst on its way to the net and the keeper couldn&apos;t thus stop it due to its skewed trajectory. &quot;During Black&apos;s spell with Newton Heath, Dale was a reserve player at the club. After only making the first team once, he decided a better way of getting onto the field was to become a ref. Sure enough, he was seen whistling in Football League games for years.&quot; More recently the Huddersfield Town, Bradford City and Chesterfield defender Steve Baines decided to start dishing out bookings rather than receiving them. &quot;Having retired from playing in 1987, Baines worked in insurance before taking up refereeing,&quot; writes Pete Stanford. &quot;By 1994, he had progressed to being an Assistant Referee and was promoted to the Football League&apos;s Referees List in 1995. Baines&apos; career &quot;in the middle&quot; lasted for eight years. &quot;Although he is the only ex-Football League player to have a refereeing career of any note, he is not alone in moving from wearing football kit to donning refereeing kit: ex-Bolton Wanderers centre half Bob Matthewson (he refereed the 1974 Charity Shield between Leeds United and Liverpool) and ex-Wrexham outside right John Lloyd (who career as an official lasted from 1985 to 1986) both took charge of matches, but they had totalled less than half a dozen Football League appearances between them.&quot; And at least two referees have experienced life on both sides of the fence. &quot;The now retired referee Dick Jol (probably best known for refereeing the 2001 Champions League Final between Bayern Munich and Valencia) played several matches for NEC Nijmegen in the Dutch league before moving on to Belgium where he played for the likes of Menen, Berchem Sport and current first division team KV Kortrijk,&quot; writes Wouter IJzermans. &quot;As a player Ben Haverkort, now retired as referee, made it through the youth ranks at Ajax. Not able to force his way in to the Ajax first squad, Haverkort spent most of his playing career representing minor outfits like Telstar, Cambuur Leeuwarden and Emmen.&quot; Rather brilliantly Haverkort collected 73 cards and six reds as a player, many of which, according to worldreferee.com, &quot;were for talking to the ref, even abusing him&quot;. &apos;ENGLISHMEN&apos; ABROAD (2) Last week we, or rather the helpful Warren Lyons, looked at those &apos;Englishmen&apos; who have worn an international shirt other than that bearing the three lions. And as ever plenty of readers have been in touch with emails beginning &quot;I can&apos;t believe you missed ...&quot; &quot;The former Australia international Robbie Slater was actually the only Lancashire-born member of Blackburn&apos;s 1994-95 Premier League winning squad,&quot; kicks off Stuart Horton. &quot;He was born in Ormskirk and moved to Australia at six months, eventually going on to represent their national side 28 times. A more recent example, though, is Colin Kazim-Richards, or Kazim Kazim as he&apos;s known now. Born in London to a Turkish Cypriot mother, he has played 16 times for Turkey and was a member of their Euro 2008 squad.&quot; Perhaps even more glaring, given that we did highlight his international and club team-mate, and fellow England native, Daniel Bennett, was the omission of Singapore&apos;s John Wilkinson. &quot;He played for Exeter City before coming to Singapore in 2002,&quot; points out Sazali Abdul Aziz. &quot;He gained citizenship in mid-2007 after marrying a local, and made his international debut (and scored) against Bruno Metsu&apos;s United Arab Emirates side a couple of weeks later. He also made history by becoming the first Singaporean to score in the Asian Champions League group stage last April.&quot; Casting a little further back we were also reminded of the &apos;Bogot\u00e1 Bandit&apos; Charlie Mitten, who left Manchester United to join Independiente Santa Fe in 1950 for a handsome sum. While there he, along with fellow Englishman George Mountford and the Argentinian-born Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, played for a Colombia XI who beat the reigning world champions 4-2, though at the time their adopted country was not officially recognised by Fifa. Jon Enfield, meanwhile opens up a whole new can of worms by highlighting the case of Mike Renshaw, who won two caps during the United States&apos; tour of Europe in 1973 despite the fact he had never been granted citizenship. Renshaw, a regular for NASL&apos;s Dallas Tornado at the time, played in friendlies against Poland and Bermuda and several other Under-23 sides. It was only when he returned to America and immigration officials noticed his work permit had expired that team officials realised he had never been eligible in the first place. FOOTBALL ON GOOGLE EARTH (4) For the past few weeks we&apos;ve been looking for matches captured by the blimp/gently orbiting satellite/flaming lidless eye of Google Earth. Though not a match, one of our favourite spots arrived this week from David Tunnicliffe.   View Larger Map   &quot;In the Burgplatz in Leipzig, Germany you can see what is unmistakeably a sea of orange,&quot; writes David. &quot;These are Dutch fans milling about either before or after (can&apos;t see the date of the picture) their World Cup 2006 match against Serbia and Montenegro on 11 June 2006.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;I once saw a Danish footballing film late at night during the 70&apos;s,&quot; wrote TW Cheung back in the innocent days of 2006. &quot;It was very strange and involved the Danish legend Allan Simonsen being targeted by a sniper during a football game. Anyone know the name of this film?&quot; We had a deluge of answers to this question, which was a great relief because none of us could understand why anyone would want to assassinate the former Charlton Athletic striker. To a man and woman, you agreed that the name of the 1977 Danish turkey in question is Skytten, although English translations varied between The Marksman, The Sniper and, in one instance, The Gamekeeper. However, we feel obliged to point out that Allan Simonsen being targeted by Jens Okking&apos;s villain isn&apos;t actually the focus of the movie. &quot;It&apos;s about a man who misinterprets remarks made by a journalist who says that force may be necessary to keep Denmark nuclear-free, so he starts shooting everyone, including our beloved, curly-haired midget,&quot; explains David &quot;Barry Norman&quot; Tiemroth. Not content with spoiling the plot for you, we&apos;re also happy to let Nikolaj Steen M\u00f8ller reveal how the scene in question was filmed: &quot;The director got Simonsen to lie completely still for a few seconds after attempting a header in an actual international,&quot; he explains. &quot;Then they added blood to the pictures afterwards. Simonsen was up for it, and so was Danish commentator Svend Gehrs, who added &apos;stunned&apos; commentary to the movie&apos;s soundtrack.&quot; For a review of Skytten and more info on it&apos;s unlikely star, click here.

Scroll forward to 1992 and Carlisle finished 92nd and bottom of the Fourth Divison, giving them the (un)enviable record of having been both top and bottom of the Football League.

But in his career has won three La Liga&apos;s, two Champions Leagues, one Copa Del Ray and a plethora of Super Cups. So which player has won the most club titles without winning an international cap?&quot; &quot;If Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs qualify for the Champions&apos; League, will it be the first time that three clubs from the same city have appeared in it in the same season?&quot; ponders Neil Carter.

There&apos;s plenty to think about if the Nigerian city of 16 million tightly packed inhabitants is the ultimate expression of modern urban living. Lagos is growing at such an astonishing rate that by 2015 it is predicted to be the third largest city in the world, behind Mumbai and Tokyo, but it is an unlikely model metropolis. Although the country has vast oil resources, the city&apos;s infrastructure is appalling. Three-quarters of Lagos residents live in slums. The rail network manages one train per week. Despite being the world&apos;s sixth biggest oil producer, power cuts are a daily occurrence and a national joke. Lagosians have renamed the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) as Never Expect Power Always. When I first visited Nigeria, my parents&apos; homeland, a decade ago, I was unprepared for the reality. It was like landing on another planet. Although the city is a nightmare to navigate, the Lagosians are a breed apart. Millions of quick-witted economic migrants have created a city characterised by personal ingenuity and entrepreneurship. Nothing is wasted, everything is a commodity. &quot;Lagos is not a kind of backward situation but an announcement of the future,&quot; the architect Rem Koolhaas has said. &quot;What is now fascinating is how, with some level of self-organisation, there is a strange combination of extreme underdevelopment and development.&quot; Will Anderson, the series producer of Welcome to Lagos, a fascinating new three-part documentary, agrees. He believes the way they have addressed the problems of extreme population growth is a lesson for us all, especially now that half the world&apos;s population live in cities, including one billion slum dwellers. &quot;I am an anthropologist by background, but rather than looking at marginal and tribal populations, I wanted to look at massive cities. If a Martian came down to Earth, they would report back that we are a species that lives in cities. And in some degrees the people in Lagos are doing it better than we are in the west,&quot; he says. The series looks at life on the Olusosun rubbish dump, the workplace and home to more than 1,000 scavengers who sift the garbage looking for recyclable material. This is a vibrant, self-policing community living next to a mosque, a barber&apos;s shop and three cinemas. The film-makers also take us to Makoka lagoon where 300,000 people live on water and in squatter camps on the beach. It is soon clear that most Lagos residents will do anything to earn a few dollars a day, from back-breaking labour to sharp business deals, because there is no welfare state to provide a safety net. But among Lagosians, who tend to combine relentless entrepreneurial flair with the belief that God will provide, there is little time for self-pity, a fact reflected in the series. &quot;We did not want the people to come across as victims because that is not how they see themselves,&quot; says Anderson. &quot;They are normal people doing what they have to do to survive. They encounter the same obstactles as the rest of us, but it&apos;s just that they do so in extreme circumstances.&quot; Welcome to Lagos will be shown on BBC 2 at 9pm on 15, 22 and 29 April  Voices from the margins ERIC OBUH  Eric, 28, works as a scavenger on the Olusosun landfill site, the largest dump site in Lagos, and has recorded his first album &quot;Send Them Come&quot;. &quot;They call me Slender, Vocal Slender, that&apos;s my music name. Because I&apos;m very lean in the face, and because I&apos;m always singing my songs. I have so many songs I still want to record, good songs that I&apos;ve written, but no one has heard. Songs about divine love, peace and unity in Nigeria, and others which praise all the girls. &quot;The film crew have made me a website. MySpace. It&apos;s not easy to get a website on your own. I know about 200 singers in Ajegunle where I live, but only two or three have websites. Ajegunle is the biggest ghetto in Lagos. It&apos;s where all the biggest Nigerian stars come from, people like Daddy Showkey, Baba Fryo, Mighty Mouse, African China, B&apos;Clean, and Nico Gravity. Every night there&apos;s a party going on somewhere, people playing music on the street corners, or setting up sound systems to dance to. &quot;One day I&apos;m going to be more famous than Craig David. Then I&apos;ll have enough money to be able to spend all day on my music, instead of working here on the dump. A lot of people who know me, my friends, and my family, they don&apos;t know I work in the dump. They believe I just do music. And I want to keep it that way, so I will have respect. It&apos;s not that the dump is bad, because the money I get from it keeps my body and soul together, and helps me make my music.&quot; MOHAMMED ADAMU Mohammed, 30, is a cattle dealer at the Oluwainshola Cattle Market and Slaughter Yard on the outskirts of Lagos. &quot;I am planning to marry presently, some time soon. I think it is the right time. I&apos;m 30 now, and I have sent a message to my family letting them know I am ready. They will arrange everything. Her name is Aysha. I have met her three times already, during my trips home to my village in the north. She is good, I like her, there is love and understanding and I don&apos;t doubt her at all. My family are very happy with me. To have only one wife is OK by me. I have seen the disadvantages people have with more than one wife. I want to get a house in Lagos, and to live with her here. She has never left her village. But I cannot be going up and down to the north all the time \u2013 the expenses would be too much. &quot;I am waiting to know the exact day of the wedding. I will have to provide property for her, and decorative things, two or three bags of clothes. The bags will be filled with everything concerning women&apos;s dresses, including the shoes. The only thing they have asked me for is jewellery. The whole thing will cost around 150,000 naira (\u00a3600). I know I can reach that amount. &quot;When the day comes, me and my friends will go to the north, and my wife&apos;s family will cook. W e&apos;ll gather for prayers, and then I&apos;ll take my wife to the house to celebrate the wedding. The next day I&apos;ll bring her back to Lagos, and continue selling cows in the market.&quot; ESTHER OGUNLEKE Esther, 24, lives in a house built on Kuramo Beach, a tiny spit of sand attached to Victoria Island, Lagos&apos;s most upmarket neighbourhood. &quot;I&apos;ve just finished reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. One of the film crew left me her copy when she said goodbye. I thought it was beautiful and exciting, and I want to read the next one in the trilogy, but I haven&apos;t been able to find a copy anywhere. I pray to God that he will provide one. I love to read so much. &quot;This is me, outside my house on Kuramo beach. It&apos;s a small stretch of sand attached to Victoria Island, one of the most upmarket neighbourhoods in Lagos. Everyone thinks only drug addicts, armed robbers and prostitutes live here, but they never come to find out the truth. I&apos;ve lived on the beach for almost eight years. There&apos;s about 1,000 of us here. Shopkeepers, motorbike taxi drivers, even businessmen who work in banks. My best friend, Lati, runs a cinema house next to where I live. We watch Nollywood movies, and all the Chelsea matches. I could never be friends with anyone who supports Manchester United. They are the Red Devils. They are devilish. Maybe they are using their devilish substance to win all the major trophies they have been winning. I hate them. Their nickname is very bad. Up Chelsea! Blues for life! &quot;My house cost about \u00a360 to build. You have to buy the wood and tarpaulins, and then pay a tax to the local chairman. I like to keep it very clean. When I was arguing with my husband, we had a big fight about who was going to get the house. I wasn&apos;t going to let him leave me homeless, with nowhere to go. &quot;In this picture, I&apos;m getting dressed up for church. I&apos;m a member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. On the first Friday of every month they hold a &apos;miracle service&apos;.

When the dollar goes down, the price goes down. When the dollar is up, the price goes up. The only difference between me and someone who works in the stock market is the suit and the tie, and the fine shoes. I&apos;ve been working on the dump for 12 years. I&apos;m a buyer. I buy from the scavengers, and sell to the reprocessing factories. Aluminium, zinc, copper wire, rubber slippers \u2013 all this is what I buy. &quot;All these big rich people, they don&apos;t like to conserve things. They throw everything away, even if there&apos;s nothing wrong with it! My house is full of the things I&apos;ve found on the dump. Toasted-sandwich makers. Field glasses. Even my daughter&apos;s teddy. &quot;My older daughter, Peace, will be four in May. One day, she&apos;s going to be the future Miss World. My wife Elizabeth and I believe she&apos;s going to be great in life. That&apos;s what we pray for. I don&apos;t mind what she does or how she does it \u2013 she&apos;ll make her own life. &quot;I&apos;m not ashamed to work in the dump. All my neighbours know that&apos;s where I work.I don&apos;t rob. I don&apos;t steal. I&apos;m an honest person. What is important is love for your family. That&apos;s what drives you to walk that extra mile. If there was a dump that was stinkier than this one, where I could earn more, then I&apos;d go there to work, just to make sure my family enjoys life. The government are not interested in our recycling business. They don&apos;t look at us as human beings. They just look at us as if we are miscreants. Vagabonds.

His ship, the Endeavour, had struck a reef now known as the Endeavour Reef, within a manifestly far bigger reef system, nearly 25 miles from shore. Only the urgent jettisoning of 50 tonnes of stores and equipment (including all but four of the ship&apos;s guns), a delicate operation known as fothering (in which an old sail was drawn under the hull, effectively plugging the hole), Cook&apos;s expert seamanship and a great deal of hard pumping saved the vessel and her crew. It would be another 30-odd years before the great Lincolnshire explorer and cartographer Matthew Flinders, having circumnavigated the entirety of Terra Australis Incognita, the Unknown Southern Land, gave the vast reef system its name. But despite his astonishing success in charting a safe passage through its treacherous waters, mainly by the expedient of sending small boats ahead to sound the depths, Flinders himself was later stranded on it while heading home for England in 1803. For nearly 250 years, the Great Barrier Reef has been a hazard to shipping. It is the world&apos;s largest reef system, made up of more than 2,900 coral reefs and 900 islands scattered over 344,400sq km off the coast of Queensland in north-east Australia. Covering an area bigger than the United Kingdom, it is also a priceless and unimaginably fragile world heritage site, home to 30 species of whales, dolphins and porpoises; six species of sea turtles; 125 species of shark, stingray and skate; 5,000 species of mollusc; nine species of seahorse; 215 species of birds; 17 species of sea snake; 2,195 known plant species and more than 1,500 species of fish. And it is still a hazard to shipping. In recent years, its pristine waters, in theory protected by the statutes of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, have become known as the &quot;coal highway&quot;, a busy thoroughfare for foreign-owned bulk carriers bound for Asia. Laden with coal and fuel oil from Australia, thousands of ships, such as the Chinese-owned Shen Neng 1, which ran aground off the country&apos;s eastern seaboard on Saturday, continue to jeopardise the largest marine conservation site in the world. Last night, as salvage teams worked to prevent what would be the biggest environmental disaster in Australian history, environmentalists were not slow to accuse the government of turning a blind eye to the problem. &quot;This is the $60bn-a-year, largely foreign-owned coal industry that is making a coal highway out of the Great Barrier Reef,&quot; said Bob Brown, leader of the Australian Greens party. &quot;There needs to be a radical overview of this huge coal export industry, whether these ships need to use the reef at all, and what the alternatives are,&quot; he said. Local fishermen have dubbed it the &quot;reef rat run,&quot; saying ships routinely take shortcuts to save time and money on their voyage to China. It was this so-called shortcut, near the Douglas Shoal, off Rockhampton, that is believed to have caused last weekend&apos;s accident. According to reports, the 230m-long ship, carrying 975 tonnes of heavy fuel oil and 65,000 tonnes of coal, was travelling at full speed when it hit a sandbank, in a protected part of the Great Barrier Reef. Its fuel tank ruptured, causing a 3km-long oil slick. Authorities stemmed the spill, but have warned that the salvage operation could take weeks, as moving the vessel will be &quot;a very delicate&quot; operation that risks sending hundreds of tonnes of oil on to the reef. Salvage teams are now being flown in to begin pumping the 950 tonnes of oil fuel off the vessel and on to another ship before an attempt can be made to move her. The Queensland premier, Anna Bligh, has said the ship&apos;s owner, Shenzhen Energy \u2013 a subsidiary of the Chinese shipping giant Cosco, which has allegedly been involved in three major international incidents in four years \u2013 could face a fine of up to $A1m (\u00a3600,000) for straying from a shipping lane that is currently used by some 6,000 cargo vessels each year. The stricken ship was travelling to China from Gladstone, a port playing a growing role in the booming export trade of Australia&apos;s natural resources to Asia. The incident follows a similar accident in March last year when 60km of Queensland&apos;s south-east coast were declared a disaster area after 42 tonnes of oil spilled into the ocean from the MV Pacific Adventurer during a cyclone. Conservationists say the fact that there is no legal requirement to have marine pilots on board ships in the area, to guide them safely through the 2,500km reef system, puts it in grave danger. &quot;The current lack of safeguards around shipping in the Great Barrier Reef is akin to playing russian roulette with one of the world&apos;s most treasured natural icons,&quot; says Gilly Llewellyn, the conservation director of WWF Australia, who called for ships to be piloted. She also wants improved monitoring systems so authorities know where large vessels are situated on the reef at all times. The Australasian Marine Pilots Institute, the organising body for Australia&apos;s marine pilots, says the grounding of the Shen Neng should focus attention on the lack of protection Australia&apos;s maritime regulations afford the reef. An Australian maritime law expert, Peter Glover, says public opinion and government legislative reaction to marine pollution by commercial shipping in the Great Barrier Reef have got noticeably tougher since 1996, when the Panamanian vessel Peacock, en route from Singapore to New Zealand via the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef, ran aground on Piper Reef. The ship was carrying approximately 605 tonnes of bunker heavy fuel oil, and its owners were not even prosecuted. Following the grounding of the 22,000-tonne Malaysian-flagged container vessel Bunga Teratai Satu on Sudbury Reef in 2001, legislative changes were introduced to allow both state and Commonwealth authorities to prosecute those who pollute in the waters surrounding the reef. Those changes were put to the test almost immediately in the wake of another potentially catastrophic grounding the following year, of the Greek-flagged bulk carrier Doric Chariot. But Peter Glover believes it still &quot;remains to be seen . . . how effective legislative changes are in addressing the prosecution of individuals responsible for causing damage&quot; in the reef. Inspecting the scene from the air yesterday, Australia&apos;s prime minister, Kevin Rudd, expressed concern that the Shen Neng 1, balancing precariously in the crystal-clear waters, had strayed so far from official shipping lanes. &quot;From where I see it, it is outrageous that any vessel could find itself 12km off course, it seems, in the Great Barrier Reef,&quot; Rudd told reporters in tropical Queensland, where the reef park is a major tourist draw. He pledged an overhaul of measures to protect the Great Barrier Reef from any future environmental disasters. &quot;There is no greater natural asset for Australia than the Great Barrier Reef,&quot; he said. But maritime traffic through the Great Barrier Reef is projected only to increase, with contracts reportedly signed for the export of $60bn worth of liquefied natural gas from coal seams as shrinking resources spur energy companies to turn to unconventional gas reserves to feed Asian demand. Work is under way to expand the port of Gladstone in Queensland to lift capacity by up to 25m tonnes a year, driven by surging demand from Japan, South Korea, India and China. Local fishermen fear any increase in traffic will put Australia&apos;s most precious environmental asset at further risk. &quot;We see ships through there every day,&quot; Graham Scott, who has been fishing and chartering boats on the reef for 40 years, told the Sydney Morning Herald. &quot;We see many, many boats within 15 miles of that spot [where the Shen Neng 1 grounded]. One or two boats a day, every time we&apos;re out. We&apos;ve assumed in the past that they&apos;re not coal boats, because what would a coal boat be doing there?&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/apr/09/compassgroup", "sentences": ["Elsewhere Aviva added 8.7p to 388p as the insurer re-entered the Asian general insurance market after five years by launching a new business in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-04-09T15:52:20Z", "title": "Compass climbs on US deal talk while Greek hopes lift FTSE", "tags": ["Compass", "Business", "Anglo American", "Xstrata", "Aviva", "Prudential", "Legal and General", "Hibu", "Premier Oil"], "article": "Catering group Compass was on the menu for investors on talk it could take over a key US contract from French rival Sodexo.

Democrat Loretta Sanchez said there were concerns that Sodexo services had been more expensive and less effective than originally promised. Hopes that Compass might benefit by winning the new contract sent its shares 16p higher to 540p. Overall, markets regained some of their poise, amid speculation that Greece would soon receive EU and IMF aid to tackle its debt crisis - perhaps as soon as this weekend. UBS economist Stephane Deo said:  We have always been cautious on the ability of Greece to meet its financing needs during the second quarter without any external assistance. In our view, the recent market action means that an external intervention may be unavoidable and could happen very soon as the situation is untenable. We think an intervention over the weekend is a distinct possibility. We believe the most likely scenario is one in which the IMF will have a key role both in terms of providing liquidity and in terms of providing expertise on additional measures. We continue to believe that an IMF intervention is probably the best possible outcome.  Even the news that Fitch had downgraded Greece&apos;s credit ratings by two notches failed to dampen the positive mood set by the prospect of a rescue package. With commodity prices on the rise again - gold climbed to its highest level since January - mining groups helped the FTSE 100 regain all of yesterday&apos;s losses and more, with the leading index closing 58.28 points higher at 5770.98. Fresnillo, the Mexican silver and gold specialist, finished 30p higher at 884p, while Anglo American added 73p to 2979.5p. Xstrata rose 36p to \u00a312.99 as word went round it might enter the $3.5bn bidding battle for Australia&apos;s Macarthur Coal, which is already trying to fend off bids from local rival New Hope and US group Peabody Coal. Macarthur said yesterday that an investment bank representing Xstrata had approached one of its major shareholders:  Macarthur understands that this discussion was &apos;preliminary and highly conceptual&apos;. Macarthur has no further information about the context or content of that discussion, nor whether Xstrata has any substantive interest in Macarthur or any of its assets.  An Xstrata spokesman declined to comment on the situation. Elsewhere Aviva added 8.7p to 388p as the insurer re-entered the Asian general insurance market after five years by launching a new business in Singapore. Prudential, up 11p at 573.5p, already has plans to expand in the area with its $35.5bn bid for the Asian operations of US insurer AIG. Legal and General closed 0.65p ahead at 90.55p. Analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove raised their target price from 35p to 86p but kept an underweight rating on the company. They said:  We recognize that management has done a good job in pitching the L&amp;G investment case in relatively simple terms \u2013 a rarity in this sector \u2013 and there could be a nice growth opportunity in annuities long term. However, the shares trade on 8 times 2011 estimated PE, which seems appropriate given the uncertainty on earnings sustainability and regulation.

RBS&apos;s Phil Corbett said:  We still believe management will be under pressure to deliver clear-cut exploration success in 2010, although we like the balance of the exploration programme and believe that recent oil price moves are making the company&apos;s valuation discount even more untenable.

According to legal sources, Victor Dahdaleh, a London-based aluminium trader, has had his Belgravia premises searched by the Serious Fraud Office, and offshore bank accounts linked to him are being examined in the Isle of Man and Channel Islands. He is also under criminal investigation by the US department of justice. This follows allegations that Dahdaleh has used UK banking havens to make covert payment of millions of dollars to senior officials in the Gulf state of Bahrain, in order to overcharge their organisation by an estimated $65m a year. At the time of the alleged bribe payments, Dahdaleh, who &quot;vigorously contests&quot; the allegations, was using some of his wealth in London to fund Labour-supporting thinktanks, including the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Policy Network, a group founded by Tony Blair and presided over by Mandelson. Dahdaleh helped pay for a Mandelson-authored pamphlet and both Mandelson and Blair appeared at Dahdaleh-sponsored events. Mandelson referred to Dahdaleh as &quot;Victor, my friend&quot; and praised him as &quot;a business dynamo, a public-spirited figure, and a big-hearted personality&quot;. Policy Network refuses to say how much cash he has given since 2005. Dahdaleh sponsorship of more than \u00a31m also helped the businessman to a governorship of the London School of Economics alongside Cherie Blair, and the presidency of an Anglo-Canadian trade body in London. He also persuaded both Mandelson and Blair to speak there. Another donation of more than $1m went to the US foundation set up by ex-president Bill Clinton. Mandelson&apos;s stance has been that he was merely flattering a millionaire sponsor, and had no close relations with him. His spokesman told the Wall Street Journal, which referred to the issue last week: &quot;These words should not be over-interpreted. Peter Mandelson is generally gracious toward the host, sponsor or chairman of whatever event he had been invited to address.&quot; Dahdaleh&apos;s aluminium-related operations survived an Office of Fair Trading inquiry in Britain in 2004, which ruled they did not pose monopoly dangers. The allegations against Dahdaleh centre around a previously unknown offshore entity in Jersey called United Legal Engineering Consultants Ltd [Ulec]. Investigators are reported to be examining whether it was used to make secret payments to top officials in Bahrain, who held Barclays offshore accounts in the Isle of Man. Jersey company records show that Ulec is controlled by Dahdaleh and two members of his family, who give their address as Amman, Jordan \u2013 although Dahdaleh lives in Eaton Place, London, and has offices of his main company, Dadco, based nearby. He holds a Canadian passport. The US department of justice started its investigation into Dahdaleh in 2008. Intervening in a civil lawsuit brought by the state-controlled Bahraini company, its anti-corruption unit disclosed Dahdaleh was &quot;the subject of an ongoing federal criminal investigation&quot;. He had been acting as an agent or middleman for the US aluminium giant Alcoa, which was supplying the alumina feedstock under long-term contracts to the smelter operation in Bahrain, and denies wrongdoing. It was alleged that, in order to jack up the price, millions of tons of alumina had been routed through Dahdaleh-controlled shell companies whose true ownership was hidden in the British Virgin Islands, Singapore and Switzerland. Last November, legal sources say, the SFO, acting on a treaty request for mutual legal assistance, conducted a search of Dardaleh&apos;s London premises. The SFO also has the power to impose production orders on British banks, and to liaise with parallel authorities in Jersey. Last night Dahdaleh&apos;s lawyer at Allen &amp; Overy, fraud specialist David Esseks, said: &quot;We do not propose to comment on any of the points you raise save to point out they contain many errors and inaccuracies.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/10/charanjit-singh-acid-house", "sentences": ["Veteran of countless Bollywood soundtrack orchestras, Singh was the sort to turn up at session with the latest new synthesiser, acquired at great expense from London or Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-04-09T23:11:15Z", "title": "Charanjit Singh, acid house pioneer", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Bollywood", "Dance music"], "article": "Charanjit Singh doubtless stood out as unusual in the Hindi film industry of the 1960s and 70s. Veteran of countless Bollywood soundtrack orchestras, Singh was the sort to turn up at session with the latest new synthesiser, acquired at great expense from London or Singapore. He was not, however, widely regarded among his country folk as someone &quot;pushing things forward&quot;. His band, the Charanjit Singh Orchestra, made their rupees touring weddings, performing the hits of the day, and while he played on many popular Bollywood recordings, Charanjit Singh was never a household name. In 1982, though, Singh did something unusual. Inspired by the sound of disco imports from the west making waves among Bombay&apos;s hipster cognoscenti, he went into the studio with some new kit \u2013 a Roland Jupiter-8 keyboard, a Roland TR-808 drum machine and a Roland TB-303 \u2013 and decided to make a record that combined western dance music with the droning ragas of Indian classical music. Recorded in two days, Ten Ragas To A Disco Beat garnered some interest, excerpts finding their way on to national radio, but it was a commercial flop and was soon forgotten. In 2002, record collector Edo Bouman came across Ten Ragas in a a shop in Delhi. &quot;Back at my hotel I played it on my portable player, and I was blown away. It sounded like acid house, or like an ultra-minimal Kraftwerk.&quot; But it was the date on the record that shocked Bouman. Released 1982, it predated the first acid house record \u2013 often regarded as Phuture&apos;s Acid Trax \u2013 by five years. Bouman tracked down Singh to Mumbai. &quot;He was most friendly and surprised I knew the album. I remember asking him how he got to this acid-like sound, but he didn&apos;t quite get my point. He didn&apos;t realise how stunningly modern it was.&quot; Eight years later, Bouman is reissuing the record on his label, Bombay Connection. Even today, it sounds like some strange kink in the dance music continuum, but Bouman is amused at speculation Ten Ragas is a hoax, cooked up by some Aphex Twin-style techno joker (the label has released Singh&apos;s conventional soundtrack work before, and besides, one can&apos;t imagine a respectable Bollywood reissue label pulling such a prank). Now in his 70s, Singh is, as Bouman puts it, &quot;more a musician than a talker,&quot; but he understands Ten Ragas might have been something accidentally, unusually prescient. &quot;He made close to 10 albums, but they all were cover albums,&quot; says Bouman. &quot;He told me, &apos;Frankly, this was the best thing I did. Other albums are all film songs I just played. But this was my own composition.

It hints, often unfairly, that everything was downhill thereafter. A case in point was James Aubrey, who was 14 when he played Ralph, one of the principal characters in Peter Brook&apos;s film of Lord of the Flies (1963), a part for which he was highly praised. Aubrey, who has died of cancer aged 62, was one of 30 British schoolboys chosen by Brook out of 3,000 candidates. In attempting to duplicate the conditions depicted in William Golding&apos;s novel about children on a desert island who have survived a plane crash, Brook transported his young cast to the island of Vieques, off Puerto Rico, and made them live in an abandoned pineapple cannery that had only the most basic facilities. As the children were only available during the school summer holidays of 1961, the film had to be completed quickly. Ralph, the &quot;genuine leader&quot; and voice of conscience among the barbarism, was so central to the film that the shoot nearly came to a halt when Aubrey went down with an ankle injury. Luckily it healed quickly enough, but the tears that he sheds at the end of the film were partly genuine as he remembered the pain. Many years later, affectionately recalling the filming, Aubrey said: &quot;For me something happened; a religious, spiritual experience. Peter Brook was the octopus and we were the arms.&quot; The holidays over, all the boys returned to their schools. Only Aubrey and Nicholas Hammond, who played Robert, one of the choirboys who follows Jack (Tom Chapin), Ralph&apos;s rival, continued acting. Like Ralph, Aubrey came from a privileged background. Born James Aubrey Tregidgo in Klagenfurt, Austria, where his father, Major Aubrey James Tregidgo, was stationed, he was educated at private English schools in Jamaica, Germany and Singapore. His first enjoyable taste of acting as a child in Lord of the Flies, followed by a very short run on Broadway in Isle of Children, directed by Jules Dassin, led him to study at the Drama Centre in London from 1967 to 1970. Aubrey then joined the Citizens theatre in Glasgow, appearing in such roles as Andrew Aguecheek in Twelfth Night. This was followed by spells with the Cambridge Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company. One of the highlights of his stage work was his portrayal of Tom Wingfield, the narrator, leading character and playwright&apos;s alter ego in Tennessee Williams&apos;s The Glass Menagerie at the Shaw theatre in London in 1977. In the meantime, Aubrey was starting to get work on television, his break coming in all seven episodes of Andrea Newman&apos;s steamy soap opera, Bouquet of Barbed Wire (1976), and a further seven episodes in the equally steamy sequel, Another Bouquet (1977), of which the TV critic Clive James wrote that &quot;by the end, everybody had been to bed with everybody else except the baby&quot;. Despite a rather wobbly American accent, Aubrey was rivetingly nasty as the abusive Gavin Sorenson, who marries the pregnant Prue Manson (Susan Penhaligon), but makes a play for her mother (Sheila Allen). Other TV series in which Aubrey had significant roles were as a detective inspector in Rockliffe&apos;s Folly (1988) and The Men&apos;s Room (1991), as well as popping up in Lytton&apos;s Diary (1986) and Dalziel and Pascoe (2005), among others. Of his films, it could be said, with some justification, that Lord of the Flies was the premature peak. They were a bizarre mix: a few gore and sexploitation movies; The Great Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll Swindle (1980), Tony Scott&apos;s lesbian vampire film The Hunger (1983), and Riders of the Storm (1986), in which he played an Italian-American Vietnam vet on an anti-rightwing crusade led by a crazed Dennis Hopper. Most of these, Aubrey chose to forget. However, among his treasured possessions were the conch shell he used to call the boys to order in Lord of the Flies, and a copy of a biography of Tennessee Williams, signed by the playwright: &quot;To James. The best Tom ever.&quot; No actor could receive a better testimonial. He married Agnes Hallander, but the marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his daughter. \u2022 James Aubrey Tregidgo, actor, born 28 August 1947; died 6 April 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/12/fia-lift-life-ban-flavio-briatore", "sentences": ["Briatore and the former Renault head engineer, Pat Symonds, whose five-year ban was also cut, were barred in September for their involvement in the &quot;Crashgate&quot; plot to rig the 2008 Singapore grand prix.", "The FIA said each man had recognised &quot;his share of responsibility for the deliberate crash&quot; in Singapore, expressed regrets and apologised.", "Briatore issued a statement in which he agreed &quot;to bear his share of responsibility in the Singapore events in his capacity as managing director of the Renault F1 Team, at the time they happened, without any admission of a personal guilt in these events."], "publicationDate": "2010-04-12T19:44:16Z", "title": "Flavio Briatore may make F1 return in 2013 after FIA lifts life ban", "tags": ["Flavio Briatore", "Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "Flavio Briatore will be allowed to return to Formula One in 2013 after the sport&apos;s governing body today agreed to end a lifetime ban against the former Renault team principal.

True, Leonowens claimed to have been born in Wales in 1834 into an upper-middle class family. But in fact, according to a recent biography, she was born in Bombay in 1831, to a poor, widowed teenage mother of mixed British and Indian origin. She grew up entirely in India, speaking Hindi and Marathi as well as English, and never even visited the British Isles until after she left Siam. From India, she made her way to Singapore, reinvented herself as an educated Welsh gentlewoman, and bagged the job at the Siamese court.

The dialogue of their argument is taken from Leonowens&apos; memoirs, but in real life Mongkut was not just being petulant and arbitrary, as he appears in the film. Her desire to leave near the expat community indicated to him that she might want, as he put it, &quot;to convert our Children to Christianity \u2026 like American Missionaries and their wives have done here before.&quot; For the 1860s, Leonowens was unusually enlightened about religious tolerance, writing in her memoirs: &quot;We are prone to ignore or to condemn that which we do not clearly understand; and thus it is, and on no better ground, that we deny that there are influences in the religions of the East to render their followers wiser, nobler, purer.&quot; The kiddies stayed Buddhist, and the king stayed happy.

The patronising tone of this stuff comes from the 1940s novelisation of Anna&apos;s time in Thailand by Margaret Landon. The real Leonowens described the ladies of the harem as her &quot;sisters&quot;, and saw them intellectually and morally as her equals or betters. This film leaves out the controversial twist, alleged by Leonowens but doubted by historians, in which Mongkut&apos;s slave Tuptim (Rita Moreno) is burnt at the stake for taking a lover. To be fair, even the unfailingly cheery Rodgers and Hammerstein might have had a hard time writing a family-friendly musical number about that. Anyway, it probably never happened. Mongkut issued edicts to improve the lives of slaves, and his son, Chulalongkorn, abolished slavery.

During an energetic polka to Shall We Dance?, Mongkut puts his hand on Anna&apos;s waist, but that&apos;s the extent of it. Nevertheless, the suggestive implication is one reason why this version of The King and I has been banned in Thailand. In real life, there is no evidence for any romantic attachment between Leonowens and the king. As for her dalliance in the film with Sir Edward Ramsey, a supposed old flame from her ballroom dancing days back in south-west London, the fact that she was a working class Anglo-Indian who had never been to England writes that one off, too.

Across the rest of Europe the situation improved slightly, down 7.2% year on year in the first quarter this year compared to 12% for the same period last year, with the situation &quot;remaining difficult&quot; in Spain and &quot;certain&quot; eastern European countries. Net new business remained strong in the first quarter, totalling \u20ac574m. North America provided a &quot;significant turnaround&quot;, returning to growth with organic revenue up 5.2% year on year. This compares with a fall of 9.2% in the first quarter of 2009. &quot;Growth was driven by strong overall performance in all activities, and especially by the Euro RSCG network most notably in advertising, healthcare and corporate communications,&quot; said Havas. In Latin America, organic growth was 24.4% year on year, up from a 2.5% fall ion the first quarter of 2009. Havas attributed the result to the &quot;excellent performance&quot; of media activities in the region and &quot;especially advertising in Brazil&quot;. Asia Pacific reported growth of 4.4% in the first quarter, a dramatic improvement on the 24.7% fall in the first three months of 2009. Standout markets were China, India and Singapore. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

And the Conservatives will use it to bash Labour as part of their broken Britain thing.&quot; Pausing for a moment, the lifelong Labour voter adds: &quot;It&apos;s very strange finding yourself being quoted by the Tories.&quot; Dorling, a professor of human geography at Sheffield University, and an expert on health and social inequalities, is best known for deftly taking apart seemingly impenetrable statistics and using them to shine a light on some of the starkest wealth and health disparities around the UK and globally. The fact that much of his work has charted the widening gap in social inequality under New Labour has inadvertently made him a recurring thorn in the side of government. But he insists that his latest book, published today, &quot;is just as much an indictment of the Conservatives. It&apos;s quite hard to tell the difference between New Labour and Thatcher, so my book is an indictment of the two main political parties.&quot; His previous work \u2013 such as Poverty, Wealth and Place in Britain, 1968 to 2005 \u2013 explained why the geographical distribution of wealth is vital to understanding social inequalities, and outlined the patterns that have emerged while Labour has been in power. However, his latest publication sees Dorling come off the academic fence \u2013 with incendiary results. It is a sweeping critique of British politics that bluntly dismisses a plethora of supposedly progressive policies as ineffective, distractions from what he says are the real trends undermining the wellbeing of individuals, communities and the country. &quot;I&apos;d done 20 years&apos; worth of saying, &apos;This is what I think is going on&apos;, sort of describing it, and I&apos;d get these little criticisms saying, &apos;But he doesn&apos;t say why it&apos;s happening.&apos; The big question is why is it going on?&quot; He identifies five sets of beliefs \u2013 elitism, exclusion, prejudice, greed and despair \u2013 that he claims are replacing Beveridge&apos;s five social evils at the dawn of the welfare state (ignorance, want, idleness, squalor and disease), and have become so entrenched in Britain and some other affluent countries that they uphold an unjust system that perpetuates extreme inequality. He makes a case for why each set of beliefs is propagated, how each contributes to a growing gap between rich and poor, and why they endure. He says: &quot;The beliefs are supported by the media where stories often imply that some people are less deserving, where great City businessmen (and a few businesswomen) are lauded as superheroes, and where immigrants looking to work for a crumb of the City&apos;s bonuses are seen as scroungers.&quot; Dorling feels that politicians of all hues should be called to account for overseeing such unprecedented rises in inequality that put us on a par with Victorian society. &quot;In countries like Britain, people last lived lives as unequal as today, as measured by wage inequality, in 1854, when Charles Dickens was writing Hard Times,&quot; he states. Dorling argues that politicians in Britain and the other most unequal rich countries \u2013 he found only the US, Portugal and Singapore out of the 25 affluent states he analysed to be more unequal than Britain \u2013 have accepted and fostered the damaging idea that inequality is &quot;unfortunate&quot; but inevitable, rather than seeing it, first and foremost, as unjust. The more progressive end of New Labour&apos;s policy spectrum, such as its focus on reducing child poverty, is rendered redundant by an elitist system that permits the &quot;super-rich&quot; to accumulate record levels of wealth, Dorling believes. He argues that, instead of promoting greater equality, the government has cultivated an &quot;educational apartheid&quot; that sees &quot;25% of education spending go on 7% of pupils&quot;, that has led to more people being socially excluded than ever, and that has left Britain in a worse position post-recession than its more equal European counterparts. &quot;Inequalities in the more unequal affluent countries are sustained largely because of the political rhetoric of such countries,&quot; he concludes. If Injustice was Dorling&apos;s first major work, it might easily be dismissed by critics as over the top or hyperbolic. It might even be ridiculed as pseudo-Marxist. Every chapter contains an inflammatory statement to make policy-makers balk. One states: &quot;It is a sign of the duplicity of our times that institutions which often say they are against elitism do the most to promote it, that governments which say they aim to reduce social exclusion actually create it.&quot; Another, a clear swipe at the philosophy underpinning the New Labour years, declares: &quot;Despair grew, greed spiralled, prejudice seeped in, more were excluded, the elite preached that there was no alternative . . . and greed, greed of all things, really was good.&quot; In some parts, the book does feel more like an impassioned call to action than an academic text. Yet Dorling&apos;s adept handling of the vast body of evidence manages to keep it firmly anchored. He homes in on numerous examples to illustrate how injustice is integral to wealth disparities. Why, in more unequal countries, are so many people disenfranchised or don&apos;t vote? Why, in those same countries, are a seventh of children labelled as the modern-day equivalent of &quot;delinquent&quot;? Why are people living in unequal societies more likely to be dealing with mental distress? Why are a quarter of families in Britain &quot;disregarded in what is considered access to normal infrastructure&quot;, such as a car or the internet? If Dorling was concerned at any point about critics accusing him of over-egging inequality, he certainly isn&apos;t now. He points out: &quot;Since the final manuscript going [to press], the latest health inequality statistics came out [showing] they have accelerated \u2013 not just that the gaps are still growing. The new figures are worse than the figures in the book. It&apos;s getting worse, faster. It&apos;s almost coming to a head. &quot;I worried when I was doing this that I had picked doom and gloom, but in fact it&apos;s actually quite conservative.&quot; So what does Dorling believe is happening in response to the circumstances he outlines in the book? &quot;People aren&apos;t going to party political meetings, but there&apos;s this real need, largely among middle-class people, to go to something and vent their anger about,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve had some talks sold out six weeks in advance. You suddenly find that 200 people have signed up to come and listen to you.&quot; He insists that he didn&apos;t set out to write a controversial book, and that until his publisher described the final manuscript as &quot;hard-hitting&quot; he had assumed much of the more strident aspects had been tempered. Astonishingly, bearing in mind the grim picture he paints, he is also optimistic. &quot;Maybe I have a silly optimistic faith in people, but I don&apos;t think you can carry on fooling people,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s not a Marxist working-class thing this [anger]. It really is middle-of-the-road.&quot; Dorling suggests all three political parties need to learn from history. Large numbers of people are most likely to get angry he says, when they begin to collectively feel the impact of the kind of cutbacks in public services expected after the election. When sweeping cuts in public spending are coupled with growing inequality the situation is even more volatile, he says. &quot;It&apos;s always at these points [in history] that people get angry,&quot; he suggests, speaking of what we might expect, whoever is in power come May. He insists that it does not matter who wins the election. &quot; What&apos;s much more important is what is produced around it, the fallout from it,&quot; he says. &quot;The bailout has been there to keep everything going as normal until after the election. Unless\u00a0there&apos;s some kind of strange miracle, we are about to have several years of \u00a0purgatory.&quot; As for being a radical protagonist for change, or the author of a call to action, Dorling says: &quot;I feel very wimpy saying this, but I&apos;m hardly saying, &apos;We want a revolution, we want a utopia.&apos; I&apos;m just saying, &apos;Can we be slightly less stupid, and we&apos;ll all be better off for it.&apos;&quot; \u2022 Injustice: Why Social Inequality Persists is published by Policy Press.

The index also reveals the fragility of the recovery in property markets across the world: in the final three months of last year house prices were still falling in almost half the countries covered. Ireland led the way down, recording house price falls averaging 8.3% in the final quarter of 2009, with the pace of decline accelerating throughout the year. On average, prices in the republic fell by 18.5% over the year compared to a 3.4% gain in the UK. After Ireland, the country with the deepest house price falls in the final quarter was Croatia, where they they dropped by 3.4%. Over 12 months the biggest falls were in Dubai (-42.1%) and Latvia (-49.8%), but in both these countries prices began rising again in the second half of the year, with Latvia seeing a 7% gain in the final quarter. Conversely, China is leading a property price boom in the Asia-Pacific region. Prices in the country, which announced bumper GDP growth figures this week, rose by 25.1% last year. In Hong Kong prices rose even more, increasing by 27.6%. Singapore has also seen big rises while Australia, buoyed by Chinese demand for raw materials, saw prices rise by an average of 13.6% in 2009, with a rise of 5.2% in the last quarter alone. Liam Bailey, head of residential research at Knight Frank, said: &quot;Prices in Hong Kong and mainland China increased by over 25%, driven upwards by a massive injection of liquidity into the economy by the Chinese government&apos;s fiscal stimulus package. &quot;Prices do appear to be levelling off, though, with final quarter increases of only 2.9% in Hong Kong.&quot; But he added that elsewhere across the globe the recovery was &quot;shaky&quot;. &quot;A number of countries that recorded tentative growth earlier in the year saw prices fall back again slightly in the final quarter as their economic recovery wobbled. In the US, for example, prices rose on average by almost 3% overall in the second half of 2009, but actually fell by 0.6% in the last quarter. &quot;Question marks still hang over a number of economies, particularly in Europe, as the true impact of the credit crunch continues to unravel.

My fear before this week&apos;s debate on foreign policy is that it will prove to be hemmed in by a similar consensus \u2013 even if it less obvious. For sure, there will be dividing lines on the surface. The Liberal Democrats can justly claim to have been right about Iraq, and they deserve credit for calling for the Trident replacement to be scrapped \u2013 no one believes that Britain would ever use nuclear weapons, but no major party has been brave enough to state the obvious conclusion that there&apos;s little point in having them, then, since Labour in 1987. But all three parties see foreign affairs through the prism of two relationships: that with America, and that with the European Union. No leader will want to see our alliance with the US become even less &quot;special&quot; than it already evidently is under Barack Obama. Likewise, no leader is arguing for any fundamental renegotiation of the UK&apos;s connection with the EU. Even Nick Clegg admits it is &quot;flawed&quot;, thus conceding that the British public does not share the Liberal Democrats&apos; historic Europhilia. The current stasis in EU institutions also makes it very easy for David Cameron to talk tough while not actually having to do anything. &quot;We do not want to join the euro,&quot; he said recently. &quot;We want to keep the pound as our currency. What the British people want is Britain in Europe but not run by Europe. They do not want a state called Europe.&quot; Luckily for him, neither Britain joining the euro nor a &quot;state called Europe&quot; are on the horizon at the moment.  What we almost certainly will not get during tonight&apos;s debate is anything resembling a full-scale re-evaluation of Britain&apos;s role in the world. And that will mask two important truths. First, that we vastly overestimate our importance, and have long done so. In The Post-American World, Newsweek International&apos;s editor Fareed Zakaria dates this back to the end of the second world war. &quot;The photographs of Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 are somewhat misleading,&quot; he writes. &quot;There was no &apos;big three&apos; at Yalta. There was a &apos;big two&apos; plus one brilliant political entrepreneur who was able to keep himself and his country in the game, so that Britain maintained many elements of great powerdom well into the late 20th century.&quot; If that was true then, it certainly is now. UK ministers ought to pause to think before making weighty pronouncements of disapproval about how other countries run their affairs \u2013 partly because many states in Africa and Asia have had quite enough of being told what to do by Brits in the past, thank you very much; and partly because the reaction, frequently, is one of derision. Just why should a junior foreign office minister think an admonition from him is of any consequence half way round the globe? The other side of this, and the second important truth, is that while UK politicians never hesitate to criticise, they have consistently failed to appreciate the reservoirs of goodwill towards us that still exist in many former colonial countries. It is our immense good luck that many states that were invaded or exploited by the British remain very fond, not necessarily of particular UK politicians, but of a certain idea of what Britain stands for. From independence onwards, generations of politicians rose to prominence who were educated at UK universities, from BR Ambedkar, the great &quot;untouchable&quot; who was the main architect of the Indian Constitution (at the LSE), to the current prime minister of Malaysia, Najib Tun Razak (Nottingham \u2013 his father, also prime minister, went to Lincoln&apos;s Inn), while few potentates in former British possessions or protectorates have considered their offspring sufficiently trained for the throne until they have spent at least some time at Sandhurst, as did, for instance, King Abdullah II of Jordan and the Sultan of Brunei. Over the last 20 to 30 years, however, their successors have been just as likely to have gone to colleges in the US. Elites that were once predominantly Anglophile now share their affections with America (and to an extent with Australia). A clear advantage for British interests, influence and trade is diminishing, not least because our politicians&apos; eyes have seldom been on those parts of the globe. And it shows when they do visit these exotic and unfamiliar climes \u2013 such as when FO minister Kim Howells thought the best way to wrap up a trip to Kenya was to accuse the entire country of being on the take, or when David Miliband&apos;s time in India last year was branded a &quot;disaster&quot; by both ruling and opposition parties.  There is a world beyond Europe and America, and it is one with which we have deep ties of history, language and, indeed, blood \u2013 we owe much of Britain&apos;s ethnic diversity to these connections. This world is more pro-British than we perhaps sometimes imagine. One of the Abu Dhabi government&apos;s proudest cultural projects of 2008 was the opening in Al Ain of a permanent exhibition of photographs by Wilfred Thesiger \u2013 a British explorer.  There is such demand abroad for an old-fashioned British education that boarding schools have been opening branches thousands of miles away, from Harrow International School in Bangkok to Repton School, Dubai. British football teams inspire as much devotion in the tropics as they do in Old Trafford; it was no surprise that Manchester United&apos;s first caf\u00e9 store outside Britain opened in Singapore. A truly internationalist approach might begin by party leaders ceasing to be &quot;Little Europeans&quot; or &quot;Little Atlanticists&quot; and working instead to revive these affections. Too easily have politicians given up, for instance, on the Commonwealth, dismissing it as a &quot;talking shop&quot; \u2013 thereby undervaluing the virtue that activity has on its own and failing to recognise that a conversation is a very good starting point for something more concrete. But will we even hear about it on Thursday? Or will the US, EU and Nato dominate the discussion? It would be a shame if it were so. For that would be to confine the debate to the interests of a mere billion or so of the world&apos;s nearly 7 billion population. Are we so introspective that that is all &quot;foreign affairs&quot; means to us? \u2022 More Guardian election comment from Cif at the polls"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/apr/23/prudential-royalbankofscotlandgroup", "sentences": ["Alongside a timetable for the cash call - which sees the prospectus published a week or so later than expected on May 5 and nil-paid rights start trading on May 28 - the insurer said it would list on the Hong Kong and Singapore markets on May 11."], "publicationDate": "2010-04-23T08:24:07Z", "title": "Prudential dips on rights issue update, but FTSE fights back", "tags": ["Prudential", "Business", "Royal Bank of Scotland"], "article": "Prudential will publish the terms of its $21bn rights issue on May 5, the insurer said today, as it also disclosed more details of its proposed listings in Asia.

At that level the company would be valued at around \u00a365m. In the market Morse&apos;s shares climbed 6.75p to 48p.

Industry talk suggested rival 2e2 was behind the new approach, although George O&apos;Connor at Panmure Gordon put other names in the frame:  We have been here before. This time we are more confident that a deal can go through. While we have long praised the restructuring at Morse we have more recently been unsure about the &apos;growth&apos; proposition. But Morse would be a tasty acquisition given the successful restructuring.

Having checked the BA website daily, as they suggested, we have found that they are offering seats in business class on most flights but that the prices of these have been greatly increased. If you look at availability for flights after 5 May, seats currently priced at between 7,000 to 11,000 Singapore dollars (\u00a33,320 to \u00a35,217) are back to S$2,000. This seems to give the lie to BA&apos;s claim that they are doing everything to get stranded travellers back to the UK.&quot;  Keith Oram writes:  &quot;My children, (aged 12 and 14) were due to fly home on Emirates\u00a0from Johannesburg to Manchester via Dubai on 18 April.\u00a0\u00a0After the flights were cancelled we were given an earliest return date of 9 May, until I threw my toys out of the pram, pointed out that tickets were\u00a0on sale for flights on 23 April.\u00a0They are now (we hope) flying tonight (25 April), but it&apos;s a classic\u00a0case of he who shouts loudest (or has the biggest cheque-book) gets sorted first.&quot;  Lynda Clough emails from Borneo:  &quot;My family and I have been stranded in Kota Kinabalu, Borneo, for eights days and are awaiting a flight with\u00a0Royal Brunei Airlines. Sadly Royal Brunei (and I suspect every other airline worldwide) are only allowing stranded passengers to take up unbooked seats on each flight out. \u00a0\u00a0 This should not be allowed to happen.\u00a0There are in the region of 300 stranded British travellers in Kota Kinabalu all of whom have paid a return fare, and because of the policy of the airline, they are being denied their return flight, creating this unsustainable and untenable situation we are in. People stranded in Europe have the option of alternative means of getting home (albeit costly) but those further afield have no alternative and are being left at the mercy of the airlines, many of whom are being unsympathetic and unscrupulous and only thinking of themselves.&quot;  Michele Morgan says she is stuck in Faro and having a &quot;nightmare&quot; with Monarch.   &quot;I am here with my 11-year-old daughter and was due to return to the UK last Sunday when Monarch rebooked me for a flight on 29 April from a different airport. When I asked to bring this forward, or move to the airport where my car is, after flights resumed they said they would only offer me a flight for today (25 April) if I paid \u00a3522, but confirmed that the flight had space. I declined. When I finally got through yesterday, after hundreds of calls, they agreed to bring the flight forward to Tuesday for free. They have not replied to any of my emails. During those hundreds of calls I got through twice - they refused to take my number and managed to cut me off once transferring me and the other time transferred me to an answering machine.&quot;  If you can&apos;t get out, try getting kicked out, advises Fung Pee.  &quot;I simply contacted immigration of a large country in the far east, explained I was overtime on my visa, dropped a small amount of cash into the officials hand and less than a day later I was home. The trick is to get into the airport where officialdom leans on airlines directly.&quot;  On Friday we heard from Erica Wald (12.30pm) an academic at LSE, trying to get a BA flight from Mumbai. News of her plight was picked by today&apos;s Sunday Express who repeated her concerns that sick passengers are being stranded. In her latest email Erica writes:   &quot;I&apos;ve just returned from another trip to the airport, where there is still chaos all around.  Happily I was told me that the gentlemen with cancer was put on a BA flight. However, they don&apos;t seem to be giving any priority to those with medical concerns or small children. \u00a0I met a family (he&apos;s a diabetic, she fractured her foot the day before they were due to fly and is in immense pain and they&apos;ve got two small children) who have still had no news from BA.  I asked a BA official about those with medical needs and the possibility of extra flights, but he refused to answer any of my questions. BA still seem to selling seats at high prices and claiming this is meant to act as a deterrent. I still find this claim amazing. When I was waiting, I found another passenger who has actually stumped up the money for a new ticket. He paid \u00a32,800 for a flight on Monday, but he was at the airport on Saturday in the hope he could get on an earlier flight. He doesn&apos;t think that BA would reimburse him the massive difference or give him any compensation. After being escorted out of the terminal. I met a couple who were travelling with their 90-year-old father, a wheelchair-bound veteran of the second world war who had served in India and Burma, and is now stranded.\u00a0They are meant to be flying Jet Airways, and it seems they&apos;ve had a similar response. I&apos;ve been told by colleagues that Air India and Jet have put on extra flights to get stranded passengers back home, but from what I&apos;ve seen so far of BA&apos;s behaviour, I&apos;m not holding out much hope that they&apos;ll do the same!&quot;  But there has been much better news about a group of 24 British passengers who were waiting in stifling Dehli temperatures. They were all flown back on two separate flights yesterday after being told they would not be flying back any sooner than 8 May. One of the group, Elizabeth Atwell, a teacher in west London, suspects they were helped to silence their complaints to the Guardian (see 1pm, 4pm and 4.24pm). &quot;It is the ones who are shouting the loudest that are getting out. I would like to think we got back because we kicked up a stink,&quot; she said. &quot;The priority system is not working. It is not fair - it shouldn&apos;t be the ones who are empowered or who have the nouse to shout the loudest that get on the flight.&quot; Saleem Althaf, an A&amp;E doctor in Lincolnshire, complained to us after facing weeks of being stuck in Chennai. He was put on a flight today. He emailed to say: &quot;Thanks to your publicity and my telephone calls, BA have booked me on the flight leaving Chennai on the 25 April. I wait to see if the others in my situation manage to get BA to do the right thing.&quot;  3pm: A spokeswoman for BA insisted that the policy of hiking ticket prices was successfully discouraging new customers. She also denied that passengers who have complained to the press are being given priority. &quot;We are getting people out as quickly as we can. We have got extra flights to Heathrow and Gatwick this week, including from Johannesburg, Dubai and Hong Kong. We are putting on extra capacity where we can. &quot;We have to have the system open in order to rebook people on to it. We have top prices to discourage people from buying seats, so we can put people on to flights. And that is working very well. We have not had that many complaints, people are getting back in.&quot; On Lionel&apos;s complaint about flights from Singapore, she said BA was &quot;looking&quot; to put on an extra repatriation flight there. Asked about Erica&apos;s point about the medical needs in Mumbai, she said: &quot;We are doing as much as we can. We are giving hotel accommodation and money. In terms of medical needs we would advise that people carry their medicine with them.&quot; BA is not revealing how many people it estimates to be still stranded by Volcano. The spokeswoman added: &quot;It is an enormous logistical operation. It is not the case of who shouts the loudest [gets back]. This is an unprecedented situation and we are doing absolute best to get people home.&quot; We are waiting for responses from the other airlines mentioned above. Finnair responded on Friday (see 2pm).  3.20pm: I should have said this already: If you are having trouble getting a flight home please post a comment below (thanks InaneChat) or get in touch. My email is matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk.   3.50pm: Monarch Airlines says it is puzzled by Michele Morgan&apos;s complaint. A spokeswoman said: &quot;If her flight was disrupted by the volcanic ash problems there are no change fees, so she should be permitted to change her flight free of charge. &quot;All emails are responded to within 24 hours. If she was spoken to by someone in our call centres she would have been told she can return free of charge.&quot;  4.28pm: An EK spokesman has responded to Keith Oram&apos;s complaint about Emirates: &quot;At the height of the disruption, Emirates had 100,000 passengers affected. With European airspace open again, we are working around the clock to get everyone from all corners of our network to where they need to be. As you can imagine, this is a colossal task. We also understand that our customers have been patient and want a fast resolution to their own personal circumstances. We have not been provided with the full details relating to this particular query, but of course, as soon as we have, we will investigate.&quot;  4.45pm: It was Joan Loughrey&apos;s birthday yesterday. She has had to celebrate as best she could while stranded away from her family waiting for a BA flight in Singapore. She writes:   &quot;I was due to fly home on 15 April. I now am due to fly back on 27 April having originally been told 2 May. Because I was on a BA flight operated by Qantas I could have flown with either airline but nevertheless the 27th was the earliest date to get me out. I was texted by the British High Commission here and told that BA/Qantas were contacting people on a first-in-first-out basis to put them on flights this weekend. How then is it that it has taken a week to move me when they have flights going out every night?  I have been told by the airlines that I was lucky to get 27th April and I get the distinct impression that the airlines have taken the view that that date is &apos;good enough&apos;. I have been phoning and phoning to try to get a better date and when speaking to BA and Qantas again got the clear impression that they are not sure why I keep bothering them as I should be happy with what I have got. I feel I have been fobbed off.  Why has BA not put on an extra flight to get us out? It is not good enough to just slot people into any spare seats that happen to be available.  It was my birthday this weekend. I will have been away from my children (aged 7 and 9) 17 days instead of the originally planned 4. I don&apos;t think the speed at which BA has dealt with this is good enough.&quot;    5.02pm: BA&apos;s chief executive Willie Walsh has attempted to explain the policy of hiking prices to put off new customers. The YouTube footage went out on Friday, but I&apos;ve only just spotted it and it&apos;s still relevant.  He says: &quot;Once the skies did open we had to make all of the seats available to the general reservations system.. To try to stop other airlines putting their stranded passengers on British Airways aircraft we only made those seats available at the highest fare levels. And I would please asked our customers to bear with us. I know how stressful it must be for to be stuck abroad. I know how important it is for you to get home. I want to assure you that we are doing everything we possibly can to do so.&quot; (I&apos;ve embedded the video at the top of the blog).  5.21pm: Monarch Flights has sent out a fuller response to Michele Morgan&apos;s complaint  &quot;I am sorry that Mrs Morgan has experienced problems rebooking her Monarch flight from Faro. When airspace over the UK and Europe all Monarch flights were cancelled and customers offered a full refund or to rebook their flights free of charge.  As soon as UK airspace opened Monarch launched a repatriation programme to return as many of its stranded customers back to the UK as quickly as possible. Between Wednesday 21 and Friday 23 April, Monarch repatriated in excess of 25,000 passengers on 63 repatriation flights - these operated in addition to Monarch&apos;s existing flying programme.  Monarch apologies that numerous calls were made to its Customer Contact Centre to rearrange the flights. Monarch apologises for the extended disruption that Mrs Morgan has experienced, but looks forward to welcoming her onto a Monarch flight on Tuesday.&quot; "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/27/lalit-modi-ipl-crisis", "sentences": ["Worldwide rights for the IPL were sold to World Sports Group (Mauritius) and Indian rights to Multi Screen Media (Singapore), on a sub-licence from WSG."], "publicationDate": "2010-04-26T23:05:03Z", "title": "Cricket world waits on India's battle with sleaze and corruption", "tags": ["IPL", "Cricket", "Sport", "Lalit Modi"], "article": "World cricket faces a deepening crisis following the suspension of the Indian Premier League commissioner, Lalit Modi, by the Indian board as an investigation begins into allegations of sleaze and corruption at the heart of the Twenty20 competition that has taken the game into a land of high finance. The England and Wales Cricket Board, among others, nervously awaits proof that the Indian board can prevent a deepening crisis. &quot;This has been coming for a long time,&quot; an ECB official said. &quot;We will now see what Indian cricket is made of.&quot; India is so powerful, accounting for an estimated 75% of the game&apos;s revenue, that, if it fails to restore its shattered credibility, the damage will reverberate around all corners of the cricketing world. The most pressing question for Modi, who has a fortnight to respond to the charges against him, is the exact whereabouts of documentation over an $80m (\u00a351.8m) &quot;facilitation fee&quot; said to have been paid to settle a complex legal wrangle over IPL TV rights. He must also answer charges of manipulating bidding for the IPL&apos;s two newest franchises, in Pune and Kochi, and if he answers all that satisfactorily, he will still be castigated for his maverick business practices, where announcements are made on Twitter and cronyism and politicking are allegedly rife. But many argue that the problems run deeper and that the allegations against Modi are symptomatic of the inadequacies of an Indian board that is said to be awash with political involvement and which, even it had the appetite to do so, has not modernised enough to regulate the voracious capitalism that now permeates the game. Chirayu Amin, president of the Baroda Cricket Association, and the antithesis of Modi in his lack of public recognition, has been appointed the IPL&apos;s interim commissioner. &quot;The immediate task is to clean up the IPL,&quot; said Amin, head of a pharmaceuticals company. Shashank Manohar, the BCCI president, said Modi&apos;s suspension &quot;was not a punishment, it&apos;s just for free and fair inquiry&quot;. He then took the IPL on to new ground \u2013 that of integrity. &quot;Commercial aspect is important, also ethics are important,&quot; he said. The TV rights dispute was largely of Modi&apos;s own making. Worldwide rights for the IPL were sold to World Sports Group (Mauritius) and Indian rights to Multi Screen Media (Singapore), on a sub-licence from WSG. But MSM was sacked before IPL2 for breach of contract. A legal wrangle ensued and the Bombay high court ruled that the Indian board was within its rights to renegotiate. MSM rebid but wanted to bid directly rather than as an offshoot of WSG. It was given the right but only if it paid an $80m facility fee to free itself. It is that facility fee that the Indian tax authorities are investigating. It is that facility fee about which Manohar said: &quot;There is an allegation that a facilitation fee was paid but the board does not have the document. This deal happened between MSM and WSG. All the documents are with Lalit Modi.&quot; The Indian tax authorities are investigating the complex ownership of some of the franchises, notably Rajasthan Royals, whose initial front man was Manoj Badale, owner of a UK company, Emerging Media, but whose consortium then expanded to include Modi&apos;s son-in-law, Suresh Chellaram; Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of Rupert Murdoch; and Raj Kundra, husband of the Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. Rajasthan Royals claim their ownership structure is &quot;completely transparent&quot;, saying: &quot;There are no &apos;secret stakeholders&apos;. After we won the bid, we needed to form a properly incorporated vehicle which represented the various consortium stakeholders. This has been done with complete transparency.&quot; Before the Modi affair took centre stage India was consumed by reports that Indian tax authorities were investigating the bank accounts of 27 players because of match-fixing allegations in last season&apos;s IPL in South Africa. Since match-rigging allegations first shook cricket 10 years ago, the International Cricket Council&apos;s anti-corruption unit claims to have controlled the problem, but they have no jurisdiction in the IPL."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/01/exhibitions-picks-of-the-week", "sentences": ["Limoncello, E2, to 29 May Skye Sherwin Lanwei/Decaying End Stanley Wong, who cryptically goes under the artist name of anothermountainman, has taken good advantage of the 1990s collapse of the previously booming property market throughout China, Thailand, Cambodia, Turkey and Singapore by photographically exploiting their leftover landscapes of urban stupefaction."], "publicationDate": "2010-04-30T23:19:23Z", "title": "Exhibitions picks of the week", "tags": ["Art", "Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture", "Sculpture", "Photography", "Installation", "Richard Deacon"], "article": "Richard Deacon, Salisbury In the 1980s Richard Deacon and his New British Sculpture cohorts got inventive with whatever they had to hand.

The Mead Gallery hosts Palma&apos;s drawings and films on a theme of cars and technology plus archive material from Coventry&apos;s Jaguar Daimler Heritage Centre.

Warwick Arts Centre, to 29 May Robert Clark Maria Nepomuceno, London Maria Nepomuceno&apos;s sculpture rolls out like ocean waves in the lapis lazuli and oyster grey shades of climbing rope. Weaving and beading fashioned in spiral patterns provides the basis for her endlessly mutating forms. Part of a group of young Brazilians championed by Ernesto Neto, Laura Lima and Marcio Botner&apos;s gallery in Rio, Nepomuceno has her first UK show. Displaying a passion for colour and organic forms, her work harks back to that of great Brazilian innovators like Helio Oiticia and Lygia Clark. Infused with the repetitive tempo of hand-crafting, her swelling coils channel natural cycles, DNA chains and the push-pull between the body and the landscape or male and female. Victoria Miro Gallery, N1, Fri to 12 Jun Skye Sherwin Attitude, Wolverhampton A monumental skeletal structure cast in salt evokes the spectral ruins of a gothic church. This is Banks Violette&apos;s Untitled (Church), a sculpture that apparently takes its inspiration from a black metal murder in Norway. The Attitude of the exhibition title refers to a tradition of avant garde modern art, stretching from dada and surrealism, that tends to find its more blatantly recognisable outlet these days within sub-cultural pop. Gardar Eide Einarsson&apos;s work here derives from the self-consciously revolting graphic anger of punk and agitprop, while Gerald Davis reflects on Kurt Cobain&apos;s suicide of disillusionment and nihilism. Elsewhere, Dan Colen&apos;s work looks assembled from some backstreet Berlin scrapyard, typically crazed with graffiti. Initial Access, to 25 Sep Robert Clark Shahin Afrassiabi, London Shahin Afrassiabi was once best known for exhibiting groups of objects \u2013 wooden planks, lino and wallpaper samples \u2013 that suggested DIY in process. As everyday as they seemed, these home-improvement constellations worked a flair for form and space that harked back to modernism. His first London solo show in five years is a further riff on spatial configurations and features an array of buildings, from a CGI projection to a mock-up architectural structure that doubles as a fragmented film screen. Limoncello, E2, to 29 May Skye Sherwin Lanwei/Decaying End Stanley Wong, who cryptically goes under the artist name of anothermountainman, has taken good advantage of the 1990s collapse of the previously booming property market throughout China, Thailand, Cambodia, Turkey and Singapore by photographically exploiting their leftover landscapes of urban stupefaction. Tower blocks loom like colossal concrete tombstones. As the artist&apos;s camera zooms in, we see, in several of the unfinished apartments, sad glimpses of the supposed intended tenants, posed alone amid the dust. There&apos;s a potent thematic disconnection between the scenes of architectural desolation and the apparent professional status of their temporary inhabitants. The subject is uncompromisingly focused upon as a series develops of metaphorical tableaux of unanticipated human wastage. Chinese Arts Centre, to 12 Jun Robert Clark Aaron Williamson, Bristol Perceptions of disability and art world hubris are the frequent focus of Aaron Williamson&apos;s ribald, unsettling work, which has seen the British performance artist hurl himself at walls and pose for ogling schoolkids as a sideshow freak. Though his creative roots are in auditory pursuits like punk rock and poetry, Williamson is profoundly deaf. A selection of collaborative films here features an homage to slapstick mavericks Tom and Jerry with artist Katherine Araniello, plus Williamson playing the LSD-addled messianic leader of a terrorist faction, fighting for the rights of the disabled. Spike Island, Sat to 6 Jun Skye Sherwin Extraordinary Measures, Morpeth The infiltration of the English Heritage ambience of Belsay Hall, Castle and Gardens with the often irreverent indulgences of contemporary artists provides something of a mild culture shock. But then these artists, as artists are wont to do, provoke further bafflement from the straight-and-narrow tourists by installing a variety of deliberately out-of-scale projects. Ron Mueck&apos;s here with his giant hyper-real spooks. Mariele Neudecker creates one of her enchanting sculptural illusions within the Quarry Garden and Matt Collishaw infiltrates the Great Chamber of the medieval castle with a spinning-wheel fantastique of prancing imps and butterflies.

The insurer, which is due to reveal on Wednesday details of how it intends to finance the deal, is under pressure from several high-profile investors to signal an intention to sell its UK and US businesses to fund the purchase of AIA. Its largest shareholder, Capital Research and Management, told the firm&apos;s chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, that it was concerned that a \u00a314bn rights issue, the largest on the London market, was unnecessary when the sale of &quot;low-growth&quot; businesses could provide much needed funds. The fund managers Fidelity and BlackRock are also understood to be concerned at the level of fundraising at a time of huge instability in the stock market, mainly on concerns over the Greek bond crisis. Pru has denied it is planning to include sales of the UK and US businesses in its fundraising prospectus. A spokesman for the group said it was &quot;pure speculation&quot; and denied working on plans for sales. The insurer must be able to put up a convincing argument for the takeover, as it needs 75% of shareholders to vote for the transaction later this month. The high threshold has sparked some speculation that the hurdle may be difficult to achieve, particularly when it emerged that Capital had been trying to find a way to stop the bid. Pru&apos;s UK business has stagnated for several years as UK savers have scaled back on savings and investments. Competition for sales in the UK and calls in Brussels for tighter regulation of insurance companies have also reduced the scope for growth. However, the businesses remain profitable and generates cash that is expected to be used to build the Asian businesses. Much of the Pru&apos;s credit rating is based on the solidity of its UK business. But several analysts believe a switch to Asia is inevitable, especially as the Pru&apos;s main shareholders, most of them large US pension fund managers and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, encourage moves into &quot;high-growth&quot; countries of China, Vietnam and Indonesia. A source close to the Pru said it was likely that the group would review all its holdings following the purchase of AIA, but there were no imminent plans to push ahead with sales. Demonstrating improving confidence in the deal, GIC \u2013 Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 and Qatar Holding have joined the underwriting syndicate. Norges Bank, Prudential&apos;s fourth-biggest shareholder, also indicated it would back a rights issue, saying: &quot;We still clearly think there is a plenty of long-term value in Prudential at this stage.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/04/jersey-city-formula-one-us", "sentences": ["&quot;To maximise the dramatic effect, Jersey City could possibly follow in Singapore&apos;s footsteps by holding the finals at night.&quot; A provisional 3.6-mile track layout has already been prepared and it is understood that organisers are seeking a five-year deal."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-04T15:22:56Z", "title": "Jersey City make proposal to host Formula One grand prix in the US", "tags": ["Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010", "US sports"], "article": "Formula One, last seen in the US when Lewis Hamilton won in Indianapolis at its final race in 2007, may be set for a return to that country after plans for a grand prix in Jersey City emerged today.

The plans for the Jersey City grand prix come a few weeks after fresh speculation that Indianapolis was poised to get F1 back, with Tony George, the former head of the city&apos;s Motor Speedway track, present at the Chinese grand prix to discuss ideas. &quot;With the incredible backdrop of the New York City skyline, selecting Jersey City for the 2012 grand prix auto race circuit will not only boost ticket sales as the grand prix returns to the US, but will [provide] striking television footage,&quot; reads an outline proposal for the event. &quot;To maximise the dramatic effect, Jersey City could possibly follow in Singapore&apos;s footsteps by holding the finals at night.&quot; A provisional 3.6-mile track layout has already been prepared and it is understood that organisers are seeking a five-year deal. They are also eager that the race be known as the Jersey City grand prix. But while the invitation may be well received by F1&apos;s organisers, who are keen for the sport to have a presence in the US, the local advocacy group Friends of Liberty State Park has already lodged a protest with Jersey City&apos;s mayor, Jerramiah Healy. &quot;Once you have a track there, and especially with the state&apos;s finances, there would be such pressure on the state to have regular car racing there,&quot; said Sam Pesin, the president of the Friends&apos; board of trustees. &quot;You&apos;d end up having the name changed from Liberty State Park to Liberty Race Track.&quot; Meanwhile, Ferrari&apos;s president, Luca di Montezemolo, has dismissed as &quot;ridiculous&quot; claims his team&apos;s cars carry subliminal tobacco advertising.

If you are like the rest of the herd you are putting your money in the developing world.  Now pretend you are a finance minister in an emerging market economy. In normal times you would more than welcome all the capital you could get. However, you have a fledgling financial system just showing signs of recovery from the global financial crisis. You are also just back from the annual International Monetary Fund meetings where you were warned that this &quot;capital bonanza&quot; may be causing currency, stock, real estate, and other asset bubbles in your economy. To stem those bubbles you raised interest rates \u2013 which only accentuated the incentive for foreign investors to pour speculative capital into your country. Well, there may be another way out. In a February 2010 staff position note and (more cautiously) in the IMF&apos;s Global Financial Stability Report (GSFR) also released at those meetings you went to, the IMF said that capital controls are a legitimate part of the toolkit for the situation you are in. That&apos;s right. There is a new consensus that controls like temporary taxes on speculative capital or policies that require a percentage of short-term investments to be reserved in the Central Bank for a minimum period of stay, may be of help. Indeed, the February IMF study argues that those countries who resorted to capital controls preceding the global financial crisis &quot;were associated with avoiding some of the worst growth outcomes&quot; of the current economic crisis. So you are thinking about crafting such a policy when your trade minister tells you that deploying capital controls could be seen as a violation of your bilateral investment treaty or free trade agreement with the United States. And rather than going through a (drawn out) process whereby your government and the US government screen and debate the case in a relatively transparent panel, a US investor can directly file a claim against your government and sue you for millions of dollars in damages without even having to consult the US government. As finance minister you remind the trade minister that you also have treaties with the European Union, Canada, and Japan. And in those treaties you have all the &quot;policy space&quot; you need to deploy capital controls, or you at least have a temporary safeguard provision for crises.  Those treaties only cover investment originating from those particular countries, says your trade minister. The minister cites a United Nations report (pdf) written by a senior lawyer at the IMF arguing that controlling capital with just those countries could create (local and global) distortions and an incentive for those countries to slip their inflows through the US and circumvent the whole effort and a host of other jurisdictional problems. Unfortunately this story is not make-believe. As I show in my new study for the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development (G24), there are more than 50 developing countries that could find themselves in such a conversation.  Despite the fact that the US has now learned the hard way that the financial stability of its trading partners is in its interest, US trade and investment agreements require the free transfer of US capital without delay and without exception.  This can partially be rectified. The US is reworking its Bush-era trade deals with Colombia and South Korea \u2013 two countries with prior success with capital controls. Moreover, the Obama administration boasts that its newly launched negotiations for a &quot;Transpacific Partnership Agreement (TPP)&quot; will fix many of the flaws in past trade deals and forge a truly &quot;21st century trade agreement&quot;. The TPP includes Chile, Peru, Singapore and other countries that are known for prudently using capital controls but have bad deals in this regard with the US. Finally, the US hopes to negotiate investment treaties with Brazil, China, and India under a new &quot;model&quot; as well. In the wake of the financial crisis any 21st century trade or investment deal should ensure that nations have all possible tools at their disposal to prevent and mitigate financial crises. There is a model to follow: the treaties of virtually every other advanced capital exporting nation that allow their developing country partners to deploy capital controls at their own discretion \u2013 or at least do so in the midst of crisis.  Unfortunately the Obama administration&apos;s attempts at reform are on a slow track and facing stiff resistance from the same financial interests fighting financial regulatory reform. In the meantime, finance and trade ministries \u2013 and people with real livelihoods in their countries \u2013 are feeling the chilling effect of US trade policies as their economies heat up."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/04/sainsburys-sponsors-paralympic-games", "sentences": ["Lord Coe, chairman of the London organising committee (Locog), said: &quot;We said in Singapore that through the Paralympic Games we wanted to change public attitudes towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-04T18:10:00Z", "title": "Sainsbury's announces sponsorship of 2012 Paralympics", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "UK news", "J Sainsbury", "Business", "Sport", "Disability", "Paralympics 2012", "Olympic Games"], "article": "London Olympics organisers said yesterday that Sainsbury&apos;s multimillion pound sponsorship of the 2012 Paralympic Games would change the way the event is viewed by the public. The supermarket yesterday became the first company to solely sponsor the Paralympics, rather than backing both events, and will sell merchandise in its stores as well as getting its staff involved with volunteering opportunities. Sainsbury&apos;s chief executive, Justin King, said the company had chosen to focus on the Paralympics because it offered a unique opportunity. Unlike the Olympics, sponsors are allowed to have a presence in the stadium and other venues during the Paralympics and Sainsbury&apos;s will also be featured on athletes&apos; bibs and during the torch relay. Sir Philip Craven, president of the International Paralympic Committee, said the deal was historic. &quot;What excites me most is that this will get out to the UK through the 850 stores. It will really get out to Britain the importance and the brilliance of London&apos;s Paralympic Games in 2012,&quot; he said. Sainsbury&apos;s plans to link its 850 stores with individual Paralympic athletes from different parts of the country and will twin groups of stores with specific Paralympic sports. Staff will be offered the opportunity to volunteer at the Games, which begin on 29 August, and take part in the torch relay. Lord Coe, chairman of the London organising committee (Locog), said: &quot;We said in Singapore that through the Paralympic Games we wanted to change public attitudes towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole. &quot;We are very excited by this announcement, which will drive the power and strength of the Games. We have an extraordinary opportunity to drive all the values the Paralympic Games engender.&quot; Sainsbury&apos;s will join seven other domestic &quot;tier one&quot; sponsors that have paid more than \u00a340m each to sponsor the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012. Locog has now raised more than \u00a3600m from 29 partners towards the \u00a32bn cost of staging the Games. In addition to domestic sponsors, Locog&apos;s income comes from the International Olympic Committee&apos;s roster of sponsors and ticket sales. By focusing exclusively on the Paralympics, the supermarket chain will hope to become linked with the event in the public mind. Because it is being broadcast by Channel 4, rather than the BBC, there will also be greater opportunities for advertising around it. King said he was confident that the deal could take the Paralympic movement to a new level&quot; and would build on existing programmes such as its sponsorship of schools athletics and its Active Kids programme."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2010/may/06/eu-debt-crisis-greece-live-blog-ecb", "sentences": ["As Clarence Chu, a trader with market maker Hudson Capital Energy in Singapore, told the Associated Press:      The market is realising the problem in Europe is not easy to fix."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-06T06:22:53Z", "title": "Market reaction general election 2010: live blog", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Financial crisis", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Greece", "Euro", "European Union", "Business", "General election 2010", "Market turmoil", "Europe"], "article": " 6.44am: OK - we&apos;re moving over to a new live blog for today&apos;s action.  It&apos;s here - Market turmoil - live coverage - click across now to see the latest action. Thanks for reading and commenting. Graeme  6.27am: The pound&apos;s still falling - just hit $1.4641.  6.23am: The pound just hit a 12-month low against the dollar at $1.4670, as traders quickly digest those forecasts of heavy selling on the European exchanges. You have to go back to the end of April 2009 to find a time when sterling was weaker against the greenback. There have also been some interesting moves against the euro, which has been steadily weakened by the Greek crisis. The pound hit a high of \u20ac1.2735 (that&apos;s 84.4p) shortly after 4am, but has been slipping since. Currently \u20ac1.2679 (86.2p)  6.05am: We&apos;re just getting the latest projections from the City forecasters, and they predict that shares are going to tumble again when trading begins at 8am. The FTSE 100 is being called down up to 2.1% at the start. That&apos;s a fall of over 100 points, following yesterday&apos;s 80-point tumble. The picture is just as grim across Europe - with Germany&apos;s DAX tipped to fall 2.3% and the French CAC down a whopping 2.9%. That can&apos;t be blamed on the British electorate, of course - it&apos;s a reflection of the heavy losses on Wall Street overnight, and the ongoing turmoil in Greece.  5.53am: Morning all. Graeme Wearden here. And what a morning - as I type the Conservative Party are on track to claim the most seats in a hung parliament, but with 120 constituencies still to declare the future of British politics is skin-tinglingly unclear. As Patrick Wintour has written - Gordon Brown and David Cameron are locked in a constitutional standoff.  So let&apos;s run around the state of the financial markets. Sterling is DOWN, at $1.4754 against the dollar. It hit $1.4731 around 3.15am, when the glut of declarations started coming in. UK government bonds are also coming under heavy pressure. Gilt futures soared overnight, pushing up the cost of borrowing.  4.22am: Markets are braced for a rocky start to trading today as overnight confusion in the polls comes amid continued heavy selling on international markets due to the Greek debt crisis. Prices quoted by IG Index suggest the FTSE-100 could fall over a 100 points after a volatile night of trading in London follows panicked selling late yesterday in New York. Investors are struggling to digest the implications of this tightly-fought general election, but for the moment, the fight is overshadowed by broader worries about whether the next phase of the credit crunch is underway. I&apos;m going to head off now to get some sleep, but Graeme Wearden will be taking over from me shortly to chart what promises to be an interesting morning.      Dealing room reaction: Elena Moya    3.23am: OK, so now the City reckons it&apos;s going to be a hung parliament. So much for all that collective wisdom (or not). The bankers are as confused as the rest of the country. Elena Moya, our tireless reporter in the Square Mile, reports:  After a short euphoria from those who believed a Tory victory was coming - despite the hung parliament announced by the exit polls- sentiment turned to reflect what the market has been discounting for weeks: there&apos;s no clear winner. &quot;The market is resigning itself to a hung parliament - we would need a massive surprise not to see hung parliament, and we haven&apos;t had one yet,&quot; said David Jones, Chief Market Strategist at IG Index in London.&quot;Current aggregate swing on results in is just above 4%, which is not enough for a Conservative majority,&quot; addded Mike Amey, Pimco&apos;s man in London. &quot;As a result the Gilt market is coming down a little. The gilt market had rallied by just over 1 point, or 1% at the open. That is now more like half a point. Similarly the Pound is a touch lower (1.4840 from 1.49). The markets are starting to think seriously about a hung parliament.&quot;   2.53am: Glancing away from this gripping election race for a second, the markets have just opened in Hong Kong and it looks like the panic that hit Europe and the US yesterday has rippled all around the world. HSBC shares have opened down 5.1%. Whatever the result of this election, I think we should brace for a rocky Friday on the markets.  2.25am: The markets have gone quiet as everyone tries to work out what all these contradictory results add up to. The pound and gilt markets remain firm, but the prospect of a hung parliament is looming again and I woudn&apos;t be surprised to see prices begin to fall once more. This really has been a roller-coaster night.      Dealing room reaction: Elena Moya     1.33am: Definite signs of a rally in the UK bond markets, but our credit market expert Elena Moya (who is in the London dealing room of the world&apos;s biggest bond investor, Pimco) cautions that this is not all about the Tories.   This is a reaction to a rally in US treasury bills, which rallied after a trading error sent equities diving and investors seeked refuge in the - in principle - safer world of bonds. &quot;The gilt reaction is very similar to the German bonds, so it s a catch up with the US market, it&apos;s not saying the results are good or bad, just saying they don&apos;t know,&quot; said Mike Amey, head of UK fixed income at Pimco, the world&apos;s biggest bond investor. Trading at the London Financial Futures Exchange, Liffe, was about 1000 contracts in the first 15 minutes since the market opened at 1am. &quot;It&apos;s very small, if something big had happened, there would be 15,000 contracts traded,&quot; Amey said. He&apos;s covering the markets alone in London, liaising with his colleagues at the much bigger trading room in southern California. Communication is through Bloomberg screens, but there&apos;s little chance the firm will jump on UK gilts, after founder Bill Gross said they were resting on a bed of nitroglycerine.  For those interested in the detail, gilt futures are up \u00a3117.7 [to buy \u00a3100 worth of gilts], from \u00a3117.3, pushing down 10 year gilt yields down to 3.8%, from 3.9%. This means the cost of borrowing money is falling for the UK government.  1.09am: Government bond markets rallying judging from early prices. Those two Tory gains likely to be reassuring investors about majority government. IG Index say June Long Gilts now open and up around 0.6% - driven by New York uncertainty and City feeling it will get a definite winner tonight.  1.00am: Trading in the City has now started. We&apos;re getting prices with a 10 minute delay unfortunately, but I&apos;ll give you a flavour of the action once the seats start coming in. We&apos;ve been getting currency trades through the night already (sterling now back up to $1.49) but the opening of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe), will give the first indication of how investors think the election result will effect interest rates, government bonds and the FTSE-100. Meanwhile, our reporter Elena Moya has filed this after speaking to traders in the US:  Investors are betting sterling volatility will continue to the weekend, until clear results come out. &quot;This won&apos;t be figured out quicky, the pound will be trading all over the map over the next two sessions,&quot; said Dave Leaver, a senior trader at forex.com in New York. Then, the pound will be a good buying opportunity, he said. &quot;Sooner or later, problems in Europe will be a lot worse than the UK, so the pound will appear as a safe heaven. Britain and the US have taken good steps to handle the crisis. The ball will be in the European central bank&apos;s court, and we don&apos;t see what can be done: a debt problem is being sorted with more debt, one country is worse than the other. It s a complete mess.&quot;. I would have never thought that I would ever report a trader saying that the currency of a country with debts of more than 10% of the size of its economy would appear as a safe heaven. It&apos;s all relative, Einstein already said.       Currency markets - Sterling    12.34am: The pound has recovered most of its early losses after the exit polls. Now trading at $1.48. This feels like the calm before the storm though. Everyone wants to see some results from marginal seats before making up their minds. Trading on Liffe begins in half an hour, which should give us some more sense of what investors think will happen.      Dealing room reaction: Elena Moya    Our reporter in the City, Elena Moya, says the mood is turning (predictably) toward the Tories in London&apos;s dealing rooms.  Armed with computer and television screens, investors are convinced the exit poll is wrong and the tories will win a majority -the City&apos;s preferred outcome, given the conservatives&apos; outright commitment to budget cuts. IG Index has been handling an investor bet every 10 or 15 seconds since the exit poll came out at 10pm.  She&apos;s in a cab now heading for the dealing room at Pimco, the world&apos;s largest bond trader, which famously warned the UK was resting on a &quot;bed of nitrogylcerine&quot;. Here&apos;s her recent interview with the boss of Pimco warning &apos;clients don&apos;t pay me to feel sorry&apos;.      Live blog: Nils Pratley    11.40pm: My colleague Nils Pratley points out that the City is digesting these big swings against Labour in Sunderland. Spread betting sites have Tory seats at 330-335, enough for a small overall majority.  Meanwhile, the pound has recovered some of its earlier losses.      Dealing room reaction: Elena Moya    11.18pm: Our reporter Elena Moya is at one of the many City dealing rooms to have opened especially for the election night and has just filed this dispatch:  At 10pm, as the exit poll came out, the screens of spread betting company IG Index were flashing orders from some of its more than 50,000 clients worldwide.In the usually quiet headquarters on Blackfriars Rd., about 15 staff monitored the company&apos;s risk exposure, as clients mostly placed bets against sterling, and on a rally of the FTSE-100 Index.&quot;A hung parliament is bad for the pound, but investors may be speculating that the fall of the FTSE might have been overdone -FTSE companies get much of their revenues from overseas, so a hung parliament here might not have such big impact,&quot; said David Jones, Chief Markets Strategist at IG Index.Before the exit poll was announced, investors bet that the FTSE would fall 150 points from its closing price on Thursday. The bet moved to a smaller drop of 120 points by 10.20pm. The pound lost 200 points against the dollar, from $1.49, from $1.47, after the exit poll. &quot;In 20 minutes, 200 points is quite a big move,&quot; Jones said. It was his first day in the office at night, he said, adding that he planned to work through the night and until 2 pm on Friday.Thursday was IG Index&apos; busiest day in the company&apos;s 30-year history, with 420,000 transactions from around the world, or about five trades per second. The Greek crisis, a mis-placed trade in the US, and the uncertain outcome of the UK election, pushed volatility, the favorite element of punters. &quot;It&apos;s great for our clients,&quot; Jones said. &quot;It&apos;s quite exciting, for a change. Markets had been open in the past, but the market reaction was negligible because the result was expected.&quot;   10.41pm: Barclays Capital has just released its snap verdict on the exit poll data, of which they are rightly sceptical. The main point is that a minority Tory government is actually a big worry for the City, rather contrary to Ken Clarke&apos;s dire warnings before the election.  The emergence of a minority government would leave some residual uncertainty about the outlook for economic policy as the passage of any necessary legislation may be more difficult to navigate than if the government had an outright majority. As such, this outcome seems likely to lead to some volatility in asset prices unless and until the ability of the new government to operate effectively is established.    10.30pm: Our reporter Elena Moya is on a trading floor in the City following events this evening. She says investors are still most concerned about wider market turmoil:  The exit poll suggests that it will be a hung parliament with no party having a strong mandate. If this turns out to be correct then the UK market might be slightly volatile tomorrow. However the fact of the matter is that in the capital market, the UK election is being totally overshadowed by events in the European government bond market  Meanwile, others are picking up on the sliding currency markets we mentioned earlier.  Telegraph economics columnist Ed Conway tweets: &quot;Pound down against euro - big sign of market concern. near 86p a euro. took traders a sec to realise what polls mean. now they&apos;re worried&quot;      Currency markets - Sterling    10.24pm: Sterling continuing to slide, now down exactly a cent against the dollar having fallen three cents earlier in the day. The fear seems to be that a result that mirrored the exit poll would make it hard even for a coalition government to be formed.      Currency markets - Sterling    10.17pm: Sterling has fallen almost half a cent against the dollar since exit poll data came out at 10pm pointing to a hung parliament. The pound has already had a battering today after the Greek debt crisis raised fears of contagion. Prices quoted by spread-betting agency IG Index are also pointing to a 123 point fall in the FTSE 100 index on Friday morning. &quot;With Conservatives 19 seats short, that&apos;s getting close to the most awkward result you can get,&quot; said David Lea, western europe analyst at Control Risks.      Dow Jones at 3.20pm US eastern daily time Photograph: Graphic    8.59pm: Here is a graphic of the frightening plunge on the Dow Jones earlier this evening. It looks like the panic may have been triggered by one or more rogue trades. CNBC is reporting that one of the big banks may have been responsible but the New York Stock Exchange is investigating. Either way, the Dow has just closed down 354 points, or more than 3%, with almost all of the gains this year now reversed. Rogue trades are not what we need on days like this.  8.46pm: New York may be calming down (a bit) but this could be a long night because traders in London are coming in especially to trade through the results of the UK election. The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange is opening at 1am to allow trading in derivatives that track UK interest rates and the FTSE 100 index.      Given what a rollercoaster day we have already had on international markets, it goes without saying that traders will be watching the results closely to see what it may mean for the UK economy. Putting party allegiances to one side (and most of the City would love to see a Tory win), the main issue will be stability. If the new government looks like it will command a clear majority or can form a stable coalition, things may calm down. A hung parliament may add to the international jitters. They could all fall asleep, of course. If you need reminind how volatile things are have a look at this piece from our banking correspondent Jill Treanor about how the crisis in Greece is already hitting British banks.       8.26pm: Dan Roberts here taking over the live blog to see us through what could be an interesting evening on the international markets. Following the shock 900 point plunge in the Dow, the New York Stock Exchange is looking into the trading data to see whether a rogue trade may have sparked the panic selling. The Dow Jones index has recovered to trade &apos;just&apos; 4.5% down, but it&apos;s undeniable that markets are extremely jittery right now. It feels, in fact, just like it did during the banking crisis.  8.20pm: Some of the City&apos;s dealing rooms will be opening up very early in the morning to trade on the result of the general election. With Wall Street seeming to have a major case of the jitters, by far the worst outcome - for the markets - would be a hung parliament. If there is no clear winner, expect a rout in London tomorrow. The foreign exchange markets are, of course, open all night, with the centre of trading switching during the day. The pound has taken a battering today, while the euro has continued its slide against the dollar. It&apos;s going to get worse, according to BNP Paribas. The bank expects the euro to be at parity - ie worth exactlty the same as - the dollar by the first quarter of NEXT YEAR. The euro hit a 14 month low against the greenback - dropping under $1.26 - but parity still suggests a major revision. Until today, BNP had been forecasting the euro at $1.22. In its early days as a currency, of course, the euro was at around 80cents so it is not unchartered territory (as Larry Elliott, our economics editor, pointed out to me as he wandered past my desk). But since then the eurozone has expanded and - its supporters would maintain - strengthened as an economic bloc. Cobblers, its detractors would of course point out, the problems in Greece highlight the fundamental flaw in having monetary union without fiscal/political union. Anyway, back to the BNP note. This from Reuters:  &quot;European bond markets are no longer a homogenous entity, which has reduced their attractiveness to foreign investors,&quot; strategists at BNP wrote in a note. &quot;The inner (European Monetary Union) bond spread divergence and its impact on capital flows has been more severe than had been initially anticipated.&quot;  BNP said over the past year the net inflow into European sovereign debt markets has &quot;collapsed.&quot; Official accounts, which had been steady euro buyers and bond investors for years, have &quot;disappeared.&quot;  &quot;While we have had one of the most euro bearish forecasts in the market, these previous projections now appear too moderate given current developments,&quot; the firm said. &quot;Now that the fiscal option has been used without much success it will be down to the European Central Bank to come to the rescue of the euro,&quot; BNP said.  &quot;But, ECB President (Jean-Claude) Trichet did not leave the impression that this rescue comes at speed.&quot;        8.01pm: Wall Street has gone into meltdown. At one point in the last half an hour the index of America&apos;s leading stocks - the DJIA - was down more than 900 points. That&apos;s a 10% fall. The vote in favour of Greece&apos;s austerity package has done absolutely nothing to convince traders on the other side of the Atlantic that Europe&apos;s heavily indebted economies are going to be able to pull themselves out of the mire. At 8PM the DJIA is down 530 points, which still counts as a rout. Investors are as jittery as they were in the days following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.       7.45pm: Stephen Moss, our man on the ground in Athens, has sent a couple of choice missives via micro-blogging site Twitter about the situation in Athens, where protestors appear to be getting increasingly agitated. A few minutes ago he tweeted:      Police breaking up athens parl demo with gas and advance from several sides Obviously things appear to have gone rather downhill since then. While there has not yet been another flare-up quite as violent as the scenes witnessed on Wednesday, which resulted in three deaths in an Athens bank, local residents are apparently taking few chances. Even hoteliers are apparently scared, according to Stephen&apos;s latest tweet.      Tried to take refuge in posh hotel but the concierge closed the shutters on me Some bastions of capitalism, however, will stand regardless of what the mob might be able to throw at them. Although Stephen does question the wiseness of keeping one particular outpost of American colonialism open during such times of unrest.      Is it really wise for mcdonalds in syntagma square to be open? Almost certainly not judging by the pictures now running on the television. There appear to be running battles going on between protesters and police.       7.20pm: Despite the success of George Papandreou in getting his package of austerity measure through parliament there is still a papable sense of panic in the financial markets about the state of the Greek economy and the &apos;contagion&apos; spreading to other eurozone countries. The recent violence on the streets of Athens - and the protestors have been out in force again today and are currently massing in the streets surrounding the parliament building - has reminded investors, especially on the other side of the Atlantic, that voting in a law is not the same as implementing it. The vote took place against a backdrop of angry Greeks outside shouting &quot;Take to the streets! Say &apos;No&apos; to the measures!&quot; and it looks as though there are likely to be further mass demonstrations tonight. Financial markets are far from convinced that the vote - which paves the way for the eurozone/IMF \u20ac110bn bailout - marks the beginning of the recovery for Greece. On Wall Street the Dow Jones is down almost 250 points. Earlier, European stock markets closed lower, with banking stocks taking a pasting. And of course it should not be forgotten that at a time when the financial markets are desperate for proof that decisive political action can be taken to deal with Europe&apos;s heavily indebted countries the last thing any economy needs is political indecision. What a great time to hold a general election that could result in a hung partliament..!  On that point, some dealing rooms will be opening up very early tomorrow morning (and I mean early, 1AM in some cases) in order to react to the election results as they come in. Foreign exchange trading, of course, carries on all night. The pound has already taken a battering today, down 1% at under $1.50.       6.40pm: To a back drop of chanting by demonstrators outside the parliament building, Greece&apos;s politicians have approved prime minister George Papandreou&apos;s austerity package, paving the way for a \u20ac110bn bailout by the eurozone countries and the IMF. The package of measures, which opposition leader Andonis Samaras characterised as a dose of medicine which &quot;is in danger of killing the patient&quot;, includes the overhaul of Greece&apos;s pensions system, tax increases and the abolition of the 13th and 14th monthly wages paid annually to public sector workers on low salaries. Its passage was not smooth, with leaders on both sides of the parliament having to chuck out dissenters. &quot;We have done what was necessary, not what was easy,&quot; Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said after the vote. &quot;Without these measures, we&apos;d be thrown into the deepest recession this country has ever known.&quot; Elsewhere on the site, our banking expert Jill Treanor has explored the potential impact of the crisis on the European banking sector.       6.18pm: The Greek government has approved the austerity bill. More will follow on that in a moment. But first, here&apos;s some more on the earlier preliminary vote in the Greek parliament. The bill passed its first hurdle with a vote of 172 in favour and 121 against.  The \u20ac110bn bailout from the euroxome/IMF is contingent on the passing of the so-called austerity measures, which have lead to violent protests in the streets of Athens. With such a contentious piece of legislation its passage was never going to be smooth, and it has not been. Papandreou was forced to expel three of his deputies who abstained from voting (he still has 157 of the 300 seats in the Greek parliament which still gives him the sort of comfortable majority that David Cameron is praying he will have tomorrow) His Conservative opposite number Andonis Samaras also had to remove one of his supporters - former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyiannis - after he voted in favor of the bill. The main Greek opposition party now has 90 seats. Samaras blated the government saying &quot;The dose of the medicine you are administering is in danger of killing the patient&quot; and claiming Papandreou had caused &quot;a social explosion.&quot; Papandreou was suitably frank about the choice facing deputies in the parliament:  &quot;Today things are simple. Either we vote and implement the deal, or we condemn Greece to bankruptcy,&quot; he said. &quot;Some people want that, and are speculating (on it), and hope that it will happen... We, I, will not allow that. We will not allow speculation against our country, and bankruptcy to happen.&quot;   5.33pm: Europe&apos;s stock markets have ended on a 10-week closing low on fears about the contagion spreading from Greece. From Nick Fletcher&apos;s closing market forces blog      Overall it was another day of volatile trading, with the FTSE 100 finishing down 80.94 points at 5260.99 after hitting a low of 5251 and a high of 5371. The index has dropped around 360 points since last Friday morning. Ratings agencies Fitch and Moody&apos;s, meanwhile, are both keeping their stable outlook on Italy despite the Italian government increasing its forecast for the ratio of its debt to GDP. Cheekily the rating agencies have stated that the revision merely brings the government&apos;s projections into line with their own. Who needs politicians and their economists when you have unelected ratings agencies? Perhaps we should hand over the reins of power now (actually, I think this crisis may show we already have). Incidentally, there&apos;s an excellent discussion of how spreads in the credit default swap market (that&apos;s bets on which banks will be hardest hit by the sovereign debt crisis) have now widened beyond the last three spikes: the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and March last year, behind the FT paywall on FT Alphaville but you can sneak in through Google - just search for &quot;CDS Report: It&apos;s getting worse&quot; and click on news.       5.05pm: The Greek parliament has voted to approve Papandreou&apos;s austerity measures, needed in order to get the \u20ac110bn EU/IMF bail-out cash. But the markets are not going to break out the bunting just yet.  This first vote was a preliminary non-binding vote. In order for the package, which has lead to such violent protests in recent days, to actually become law it must pass a second vote later today.      As investors look for safe havens among all this talk of contagion and a sovereign debt crisis, gold has gained almost 2%, rising to a five month high of $1,195.35 an ounze. Silver prices are slightly weaker, but platinum is also soaring, quoted at over $1659 an ounce, up more than 30 cents.      Live blog - Portugal flag    4.56pm: Things are tough for Portugal as the P in PIGS looks to raise anywhere between \u20ac300m and \u20ac1bn next week. Spreads on its existing 10 year bonds have ballooned today on fears that the country will be the next to fall into the sovereign debt crisis hole that has enveloped Greece. The premium demanded by investors in Portugese bonds, compared with German bonds - which investors see as a far safer bet - has grown to 349 basis points compared with 307 basis points on Wednesday. That means it costs Portugal 3.49 percentage points MORE than Germany to raise funds. Portugal has roughly \u20ac5.9bn worth of bonds falling due this month and while officials maintain that the country will not have any problems with these redemptions, the situation has not been helped by comments earlier from ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet that the bank&apos;s monthly rate setting meeting did not include any discussion of the bank buying government bonds. In Portugal the PSI20 has closed down 2%.      In Spain the IBEX 35 is down 2.2%.      In Italy the FTSE MIB has closed down 4.3% The euro is down 1% against the dollar today taking its losses against the greenback to 4.8% for the week. So far the euro has lost 11% in 2010 (thanks to Reuters for the figures). The FTSE 100, meanwhile, closed down 80.94 points at 5260.99 points, further unsettled by an 80 point slide on the DJIA in New York.  4.02pm: The markets are wobbling again, and sterling is down below $1.50 as new fears spread that Greece&apos;s bailout may not be a done deal after all. The FTSE 100 has turned negative again, down 63 points at 5279. The catalyst appears to be a statement from the German opposition leader saying he will oppose the bill that is going through the German parliament.      Rick Wray will be bringing you more details.... (Cheers Graeme, now go and get some sleep. I hear you&apos;ll be back in the office at some unGodly hour to cover the market&apos;s reaction to the election) Rick here: as the denizens of Westminster canvas the electrorate this side of the Channel, in Germany there is some political grandstanding going on in parliament. Chancellor Angela Merkel does not need the support of opposition parties to get the country&apos;s involvement in the Greek bailout into law, it would help to soothe an increasingly disgruntled public. But the main German opposition party - the SPD - appears to have failed to reach an agreement with merkel on a joint resolution that was to be attached to the bill approving the deal for Greece. Investor disquiet about the Greek situation - and potential contagion into other countries - is playing havoc with the markets.     Financial data from Thomson Reuters    Through the wonders of technology (and the office&apos;s Thomson Reuters screen) here&apos;s the day&apos;s sterling/dollar trading chart.       3.07pm: Time to look back at Greece. Prime minister George Papandreou has given a passionate speech to parliament as it continues to debate the \u20ac110bn bailout - and the austerity measures the country must adopt. Papandreou told MPs that there was no time to lose:      &quot;This is the time for change. There is not a single day or hour to lose. I take responsibility as prime minister for making the decisions I believe are necessary for my country and its citizens ... I don&apos;t care if this will be the only time I serve asprime minister.&quot;  Papandreou also touched on yesterday&apos;s tragic scenes:  Neither stones, nor violence will remove us from (EU) supervision. Instead they will throw us into even deeper crisis and disrepute.   2.35pm: Trichet&apos;s work is done, and the euro has clambered back to \u20ac1.2726. The top line from this press conference seems to be the ECB&apos;s refusal to indulge in quantitative easing. Will the markets see that as a sign of confidence, or will it disappoint those who were hoping for firmer action to prevent the Athens crisis spreading? Gary Jenkins of Evolution doesn&apos;t sound too convinced:  Well Mr. Trichet is going for the &quot;crisis, what crisis?&quot; approach in the Q&amp;A session of the ECB meeting. I am not convinced that this denial of the problems facing European sovereigns is healthy. It is also difficult to believe that they didnt even discuss the possibility of buying government bonds, but that is what Mr Trichet claimed. However, if recent track record is anything to go by, that doesn&apos;t mean that they won&apos;t be buying government bonds pretty soon. I worry that Mr. Trichets performance today could well lead to a further sell off in government bonds, certainly the Euro is already suffering.   2.25pm: Wouldn&apos;t we be better without the euro, asks one journalist. Trichet looks a bit shocked at this kind of talk.      I don&apos;t think there is any such sentiment in the Governing Council. We, and the presidents and prime ministers I speak to, think that belonging to the euro has brought about an enormous amount of advantages. But it also calls for responsible attitudes.   2.19pm: The euro just fell through $1.27. We&apos;re hearing that the bonds issued by weaker members of the eurozone are also coming under pressure following Trichet&apos;s insistance that quantitative easing was not discussed by the ECB. Geman Bunds look safer than ever.  2.10pm: Does Trichet think there should be a European ratings agency? Some people have been calling for this in recent days, after America&apos;s Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s agency sparked panic by cutting its ratings on Greece, Portugal and Spain. Trichet sits on the fence (something not tolerated at this UK polling station today)      I would say it is an open question, not only at the European level but at the global level, whether or not we have the optimum configeration, or constallation, of rating agencies. As with many things, the more you have competition the better. But, but I have no position of the governing council on whether or not we are calling for an European rating agency. He also wins some points from his audience by insisting that Greece and Portugal are &quot;not in the same boat. That is obvious if you look at the facts and figures.&quot;  2.06pm: Another journalist asks whether the decision to tear up the collateral rules for Greek debt last weekend was unanimous. Trichet doesn&apos;t want to say no, but can&apos;t say yes. Here&apos;s his answer (as I jotted it down):      We were unanimous in asking Greece to embark on a recovery programme.We were unanimous in judging positively the recovery programme created with the EU and IMF We were unanimous that there was a case for activating the loan that would, with the IMF, finance the programme.Unanimity, Unanimity, Unanimity. There was an overwhelming majority that we had to take the decision that was taken on Sunday, as a matter of consistency. So not unanimous, then. Trichet has also insisted that Greece will not default on its loans.  2.02pm: David Tweed of Bloomberg wants to know why the ECB didn&apos;t consider buying government bonds. Is it not going to take a decision, or has it already taken the decision? And what&apos;s Trichet&apos;s personal view on the need (or otherwise) for an orderly default mechanism. Trichet says that &quot;I think default, for me, is out of the question.&quot; And on quantitative easing, he is not budging. &quot;It was not discussed. I have nothing more to say than that.&quot;  1.50pm: Question time. A Bloomberg reporter hits Trichet with three questions: did the ECB discussed buying up government bonds to try and reassure the markets; does the eurozone need a proper method to allow its members to default on its loans, and why did the ECB only relax the rules on accepting Greek bonds as collateral, rather than on all EU government bonds? Trichet responds that the ECB did not consider engaging in quantitative easing (despite analysts suggesting some days ago that it should take the QE plunge), and that it certainly did not talk about mechanisms for allowing member states to default. On the third question, Trichet says that the ECB was fully consulted and informed on Greece&apos;s &quot;very ambitious&quot; recovery programme, and that the rest of Europe had asked the ECB whether it was right to activate Greece&apos;s loans. As such, it felt confident that it could break the rule book for Greece. Another questioner wants to know whether &quot;saving the eurozone&quot; is now the ECB&apos;s prime objective, rather than keeping inflation under control (not a question you can easily imagine being asked a few years ago). Trichet&apos;s reply focuses on the ECB&apos;s record to this date:      We are inflexibly attached to price stability. It is our primary mandate. It is what the people of europe have asked of us and we are credible in this respect.           We will post average inflation over the first 12 years of the euro, at below or close to 2%. Exactly in line with what we said 12 years ago. This is a remarkable result. Looking at my Reuters screen, the euro is falling again and threatening to go through the $1.27 mark.  1.42pm: The ECB press conference is just starting in Lisbon - a chance for Europe&apos;s top bankers to reassure the markets about the Greek crisis. It looks pretty packed - photographers falling over each other to get a good shot of Jean-Claude Trichet and his colleagues. Trichet starts reading out a prepared statement, saying that it is &quot;appropriate&quot; to leave rates at 1%, with low economic growth helping to keep inflation in check.He also says that:      Overall we expect price stablility to be maintained in the medium term....inflation expectations remain anchored with the ECB&apos;s aim of keeping rates below, but close to, 2%. Monetary policy will do all necessary to control price pressure in the medium term. Trichet seems confident that the overall European economy is still recovering from the recession, but he admits that the Greek debt crisis is going to inhibit growth:  While adverse weather conditions dampened growth earlier this year, some strengthening took palce in the spring. The governing council expects real GDP to expand at an encouraging pace.....But the financial crisis will have a dampening effect on economic growth.  Trichet also said that the ECB continues to see the risks facing the economic outlook as &quot;broadly balanced in an environment of high uncertainty&quot;. I&apos;ve heard more reassuring forecasts.  Trichet rounds up by urging Europe&apos;s governments to get to grips with their burgeoning fiscal deficits as soon as possible, saying that the ECB does not believe that enough is being done. He warns that putting &quot;decisive action&quot; off will only make the eventual task even harder.  1.20pm: This video shows Greece mourning the dead bank workers (see above - you may have to refresh.....)  1.08pm: The uncertainty over Europe&apos;s debt crisis has sent some investors flocking to put their money into gold and the dollar. This has helped to weaken other currencies, meaning that gold priced in sterling has hit a new all-time high. GoldCore, a group of bullion dealers, have more information:  The euro has again come under severe pressure as contagion risks increase. While all the focus is on Europe right now, similar risks face the UK and US economies and this is leading to significant safe haven demand for gold internationally. Prices have risen close to a new nominal record against the British pound and the highest level in yen since February 1983. Gold is slightly higher in most currencies this morning and significantly stronger in British pounds and euros - trading at $1,185.00, \u00a3786.03 and \u20ac925.72 per ounce this morning.  Goldcore added that European nations must raise almost \u20ac2 trillion ($2.6 trillion) within the next three years to refinance maturing bonds and fund deficits - which may prove a stretch too far:  The real risk is that the massive debts in various OECD countries are simply too big to bail out and neither the German government, individual governments or even the IMF itself can afford to bail out Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland or other debt ridden countries. As the Greek debt crisis spreads to other European nations there is a real risk of the crisis creating an international monetary and financial crisis. The Asian monetary crisis of 1998 looks quite tame and management compared with the risks today.        12.56pm: Right, we&apos;re had the ECB&apos;s decision - it has left interest rates unchanged at 1% (so that rumour going round the trading floors this morning was bogus). This has hit the euro, which dropped to a new 14-month low of $1.2717 against the dollar. It also nudged 84.32p against the pound (lowest since June 2009). We&apos;ll get the good stuff after 1.30pm when the press conference with ECB head Jean-Claude Trichet kicks off.  12.42pm: While we wait for the ECB&apos;s decision on interest rates, let&apos;s flag up this topical image going round the City today.  (via FT Alphaville):     Live blog - Alphaville chart Photograph: guardian.co.uk    Generally, though, the feeling is that traders are still sitting tight before we get the results of today&apos;s general election (with bond markets opening at 1am)  11.49am: While we&apos;re waiting for the European Central Bank&apos;s decision on interest rates (and there&apos;s a rumour going round the City that they might announce a surprise cut), here&apos;s some more info from Moody&apos;s report on banking contagion.      On Ireland:  Ireland was one of the first countries to be affected by the abrupt bursting of the real estate bubble. But it has also been among the first to take decisive actions, first by guaranteeing banks&apos; debt, and then by implementing the restructuring and recapitalisation plan, combined with very severe austerity packages imposed by the government. The government and the banks now have to execute the plans and hope that the decisiveness and large acceptance of the austerity measures by the population will see them emerging stronger, albeit smaller, at the end of this process.       The UK:  With the economy facing challenges, the banking sector remains vulnerable: the highly leveraged economy is benefiting greatly from the benign interest rate environment, but the threat of a doubledip recession (in case of a fiscal tightening that is too harsh) or increased funding costs for the banks and the sovereign (in the opposite case) remain. Many banks and building societies are also still vulnerable to the downside scenarios, especially in their domestic retail and real estate exposures. Moreover, a deterioration in unemployment or higher interest rates are likely to further impact asset quality.        11.13am: Some reassuring (ish) news from Spain in the last few minutes. It successfully auctioned off \u20ac2.3bn of government debt.  It had to pay a higher yield than in a similar sales in March - 3.6%, up from 2.8% - indicating that investors demanded greater rewards for holding Spanish debt until 2015. But the auction also attracted almost two-and-a-half as many bids as required, indicating that investors weren&apos;t too bothered by the downgrading of Spain&apos;s credit rating last week. The markets have taken this news well, with the FTSE 100 now up 19 points at 5361. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities said the result was &quot;a classic example of there being a price for everything&quot;.       10.51am: More action from Greece, where finance minister George Papaconstantinou has just given a speech urging parliament to adopt the austerity measures at the vote later today.       He warned that the only alternative was a complete financial collapse:  The only way for the country to avoid default and bankruptcy is to take the money from our European partners and the IMF. It is very simple. In order to get this money we have to agree on this 3-year economic programme.  Papaconstantinou also acknowledged that other members of the eurozone face their own problems:  We are asking for money from countries which themselves have deficits, which themselves are the target of speculative attacks. We have to convince them that we are putting our house in order.   10.37am: Right, we&apos;ve got more information on those headlines from Moody&apos;s. It has published a research piece called &quot;Sovereign Contagion Risk -- Part I: Assessing the Impact on Banking Systems of Southern Europe, Ireland and the UK&quot;. The report looks at banks in three of the weakest members of the eurozone, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland* , as well as Britain. * who some analysts controversially group with Greece as the &quot;PIIGS&quot;  There&apos;s a link to the report here, but I&apos;m afraid you have to have registered. So here&apos;s the highlights.... \u2022 Each of these countries&apos; banking systems faces different challenges of different magnitudes&quot;....but contagion risk could dilute these differences and impose very real, common threats on all of them&quot; \u2022 Despite facing a fundamentally different situation compared with Greece, Portugal is now under heightened investor scrutiny, resulting in this week&apos;s review for possible downgrade on the ratings of all Portuguese banks. A key factor determining whether contagion risk continues in this case will be the market&apos;s view of the likely success or otherwise of the recently agreed IMF and European Union support package for Greece. Italy is another country where the banking system had been relatively robust so far, but where the major risk to its banking system could also be challenged by contagion risk should the market pressures on the sovereign increase. \u2022 Contagion could potentially also spread to banking systems that have weakened from within, often due to excessive loan growth (mostly Spain and Ireland and to a lesser extent the UK). UK bank shares are down today, with RBS, Barclays and Lloyds all down by around 1.7%. Despite this, the FTSE has clawed back its early losses and is up 1 point.  10.13am: We&apos;re seeing some alarming quotes from ratings agency Moody&apos;s on the Reuters screen, warning that the Greek crisis could hit weaker members of the eurozone - and even hit Britain&apos;s banking sector. Here&apos;s the snaps: MOODY&apos;S ASSESSES RISK OF SOVEREIGN CONTAGION ON CERTAIN EUROPEAN BANKING SYSTEMS MOODY&apos;S SAYS SOVEREIGN RISK CONTAGION COULD SPREAD TO BANKING SYSTEMS IN PORTUGAL, SPAIN, ITALY,IRELAND AND THE UKMore as we get it...  10.00am: Athens is in clean-up mode this morning after yesterday&apos;s rioting. Parliament continues to debate the highly unpopular austerity measures today, and we are expecting a vote on a draft bill to take place Thursday night. As I mentioned at 7.59am, many bank workers are on strike in protest at the three deaths yesterday, although some major branches in the centre of the capital are reported to be still open.       Today&apos;s Greek newspapers show the extent of the shock over yesterday&apos;s fatalities. Here&apos;s a flavour:  Kathimerini, a centre-right paper, warned that Greece could be &quot;on the road to distruction&quot; in a sombre, hard-hitting editorial:  Can a society self-destruct? Yes, it most definitely can and the way Greece is headed right now it is a very real possibility that it will. Here we have a state and a society that allow a handful of nihilistic hooligans to torch the city and cause the deaths of three citizens. We have the leadership of the country&apos;s second biggest political party opting for a populist line of rhetoric and failing to answer a simple question on whether or not it will support the government&apos;s economic recovery plan. We see a society that is mad, and justifiably so, and we see it going down an ill-advised path. Then we see the government, caught in the grips of panic, contributing to the populist fever and pouring more oil over the fire. Greece is at the most crucial point of its post-1974 history and whether we destroy ourselves or not, whether we go bankrupt or not, depends not just on our political leadership, but also on every single one of us individually and collectively.  Eleftheros Typos, a right-wing newspaper, said that the Greek government had left the capital &quot;at the mercy of murderers&quot;:  Three innocent, working Athenians lost their lives by brutal murderers. In democratic regimes there is also the right to work. This time again, police did not manage to disperse the hoodlums. According to eyewitnesses, they were walking unchecked on both sidewalks of Stadiou street and they were left free to impose their own law, the law of the jungle. Really, apart from condolences, what else will authorities utter?  And Ta Nea, a centre-left paper, wrote that:  The glory of democracy is that it assures everyone&apos;s right to express ideas, without limits. Put simply, in democratic regimes freedom of speech prevails. Yesterday&apos;s tragedy in the centre of Athens took place because democratic rights were trampled on. A protest march was subjected to violence. Where Greece finds itself today, no government can reject the demands imposed by its lenders. It could perhaps make the criterion of social justice more evident. This is what protesters were demanding yesterday but the gruesome acts overshadowed this.  In Britain, the front page of the Daily Mail shows a Greek policeman in flames after being hit by a petrol bomb. It calls the Athens protests an &quot;election wake-up call for Britain&quot;.  9.17am: Some breaking news in from Germany, where politicians continue to debate the \u20ac110bn rescue package for Greece ahead of tomorrow&apos;s crucial parliamentary vote. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the head of the opposition Social Democrats party, has told reporters in Berlin that Angela Merkel&apos;s government has opened talks about &quot;increasing the financial sector&apos;s participation&quot; in the bailout. That could help to ease the unpopular plan through the German Bundestag.....  8.45am: The City seem to be taking today cautiously while it waits to see how the general election unfolds. Interestingly, there&apos;s been good demand for UK government debt this morning - despite predictions that the UK deficit will overtake Greece&apos;s this year. Andrew Roberts, head of European rates strategy at RBS, told Reuters there&apos;s little sign of a &apos;gilt strike&apos; hitting Britain:  The massive flight to quality is ongoing: European bonds haven&apos;t really done much this morning and the UK has shown over the past two weeks that there&apos;s a willingness to buy at these yield levels. I still think gilts are very good value here and they will continue to rally.  Good news for whoever occupies Number 11 Downing Street next week.  8.10am: The London stock market has opened, and once again shares are falling. After dropping over 1% at the very start of trading, the FTSE 100 is currently down 34 points at 5307, a 0.6% fall. Germany&apos;s DAX is down 0.4%, while the French CAC has lost almost 1% and Spain&apos;s major market fell 1.3%. Those falls are bigger than expected, and it appears that traders got the wobbles as the markets were about to open. David Buik, an experienced City analyst, explains:       A minute before the off the FTSE was scheduled to open up 22 points down at 5319. Then it was like a torrent - a burst dam with sellers falling over themselves to get short. I have not seen that for some months. It opened down 60 points! but has now steadied down 34 at 5307 at 8.07am       7.59am: Greek bank workers have halted work for 24-hours in protest at the deaths yesterday of three people in the fire at a branch of the Marfin Egnatia Bank, during the general strike that brought Athens to a standstill. The Greek labor union of bank employees, OTOE, called the strike to protest at the tragedy.One 32-year-old pregnant woman and two other people, a man and a woman between 30 to 40 years old, died from asphyxiation after petrol bombs were thrown into the branch. Our Greece correspondent, Helena Smith, filed this report from the scene of the bank fire yesterday.  7.50am: Looking at the foreign exchange markets, and the euro is taking another battering.       In the last few hours it has fallen another cent against the dollar, and just touched a lowpoint of $1.2752 - a fresh 14-month low, I reckon.     Euro against the dollar. Financial information supplied by Thomson Reuters    It appears that Far East investors are becoming more concerned about the stability of the single currency. As Clarence Chu, a trader with market maker Hudson Capital Energy in Singapore, told the Associated Press:      The market is realising the problem in Europe is not easy to fix. The euro has also lost ground against sterling, to 84.7p (that means one pound is worth \u20ac1.18).  7.41am: Europe&apos;s major stock markets open in about 20 minutes. Shares have fallen for the last two days, and the word in the City is that there&apos;s little chance of a rally this morning. Asian markets have dropped sharply overnight, with Japan&apos;s Nikkei index just closing 3.3% lower at a two-month low. Japanese investors haven&apos;t had much chance to react to events in Europe this week as markets have been closed due to public holidays.      This just in from Ben Potter, research analyst at IG Markets:  There&apos;s no let-up in concerns that the Eurozone debt crisis could continue to worsen and as a result equity markets across the globe remain under pressure. The bull market always had to end somewhere and it looks like this could be the trigger with Gold and the US$ being big winners whilst even oil prices tumble - although the foray below $80/barrel is looking to be short lived.  The ECB rate verdict will prove interesting later in the day as presumably Trichet and his team will look to calm the nerves of investors whilst the weekly jobless claims from the US will be scrutinised ahead of tomorrow&apos;s non-farm payrolls.       I&apos;ve also got a note from Gary Jenkins of Evolution Securities. Here&apos;s a highlight:  All eyes and ears will be on the ECB today. Not so much on their decision regarding interest rate policy but on Trichet&apos;s statement and then the following press conference. Will he claim that the markets are irrational and that is no need for any extraordinary measures to be taken by the ECB, or will he try and manipulate the markets by suggesting that they would be prepared to use all powers at their discretion to ensure solvency for sovereigns and the banking sector alike? The very fact that Bundesbank President Axel Weber stated yesterday that the Greece crisis does not merit &quot;using every means&quot; suggests that they are indeed at least considering every option.   7.29am: The key scheduled event today is the European Central Bank&apos;s monthly meeting to set interest rates across the eurozone. We&apos;ll get its decision on rates at 12.45pm BST, but the real interest will be in Jean-Claude Trichet&apos;s press conference shortly afterwards. Expect Trichet to get a grilling about the Greek crisis, and whether the ECB is doing enough. It has already dropped the minimum credit rating requirement for Greek government bonds used in its liquidity operations. Now, though, some analysts speculate that the ECB may have to start buying government bonds in an effort to prevent confidence in the eurozone disintegrating further. This is one of those occasions when the ECB goes &apos;on the road&apos; and holds its meeting in a European capital, in this case Lisbon. That&apos;s an interesting choice, given that Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s has already downgraded Portugal&apos;s credit rating, and yesterday Moody&apos;s threatened to follow.  7.15am: Morning all, on a day when Europe&apos;s financial crisis continues to dominate events in the world financial markets. I&apos;ll be blogging the latest events here for the next few hours.  We&apos;re expecting interesting developments in Greece (after yesterday&apos;s riots), Germany (where the Greek bailout continues to divide politicians), and here in London (where traders expect another nervous day as Britain goes to the polls). But on current form, this drama could flare up pretty much anywhere...."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/07/ipad-apple-uk-pricing-announced", "sentences": ["Apple plans to release iPad in Austria, Belgium, Hong Kong, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand and Singapore in July and will announce availability, local pricing and pre-order plans for these nine additional countries at a later date."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-07T17:14:00Z", "title": "Apple reveals UK iPad prices", "tags": ["iPad", "Apple", "Technology", "Tablet computers", "Wi-Fi", "Business", "Gadgets"], "article": "Apple has revealed that the iPad, which will go on sale in the UK on 28 May, will cost \u00a3429 for the basic version.

Collectively the family ranks 40th on Forbes&apos; Rich List 2010, with a fortune of \u00a38.6bn drawn from interests spanning steel, energy, power and shipping. Indian names now figure prominently on the league tables of the wealthiest people on the planet. The country boasts 47 billionaires, up from 12 in 2005 and just nine at the turn of the millennium, compared with 10 in France and 35 in Britain. The highest-ranking Indian in the Forbes rankings is Mukesh Ambani, the world&apos;s fourth-richest man with \u00a319bn. Ambani&apos;s flagship company, Reliance Industries, inherited from his father Dhirubhai, is India&apos;s largest privately run firm with annual turnover just shy of \u00a330bn. He is reported to have recently spent \u00a3650m building a 27-storey house in the upmarket Mumbai district of Malabar Hills, complete with helipad, lavishing a further \u00a340m on a private jet said to be for his wife, Nita. Mukesh&apos;s younger brother Anil, owner of telecoms giant Reliance Communications, is worth \u00a39bn, ranking him 36th worldwide, just beneath George Soros, but ahead of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Further down the list are such luminaries as Sunil Bharti Mittal, founder of Bharti Airtel, India&apos;s largest (and the world&apos;s third-biggest) mobile telecoms firm, and Kumar Birla, a commodities tycoon worth \u00a35.2bn. Between them, these tycoons and a few dozen others make up the elite that owns India. They have been compared with great US capitalists of the 19th and early 20th centuries such as John D Rockefeller, who made his fortune in oil, John Pierpont (JP) Morgan, who dominated corporate finance, and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. Unlike their American counterparts, no single member of India&apos;s industrial and financial superclass exerts a nationwide grip on a sector or commodity, but many boast virtual local monopolies, with entire industries divided up and profitably parcelled out among the country&apos;s jet-set. Many hang out at opulent clubs such as the Bombay Gymkhana, holiday in London, Dubai or New York, and rub shoulders with Bollywood film stars in swish Mumbai nightclubs. India is a key member of the so-called &quot;Bric&quot; nations \u2013 standing for Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 a term coined by Goldman Sachs to describe what they see as emerging superpowers. Though not immune from the credit crunch, India has come through relatively well. But compare the opulence enjoyed by the ruling commercial elite with a very different India, a nation founded on the communistic principles of Mahatma Gandhi. While the rich few shelter in gated communities safeguarding their billions, the masses live in cramped communal apartments\u00a0\u2013 if they are lucky \u2013 or in the press and heat of the city streets if they are not. More than three-quarters of the country&apos;s 1.2\u00a0billion people have to get by on less than \u00a31.30 a day,\u00a0double the level of poverty seen in China. Seen up close, this world of total financial extremes is disturbing. The Ruias, cocooned in their personal tower block soaring over Mumbai&apos;s majestic racecourse, can enjoy panoramic views of the city; even the air they breathe is fragrant and untainted. But nearby, in a morass of slums where households live cheek by jowl, I met a family\u00a0sheltered under a flimsy tarpaulin against the lashing of a monsoon. The father told me they had been there &quot;many, many years&quot;. The Ruias and their fellow billionaires provide regular employment to tens of thousands of workers and \u2013 in recent weeks at least \u2013 have also kept a few hundred City of London bankers, auditors and lawyers in gainful employment. Their wealth and enterprise has helped push India&apos;s economy into the global big leagues. Gross domestic product here is tipped to rise by 8-10% each year for the rest of the decade, figures the UK can only dream about. And many of the country&apos;s wealthiest people are also philanthropists, notably Ratan Tata, owner of steelmaker Corus and luxury British car marques Jaguar and Land Rover. Two-thirds of the equity of Tata&apos;s holding company, Tata Sons, is held by a network of charitable firms channelling profits into worthy causes. But the divide between rich and poor remains. Sir Mark Tully, the respected former BBC Delhi bureau chief, says that while absolute poverty levels have come down in recent years, huge concerns remain over the yawning wealth divide: &quot;There are some very rich people indeed, but the vast number of people are struggling. There is great concern that the gap between the rich and the poor is not narrowing fast enough, and that&apos;s why India&apos;s premier, Manmohan Singh, talks about inclusive growth.&quot; Critics are also exercised by the \u00a0virtually uncircumscribed power the financial elite wield both in industrial and political circles. Leading businessmen (they are almost always men) can change rulings in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India&apos;s parliament, almost at will. Allegations of corruption are repeatedly aimed at the police, the judiciary and professional sport \u2013 witness the controversies surrounding Lalit Modi, a top cricket official and creator of the hugely popular Indian Premier League, and the sale of 3G telecom licences. Many worry about a backlash against the extremely wealthy and their activities. In recent years, riots in areas such as West Bengal highlight the level of public anger felt at the appropriation of agricultural land for factories, real estate and shopping malls. On 5 April, writing in the Indian newspaper DNA, activist-artist Mallika Sarabhai lambasted the government for failing to crack down on corruption and collusion, asking the pointed question: &quot;Who will fight the robber barons pillaging India?&quot; A plethora of protectionist rules \u2013 many established by the political elite and reinforced by business moguls \u2013 makes it difficult if not impossible for foreign companies to do business on a serious scale in India. Lord Desai, the Gujarat-born British economist and Labour peer, highlights the difficulties facing any foreign business: &quot;India&apos;s political elite is still very xenophobic \u2013 they still look back to colonisation and the imperial past. They don&apos;t want foreign businesses to come in, and local businessmen gain from having these obstacles put in place.&quot; The occasional global player, such as Vodafone and IBM, makes it through the net, but most are stopped at the gates. Tesco boasts a huge presence in many Asian markets \u2013 notably China, where it is growing in leaps and bounds \u2013 but has struggled to get its local joint venture off the ground in rural India. Foreign corporations are constantly stymied by nebulous regulations that favour local interests. Contract talks can open and close any number of times before anything gets done, while most laws are only semi-developed. &quot;The laws on foreign investment are improving,&quot; notes Desai, &quot;but it would help everyone if India would clarify its business laws a bit better. It will take a long time before India gets anywhere close to the likes of the UK, with its transparency and sense of playing by the rules.&quot; In its 2010 Ease of Doing Business report, the World Bank ranked India 133rd out of 183 nations. The UK ranked fifth, behind only Singapore, New Zealand, Hong Kong and the United States. In terms of enforcing contracts, India ranks bottom of every country in the world bar tiny East Timor. Such statistics rarely bother the country&apos;s comfortable political classes, let alone a financial community that continues to reap vast profits from a fast growing and largely closed economy \u2013 whether in mobile telecoms, steel, shipping, energy or power. Or, in the case of the Ruia family and many of their billionaire peers, all of the above."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/11/singapore-sand-imports-global-witness", "sentences": ["Singapore, which prides itself on being one of the most environmentally friendly nations in Asia, is expanding its coastline with irresponsibly dredged sand from Cambodia, according to a report from an environmental NGO.", "The report, Shifting Sand: how Singapore&apos;s demand for Cambodian sand threatens ecosystems and undermines good governance, reveals that much of the demand is from Singapore, a small island state with big ambitions to increase its territory.", "Cargo manifests and photographs in the report suggest Singapore imported 14.2m tonnes of sand worth $273m (\u00a3184m) in 2008 from Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia.", "After local media reported the shrinkage of several islands in Indonesia, the government there banned sales of sand to Singapore in 2008.", "The NGO estimates a single Cambodian province - Koh Kong - has an annual trade with Singapore worth $248m (\u00a3168m).", "A tonne of sand, which costs $3 (\u00a32) per tonne to extract, can be sold for $26 (\u00a318) per tonne in Singapore.", "The government of Singapore, which will this summer host the World Cities Summit - focusing on sustainability - denies any wrongdoing.", "However, Singapore will continue to play its part to ensure that sand is extracted in a legal and environmentally responsible manner,&quot; noted a statement by the Ministry of National Development."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-11T11:01:58Z", "title": "Singapore sand imports threaten Cambodian ecosystem, report warns", "tags": ["Endangered habitats", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "Marine life", "Environment", "Cambodia", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Singapore, which prides itself on being one of the most environmentally friendly nations in Asia, is expanding its coastline with irresponsibly dredged sand from Cambodia, according to a report from an environmental NGO. Global Witness says the lucrative sand trade devastates ecosystems, lacks regulatory oversight and enriches traders at the expense of local fishermen. The report, Shifting Sand: how Singapore&apos;s demand for Cambodian sand threatens ecosystems and undermines good governance, reveals that much of the demand is from Singapore, a small island state with big ambitions to increase its territory. The city state of 4.9 million people has expanded its surface area from 582 sq km in the 1960s, to 710 sq km in 2008, an increase of 22%, and it has ambitious plans to reclaim further land from the sea. This requires far more sand than the island is able to provide for itself, prompting suppliers and middlemen to dredge and buy overseas. Cargo manifests and photographs in the report suggest Singapore imported 14.2m tonnes of sand worth $273m (\u00a3184m) in 2008 from Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia. Its sourcing has reportedly expanded recently to Burma, the Philippines and Bangladesh. The lucrative trade has alarmed neighbouring nations, which have seen chunks of their land being shipped off. After local media reported the shrinkage of several islands in Indonesia, the government there banned sales of sand to Singapore in 2008. Malaysia and Vietnam have imposed similar controls. After the trade moved to Cambodia, the prime minister, Hun Sen, announced last May that his country too would restrict exports of sand. But Global Witness says coastal dredging operations have increased in the year since. The NGO estimates a single Cambodian province - Koh Kong - has an annual trade with Singapore worth $248m (\u00a3168m). On a single day, the NGO says its investigators have seen nine dredgers inside a single protected area - the Peam Krasop wildlife sanctuary and Koh Kapik Ramsar site. The dredging operations threaten mangrove swamps, coral reefs and the biggest seagrass bed in the South China Sea, which is home to several rare species including the Irrawaddy dolphin, dugong and seahorses, it said. Local communities have reported a sharp fall in fish stocks and crab harvests. The Cambodian government has denied any link with dredging operations. In Cambodia, at least 14 firms have been given dredging licenses. A tonne of sand, which costs $3 (\u00a32) per tonne to extract, can be sold for $26 (\u00a318) per tonne in Singapore. It is unclear how much of the revenues are returned to the people in the form of taxes. &quot;Cambodia&apos;s natural resource wealth should be lifting its population out of poverty. Instead, international aid has propped up basic services in Cambodia for over 15 years. Meanwhile, money from natural resources disappears into private bank accounts, and nearly 70% of the population subsists on less than $2 a day,&quot; said George Boden, campaigner at Global Witness. The government of Singapore, which will this summer host the World Cities Summit - focusing on sustainability - denies any wrongdoing. It says the import of sand for reclamation is done on a commercial basis with safeguards for the environment. &quot;The policing and enforcement of sand extraction licences is ultimately the responsibility of the source country. However, Singapore will continue to play its part to ensure that sand is extracted in a legal and environmentally responsible manner,&quot; noted a statement by the Ministry of National Development. &quot;We have not received any official notice on the ban of sand exports from Cambodia.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/13/top-10-incarceration-stories-lesley-glaister", "sentences": ["Like my own father, Lomax was captured in Singapore by the Japanese army in 1942 and assigned to a prison camp, where he suffered years of filth, vermin, starvation, disease and the brutality of the prison guards."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-13T14:38:32Z", "title": "Lesley Glaister's top 10 books about incarceration", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Biography", "Children and teenagers", "Stephen King", "Teen books"], "article": "The award-winning Lesley Glaister was &quot;discovered&quot; by Booker prize winner Hilary Mantel while taking a creative writing course in 1989; Mantel was so impressed with her writing that she recommended Glaister to a literary agent. Now the author of 13 novels, her first, Honour Thy Father, won both the Betty Trask and Somerset Maugham prizes; her latest, Chosen, delves into the world of religious cults as Dodie tries to rescue her brother Seth from the mysterious Soul Life Centre. &quot;There seems to be a natural link between incarceration and story telling. A person forcibly removed from the comfort and distractions of the familiar, and shut up in a cell (or hospital, hostage situation, madman&apos;s cellar or the prison of their own failing body) will be forced to travel inwards to the place where memories twist and loop and spin themselves into story. Incarceration may be a primal human dread, but it also has its fascination, even a peculiar attraction. Freedom may be taken away but with it responsibility, and perhaps deep within our psyches there&apos;s an urge to be contained? I don&apos;t know, but for whatever reason, writers are very often drawn to explore the experiences of characters challenged by this particular conflict \u2013 whether or not they have suffered it themselves. And I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not the only law-abiding writer who has occasionally wondered whether a short prison sentence might provide just the necessary discipline to finish that novel...&quot; 1. Rumpelstiltskin (originally collected by the Brothers Grimm) Fairy stories are full of people being locked up, needing to be rescued or, more satisfyingly, to find the magic key for their own escape. In this strange story a miller&apos;s daughter is imprisoned by the king, after her father has told the boastful lie that she can spin gold from straw. She&apos;s helped by a dwarf to complete the magical task but, in return, she must promise the dwarf her first-born child. Once she&apos;s married to the king and expecting a baby she begs to be released from her side of the bargain. The dwarf agrees \u2013 on the condition that she guess his name. By trickery \u2013 not magic \u2013 she does this, which so amazes and enrages Rumpelstiltskin that he stamps hard enough on the ground to split it open, falls into the chasm and is never seen again. Oddly, as a child, my sympathies were with him. 2. Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb Like many children, I found the idea of being an orphan extremely appealing and identified to a ridiculous degree with poor orphaned Jane Eyre, who as a child is bullied by her cousin until she retaliates. Her punishment for this is to be locked into the &quot;red-room&quot; in which her uncle, Mr Reed, recently died. She tries to be brave, but as it gets dark thinks she sees her uncle&apos;s ghost, panics, screams and faints. (And, of course, as an adult, Jane is brought into opposition with another incarcerated female, the tragic and frightening Bertha, Rochester&apos;s first \u2013 mad \u2013 wife, secretly imprisoned in the attic.) 3. I Capture The Castle by Dodie Smith The teenage narrator of this perfect book is desperate for her father Mortmain, a one-time experimental novelist with terrible writer&apos;s block, to begin writing again \u2013 for the sake of his sanity as well as the family coffers. She hatches a plan to lock him into the dungeon of their castle home, and, with the help of her brother, traps him there in a sort of enforced writer&apos;s retreat. The place is stocked with reams of fresh stationery, and delicious food, wine and cigars are lowered down at intervals. At first Mortmain rages and tries to trick his way out \u2013 but by the time he&apos;s rescued by his wife, the incarceration has worked and he&apos;s successfully embarked upon another strange, eccentric work. (Will somebody please do this to me?) 4. Misery by Stephen King There&apos;s a less appealing version of the enforced writer&apos;s retreat in this terrifying novel \u2013 terrifying particularly, perhaps, for a writer. In a remote part of Maine, a popular novelist crashes his car and his life is saved by a mad fan. She&apos;s mortified to discover that he&apos;s killed off Misery, her favourite character, and keeps him prisoner, insisting that he write a novel resurrecting Misery. She&apos;s the most fanatically particular and violent editor/jailer one can imagine. It&apos;s an intense book, with just these two central characters locked in a close and claustrophobic tangle of mind-games, combat and downright gruesome nastiness. 5. The Collector by John Fowles Frederick, a butterfly collector, decides to augment his collection with Miranda, a beautiful young art student. The novel is brilliantly structured so that first of all the reader experiences the &quot;collection&quot; \u2013 the capture and imprisonment of Miranda from Frederick&apos;s point of view. His almost heroic self-delusion as he goes about trying to win her love and trust makes for excruciating reading. The second part of the book switches to Miranda&apos;s narrative, in the form of the diary she&apos;s kept secretly during her ordeal in Frederick&apos;s basement. And in the last section, we&apos;re back with Frederick again as he makes us aware of Miranda&apos;s fate and prepares for the capture of another specimen. This adds up to a truly chilling and horribly plausible story. 6. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by Jean-Dominique Bauby Most people find it hard enough to write a book at all, but this one was written against extraordinary odds by Bauby, former editor-in chief of Elle magazine, after he suffered a stroke which left him comatose. Twenty days later, he regained consciousness to find himself entirely paralysed, except for the ability to blink his eyes. This condition is known as locked-in syndrome \u2013 the most frighteningly complete manner of incarceration I can imagine. Amazingly, by laboriously blinking his left eyelid to indicate letters of the alphabet, Bauby managed to &quot;write&quot; his devastatingly elegant and moving memoir. Each word took him an average of two minutes to spell out, and the whole process over ten months \u2013 truly a triumph of the human spirit and enough to make anyone complaining of writer&apos;s block ashamed. 7. Awakenings by Oliver Sacks Another example of physiological incarceration, this time caused by an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica \u2013 sleeping sickness \u2013 in the 1920&apos;s. Oliver Sacks tells the story of some of these &quot;locked in&quot; patients, who were studied and cared for in a small hospital in the Bronx. In 1969, it was discovered \u2013 almost by chance \u2013 that treatment with L-DOPA would reawaken the sufferers, and it&apos;s wonderfully moving to see them warm and thaw and regain movement and personality. However, the effect proves not to be permanent and these poor people, having experienced a brief period of freedom, gradually become locked in again. 8. Faces in the Water by Janet Frame Janet Frame spent eight years of her life in prison having been wrongly diagnosed as a schizophrenic, and true to her calling as a writer transformed her ordeal into a powerful novel. This gives us a visceral insight into the feelings of being mad, terrified, humiliated, and zombified by drugs and electric shock treatment. Frame&apos;s main character, Estina, both refuses to and is unable to behave &quot;normally&quot;, and thus is scheduled for the ultimate treatment (or punishment) \u2013 a lobotomy. Fiction comes to Estina&apos;s rescue (just as it did Frame&apos;s own) when one perceptive doctor discovers her talent for writing and she is released, with her lobes entire, back into the world. 9. The Railway Man by Eric Lomax My childhood was dominated by the tension surrounding a silence, only subsequently recognised as a sort of smothered trauma \u2013 that of my father&apos;s never spoken about experience as a POW in Burma. It was only when I came to research my own novel, Easy Peasy, that I was brought face to face with some of what he must have suffered. Central to my research was Eric Lomax&apos;s book The Railway Man. Like my own father, Lomax was captured in Singapore by the Japanese army in 1942 and assigned to a prison camp, where he suffered years of filth, vermin, starvation, disease and the brutality of the prison guards. The men were forced to toil naked in the sun, and to endure beatings, torture and the agony of seeing their mates perish around them. Movingly, this book ends on an optimistic note as, half a century later, Lomax meets and is able to shake hands with a young Japanese interpreter who had been present at his torture, and is now a contrite and dedicated anti-war campaigner. 10. One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn This list would not be complete without the inclusion of this great classic of prison writing. As a warm, well-fed child (and before I knew anything about my father&apos;s own terrible experience) I got a masochistic thrill from reading this, and imagined myself subjected to main character Shukov&apos;s deprivations. Because the treatment in the freezing gulag was so extremely cruel, the work so terribly hard, there&apos;s an intense, visceral pleasure in reading about the scraps of food, warmth and kindness Shukov manages to glean in just one day of the 3,653 that he has yet to endure. Strikingly, with his existence pared down to a few simple needs \u2013 warmth, a bit of sausage, a kind word \u2013 and having to some extent fulfilled these needs, Shukov ends the day feeling almost happy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/15/labour-ministers-head-for-city", "sentences": ["But he may be enticed back, part-time, to work with the government of Singapore to which he has been an adviser in the past."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-15T08:18:36Z", "title": "Labour ministers and advisers head for the City", "tags": ["Labour", "Business", "Politics"], "article": "Several high-profile former government ministers and advisers are on the hunt for new and probably lucrative jobs. Speculation focuses on Lord Myners, Labour&apos;s City minister, a former chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer and Guardian Media Group. His pledge to study theology after his bruising ride at the Treasury is unlikely to occupy the energetic businessman full time. He may find it difficult to take a role in another public company after his stinging assaults on the City. But he may be enticed back, part-time, to work with the government of Singapore to which he has been an adviser in the past. There were 25 special advisers working around the prime minister and 50 or so working for other departments, earning up to \u00a3142,000. While some like Myners worked for no pay, others had three months notice and redundancy pay to tide them over while they seek new jobs. Many past special advisers have moved on to frontline roles in politics \u2013 including Ed and David Miliband, Andy Burnham and Ed Balls \u2013 but with Labour now in opposition, many could face a long wait for a parliamentary seat. Some will head off to thinktanks, but others will be looking for well-paid jobs in the corporate sector, often in PR or communications. Anji Hunter, Tony Blair&apos;s former private secretary, quit for a \u00a3200,000-a-year salary at BP, while Tim Allan, another former Blair adviser, went to work for Rupert Murdoch&apos;s BSkyB before starting his own PR consultancy. Jim Godfrey, Patricia Hewitt&apos;s adviser at the Department of Trade and Industry, went to ITV as communications supremo before starting his own advisory business, and more recently Sarah Schaefer, a foreign office special adviser to David Miliband, left to become &quot;sustainability and science communications director&quot; at Mars. One former special adviser said they are unlikely to be short of job offers. &quot;It is a really good thing to have on your CV, because you have worked at a very senior level in a government department, taking a lot of responsibility and dealing with strategy, media, and marketing&quot;. Working for a Labour government, he said, was certainly no barrier to joining corporate life. &quot;It is not about what side you are on, it is about understanding the system, knowing when, how and where decisions and made. Only 5%-10% of the role is about contacts&quot;. A senior City PR man, with a client list of FTSE-100 companies, said the special advisers&apos; &quot;experience and relationships with civil servants could be helpful&quot;, but he admitted he was &quot;suspicious of those who tout their contacts or took the job as a smart career step&quot;. Among those tipped for greater things are Stewart Wood and Gavin Kelly \u2013 the No 10 foreign policy adviser and deputy chief of staff who were at the centre of the Gordon Brown bullying allegations earlier this year. Wood is an Oxford don, whose areas of expertise are European policy, US links and the creative industries. &quot;He would be a great asset to any business&quot;, said a former colleague. &quot;Companies will be lining up for him&quot;. Kelly worked at the Institute for Public Policy Research before Whitehall. Geoffrey Spence, a former banker at HSBC and Deutsche, played a key role in the government&apos;s policy on banks but could still return to City life.

Analysts value the company at \u20ac45bn. Proceeds from a flotation will be used to expand the mining side of Glencore&apos;s business, with the Swiss-based company looking at acquisitions in Brazil, Australia and South Africa. Glencore took the first step towards becoming a public company recently by issuing up to $2.2bn (\u00a31.5bn) in convertible bonds to strategic investors in the US, Singapore and China. &quot;The mix of investors is typical of what you would expect in a pre-initial public offering&quot;, a commodities banker said. Glencore said that the bonds were convertible &quot;into Glencore shares upon a qualifying IPO or upon other pre-determined qualifying events&quot;. A flotation is pencilled in for 2011, but could come earlier if the economic recovery gathers steam and prices continue their upward trajectory. The company dwarfs its rivals in terms of size and the number of raw materials it trades. It also owns a variety of mining assets and companies. The value of its 34.5% stake in Xstrata has risen from \u00a32.2bn to \u00a312bn in 18 months. Glencore&apos;s increasing openness further moves it away from its roots under Marc Rich, the oil trader who founded Glencore in 1974 but later sold out to management. In 1983, Rudolph Giuliani, then a US prosecutor, indicted Rich for tax evasion and he became a fugitive in Switzerland. On leaving office in 2001, President Bill Clinton pardoned Rich. Some observers suggest preparation for a flotation is the precursor to a merger with Xstrata [see footnote], which could create a natural resources group valued at more than $50bn. Sources say that the merger option is the preferred route for Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore&apos;s chief executive, and there have been reports that executives have met Xstrata shareholders. A merger of Glencore and Xstrata is being seen as the best way for Glencore to go public, because the companies are connected. Glencore owns a significant number of Xstrata shares. Willy Strothotte is chairman of both companies. And Glencore was instrumental in creating Xstrata: in 2001 it sold coal assets to the then-fledgling mining company and those assets became Xstrata&apos;s bedrock for its 2002 flotation. &quot;Glasenberg would love to have all the mining assets and the trading assets combined under one roof,&quot; said an executive familiar with Glencore&apos;s thinking. Xstrata boss Mick Davis could be receptive. He built his company through a string of acquisitions, but his boldest bid \u2013 to merge Xstrata with Anglo American \u2013 failed last year. In a recent speech Davis reiterated Xstrata&apos;s &quot;commitment to scale and diversity as key sources of advantage in an increasingly globalising and consolidating mining industry.&quot; But agreeing a valuation of Glencore with Xstrata investors could prove tricky and may force Glencore to float first before considering anything else. An extra benefit of such a move, say observers, would be that it would force the trader to adapt to an independent board and other aspects of public corporate governance. This could lessen the culture shock of merging with a FTSE 100 company. Glencore is seeking a flotation because, as a private company led by a partnership, its growth options are few. Relying on the bond markets limits its ability to make big acquisitions. If it could raise equity on the stock market, the company could expand more rapidly and take much bigger strides along the way. It is thought that Glencore is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, while Xstrata has retained Goldman Sachs [see footnote]. \u2022 This footnote was added on 19 May 2010: Goldman Sachs has asked us to make clear that they have not been mandated by Xstrata for a potential merger with Glencore."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/may/17/universities-must-set-fees-russell-group", "sentences": ["But even in these circumstances, increased funding from the individual and their family will be unavoidable if standards are to be maintained.&quot; Piatt said that while the UK was cutting university budgets by more than \u00a31bn by 2013, China, South Korea and Singapore were increasing their public investment in higher education."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-17T13:19:49Z", "title": "Let universities set their own fees, Russell Group demands", "tags": ["University funding", "Higher education", "Education", "Student finance", "Education policy", "Politics", "Graduation", "UK news", "Borrowing & debt", "Money"], "article": "The UK&apos;s leading universities warned today that unless they are allowed to set their own fees for undergraduate courses, they will lose their world-class reputations.

Students and academics condemned the proposals as &quot;the most regressive piece of education policy since the second world war&quot; and said they would saddle future students with &quot;mortgage-style debts of more than \u00a340,000&quot;. In its submission to the review on student finance \u2013 led by the former chief executive of BP, Lord Browne \u2013 the Russell Group said it recognised that the cap on fees could not be removed immediately. Fees should increase incrementally, Wendy Piatt, its director-general said, but she would not say by how much they should rise. Degrees in law should receive little public subsidy, while high-cost subjects considered of strategic importance to the country, such as medicine and science, should receive more in state funds and cost students less, the Russell Group advised. It did not specify how much universities should charge. The group said that if graduates were asked to pay steeper fees, they would value their degrees more highly and be careful about and committed to the choices they made. It denied that students from poor families would be deterred from applying to university. Research has shown that graduates earn between 20% and 25% more than non-graduates over their lifetimes \u2013 the equivalent of about \u00a3160,000, the Russell Group said. On top of this, graduates from Russell Group universities earn on average \u00a33,000 more per year than other graduates and have greater job satisfaction. The taxpayer continues to foot the majority of the costs of undergraduate degrees and this is unfair, the group said. Piatt said: &quot;Graduate contributions should be increased to better reflect the considerable private benefits which graduates gain from higher education. Evidence shows that when people are asked to contribute even a nominal amount towards the cost of a service, they tend to value that service more highly.&quot; She added that the introduction of fees in 2006 had improved access to universities, because students could apply for loans, bursaries and scholarships to see them through their courses. The richest students could be asked to pay their tuition fees at the start of their courses, rather than when they graduate, the group suggested. Higher fees are the only answer, it said, because extra funds from charities, business, alumni and other sources will be insufficient to meet the &quot;severe challenges facing universities&quot;. &quot;It takes time to build up endowments and alumni relations, and a significant increase in income from these sources will require a sustained effort over a number of years. It is also more difficult to increase philanthropy during an economic downturn\u2026 &quot;Despite significantly increasing their level of engagement with business, funding from the private sector remains a relatively small proportion of university income and would not be sufficient to form a major part of the solution to the funding shortfall.&quot; In its submission to the Browne review, Cambridge University warned that current fees are too low for it to remain world-leading. This has led to an over-reliance on income from overseas students, who pay more than UK students. The Browne review should recomment that the cap on fees is raised or removed. However, students should be compensated with extra information about courses and a greater commitment by universities to help the poorest students to study. Cambridge said the difference between what it cost to teach an undergraduate and what it received amounted to a \u00a39,000 shortfall per undergraduate per year. Its said: &quot;The gap would, inevitably, widen should there be a further decline in government support for higher education. This argues strongly for maintaining the real value of the government component in the future. But even in these circumstances, increased funding from the individual and their family will be unavoidable if standards are to be maintained.&quot; Piatt said that while the UK was cutting university budgets by more than \u00a31bn by 2013, China, South Korea and Singapore were increasing their public investment in higher education. &quot;As the global economic gravity shifts to the east, these \u2013 and other \u2013 countries will increasingly be key competitors for the UK in attracting the very best students and academic talent from around the world.&quot; The University and College Union said lifting the cap on fees would be &quot;the most regressive piece of education policy since the second world war&quot;. The union&apos;s general secretary, Sally Hunt, said it was time for business to make a &quot;fair contribution&quot;. Aaron Porter, the president-elect of the National Union of Students, said removing the cap would leave students with &quot;mortgage-style&quot; debts of \u00a340,000 and &quot;expose students and their families to the huge risks and potential calamities of the market, abandoning them to sink or swim&quot;. Since fees were introduced in 2006, they have more than trebled. The Browne review will report in the next few months."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/17/pru-record-cash-call-gets-lukewarm-reception", "sentences": ["&quot;I think they supposedly have backers in Asia, particularly the government of Singapore, but I think it&apos;s still going to be a difficult deal to execute,&quot; Cumming said."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-17T20:01:00Z", "title": "Pru chief embarks on \u00a314.5bn hard sell", "tags": ["Prudential", "Insurance industry", "Rights issues", "Tidjane Thiam", "Business", "UK news", "Shares", "Investments", "Banks and building societies", "Money"], "article": "Prudential&apos;s chief executive Tidjane Thiam has just three weeks to persuade &quot;sceptical&quot; City investors to back the \u00a314.5bn cash call the insurer needs to take over Asian rival AIA. It would be the biggest fundraising undertaken on the London market. Thiam refused on three occasions to concede he could face pressure to resign if investors failed to endorse the transaction at a shareholder meeting on 7 June, while chairman Harvey McGrath would only say:&quot;We will take a view as and when it unfolds.&quot; Asked if the vote would be regarded as a confidence motion for Thiam, McGrath replied: &quot;We see it as a vote of confidence in the deal&quot;. In an attempt to win over shareholders, the Pru has persuaded the banks underwriting the deal to share a greater proportion of their \u00a3430m fees with the big City investors that act as sub-underwriters. Major investors would usually receive 1.75% of the shares they are guaranteeing to buy as a fee but this had been increased to 2% \u2013 an &quot;unprecedented&quot; level according to the insurer, which needs 75% of shareholders to vote for the transaction. After a 12 day delay caused by concerns being raised by the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, Thiam made a detailed presentation to investors and analysts today to show them the &quot;unique&quot; deal would transform the Pru in the coming decade. The Pru promises it will generate revenue synergies of $800m and cost synergies of $370m during 2013 and aims to more than double the new business profit in its Asian arm to &quot;at least \u00a32.8bn in 2013&quot;. Hong Kong will generate more profit than the UK if the deal is completed and Thiam refused to rule out a sale of the UK arm at a later stage. The enlarged company could be worth $60bn in three years, he said. David Cumming, head of UK equities at Standard Life Investment, told BBC&apos;s Today programme Prudential would have &quot;quite a lot of trouble raising that cash&quot;. &quot;I think they supposedly have backers in Asia, particularly the government of Singapore, but I think it&apos;s still going to be a difficult deal to execute,&quot; Cumming said. Despite the 12 day delay caused by the ongoing FSA negotiations, Thiam insisted he was confident shareholders would back the bid for the Asian business of the bailed out US insurance company AIG although the deal suffered a further setback tonight after the 1,000 page prospectus was not published before the market closed. The City regulator has demanded the Pru hold enough capital to withstand an instantaneous 20% fall in equity markets, followed by a further 20% fall over a four week period, interest rates slumping to zero and credit defaults of ten times the expected level. Pru shares fell 2.5% to 529.5p in early trading, one of the FTSE 100&apos;s biggest fallers, but regained some of their losses to close at 534.5p. The rights issue is priced at 104p a share and it will be made on the basis of 11 new shares for every two existing shares. This is a 39.3% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price based on the closing price of 542.5p on 14 May 2010 and an 80.8% discount to that closing price. City experts were divided on why the share price was so stable given the size of the cash call. Some suggested hedge funds were buying to enable them to participate in the sub underwriting while others reckoned it was because the deal would fail. Barry Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: &quot;It is very early to form a cast iron view but we believe that either the proposed deal will fail to achieve the required 75% hurdle rate and the shares will rebound or investors will take comfort from the improving economics and the shares will rally&quot;. Either way, the shares were a &quot;buy&quot;. To appease the FSA, Pru has revised the debt financing arrangements to include a facility for $5.4bn (\u00a33.65bn) of hybrid capital; put in a standby commitment from AIG to subscribe for up to $1.875bn of hybrid capital; and a contingent subordinated debt facility of \u00a31bn to enhance its capital in certain stress scenarios.

The late author would no doubt have been delighted to be given a similar platform today after his novel Troubles was chosen by the reading public as winner of the Lost Booker award. The story of an army major who travels to a decaying Irish hotel in 1919 to meet his rashly acquired fiancee, Troubles was one of six novels published in 1970 to be shortlisted for the Lost Booker, intended to reward books that were ineligible when they were published, thanks to a shift in the fledgling prize&apos;s schedule that year, which resulted in the exclusion of almost 12 months&apos; worth of novels from consideration. More than 4,000 readers worldwide cast votes for their favourite shortlisted novel, with Troubles taking 38% of the vote, more than double that of other contenders by Muriel Spark, Nina Bawden, Shirley Hazzard, Mary Renault and Patrick White. &quot;I&apos;m not at all surprised readers voted for Farrell \u2013 he&apos;s a very worthy winner,&quot; said ITN newsreader Katie Derham, who selected the shortlist with poet and novelist Tobias Hill and Observer journalist Rachel Cooke. &quot;He thrusts, chucks, throws you immediately into his world \u2026 Because he has this lightness of touch, as well as being bizarre and weird and dark, you get swept up in it. The three of us adored the book.&quot; Set in the Majestic hotel in fictional Kilnalough, County Wexford, Troubles sees Major Brendan Archer travelling to meet Angela, the fiancee he had acquired during an afternoon&apos;s leave. The engagement proves shortlived but the major remains in the hotel, hypnotised by its faded charms and ancient inhabitants, as the Irish war of independence is about to begin. &quot;From the first page you have this bizarre world painted for you of this decaying hotel, which is symbolic of the state of affairs in Northern Ireland,&quot; said Derham. &quot;It&apos;s metaphor built on metaphor built on metaphor \u2026 The tragic climax of the story comes when what&apos;s going on in the outside world finally impinges on this bubble of imperialist nonsense.&quot; The novel is the first in Farrell&apos;s Empire trilogy, which concludes with The Siege of Krishnapur \u2013 a story of the British in 1857 India on the brink of revolution, which beat Iris Murdoch to the Booker in 1973 \u2013 and The Singapore Grip, set in Singapore just before the Japanese invasion in the second world war. Farrell&apos;s last completed novel, The Singapore Grip, was published in 1978, a year before the 44-year-old author, known to friends as Jim, drowned in a fishing accident in Ireland. &quot;He died terribly young and there&apos;s a frisson when you think of what he might have gone on to write,&quot; said Derham. &quot;It would be fabulous to know what he&apos;d make of the collapse of empire now.&quot; Born in Liverpool in 1935, the author studied at Oxford University, contracting polio as a student (an experience which he drew on for his second novel, The Lung). He completed six novels, and was working on The Hill Station at the time of his death. Asked why he wrote about the past, Farrell said: &quot;History leaves so much out. It leaves out the most important thing: the detail of what being alive is like.&quot; Farrell&apos;s popularity means that Troubles has remained in print since it was first published \u2013 something which not all of the shortlisted Lost Booker titles have managed. All, though, have seen a boost in sales since the shortlist for the prize \u2013 the brainchild of literary agent Peter Straus \u2013 was announced. &quot;When you consider that some of these books were out of print a short time ago, the Lost Booker has had a Lazarus-type effect on their sales \u2013 we&apos;re now selling them in their hundreds,&quot; said Waterstone&apos;s fiction buyer, Janine Cook. &quot;It proves that a good book is a good book, someone just needs to be told about it.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/20/north-korea-naval-ship-report", "sentences": ["&quot;[Officials in Seoul] have a dilemma: they are really angry, but they are quite constrained,&quot; said Jing Huang, a north Asia security expert and visiting professor at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew School for Public Policy."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-20T15:43:00Z", "title": "North Korea threatens South over report on sinking of warship", "tags": ["South Korea", "North Korea", "World news"], "article": "Tensions between North and South Korea escalated dramatically today following the publication of an international report which concluded that a South Korean warship was sunk by a torpedo from a North Korean submarine in March. The report by civilian and military investigators, who worked with experts from countries including Britain, said there was &quot;no other plausible explanation&quot; for the sinking of the Cheonan, which caused the deaths of 46 sailors. But the findings prompt as many questions as they answer for Seoul, which has limited options in response. Pyongyang again denied involvement, dismissing the South&apos;s findings as a fabrication and threatening to wage &quot;all-out war&quot; if punished. Such hawkish comments are common in its disputes. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, vowed to take stern action against the North and the White House described the attack as an act of aggression that challenged international peace and security. The British foreign secretary, William Hague, said the UK and others would work closely with Seoul on an appropriate multilateral response. But China \u2013 North Korea&apos;s main ally and a permanent member of the security council \u2013 said it was still assessing the investigation results. Its vice foreign minister, Cui Tiankai, called the sinking &quot;unfortunate&quot; while a foreign ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, later urged all involved to show restraint to avoid escalating the situation. The 1,200-tonne corvette was patrolling the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea when it was hit by a massive blast late on 26 March. The disputed sea border had seen previous skirmishes, but the sinking was the South&apos;s worst military disaster since the end of the Korean war. Today, the inquiry report said that torpedo fragments from the site were compatible with a North Korean weapon recovered several years ago. Intelligence gathered with allies \u2013 the US, Britain and Australia \u2013 showed it was likely that Northern submarines were operating near the site, it added. &quot;We have reached the clear conclusion that [South Korea&apos;s] Cheonan was sunk as a result of an external underwater explosion ... The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine,&quot; the report said. But the North&apos;s powerful National Defence Commission condemned a &quot;conspiratorial farce&quot;, the state-run Korea Central News Agency reported, and threatened an &quot;unlimited retaliatory blow&quot; if the South conducted provocative acts near the border. &quot;[Officials in Seoul] have a dilemma: they are really angry, but they are quite constrained,&quot; said Jing Huang, a north Asia security expert and visiting professor at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew School for Public Policy. The New York Times said South Korea was expected to push next week for the case to be referred to the security council, with the US backing it &quot;strongly and unequivocally&quot;, citing Obama administration sources. But Huang said much would depend on whether Pyongyang escalated the situation through actions in the next few days, or stuck to bellicose rhetoric. Although China might sign up to a condemnatory statement it would be reluctant to back tough new measures \u2013 and it is not clear what could be added to already tightened sanctions. Beijing is anxious that destabilisation of its neighbour could risk a shift in the regional power balance and a flood of refugees. The US has also expended considerable energy on winning China&apos;s support for new sanctions against Iran. Even with regard to North Korea, experts say its main goal is denuclearisation. But Han Sung-joo, a former foreign minister for the South, said: &quot;With countries with which we work closely there are things that can be done to tighten security and increase pressure on North Korea.&quot;      Analysts predict the US and South Korea will step up joint military training, but no one believes the South would risk military action. &quot;The actual benefit would be minimal and the risks would be tremendous,&quot; said Han. Professor Hazel Smith, a North Korea expert at Cranfield University, said she did not believe Pyongyang ordered the torpedo strike. &quot;There is no mileage in it for them ... [and] it simply doesn&apos;t fit into any pattern,&quot; she said. &quot;The command and control lines are simply not functioning ... If it wasn&apos;t an accident \u2013 which it could be because [their hardware] is so decrepit \u2013 it could be some unit which was simply going its own way.&quot; Other analysts disagree, believing the country&apos;s strict hierarchy remains largely unchanged. Smith added: &quot;In the North Korea statements you get all the bluster, but they are also saying &apos;show us the evidence&apos;.&quot; That suggested that the leadership might be open to discussions on the issue. But neither Seoul nor Washington has the back channels to Pyongyang that previous administrations used, Smith said. The dispute is likely to dominate the US secretary of state Hillary Clinton&apos;s Asian tour, which will take her to Seoul next week. Japan, which also condemned the attack today, said the report&apos;s findings would make it hard to resume the stalled multilateral aid-for-denuclearisation discussions. The two Koreas never signed a peace treaty to end formally the 1950-53 war. Relations on the peninsula have often been fraught and deteriorated rapidly when Lee became president in Seoul in 2008 and ended his predecessor&apos;s policy of free-flowing aid."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/may/21/jg-farrell-troubles-lost-booker", "sentences": ["So did The Singapore Grip in 1978."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-21T11:07:58Z", "title": "Lost and found: why JG Farrell's Troubles deserved its belated Booker win hands-down | Sam Jordison", "tags": ["Lost Booker prize", "Booker prize", "Books", "Culture", "Fiction"], "article": "The best book won. JG Farrell&apos;s Troubles took more than twice as many votes as any other book on the shortlist for the Lost Booker prize \u2013 and quite right, too. That&apos;s not to deride the competition. The Vivisector, in particular, could give most recent Booker winners a serious run for their money. But it doesn&apos;t approach the wonder of Troubles. Farrell&apos;s portrayal of the fast-decaying Majestic Hotel and England&apos;s even more rapidly crumbling rule in Ireland surely adds up to one of the best books of the last half-century, let alone 1970. At the award ceremony in Fitzroy Square on Wednesday night, Lady Antonia Fraser (who judged the prize in 1970 and 1971 - and so helped select the winners from the shortlists either side of the &quot;lost&quot; year) declared Troubles one of her &quot;very favourite books&quot;. She spoke so highly of Farrell that it can only be assumed that. had the award not skipped a year, she would have voted for Troubles to win back in 1970, too. Everyone I questioned seemed to share her high opinion. The rival claims of the other books on the shortlist were barely mentioned. A few expressed relief that Muriel Spark&apos;s many fans hadn&apos;t voted for one of her weaker books as a matter of misguided faith. There also circulated a cheeky rumour that Farrell left his publisher Jonathan Cape because they were promoting The Vivisector at the expense of Troubles. The award, it was agreed, provided ample vindication for that decision. I&apos;ve never been at a literary gathering where there was such accord. Even so, it was interesting to speculate on the sponsors&apos; feelings. Anyone in the Man Booker Group with a long enough memory to remember JG Farrell&apos;s speech when he took the prize for The Siege of Krishnapur must still shudder. Back then, the author delivered some choice words relating to the Booker&apos;s past record in British colonies and pointedly remarked that he was going to use the money they had given him to research &quot;commercial exploitation&quot;. Now that Farrell is no longer with us (tragically, he drowned in 1979) the man representing Man Booker felt safe enough to trumpet Man Group&apos;s recent acquisition of fellow hedge fund GLG Partners for a cool $1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) and to affirm that his &quot;prestigious&quot; organisation thought the prize &quot;fits well with our values&quot;. What would the fiercely political Farrell have thought about that? Richard Farrell, who had the &quot;bittersweet pleasure&quot; of receiving the award on behalf of his brother, hinted that JG&apos;s opinion might have stung. But he did no more than hint. What he did say emphatically was that JG wouldn&apos;t have been at all surprised to have won. &quot;In his life, he expected his books to be read in 30 to 40 years&apos; time,&quot; he said. &quot;He was writing for the long term, and he thought Troubles was his best work.&quot; Farrell doesn&apos;t seem to have been burdened by false modesty in that regard \u2013 but then, why should he have been? He was right. Although, it&apos;s mainly thanks to the agency of an organisation he derided. Today, rightly enough, Richard Farrell was keen to emphasise &quot;how indebted I am&quot; to the Man Booker Group. &quot;One small way of diminishing the pain of losing John is seeing him widely read&quot;, he said. That readership would not have developed without the help of the Man Booker Group. Troubles had fine reviews in 1970. (Touchingly, Richard described how his family took the unanimous praise the book received as &quot;proof positive that John had triumphed over the adversity of polio&quot;.) So too did The Siege Of Krishnapur in 1973. So did The Singapore Grip in 1978. Their quality was never in doubt. Yet somehow the books had begun to slide into oblivion. They stayed in print, but had nothing like the readership they deserved. Speaking personally, I hadn&apos;t read The Siege of Krishnapur until it was included on the Best of Booker shortlist. Thousands of others have come to Troubles because of the Lost Booker prize. And so, something very special has been brought into our lives. Something rich, profound, angry, tragic and yet also always hilarious and deliriously entertaining. The work of a genius, in short. Their preservation is a great service to posterity.

David Cameron met German chancellor Angela Merkel today while Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, will present his proposals to overhaul the eurozone at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, the second this week. Berlin has tabled a nine-point plan rewriting the euro regime to include legally enshrined budget deficit ceilings in all 16 member countries. The German demands, in a finance ministry paper obtained by the Guardian, could require the EU&apos;s Lisbon treaty to be renegotiated. In what appeared to be a concession to her centre-left opposition, Merkel vowed yesterday to fight for a global tax on bank transactions at the G20 summit next month. Berlin has also proposed a radical shift in the rules governing the single currency by insisting struggling eurozone countries be allowed to restructure their debt. Sch\u00e4uble argues that that if the G20 effort fails Europe, or at least the eurozone, should go it alone. The wave of selling came amid growing fears that the Greek debt crisis could spread to other countries in Europe and trigger a spiral of losses for banks, endangering the still fragile global economic recovery. An unexpected increase in US unemployment yesterday added to the gloom. The crisis in the eurozone and Germany&apos;s shock decision to impose a unilateral ban on naked short-selling \u2013 a strategy designed to profit from falling markets \u2013 drove shares in London down to 5,000 yesterday for the first time since November.

The vase is just one of many ongoing projects in Gormley-world (it was offered as a charity auction prize at the ICA): he&apos;s off to Alaska to install his first US public commission, a 7.3-metre (24ft) tall, 17-tonne (37,000lb) figure made of stainless steel boxes, which will squat at the centre of Anchorage; then to Singapore to install another work, Drift, on Marina Bay Sands; then to Sydney, where a staff of 10 are installing Firmament, 1,030 steel balls linked into polygonal structures by more than 1,800 steel elements; finally, returning to London for the opening of a major show at the White Cube, which will include an evolution of a work first exhibited in 2006, Breathing Room. It&apos;s made of 15 interlocking space frames, each containing the same cubic metrres of space, the struts covered with photoluminescent paint, and for most of the time the room will be in darkness. The intent, says Gormley, is to &quot;destroy perspective, and certainly destroy the idea of a single Cartesian point of view. Traditionally Renaissance perspective has always privileged a single, monocular point of view, and within these 15 interleaving space frames there is certainly no one privileged point of view.&quot; Why would he want to do that? &quot;I\u00a0think,&quot; he begins, &quot;there are only two subjects \u2013 there&apos;s \u2026 there&apos;s space, or there&apos;s, if you like the human animal \u2026 and then the architecture \u2026 that ... we ... have built to contain . Our bodies \u2026 the show in White Cube is going to polarise \u2026&quot; A long pause. &quot;You&apos;d better come through.&quot; He leaps up and suddenly we&apos;re clattering down metal stairs on the outside of his David Chipperfield-designed studio complex in an industrial corner of King&apos;s Cross, London. There is a forecourt, where, in one corner, a mini Angel of the North lies on its back. There is his drawing studio, on one side, an open-plan office and kitchen on the other, and in the centre, the main sculpture studio, high and white and huge, ringing with the sound of motors, of metal on metal, occupied by suspended clouds of wire, life-size metal figures, and politely ironic-looking people in masks wielding blowtorches. Gormley goes straight for an assemblage of metal blocks. &quot;Oscar \u2013 can you help me turn this over?&quot; And then, to me, &quot;Can you see what&apos;s there? It&apos;s a recumbent body \u2013 can you see it? There&apos;s the bum, there&apos;s the head, there are the feet. It turns into this sort of cityscape. We&apos;re doing that a lot \u2013 that&apos;s what&apos;s happening in other work here,&quot; \u2013 he points to a standing figure, made of squared-off iron blocks\u00a0\u2013 &quot;turning the space of the body into a high rise with four pillars and then loads of little [sections] that interconnect.&quot;\u00a0It looks like a\u00a0very skilful game of Jenga. The preoccupation with architecture, with interlocking squares and pillars \u2013 and the architecture of atoms echoed in works like Firmament \u2013 may be relatively recent, but bodies, it is not original to note, have been at the centre of Gormley&apos;s work ever since, in a bid to escape his high-achieving family&apos;s expectations, he took the hippie trail through India. (His father, a\u00a0pharmaceuticals magnate who worked with Alexander Fleming, was &quot;very controlling, very ambitious, and I think that&apos;s marked all of us, really. There was a sense that whatever one did one wasn&apos;t quite good enough, whether that was declining Latin verbs or excelling at sport.&quot;) In India he noticed how people would often sleep in public, curled up and covered by a light shawl. Vulnerable and veiled, trusting yet closed to the world, &quot;they carry in seed,&quot; he has said, &quot;everything that has happened since&quot; \u2013 Bed, 1981, a double bed made of bread out of which he ate his own body shape and weight; Mould (also 1981), the first work made by body-casting, with the help of his wife (he would go on to use the process several times); the first angel, in 1989; bodies crouched, bodies kneeling, bodies suspended from ceilings and crammed into the corners of rooms; tens of thousands of bodies \u2013 not his, and made of clay, not metal \u2013 in Field, the work that took him from respected but isolated and somewhat frustrated artist to the 1994 Turner prize and the beginnings of global fame. When we met, his plan for a work at the site of the 2012 Olympics had just lost out to Anish Kapoor&apos;s Orbit, and although he had refused to comment to the papers, he is still furious about how his bid was portrayed, as &quot;a 390ft naked statue of himself to tower over the London Olympics \u2026 The public would have entered Gormley&apos;s &apos;body&apos; through his feet and scaled the structure inside to reach a viewing deck in the head.&quot; He says they never actually saw his plans \u2013 their sketch &quot;looked nothing like it&quot; \u2013 and &quot;it&apos;s quite hurtful&quot;. His face is flushed, and he is hunched almost completely over the table, head in hands that almost seem to be pressing his skull lower down. &quot;[If I had the time and inclination] I&apos;d do something about it. Sue them for defamation or something.&quot; It couldn&apos;t have helped that critics such as Brian Sewell were wheeled out to say things like, &quot;I find it rather ludicrous that a man approaching later middle age can think of nothing more than his own body as symbolising this, that and the other. If he were given a commission by the Church of England, heaven forbid, he would be Jesus.&quot; It&apos;s an old refrain, Gormley knows, whether &quot;me using my body is an act of gross narcissism and megalomania, or actually something that is fundamental to the effect of the work \u2013 and obviously I\u00a0believe the latter, that it is. I stumbled across this way of working because I\u00a0discovered that it was the most direct route between something called life and something called art, for me \u2026 it&apos;s about a truth. It&apos;s about the fact that what I am asking people to share is something that derives from a lived moment. Something that really happened. I&apos;m afraid that that is my offer to the world. For better or worse, it&apos;s my wager.&quot; Increasingly, the bodies can be found outdoors, as in the 100 figures gazing seawards in Another Place, made in 1995 for mud flats at Cuxhaven, Germany, and now permanently installed at Crosby Beach; or the living bodies occupying the fourth plinth at Trafalgar square in One &amp; Other; or the 31 figures, again life-size and naked, in Event Horizon (2007) \u2014 placed on London rooftops and bridges, and then in New York, where, he says, like a pleased Eeyore, &quot;we have to thank the police department for doing an incredibly good advertising campaign on our behalf \u2013 everybody had to come and check it out as a result of being told that they couldn&apos;t ring the emergency services [because they thought the figures might be about to jump to their deaths].&quot; Gormley believes, firmly, in public art. &quot;It&apos;s a wonderful thing to make work that is unadorned either by context, framing or label, that can exist in the changing conditions of light, weather, wind. It&apos;s only in the last 150 years perhaps that we have begun to pre-programme ourselves and go to these special places to experience art.&quot; The corollary to the latter is that &quot;public art&quot; is often not a particularly complimentary term \u2013 Gormley has inveighed against the fact that &quot;a lot of public art is just a kind of garnish \u2013 an attempt to humanise a bleak real-estate development.&quot; &quot;It usually indicates compromise on both sides,&quot; he says now. &quot;But that doesn&apos;t mean to say that making a work that can exist in collective space and be collectively engaged with cannot be the highest aspiration. I mean it&apos;s just very, very curious, culturally, that we should have arrived at a point where works that aspire to be part of collective life are compromised and despised.&quot; Works which are popular, too. More than 150,000 people a year visit the Angel of the North (not to mention the 90,000 who pass it each day on the A1); Another Place is a permanent installation because people were so moved by it they didn&apos;t want the figures to leave. There has been some quite visceral reaction to his ubiquity, famously, for instance, from this paper&apos;s art critic (and former Turner prize judge) Jonathan Jones, who said of Gormley that he &quot;dominates and squats on British art like a lead toad.&quot; I approach the topic obliquely, but Gormley knows exactly where we&apos;re going. &quot;I think there&apos;s an incredible snobbism, that says, &apos;Oh well, people like it, so it must be second-rate&apos;,&quot; he says, immediately, confrontational and defensive. &quot;Not that people don&apos;t dislike it just as much as they like it. There&apos;s somehow an idea that \u2026 maybe it&apos;s a combination of working from casts of one&apos;s own body and the fact that they are often placed outside \u2013 it&apos;s a kind of pandering to populism. The fact that my work has achieved some degree of popular support is a complete \u2026 it&apos;s ... it&apos;s \u2026 amazing to me. But in some sense it is a vindication that I am dealing with things that people recognise.&quot; If he has a complaint it is that &quot;if you do things, as it were, that naturally get on to the news, the levels of research and development that go behind it are often completely ignored.&quot; This, for some, is another source of dubiousness \u2013 the increasing reliance, in works like Breathing Room, on computer modelling, linear vectors, abstract physics. Aperture, a recent book about his work, includes an essay by the mathematical physicist Roger Penrose, and Gormley often makes a point of crediting Tristan Simmonds, a member of his 17-strong London team who helps him scan bodies digitally, &quot;and then use those scans as the basis for a kind of re-interpretation of the body space in terms of architecture&quot;. Increasingly his aim seems to be to draw viewers into person-shaped absences that make them more aware of themselves not as spectators, but as bodies in space; the risk is that in the process he can make work uncharacteristically inorganic and cold. Gormley, the seventh of seven children whose initials, AMDG, stand for Ad maiorem dei gloriam (for the greater glory of God), has never made a secret of the severe spirituality of his London childhood \u2013 the kneeling to prayer at bedtime, the mass-going, the palpable sense of good and evil. &quot;I did spend a lot of time as a child very confused about whether I had a devil in me, or whether I was in a state of grace. I mean, these ideas are so potent to anybody with half an imagination.&quot; He no longer believes in God, but he does describe one aspect of Breathing Room in damascene terms: in New York, where it was last seen, &quot;there were people lying on the floor, very chilled out, going into dreamy, touchy-feely spaces, and then suddenly the lights go on and everything is revealed.&quot; He still likes to go into churches &quot;because they seem to be \u2013 well, usually they&apos;re empty, which is a rather wonderful thing, so you can just be in the space for the sake of being there. And those places that are in the world but also slightly not of it are quite precious.&quot; As a young man he abandoned Catholicism for Buddhism, and of the latter he retains a great appreciation that &quot;it isn&apos;t a religion \u2013 it&apos;s a way of life. Everything that I was brought up with was about the fate of my eternal soul, and whether it was going to go to heaven or to hell. And I think that does distance oneself from the real \u2013 well, the way things really are, which is that things change from moment to moment and the best we can hope for is to be responsive and responsible, from moment to moment. The idea that we own our bodies \u2013 that we call them &apos;my body&apos; \u2013 the realisation that that&apos;s an illusion is a really useful thing.&quot; It would not be too far-fetched to say that it seems the aim of his best work is to combine the two feelings \u2013 the sense of contemplative, even holy space, and the temporality of a body divorced from a sense of ownership. &quot;I&apos;m trying to make work that is reflective and is encouraging of reflection. I would say that the whole way that I have approached the body is as a\u00a0space not a thing \u2013 not an object to be improved, idealised or whatever, but simply to be dwelt in.&quot; Antony Gormley: Test Sites, White Cube, London, 4 June \u2013 10 July.

Investors were rattled by fears of war between North and South Korea, compounded by fresh worries about Europe&apos;s debt problems and the shaky euro. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones dropped more than 250 points in early trading, falling to 9816, a drop of 2.5%. The FTSE 100 index in London saw a heavy sell-off when trading began. It hit an eight-month low of 4898.49, a fall of 171 points or 3.3%, with every share losing value. Miners and banking stocks were the worst hit, with Lloyds Banking Group losing 8.5% to 50.7p, and Royal Bank of Scotland down 7.7% to 41.8p The slump in banking stocks follows fears that Spain will become the next victim of the European financial crisis. Last night the International Monetary Fund urged the Spanish government to reform its banking sector and its &quot;dysfunctional&quot; labour market. The news today that the UK economy had grown by 0.3% in the first three months of 2010, more than previously estimated, failed to improve spirits in the City. The FTSE 100 index has now fallen by 8.6% since the start of 2010, and around 15% in the last six weeks. The data also failed to prevent a slide in the pound, by 0.8% to $1.4308. David Buik of BGC Partners said that investor confidence had been &quot;shot to ribbons&quot; by the eurozone crisis, fears over government borrowing, and signs that banks are again reluctant to lend to each other. Stock markets across Europe were also in the red. Germany&apos;s Dax was down 2.6%, France&apos;s CAC dropped 3.2%, while Spain&apos;s Ibex lost 3.6%, Portugal&apos;s PSI slid 3.1% and Italy&apos;s benchmark index fell 2.6%. The euro slipped to an 8\u00bd-year low against the yen and was close to a four-year low versus the dollar. Ben Potter at IG Markets said: &quot;Wall Street collapsed in the final few minutes of trade last night as fears of all-out war on the Korean peninsula combined with concerns that European banks \u2013 notably those in Spain \u2013 may be staring into something of an abyss. &quot;Certainly the realisation of two highly significant yet totally unrelated events like this could equate to something akin to financial Armageddon and with this in mind, the expectation has to be that traders will remain highly cautious in the near term.&quot; The European debt crisis saw its latest twist over the weekend when the Bank of Spain stepped in to rescue CajaSur \u2013 only the second time that Spain&apos;s central bank has saved a regional lender. Investors worry that debt problems in several eurozone countries could trigger a new banking crisis and the debt crisis is still not resolved, despite the \u20ac750bn rescue package agreed earlier this month. Buik said: &quot;It seems inconceivable that the EU can carry on in the same vein as it has in recent times. Too many countries are unable to abide by the fiscal and monetary rules.&quot; Later today Italy will follow the lead of Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland by announcing an austerity budget designed to cut its deficit. Korean tension escalates Stocks in Asia also tumbled, with Japan&apos;s Nikkei sliding 3.06% to 9459.89 today. South Korea&apos;s benchmark index dropped 2.75% to 1560.83, and the South Korean won slid to its weakest level against the dollar in more than 10 months. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has reportedly put his military on combat alert, shortly after South Korea officially blamed his regime for the sinking of one of its warships in which 46 sailors died on 26 March. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index fell 3.47% to 18,985.5 while benchmark indices in Australia, Singapore and Indonesia all lost more than 2%. Stock markets in China, India, Thailand and Malaysia were down between 1% and 2%. Merkel in the Gulf German chancellor Angela Merkel said today that the Gulf Arab states back European efforts to stabilise the euro. &quot;There&apos;s interest in having a strong Europe, but it&apos;s clear we need to work on our competitiveness, and this is exactly the German position too,&quot; she said in Abu Dhabi after meeting leaders of the United Arab Emirates on a visit to the Gulf. &quot;It&apos;s understood here very well that a region like the European Union which shares a currency also needs to create a shared basis for economic performance.&quot; Asked whether the European currency was still a model for efforts among Gulf states to create their own joint currency, Merkel said &quot;yes, of course&quot;, adding that the subject was high on the agenda in her talks."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/25/black-artists-yinka-shonibare-fourth-plinth", "sentences": ["London (along with other international cities such as New York, Singapore, and Berlin) has become a place for people around the world to live, visit, consume and make culture \u2013 and, of course, do business."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-25T15:44:23Z", "title": "Do black artists need special treatment? | Munira Mirza", "tags": ["Yinka Shonibare", "Fourth plinth", "Sculpture", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "Tonight I will be appearing on a panel at Tate Britain discussing multiculturalism in the arts, inspired by the latest fourth plinth commission in Trafalgar Square, Yinka Shonibare&apos;s Nelson&apos;s Ship In a Bottle. This remarkable artwork reproduces Horatio Nelon&apos;s ship, HMS Victory, but with a colourful twist: the sails are made of African batik fabrics, one of Shonibare&apos;s signature touches. Even here there&apos;s another twist. As Shonibare has pointed out, the fabrics aren&apos;t straightforwardly African: the material is Dutch waxcloth, originally based on Indonesian methods of wax-printing, then exported to Africa in the mid-1800s and slowly established as the cloth of choice for African clothing. Shonibare buys the fabric (which is now largely produced in Manchester and Helmond, in the Netherlands) at Brixton market, a place symbolic of London&apos;s position in the global exchange of cultures, ideas and products. Calling himself a &quot;post-colonial hybrid&quot;, Shonibare celebrates this element of crossbreeding: &quot;It&apos;s the way I view culture \u2013 it&apos;s an artificial construct,&quot; he said in an interview with ArtNews in 2002. Shonibare&apos;s works are a powerful reminder that cultures are almost never &quot;pure&quot;, but rather made from a messy entanglement of influences. Delft pottery in Holland, which dominated the European porcelain industry in the 17th century, arose out of trade with Japan, whose oriental designs influenced early designs. Many kilt tartans you see today were designed by English tailors under the rule of Queen Victoria, rather than by Scottish highlanders. Even some of the great thinkers and writers of the western canon were &quot;imported&quot;: the Roman playwright, Terence, one of the founding fathers of western drama, was a freed slave from Carthage. St Augustine, philosopher and seminal figure of medieval Christianity, was from modern-day Algeria. Diversity enables this kind of cultural mixing to take place, for people to hear new ideas and acquire the best of what they see, eat, enjoy and learn. London (along with other international cities such as New York, Singapore, and Berlin) has become a place for people around the world to live, visit, consume and make culture \u2013 and, of course, do business. And while we are inevitably drawn to the culture of our upbringing, the migrant experience shows we can also be inspired by new places. Derek Walcott, Caribbean poet and Nobel laureate, famously said: &quot;Something prickles in me when I see the word &apos;Ashanti&apos;, as with the word &apos;Warwickshire&apos;.&quot; But here&apos;s the rub: diversity, when the word is used to describe arts policy, seems to be a different thing altogether. Indeed, by trying to capture the essence of difference, it seems to snuff it out altogether. In this reading, culture is not fluid, but defined in rigid categories. Artists are not artists but black, Asian or minority ethnic \u2013 &quot;culturally diverse&quot;. There are special publicly-funded bursary schemes for black artists, and targets for funding black-led arts groups. There is even a new MA course at a major art school exclusively for black and minority-ethnic art curators. Yet what does &quot;black art&quot; mean, if blackness itself is a mixture of cultural influences? If black artists can win major commissions and international acclaim, why do we assume that to be black is always to be marginal, or in need of special support? We have to recognise how diversity initiatives can make black artists feel ghettoised and, as some cultural commentators have argued, bear &quot;the burden of representation&quot;. Of course, being culturally different in the past was also to suffer prejudice, but much has changed in the past two decades, and old racist attitudes have declined significantly. Barriers today are largely class-based \u2013 income, networks, education. And those affect many white people as well. The past 20 years, particularly in London, have seen a phenomenal change in the way cultures in Britain live together. Nelson&apos;s Ship In a Bottle marks the moment to recognise this shift, and ask again what it means to be part of an ethnic minority in Britain today. We may well be surprised by the answers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/25/umpire-review-system-england-bangladesh", "sentences": ["The whole question of DRS costs will be raised at the next ICC board meeting in Singapore in June \u2013 and depending on the outcome of the board meeting, we may revisit the question of DRS for the rest of the English summer.&quot; Aleem Dar, the Pakistani umpire, was virtually turned back at the airport."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-25T18:53:23Z", "title": "Umpire review system abandoned as Sky fails to foot the bill", "tags": ["Cricket", "England v Bangladesh 2010", "ECB", "Sport"], "article": "International cricket&apos;s commitment to implementing the umpiring decision review system in all future Tests has collapsed after less than a week with the abandonment of attempts to use it during England&apos;s Test series against Bangladesh. The ECB is adamant that if the DRS is used in England then it should operate with the full range of available technology, but that has cost implications that Sky TV, the host broadcaster, is unwilling to meet. The failure to reach agreement adds to the sense of a Test series that is struggling to make ends meet as Bangladesh, the weakest Test nation, and beaten by England on their own turf this year, struggle to attract much attention in the face of the build-up to the football World Cup. Sky&apos;s reluctance to foot the bill for their upmarket DRS has caused mild irritation among some senior officials of the ECB, which has campaigned vociferously against recommendations that the Ashes series should be moved back on to free-to-air TV, support which Sky might have been expected to reciprocate. Others, such as the ECB&apos;s Giles Clarke, who is suspicious of the DRS in any form, might not be overly concerned. The ICC agreed at a two-day meeting at Lord&apos;s last week to push ahead with the roll-out of DRS across Test cricket \u2013 a system that allows each team two unsuccessful appeals to the TV umpire in each innings if they wish to challenge a decision made by an on-field umpire. The ICC will now step up negotiations with Sky for the DRS to be introduced in England for the first time during the neutral series between Pakistan and Australia later this summer. An ICC spokesman said: &quot;Despite constructive negotiations with the host broadcaster [Sky], we have been unable to reach agreement on the allocation of costs for DRS. The whole question of DRS costs will be raised at the next ICC board meeting in Singapore in June \u2013 and depending on the outcome of the board meeting, we may revisit the question of DRS for the rest of the English summer.&quot; Aleem Dar, the Pakistani umpire, was virtually turned back at the airport. He was scheduled to act as the third official but will no longer be involved, because decisions required from the audio-video replay room will now only extend to line calls and ICC regulations allow a home umpire to fulfil such duties; Richard Illingworth will deputise. Lord&apos;s has sold 16,000 tickets for each of the first two days, but Bangladesh are not exactly awash with crowd-pullers, so the expectation that their opening batsman Tamim Iqbal will delay surgery on an injured wrist until after his England tour is complete will come as a considerable relief to the ECB at the start of an international summer needing all the help it can get. Tamim, an adventurer at the top of the order, struck a century against England in the first one-day international in Dhaka, followed by three attacking fifties in four innings during the Test series. Bangladesh demanded respect on their own soil earlier this year, making England work hard for a clean sweep in Tests and ODIs, but their capitulation against England Lions at Derby last week did little to advertise their worth in English conditions. Tamim, Bangladesh&apos;s greatest &quot;flair&quot; player, had been regarded as doubtful for Lord&apos;s, but the suggestion today was that he will battle through the England series before missing the Asia Cup in June to have routine surgery. &quot;I&apos;m really excited to play at Lord&apos;s in a Test match,&quot; Tamim said. &quot;I really want to play, because I don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll get another chance. I went to a specialist yesterday and he said you&apos;ve got two choices: either you play with taping and hope there won&apos;t be any harm, or you can have surgery that will take three months. I am seeing another doctor today and if he gives me the green signal, then I&apos;ll play at Lord&apos;s.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/26/markets-rebound-oecd-talks-up-european-prospects", "sentences": ["The Indonesian stock market jumped 7.3% to 2696.78 while indices in Taiwan, Korea and Singapore rose more than 1%."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-26T14:09:00Z", "title": "Global markets rebound as OECD talks up European prospects", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Currencies", "Business", "Market turmoil", "Europe"], "article": "Stock markets are rallying today following yesterday&apos;s heavy losses, after the OECD ruled out a double-dip recession in Europe.

An honourable 2-2 draw, although I am not sure if Greece had any assistance from the rest of the EU.&quot; The OECD&apos;s chief economist told Reuters that a return to recession is unlikely in Europe. He argued that the euro&apos;s recent slide, which makes eurozone exports cheaper, should help offset the impact of governments&apos; austerity measures on economic growth. The euro has lost about 14% against the dollar this year, and more than 10% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies. Pier Carlo Padoan argued that governments need to get a grip on bulging deficits while also reforming pension systems, labour and other markets, and show they are working in unison to convince sceptical financial markets that their strategy is credible. &quot;Is there going to be a double-dip [recession] in Europe? I don&apos;t think so,&quot; said Padoan, who added that massive debts following the deepest global downturn in decades were &quot;not just a European story&quot;, but one that Europe was about to tackle faster than others. Eurozone exporters should benefit from rising foreign demand, especially in Asia, helped by the euro&apos;s weakening, he said. &quot;If you combine the two \u2013 high growth in Asia and a weaker euro \u2013 that could add quite a boost to European exports,&quot; said Padoan. &quot;The weak euro, in the short- to medium-term, is a welcome development. &quot;In any case it would be good for the global economy if ... nominal exchange rates changed a little bit. The euro certainly has been overvalued for some time and the renminbi has certainly been undervalued for some time.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/26/us-treasury-secretary-debt-crisis", "sentences": ["&quot;I think we all have to understand that the world economy is very lame and it is getting everybody nervous that the problems we are seeing in Greece (and) Europe will not be isolated in Europe,&quot; Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-26T14:53:00Z", "title": "US treasury secretary pushes for action on European debt crisis", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Timothy Geithner", "Economics", "Market turmoil", "Global economy", "Business", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner flew to Europe today to push for joint action to tackle the ongoing European debt crisis.

Stockmarkets in Europe and Asia rallied today following yesterday&apos;s heavy sell-off, after the OECD ruled out a double-dip recession in Europe. But the euro continued to slide, approaching a four-year low against the dollar, after US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that its dollar funding facility would not last forever.

The maker of the Splenda sweetener and Lyle&apos;s golden syrup reported this morning that underlying profits before tax dropped by 7% to \u00a3229m in the year to 31 March from \u00a3247m the previous year. Although the company did not put its sugar business up for sale today, as some City analysts had predicted, Ahmed made it clear that sugar will be a lower priority than Tate&apos;s speciality food operations. They make a wide range of products including starch-based ingredients for microwave meals, stabilisers, and ethanol products for biofuels and alcoholic drinks. &quot;Our core value added food ingredients delivered a strong result, reflecting steady demand and firmer pricing,&quot; Ahmed told the City. &quot;We are refocusing our strategy, with our speciality food ingredients business being the key focus of investment and long-term growth, as well as making a number of important changes to the group&apos;s organisation.&quot; The company&apos;s Fort Dodge corn plant in Iowa has been mothballed, resulting in a \u00a3217m write-off charge. Tate has also mothballed a factory in Alabama and shifted all its production of the artificial sweetener sucralose to Singapore. Cautious outlook Sales of the sucralose-based Splenda climbed 11% to \u00a3187m but the global market for high-intensity sweeteners \u2013 a key market for Tate &amp; Lyle \u2013 remained flat at $1.2bn (\u00a3829m) in 2009. It gave a cautious outlook for its sweetener, starch, ethanol and sugar products, with demand for sweeteners in the US falling, although this is expected to be largely offset by increased demand from Mexico. Industrial starch margins are under pressure and there are few signs of an improvement in ethanol markets. The company also admitted that profits in the sugar business will be held back by ongoing supply problems. Despite its roots in the late 19th century, when the company was formed from the separate cane sugar-refining businesses of Henry Tate and Abram Lyle, around two thirds of its profit now comes from supplying sweeteners, starches and ethanol, with the rest coming from its sugar operations. There has been speculation that Ahmed could break with tradition and sell the sugar operation to concentrate on higher margin businesses. With falling demand and intense competition, as well as supply problems and rising energy costs, Tate&apos;s refining business has fallen from a profit of \u00a33m a month in 2007 to, at best, break-even. Securing raw sugar supplies has been a challenge. Last July the company&apos;s joint venture in Laos, south east Asia, delivered its first sugar to its UK refinery. In April, Tate struck a deal with the Jamaican government for the delivery of 100,000 tonnes of sugar cane next year. But Martin Deboo at Investec has criticised the terms of the deal (at \u00a3370 a tonne) as &quot;punitive&quot;. He said it could be the final straw and force Tate to &quot;cut the cord&quot; with its legacy business of sugars."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/may/27/eiji-kusuhara-obituary", "sentences": ["Set in 1942 in an internment camp on a Japanese-occupied island, Tenko dramatised the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women captured after the fall of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-27T17:58:03Z", "title": "Eiji Kusuhara obituary", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Television", "Culture", "Japan", "Film"], "article": "The Japanese actor Eiji Kusuhara, who has died of cancer aged 63, played the sadistic Lieutenant Sato in the television series Tenko (1981-85), was one of the narrators on the cult show Banzai (2001) and appeared on stages across the UK and Europe in a variety of beguiling roles. He was one of the first professional Japanese actors active in London in the 1970s and enjoyed something of a monopoly on roles until he starred alongside a\u00a0fellow countryman, Togo Igawa, in The Man Who Shot Christmas (1984). Eiji spent most of his adult life in Britain. He always seemed relieved to have left his home country but was also perplexed by British culture. A natural comedian, he thought he was a misfit and constructed an endlessly playful persona for himself. He was born in Tokyo shortly after the second world war, a time when poor provisions and facilities meant that many babies died. Eiji was one of four children born to Ryoichi and Yasuko Kusuhara. Their first son died at three days old. Eiji was a weak, sickly baby and his parents waited to see if he would survive before they registered his birth. When Eiji was nine, his sister, Ikue, was\u00a0part of a teenage suicide pact with her boyfriend. Eiji was brought up in Hokkaido, where his father had a jewellery shop. He went to Iwamizawa East high school in Hokkaido before going on to study acting at Tama Art University in Tokyo. After graduation, he was a member of\u00a0the Neo Literature Theatre company and then joined the Tokyo Kid Brothers. This company, formed by Yutaka Higashi in 1968, was part of the underground theatre movement and the style of rock music used in its shows was profoundly anti-establishment. I first met Eiji in 1972 when the Kid Brothers brought their show The Moon Is East, the Sun Is West to London. The show appropriated western music culture with a maniacal energy and felt both familiar yet utterly strange. It\u00a0was based on a 16th-century Chinese adventure story about a monk travelling to India looking for enlightenment. The show opened at the Oval House theatre in Kennington, then moved to the Royal Court and the Hampstead theatre. Eiji subsequently joined Stomu Yamashta&apos;s Red Buddha Theatre for The\u00a0Man from the East, a physical theatre show depicting episodes from Japanese life, ancient and modern, real\u00a0and fantastic, with accompaniment from Yamashta and an ensemble playing electronic and traditional instruments. This popular show originated in Paris, played for a month at the Roundhouse in London, then toured Europe and the\u00a0US. In 1975 Eiji returned to Britain and joined my avant-garde theatre group, Lumiere &amp; Son. He appeared in The Sleeping Quarters of Sophia, a play about split personalities, and delivered a succession of disciplined but eccentric performances for the company over the next 10 years. He was serious and focused in rehearsal, yet could be constructively unpredictable in performance. In Dogs (1976), Eiji played Edgar, a hapless immigrant entrapped by a murderous couple who are in thrall to Sadean aristocrats. The part required a comic but cowed quality that contrasted strongly with the violence Eiji summoned in Indications Leading to ... (1975), a tale of detection in which the detectives enacted the roles of both perpetrator and prosecutor. In 1977, he was in the Royal Shakespeare Company&apos;s production of Privates On Parade by Peter Nichols, playing a spying communist servant. He worked for several other companies, including Oxford Playhouse, Bristol Old Vic, Yellow Earth, Polka Theatre and Amazonia, and was one of the founder members of Ichiza Theatre Company. His last stage performance was in 2007, in Hisashi Inoue&apos;s comedy masterpiece of Japanese postwar drama, The Face of\u00a0Jizo, at the Arcola in east London. The\u00a0play comprised conversations between a young woman who survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the ghost of her father. The play shows the daughter&apos;s anguish that she survived but her father did not. On television Eiji appeared in Doctor Who, Inspector Morse and in 17 episodes of the much-praised BBC series Tenko. Set in 1942 in an internment camp on a Japanese-occupied island, Tenko dramatised the experiences of British, Australian and Dutch women captured after the fall of Singapore. During the 1990s, Eiji was a regular presenter on two Japanese TV programmes, Hello London and Living in England, in which his idiosyncratic, comic personality was given free rein. He had vast experience as a voiceover artist in both Japanese and English in film, TV, commercials and radio. He was the voice of the evil genius Dr Kamikazi in the animated TV series Robotboy and was particularly well known for his wild co-narration in the cult TV classic, Banzai, which invited viewers to place their bets on bizarre challenges, such as how long Mr Shake Hands Man would maintain a handshake with a procession of bemused celebrities. Eiji&apos;s enthusiastic commentary highlighted the programme&apos;s wackiness. His film credits included small roles in The Elephant Man, Eyes Wide Shut and Topsy-Turvy, as well as many student films in which he appeared without taking a fee. He is survived by his wife, the designer Kyoko Wainai, whom he married in 1992, and his brother, Yuji. \u2022 Eiji Kusuhara, actor, born 2 January 1947; died 23 April 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/30/prudential-merger-aig-rights-issue", "sentences": ["James Chappell of Olivetree Securities says: &quot;Even after all the promised synergies, the investment returns projected by management do not justify the price.&quot; The prospect of a deal going through was also not helped by last week&apos;s listing of Prudential&apos;s shares on the Singapore and Hong Kong stock exchanges, a move designed to raise the company&apos;s profile ahead of the AIA acquisition."], "publicationDate": "2010-05-29T23:05:47Z", "title": "Prudential's big prize in Asia slides further out of reach", "tags": ["Business", "Prudential", "AIG", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Rights issues"], "article": "Sipping champagne on a gorgeous early summer evening, Prudential&apos;s directors looked as if they did not have a care in the world. But as they strolled around the Chelsea flower show garden sponsored by the Pru&apos;s investment arm M&amp;G, chief executive Tidjane Thiam and M&amp;G boss Michael McLintock knew the storm clouds were gathering. Rubbing shoulders with the biggest names in the City and business at the lavish gala preview of the annual flower jamboree, the pair were aware that their ambition to take over AIA was beginning to fade. Big City investors were privately telling the Pru that they were not prepared to back the $35bn bid \u2013 or the record-breaking \u00a314.5bn cash call \u2013 for the Asian arm of AIG, the huge insurer bailed out by the US in the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis. By this weekend, the private conversations had become very public and the Pru was involved in desperate talks to reduce the price tag on a deal that from the outset had faced criticism for being overpriced, incredibly risky and driven by management ego. Thiam continued to meet investors in the US on Friday, determined to convince them that at a lower price \u2013 say $30bn \u2013 they should be prepared to back a deal that would transform Prudential&apos;s operations in Asia and demonstrate to the world that the Pru had serious ambitions. A shareholder vote on 7 June will be lost unless the price is cut. And the deal \u2013 and along with it the rights issue \u2013 will be ditched. The recent market turbulence has not helped. As one analyst puts it: &quot;The Pru has asked for a vote on the rights call, but what people are really voting on is whether they have faith in the markets. A lot of people don&apos;t.&quot; Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management says: &quot;What worries us is that Prudential&apos;s forecasts for Asian growth may be too rosy, and that it has failed to take account of falling asset values in the event of a significant slowdown.&quot; Last week&apos;s turmoil on world stock markets, and the near 15% drop in prices since the deal was announced on 1 March, reinforced investor concerns that Pru was paying too a high price. Asian shares have been hit by worries about a war between North and South Korea after Seoul blamed its neighbour for an attack on one of its warships in which 46 sailors were killed. The markets also worry that the crisis in the eurozone could derail global economic recovery. The Pru&apos;s claim that it can double the value of the business in three years is not enough to calm investors&apos; nerves. James Chappell of Olivetree Securities says: &quot;Even after all the promised synergies, the investment returns projected by management do not justify the price.&quot; The prospect of a deal going through was also not helped by last week&apos;s listing of Prudential&apos;s shares on the Singapore and Hong Kong stock exchanges, a move designed to raise the company&apos;s profile ahead of the AIA acquisition. The shares fell by about 4% on both markets. Prudential&apos;s cause was also damaged by reports that AIA boss Mark Wilson had told friends he intended to quit if the transaction went through. Two other senior executives \u2013 Steve Roder, AIA&apos;s finance director, and Peter Cashin, its legal head \u2013 have already left the company. Critics say Prudential could inherit an organisation bereft of senior management if the departures continue, making integration difficult. Robin Geffen of Neptune Asset Management, who has led a campaign against the AIA deal, says: &quot;Like many investors, I remain completely opposed to the course of action that Prudential is intending to pursue. Very few shareholders have been consulted and it is not why people bought shares in this long established company.&quot; Lurking behind fears about the wisdom of the AIA deal are the collective memories about the dismal experience of other financial services groups that have strayed from home and invested overseas. HSBC&apos;s acquisition of US sub-prime lender Household is a case in point. Another is Royal Bank of Scotland&apos;s acquisition of Citizens in the States. But above all it is the Edinburgh-based bank&apos;s top-of-the-market takeover of ABN Amro that sticks in big investors&apos; minds. They backed the RBS management and voted collectively for the deal, only to find that barely six months later the bank had to embark on a massive cash call before being bailed out by the taxpayer in October 2008, crippled by the ABN business. Turning the Pru into the RBS of the insurance sector is not on anyone&apos;s agenda. But nor is destabilising a company that for years has been dogged by speculation that it will break up its three distinct businesses in the UK, US and Asia. Throwing out the management as the price for failure might also bring about such a fracture. Thiam&apos;s position is on a knife-edge; chairman Harvey McGrath is hardly popular; and investors have several names of Pru directors on a watch-list. New finance director Nic Nicandrou has also failed to impress. Dismantling the company would not be easy. True, the US division could be sold, but offloading the UK business, valued at \u00a35bn, would be more difficult as that operation is the cash cow that pays the dividend and funds expansion in Asia. Even so, the acquisition-hungry insurance vehicle Resolution continues to watch the situation in the hope that, whether the AIA deal goes ahead or not, the UK business will become available. And the truth is that not everyone is up in arms. Toby Langley at Bernstein Research says: &quot;Some people have focused on AIA&apos;s businesses in China and India, where there are regulatory impediments for foreign life companies. We see bigger opportunities in Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, where life insurance is a fledgling industry and penetration is close to zero. Prudential&apos;s purchase of AIA is not just a broad-based push into &apos;Asia&apos; \u2013 it&apos;s a push into these exciting, developing Asian markets.&quot; Langley recently told clients: &quot;[Prudential] management have laid out growth expectations of 15% through to 2013, in line with our existing estimates.&quot; The Pru points out that Asia is the world&apos;s fastest-growing market for life assurance and a combination of AIA and Prudential would make it the leading foreign life insurer in many of the continent&apos;s most populous countries. AIA will bring a sales force of 320,000 tied agents, more than 23m in-force life policies and 10 million customers with other products. Even so, it has a problem: on its own admission, a return on its AIA investment will not be reflected in its share price until 2013. Investors still need convincing and directors will be hoping that their efforts this weekend are more fruitful than their performance at the Chelsea flower show: their garden failed to win a prize."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/jun/01/bp", "sentences": ["Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng was down 1.4% at 19492.59 and the Singapore index fell 1.1% to 2722.11."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-01T07:56:42Z", "title": "FTSE falls over 100 points on global recovery fears", "tags": ["BP", "Business"], "article": "The FTSE 100 index fell more than 100 points this morning after a warning of a second wave of write-offs at European banks and news of a slowdown in China&apos;s manufacturing raised fresh doubts over the global economic recovery.

The Commission for a Sustainable London 2012 released its annual review on how the games&apos; sustainable vision is taking shape. The UK&apos;s green promises were key reasons why Seb Coe and his team won the bid in Singapore in 2005. Although the report said that the Olympic Delivery Authority, which has responsibility for construction and design of the venues and infrastructure, had maintained a high standard of sustainable design, the benefits to the UK&apos;s wider green economy could be lost before the games even begin unless &quot;the knowledge in people&apos;s heads is captured before they leave&quot;. With just over two years to go until the games begin, planning has now reached a critical stage as the ODA scales back in anticipation of the completion of venues next year. The Local Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, responsible for running the event, will take on an increasingly greater role in delivering the sustainable targets for London 2012. The report, Raising the Bar, says: &quot;Our main area of concern lies in the wider commitments that were made during the bid or just afterwards. Broad promises have been made in official documents: &apos;to make the Olympic Park a blueprint for sustainable living&apos; and &apos;to be a catalyst for new waste management infrastructure in east London&apos;. &quot;With the exception of a few worthy initiatives, there is no comprehensive plan to make this happen. Furthermore, it is not clear what definitions lie behind these expressions or who is responsible for making them happen. &quot;With just over two years to go before the &apos;inspirational power of the Games&apos; moves to Rio, never to return to London, these issues need to be resolved.&quot; Shaun McCarthy, head of the commission, said: &quot;Having an Olympics is an inherently unsustainable thing to do. To build all this stuff to watch some people run around \u2013 what&apos;s sustainable about that? &quot;We have to ask ourselves is it good enough just to have some great sustainable venues and put on a sustainable games which we are increasingly confident about, or will the Olympics really make a difference? &quot;Is this going to be something in isolation so we have one great big sustainable Olympics and then go back to business as usual? &quot;Or will the games actually change things? Because that was the promise that was made when we won the bid. &quot;A lot of carbon has been saved by comparison with business as usual construction techniques. If we can transfer that knowledge to the wider industry, we can save a lot more carbon than will be emitted in the whole of the Olympic Games. &quot;How can we use the magic of the Olympic Games to make that happen?&quot; McCarthy cited lower-carbon cement, low-toxin plastics and a zero landfill waste target as some of the achievements so far. The stadium is the lightest Olympic stadium, using a quarter of the concrete used for the Beijing games, and features a lighting system suspended from a compression wheel made from re-purposed gas pipes left over from a different construction project. McCarthy singled out the velodrome as an especially good example of sustainable design, with its ultra-lightweight roof and natural lighting and ventilation. But he admitted that results have been mixed on the Olympic park. Zaha Hadid&apos;s feted aquatic centre, with a roof made from 3,000 tonnes of steel, was a &quot;sharp lesson&quot; in sustainable construction. &quot;That is a lot of steel just to cover a swimming pool and it is not necessary to have that much,&quot; McCarthy said, adding that the architect had simply been asked to design &quot;a beautiful building&quot; before the bid gained momentum. But he said he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; that the energy centre in the Olympic park would run on gas, not biogas from onsite waste.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA     Hello. Here&apos;s Leo Benedictus at the Guardian&apos;s theatre blog:   Despite how unappetisingly wholesome it made London&apos;s arts scene sound, the mayor&apos;s waffly new document (pdf), Cultural Metropolis, did make fleeting reference to something rather interesting: a mooted &quot;Londoners&apos; card&quot;. Ordinarily, this would now be the sentence where I tell you what a &quot;Londoners&apos; card&quot; is, but in truth, I don&apos;t know.  It&apos;s funny, Leo, but I&apos;m starting to feel a similar bewilderment about the Mayor&apos;s cultural strategy itself. I recall expositions about what it isn&apos;t - about &quot;political correctness&quot;, for example, or spending too much money - but have gleaned no clear sense of what it has achieved beyond perfectly fine but very modest exercises in encouraging musicianship in young people, a promising-sounding &quot;season&quot; called the Story of London which turned out to be a somewhat unevenly delivered marketing exercise done on the cheap, and false claims that Boris has saved St George&apos;s Day from oblivion.  And while our learned Mayor has provided no elegant essays or eloquent speeches about London&apos;s cultural character, he has shown great commitment to - how can I put this? - overseeing the installation of a friend into a nice job on an arts quango. Such creative industry. Olympic anxietiesWith the &quot;age of austerity&quot; eating into public budgets, Tuesday&apos;s meeting of the London Assembly&apos;s economic development committee provided sobering insights into the financial as well as the planning challenges of transforming a bunch of sports arenas and their attendant media centre into the physical pillars of a brave, new east London community.  The size of the post-Games Olympic Park will be roughly the same as half an extra London borough, and once the running and jumping is done it has somehow to be transformed into a place people want to live in and visit. It&apos;s a hard concept to get your head round. And without public money, it seems, it could be much harder to make materialise. Read about it here and here and find the webcast here. Crossrail cheerThe Lib Dems&apos; Caroline Pidgeon had a question for the Mayor on Wednesday. When he&apos;d met the new transport secretary last month, had stories about vast lumps of money being taken from the Crossrail budget been confirmed or indeed tales that its trains would be shortened or its spurs and extensions amputated? The answer was no: &quot;There was no discussion of lopping off this or that or changing the trains.&quot; Pidgeon was reassured. Meanwhile, the Crossrail company has been inviting bids to build the new ticket hall that will serve Crossrail passengers at Liverpool Street station and the Connaught Tunnel refurbishment near Mansion House. Full steam ahead then after all? Perhaps - at least until the next budget cuts story breaks.  London blogosphereMeet the author of Tamarind and Thyme:  Hi! I&apos;m Su-Lin and I love food!

The three hotels, which each trace their history back more than 100 years and whose guests have included royalty, Hollywood stars and celebrities \u2013 from Queen Victoria to Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn to Madonna \u2013 could be up for sale. The Maybourne hotel group, partly owned by Irish property tycoon Derek Quinlan, needs to refinance \u00a3610m of loans by Christmas. In the latest accounts posted at Companies House by parent company Coroin, the business had debts of \u00a3672m due after one year. The debt level compares with total assets, minus liabilities due within one year, of \u00a3679m, which could put the company at the mercy of its two banking creditors, the Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank. The company is in talks with Deutsche Bank about a refinancing, the Guardian has learned. The talks, which would suggest the exit of the two Irish banks after the deal, &quot;are proceeding steadily&quot;, the company said. It added that lending institutions are showing &quot;sufficient interest&quot; to refinance its debt. The company said the loans have not been transferred to the National Asset Management Agency, Ireland&apos;s &quot;bad bank&quot;. The agency buys troubled loans from Irish banks at a discount to clean their balance sheets and help reignite lending. The refinancing talks could also involve Barclays Bank, already a banker to Maybourne, and are now focused on how much equity shareholders might inject, as that could determine whether creditors force the company into a sale of assets. Real estate investors said the properties are openly for sale, at the right price, although Maybourne said it has no plans to sell. The three properties could attract US, Middle Eastern or Asian multimillionaires seeking trophy assets and a place to impress potential clients or investors. Claridge&apos;s attracts thousands of gourmet food fans to its in-house Gordon Ramsay restaurant and also plays host to supermodel Kate Moss&apos;s annual birthday parties. Foodies flock to the main restaurant at the Berkeley, in Knightsbridge, led by a former Ramsay pupil, Marcus Wareing, to sample the chef&apos;s signature dish of braised pig trotters stuffed with chicken mousse and morels. Maybourne&apos;s majority shareholders, including Quinlan and Paddy McKillen, another property developer, &quot;are prepared to inject additional equity if required&quot;, the company said. Other investors include Moya Doherty and John McColgan, the entrepreneurs behind Riverdance. New money would strengthen the company&apos;s stretched balance sheet. According to the company&apos;s latest accounts, to the end of June 2009, operating profit was \u00a329m on sales of \u00a3103m. The group lost \u00a33.2m last year, although that was an improvement on the \u00a39.2m loss the previous year. Interest payments hit \u00a339m, a rate of about 6% on the \u00a3610m of loans. Maybourne is one of many highly leveraged property companies built during the years of cheap and ample debt. The company bought its hotels, which also included the Savoy in London, for \u00a3750m in 2004, valuing each room at about \u00a31m. The Savoy was later sold for \u00a3230m. Hundreds of companies which followed a similar strategy now have a combined \u00a355bn of property debt up for refinancing this year in Britain. Another \u00a350bn are in breach of their financial covenants, three times more than in 2008, according to the British Property Federation. The breaches come as commercial property values plunged by about 45% since the peak of the market in June 2007, the federation said. Luxury hotels are more resilient, as they have a loyal clientele of wealthy individuals and are regarded as trophy assets. &quot;They will have lost some value, but less than 30%,&quot; said Peter Sudell, executive director at BNP Paribas Real Estate. The Stafford Hotel in London recently sold for \u00a378m after being put on the market with an asking price of almost \u00a3105m, he said. Sudell said the Cumberland Hotel, with a price tag of \u00a3220m, was under offer to Kwek Leng Beng, but the Singapore businessman pulled out of the deal at the 11th hour. It is now said to be back on the market, with bidders offering about \u00a3210m, Sudell said. The hotel was valued at \u00a3293m three years ago. Quinlan, who has moved from Ireland to Switzerland, declined to comment. The entrepreneur is understood to have sold some of his properties in New York, and to be planning a sale of a Knightsbridge portfolio worth about \u00a3530m."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/leeds/2010/jun/17/old-broadcasting-tower-leeds-rusty-building-award", "sentences": ["Pinnacle@Duxton in Singapore introduces 1,848 units of public housing on 2.5 hectares of land into the city center of Singapore, with sky gardens on the  26th and 50th storeys through all seven of the tower blocks    The other buildings garlanded by the CTBUH are a trio of the usual suspects: the Burj Khalifa in Dubai which, at 828m, is more than 11 times higher than Broadcasting Place; the 163m Pinnacle@Duxton in Singapore and the 366m Bank of America tower in New York."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-17T12:56:29Z", "title": "Rusty Leeds tower is 'top bulding in Europe' - what do you think?", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "A 23-storey tower in Leeds has been recognised as the &apos;best tall building&apos; in Europe.

Staveley advised the Qatari property company Barwa Real Estate on the \u00a3250m acquisition of the Park House site in Oxford Street - the biggest development in the area since the Second World War - from the developer, Land Securities. Staveley is best known for orchestrating Abu Dhabi&apos;s and Qatar&apos;s eye-catching \u00a37.3bn investment in Barclays in 2008, followed a few months later by the takeover of Manchester City Football Club by Abu Dhabi&apos;s ruling family. The 37-year-old former athlete and model reportedly pocketed \u00a35m to \u00a37.5m in fees from the latest deal. The news came as it emerged that the Qatar Investment Authority, the emirate&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, was in talks to take a third share in the Savoy hotel in London. The 120-year-old hotel is owned under a 50-50 joint venture by HBOS and Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal&apos;s Kingdom Holding. It is due to reopen in October after a refurbishment that has taken 18 months longer than expected and is likely to cost more than twice the originally budgeted \u00a3100m. The hotel comes with a big debt burden \u2013 its 2008 accounts showed loans of $212m and that figure is likely to be higher now. Another part of the QIA, Qatar Holding, is said to have joined the bidding war for Grosvenor House, the five-star hotel put up for sale by Royal Bank of Scotland at the start of the year. The hotel, on Park Lane in Mayfair, has attracted interest from a handful of bidders, including the Abu Dhabi and Singapore sovereign wealth funds. The sale is expected to raise at least \u00a3500m. The tiny emirate, which recently bought Harrods for \u00a31.5bn, is on track to become the largest overseas property investor in the world this year, according to a report from Jones Lang LaSalle. The QIA, which is controlled by Qatar&apos;s ruling Al Thani family, was set up in 2005 to invest the billions of dollars flowing in from the emirate&apos;s huge offshore gas fields. Trophy assets acquired in London in recent years include the US embassy in Grosvenor Square, the Shard of Glass tower near London Bridge and the Chelsea barracks site in west London. It has taken advantage of the weak pound and the fall in property prices during the recession. The development at Park House, 453/497 Oxford Street - currently a large sand pit next to Primark&apos;s flagship store - comprises 310,000 square feet and is due to be completed by November 2012. It will include 163,000 square feet of office space, 88,000 square feet of shops and 39 flats. The price adds up to \u00a3240m an acre - &quot;possibly the most expensive acre of sand in London at the moment,&quot; said a spokesman for Land Securities. &quot;The investment demonstrates our commitment to Europe as part of our growth strategy and signals our interest in strengthening our portfolio interests in London,&quot; said Barwa chairman and managing director Ghanim bin Saad Al Saad. Barwa will pay \u00a3225m immediately and the rest on completion. It will also pay a share of the profits to Land Securities within 12 months of completion, estimated at about \u00a333m and capped at \u00a350m. Land Securities will recycle the sale proceeds in its growing speculative development pipeline, one of the largest in the country. The deal took the City by surprise, but analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove welcomed it. &quot;On our estimates, the Park House development was not going to be the most profitable one. We see the best prospects in terms of development profit for Land Securities&apos; Selbourne House.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/2010/jun/18/cardiff-st-davids-shopping-centre-award-penarth-billybanks", "sentences": ["In the news, St David&apos;s has beaten off competition from Portugal and Singapore to be named International Shopping Centre of the Year, reports WalesOnline."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-18T07:26:51Z", "title": "Cardiff today - award for shopping centre and demolition at Billybanks", "tags": [], "article": "Good morning, Cardiff!

That target has been set by RoboCup&apos;s organisers for the year 2050 and was established following the success of the artificial intelligence chess challenge that was fought out in the 90s. That clash was eventually won in 1997 when IBM&apos;s Deep Blue computer program beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov. Now RoboCup wants to repeat that success with the beautiful game \u2013 though a quick glimpse at a few YouTube videos of robot players in action will reveal just how difficult that task is going to be. Metre-high players scuttle crabwise across the pitch. They lash out but miss the ball. Occasionally one falls over for no discernible reason. It sounds like a typical England training session, in other words, and suggests that the designers of robot footballers have a great deal of work ahead of them before they can create players that are able to beat\u00a0humans. Improvements are constantly being made, however. For example, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have developed a program that lets robots predict where the ball will go, rather than merely reacting to its movement. Tests\u00a0show that such robots outperform rivals, allowing them to bend it, not so much like Beckham, but like R2-D2. Indeed, Manuela Veloso, a computer science professor at CMU, is convinced this programme will bring success for his team at RoboCup. &quot;I don&apos;t see any reason why we won&apos;t win,&quot; he says. So the day of the robot football player may not be that far off. And in any case, most of them are already blessed with one major advantage over\u00a0their human counterparts: they look more lifelike than Peter Crouch when they celebrate after scoring a goal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/mbas-hull-university-business-school-hubs", "sentences": ["There are also four off-shore locations in Bahrain, Oman, Hong Kong and Singapore, where Executive MBA students come from a variety of sectors ranging from government to telecommunications and airlines."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-20T23:01:00Z", "title": "Demand for MBAs holds despite the downturn", "tags": ["Management", "Public Leaders Network", "Guardian Careers", "Workplace news", "Graduate"], "article": "Last year during the height of the financial crisis, there was an 8% increase in the salaries of people holding MBAs and more people holding the qualification were operating at board level or above in 2009 (27 per cent) than in the previous year (23 per cent), according to figures from the Association of MBAs (AMBA). Mark Stoddard, accreditation projects manager of AMBA said: &quot;Data from our Economic Downturn Survey suggests the qualifications are still in demand even in times of economic instability and that they continue to be valued at the strategic level in organisations.&quot; It&apos;s not only the corporate world that values the MBA, designed to widen the horizons of business professionals, covering major functions and practices of business. While the consulting sector at 15% and finance at 12% are the largest sectors for MBA recruitment, IT, public sector and education recruit 6% each. On Hull University Business School&apos;s Executive MBA a heart surgeon and two army officers rub shoulders with senior managers from industry and finance. Professor Sue Miller, programme leader of the MBA at the business school, said: &quot;Employers in the public sector, the not-for-profit sector and the voluntary sector also see the value of sponsoring their top people through the degree. &quot;We have students who are hospital doctors, engineers and IT consultants. They come from the public, private and voluntary sectors and from Small and Medium Enterprises as well as from larger companies. &quot;Employers in all sectors value high quality MBA programmes that concentrate on personal skills and development and that focus on areas valued by employers such as ethics and social responsibility.&quot; The business school, which is AMBA accredited, offers the Executive MBA part-time over two years, reflecting a growing demand for flexible learning, as well as a full time MBA over one year. There are also four off-shore locations in Bahrain, Oman, Hong Kong and Singapore, where Executive MBA students come from a variety of sectors ranging from government to telecommunications and airlines. Miller said: &quot;Around the world, the MBA is recognised as a passport to a successful management career and a British education is regarded as high quality by global operators. &quot;At Hull University Business School, we are outward looking and internationally focused. We have been operating for 15 years and are well established with a good network of alumni. We have strong links with industry and get a lot of repeat business.&quot; The Hull MBA has 33 corporate partners who help to inform the course content and keep it relevant, ranging from the NHS hospital trusts, fire and rescue, the police, local authorities and companies such as BAe Systems and the Royal Bank of Scotland. But how exactly does an MBA give you an edge over other professionals? &quot;The Hull MBA will prepare you to lead responsibly and shape strategy. It will give you a route to achieving significant career advancement by equipping you to succeed in a fast-changing, competitive world,&quot; said Miller. The emphasis at Hull is on &apos;connected thinking&apos;, a perspective that builds an understanding of the complexities in today&apos;s global business environment. Miller said: &quot;The Hull MBA really helps you understand complex, multi-faceted business problems. This approach helps you to see the inter-relationship between complex business problems so you can understand those problems better and gives you the tools and techniques to work through them.&quot; Company director Rory Clarke, who is currently studying for the Executive MBA at Hull, already finds himself approaching business problems in a different way since he embarked on the course last year. He decided to study for an EMBA \u2013 sponsored by his firm \u2013 because he has become a board director of a J R Rix &amp; Sons, a company that is involved in a diverse range of activities including shipping, fuel distribution, shipbuilding, property, selling cars, caravan manufacturing, stevedoring and warehousing. &quot;I felt that an MBA would broaden my knowledge and skill set, providing me with a broad range of business tools that would help me when it came to understanding what needed to be done either for growth in some of our businesses and to manage difficult periods in other businesses,&quot; said Clarke, 50. &quot;The wide range of people in the group enriches the course. I&apos;m surprised by how certain aspects of the modules are applied whether it&apos;s to the military, to medicine or to a local authority or another business, and that enriches the course. There are a number of people at a pretty senior level with a different range of experience so it certainly helps me to see things from a different angle.&quot; As an executive of a company that sponsors employees through the MBA, Rory Clarke can see the advantages of the MBA to employer and the employee. &quot;My company benefits from myself and other employees doing the MBA because as we are a fairly large and diverse business there won&apos;t be anything that we do on the MBA that won&apos;t be relevant to some part of the organisation, whether it relates to manufacturing, accounting, finance, marketing or HR. All the modules equip me better to understand up-to-date thinking, the academic thought behind modern business processes and to see how that applies within our business. &quot;I&apos;ve been able to apply what I&apos;ve learned to the company. My colleagues and I have found that we&apos;ve been able to come back and improve and develop the way we do things at the company as a direct result of the course.&quot; Clarke believes that it&apos;s important for organisations to continue to invest in their staff, despite the cost involved of paying tuition fees and allowing staff time off to study and attend campus over long weekends. &quot;It&apos;s easy to make economies in difficult times by backing away from training staff but ultimately it&apos;s your own business that suffers as a result. Not only does it equip people better to deal with problems within the business, it helps motivate people and keep them fresh and interested in you as an employer. Investing in staff through training and development keeps them loyal.&quot; For more information click here...

The New Creation church, which has a following of some 20,000 people in a nation of about five million, issued its conciliatory statement after a 2008 sermon by its pastor Mark Ng appeared on YouTube last week (it has since been removed), to public scorn from the nation&apos;s Taoists as well as scrutiny from the internal security agency. In the clip, Ng likened the ritual of praying to a Taoist deity to a criminal practice. He bluntly told his congregation: &quot;Praying to him for what? For protection. It&apos;s just like a secret society, you know, gangster.&quot; Ng is not the first Christian preacher to have initiated a public furore over his derogatory remarks about other faiths this year. In February, clips of pastor Rony Tan of the Lighthouse Evangelism church, mocking the Buddhist and Taoist precepts of rebirth and nirvana, also stirred strong reactions. According to the 2000 population census, Buddhists and Taoists account for about half of the city-state&apos;s population while Christians comprise a quarter, as do Muslims and those who profess no religious affiliation. Hindus, meanwhile, make up some 4%. The number of Christians has grown rapidly: in 1980 it accounted for only 10% of the population. This has been attributed to the increased popularity of evangelical megachurches among the more affluent, English-educated ethnic Chinese in recent decades. Given Singapore&apos;s intricate religious landscape, there is a real fear that the likes of Ng and Tan&apos;s inflammatory rhetoric could potentially undermine its fragile religious \u2013 and racial \u2013 harmony. This fear has led the Singapore government to strongly defend an ethos of multiculturalism through its social policies and policing tactics. Its leaders want to avoid the recurrence of traumatic racial riots during Singapore&apos;s formative years as an independent nation-state when ethnicity and religion were held on to tightly as identity markers. In 1964, for instance, a bloody clash broke out between Malays and Chinese when some members of the former group who were taking part in a procession celebrating the Prophet Muhammad&apos;s birthday ran amok, attacking law enforcement officers and Chinese spectators, after policemen told a number of people who had strayed from the main procession to re-join the march. The YouTube clips were only the latest in a recent series of religious &quot;transgressions&quot; in the secular city-state. In March last year, the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), an independent feminist organisation, was subjected to a leadership takeover by evangelical Christians from yet another megachurch. By turning out in force at Aware&apos;s annual general meeting and voting out individuals who they thought were redefining marriage and the family by being sympathetic to gay people, this conservative group believed they were righting a theological &quot;wrong&quot;. The conservative faction&apos;s reign was cut short barely two months after taking over when it was voted out in a counter-coup organised by liberals. Yet to say Singapore&apos;s recent religious strife can be pinned solely at the door of certain Christian groups is unfair. It would be more appropriate to trace it to the reserved, often uncritical, outlook of Singapore&apos;s interfaith groups. The activities of bodies like the Inter-religious Organisation have largely upheld common values while sidestepping difficult issues such as divine truth and proselytisation. It is also possible that these transgressions are a reaction to the strict sacred-secular dichotomy that has shaped Singapore&apos;s public policies since its 1965 independence. In fact, the importance Singapore&apos;s private citizens place on faith suggests policies that do not fear religiosity could possibly lead to greater harmony."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/22/british-airlines-poorly-rated-which-survey", "sentences": ["Second best was Singapore Airlines, with Emirates coming third."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-22T10:10:48Z", "title": "British airlines poorly rated in Which? survey", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Air transport", "Business", "Travel", "easyJet", "Thomas Cook", "British Airways", "Ryanair", "UK news"], "article": "After months of dealing with volcanic ash cloud disruption, British airlines have been dealt another blow: they are some of the worst carriers in the world, according to a customer survey from the consumer magazine, Which? While Swiss Airlines came top of the satisfaction list for passengers on short haul flights, the eight worst-rated carriers were all British, apart from Irish airline Ryanair. Thomas Cook Airlines came bottom of the short haul table, deemed worst for leg room; while Ryanair was rated poorly for its checked baggage allowance. Jet2.com, Easyjet, BMI Baby, Thomson Airways and Monarch Airlines were all poorly rated. After a year plagued by strikes and record losses, British Airways came out middling in the Which? research. Customers on its short haul flights praised BA&apos;s cabin staff, cleanliness and approach to dealing with delays, but it was still rated just 11th out of 18 airlines. On long haul flights, BA&apos;s inflight entertainment was well rated, but the airline fell short on value for money, leg room and refreshments. The best airline to fly long distance with, according to Which?, is Air New Zealand, which was rated top for cleanliness and inflight entertainment. Second best was Singapore Airlines, with Emirates coming third. The Middle Eastern airline was rated top for checked-in baggage allowance, permitting each passenger a 30kg bag. The survey also found that despite Ryanair&apos;s reputation as the cheapest airline in Europe, the Irish carrier was often not the cheapest option for a family of four travelling with hold luggage. Flying London to Barcelona, for example, Easyjet was far cheaper, and deposits passengers in the city&apos;s main airport, whereas Ryanair uses an airport actually in Girona \u2013 a 57-mile \u20ac12 (\u00a310) bus ride away. Which? also reports on how expensive it can be for British passengers reaching airports by train, particularly those using London airports.

When Which? compared the cost of travelling per mile to the station one stop before the airport on the Stansted Express, there was a 24% difference between the 39p per mile you would pay from Liverpool Street to Stansted Mountfichet, and the 51p per mile you would pay to the airport instead.

Colchester Native oysters were, legend has it, described by the Romans as the only good thing to come out of Britain. Two thousand years on, the slow-growing molluscs with their distinctive flat shells are now finding favour with an increasingly open-minded local audience as well as luxury goods purveyors as far afield as Dubai. A growing appetite for oysters from browsers at the stalls of farmers&apos; markets to business travellers in airport champagne bars has helped this niche British industry buck the recession. For Richard Haward, whose family have been cultivating oysters off Mersea since the 18th century, it is a breakthrough that was always waiting to happen. &quot;People talk about organic and now increasingly they talk about natural foods. Wild oysters are the ultimate natural produce,&quot; he explains over the sound of purifying water trickling through pallets piled high in his shed. They are about as essential to cash-strapped consumers as truffle oil in a recession, but Haward&apos;s oysters have enjoyed rising sales during the downturn. &quot;There are more people buying them and people are being more adventurous with food because they are going abroad more,&quot; he explains. &quot;Celebrity chef endorsement also helps.&quot; He points to a stack of tightly packed wooden boxes destined for Rye in East Sussex and another pile that will end up in airport bars. Haward&apos;s oysters are also sold in Belgium, where they are savoured by connoisseurs as &quot;Les Colchesters&quot;, the far east and even the high-class restaurants of Paris. But to say business is booming would be to misunderstand the nature of Colchester Natives. Fattened over four or five years by food flowing from the surrounding Mersea marshlands, these filter feeders can only tolerate so much competition. They need space and time and under a 19th-century law can only be sold in months with an &apos;r&apos; in them \u2013 September to April. They are the antithesis of fast food, something that has earned them a coveted place in the Slow Food movement&apos;s Ark of Taste. It is also reflected in their price \u2013 \u00a320 will buy you a mere dozen of Haward&apos;s Colchester Natives but for the same price you get twice as many of his easier to produce non-native Gigas, or rock, oysters. The native Essex oysters are plumper and, for Haward, something best enjoyed pure. He grimaces when asked about Tabasco and lemon juice. They are a labour of love too. The days of sailing boats and men toiling by hand to haul trays of oysters from Mersea&apos;s underwater creeks are gone. But beyond engine-powered boats and winches little has changed, as Haward&apos;s gnarled hands testify. Once dredged up, the oysters are still sorted by hand on board his 62-year-old wooden boat. The smaller ones are thrown back to fatten for longer, the keepers are scraped clean. The oysters are wild but Haward and his team of seven workers give nature a helping hand by removing pests such as starfish and by moving their stocks to seabeds with the best food. The days are long, mostly lonely and often cold, especially ahead of the Christmas rush. It is a world away from the life Haward&apos;s father imagined for his son as the teenager left grammar school in the 1960s. &quot;My father wanted me to get a proper job where you work nine to five and retire at 60 and get a pension. The [oyster] work was much harder then and I was pushed away from it,&quot; he recalls. But while he was studying economics and geography in London, Haward&apos;s father died and he returned to Mersea to help his mother keep the family trade going for a seventh generation. It was a tough start. The &quot;Great Freeze&quot; of 1963 virtually wiped out the sensitive Colchester oysters and Haward mostly caught and sold fish in the early years. He gradually moved back to oysters as stocks recovered and he weathered parasite outbreaks along the way. In the 1980s his workaholic tendencies inadvertently sparked a successful offshoot business, his wife Heather&apos;s Company Shed seafood bar where tourists and locals queue out the door for a space around mismatched tables laden with lobsters, clams, fish and oysters. Haward bought the disused little hut, realised he did not need it for oysters and hatched a plan to distract Heather from his antisocial hours. &quot;I thought she could use it at weekends so she wouldn&apos;t moan at me for working. She started selling shellfish at the window and then people started sitting down and eating what they had bought,&quot; he recalls. When financial disaster struck the family in the recession of the early 1990s, the shed and the oyster &quot;layings&quot; in his mother&apos;s name were all Haward had left. &quot;We&apos;d borrowed a lot of money to expand, interest rates went through the roof, we couldn&apos;t cope and the company went into administration and we lost everything,&quot; says Haward. But he cautiously built the business back up and it is now one of the biggest producers in the UK. Takings are now more evenly spread between different clients and Haward makes extra money by selling for other producers. He harvests 300,000 of his own oysters a year but sells four times that many. Haward is 65 next month and three of his four children work in the business but retirement is out of the question. Next up is a further push to make the most of that growing domestic appetite. &quot;We have got to try and spread our business more widely still and one of the things is to sell directly to the consumers. Oysters are not an easy thing to sell. We really have to convince people to try them,&quot; he says. So supermarkets are off the agenda. Getting new recruits to the oyster fold means wooing customers at places like London&apos;s Borough Market. &quot;I often say that if I ask 100 people do they like oysters 50 will say yes and 50 no and if the latter 50 are asked if they have tried them, probably less than half will say yes,&quot; explains Haward. Exports are also a big opportunity and at the moment make up only 5% of his business. With key producer France suffering low oyster harvests following several years of troubles with a herpes virus, the time is ripe for British cultivators. Haward hopes trade with Dubai, in particular, will pick up as a result, while he is competing with the Dutch to grow market share in Belgium and also exporting to Singapore. But one country still eludes him: &quot;I haven&apos;t yet been able to crack the Italian market but I think we might get in this year.&quot; And so two millennia on from the Romans&apos; initial love affair with Colchester Natives, the British delicacies may be finding their way to a new generation of Italians."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/jun/22/maurice-strong-interview-global-government", "sentences": ["In some of the densest city states, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, you see that it&apos;s possible to have a decent life, but only by reaching out to the rest of the world for supplies and support."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-23T10:54:56Z", "title": "Maurice Strong on climate 'conspiracy', Bilberberg and population control", "tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "Population"], "article": "What&apos;s your reaction to how your name has been used and abused over the years? I&apos;ve got used to criticisms and, naturally, I try to make sure I don&apos;t listen to the more extreme ones because most of the people who have taken their rightwing extremist view of my life are people that I&apos;ve never met. Most of my supporters are people who actually know me. I just continue to do the best I can and I don&apos;t bother to try and respond to every little bit because the best response is just to keep on doing what you think is right. Is this a phenomenon that has happened over the past decade or so during the internet age, or have you attracted criticism all your career stretching back to the 1960s? Way back when I headed the Stockholm Conference on the Environment in 1972, I was roundly criticised then. I learn something from criticism because when it comes from sources you respect you always examine it and learn. However, the extreme criticism and attacks exclusively come from people I don&apos;t know who have an ideological basis for their criticism, and, most often, very little factual basis. I remember years ago the rightwing magazine in the US, the National Review, had me on their cover saying something like Maurice Strong is not a household name, but it perhaps the most dangerous person around, but they didn&apos;t interview me or anything. But I&apos;ve had my positives too. Just recently I was in the Netherlands receiving the Franklin Roosevelt Freedom award.  Some of the criticism, particularly in this internet age, can be like a virus, going completely unchallenged\u2026 If I spent my time responding to it I&apos;d be doing nothing else. The best thing is just to keep doing what you think is right. I have a website for people to get some factual information about me. That is a type of response, I suppose. Anyone who is seriously interested in me would usually do a little more homework and realise that the extreme criticisms are almost exclusively ideologically based. And they don&apos;t bother with facts, they just distort or misrepresent the facts. They haven&apos;t silenced me. Are you now retired? I passed retirement age at the UN long ago. I left after the role I was in most recently which was Kofi Annan&apos;s representative in the North Korean issue. But North Korea withdrew their support for the UN and, incidentally, I drew some negative comments about why I left the UN, too. But it just happened that my contract expired and I was already over retirement age. So there&apos;s nothing in the allegations about your involvement in the oil-for-food scandal? There was lots of controversy about it, but very little attention was paid when it become clear that I didn&apos;t [have any involvement]. I had nothing to do with the oil-for-food scandal and there was an enquiry that made this clear. But I did have a relationship with one of the people involved with helping me on North Korea, who came from North Korea itself. That gave rise to some controversy and then when there was a report on it that made clear that I had not done any of those things there was very little publicity for that.I am retired from all my official roles, but I am still very active. I have close relationships at the UN. I don&apos;t have any role at the UN, but I&apos;m still quite cooperative with a number of UN activities, in particular to China and that region. I don&apos;t have any government responsibilities or formal role. I continue to be active, though. Have you wound down your business interests? I don&apos;t do very much. My son is the main shareholder of my company and I help him explore some of those opportunities that are related to things I know about, such as energy and the environment. But I&apos;m active because I can&apos;t think of anything else to do in my so-called retirement. A lot of the criticism you seem to attract is founded on the belief that, via your extensive portfolio of business interests and bureaucratic roles, you are somehow plotting to establish a new world order. How do you respond to this accusation? I think it exaggerates my influence, my power and my intention. Anyone who wants to look at the record over the years can see that I&apos;ve been subjected to that kind of criticism, but I&apos;ve always made it clear that I do not believe that global government is either necessary of feasible. What I do believe is that we need a system of global governance through which nations can cooperate and deal with issues they cannot deal with alone. Maybe that statement is too sophisticated for some but it shouldn&apos;t be. The ultimate example is climate change. I prepared a piece recently on what I call the &quot;Survival Agenda&quot;, pointing out that the UN agenda has something like 150 items on it and it is impossible to get an item off the agenda due to the constituencies that keep them on there. However, many just don&apos;t need to be on there. They can be dealt with by other organisations, or are no longer relevant compared to when they were put on the agenda. What we need is to give special priority to those issues that affect our actual survival and I&apos;ve boiled this down to about seven issues. We&apos;ve got to realise that we blithely assume that life will continue no matter what because it always has. But it&apos;s not correct that it always has. Look at the history of planet earth \u2013 there&apos;s only a minute moment of time when the conditions have been conducive to human life. We are literally altering those conditions and my motivation is to alert people to this. I believe that we need a degree of cooperation on these issues that goes beyond anything we&apos;ve ever seen before. During a war we get a lot of co-operation, but we also get a lot of rivalry. In the second world war, nations co-operated. There are examples of co-operation during periods of special need. But things are happening now that could really affect the future of humanity and that&apos;s what drives me. It doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m right about everything, but that is my purpose. A common cry among your critics is that you are a socialist, a communist. Your links to China and North Korea give rise to that view with some. This, they argue, is all part of some secret agenda to create a totalitarian, unelected world government. Is this something you recognise? Are you \u2013 or have you ever been \u2013 a communist? I&apos;ve certainly never been a communist. [Laughs.] It doesn&apos;t mean that I don&apos;t look critically at all systems. The capitalist system has proved itself not able to deal with all of society&apos;s problems. In terms of socialism, yes, I&apos;ve been accused of that. My belief is that the purpose of economic life is to meet the social needs of people. My kids sometimes ask me: &quot;Are you a socialist or a capitalist?&quot; I&apos;m a socialist only in the sense that I believe that the purpose of economic life is to meet the social needs of people. I&apos;m a capitalist in that I believe that&apos;s the best way to do so. Capitalism is not an end in itself but a means of creating and managing wealth to help meet social objectives. To me some people define socialism as the ownership of enterprises by governments on behalf of society. Well, sometimes that is very necessary. In Canada, we&apos;ve never had a socialist government at the federal level, but we&apos;ve had state corporations, or what we call crown corporations. There are times when every government has state involvement in the economy. In the US, take a look at the single biggest industry \u2013 the defence industry. It is very much state-controlled. I believe that the government is actually a very poor owner of enterprise. I&apos;ve run enterprises in Canada that were owned by government and never believed that government was the best owner of enterprise. Is the concept of a free market, given the environmental challenges we face, a dangerous concept for humanity? It&apos;s not free and never has been. Just look at the level of subsidies that every government provides. Even today, governments continue to subsidise fossil fuels or other things that are environmentally counter-productive. The market economy has seldom ever been free and we&apos;ve seen recently the dangers of an unregulated, unrestrained market economy. I think even those who believe in the market economy must accept that it produces some unwelcome by-products and economic winners and losers. It demonstrates that a totally free market economy simply isn&apos;t workable. So an ever freer market is a wrong-headed goal in your view? And increased regulation is preferable? Up to a point. There are extremes of regulation. There has to be a balance. The democratic system, in theory, permits this constant re-examination of this relationship between government and enterprise. Given your understanding of China, what in your view is the better model in the decades ahead \u2013 the Chinese model or the Western model? I don&apos;t think there is any perfect model anywhere. We know already that the US model is not working. With the bail-outs and takeovers some of the US&apos;s main companies are now controlled by the government. We know that pure capitalism hasn&apos;t worked. In China, they have used their system \u2013 which they call a socialist market economy \u2013 quite well to achieve their objectives. It&apos;s also in a continuous process of evolution. I&apos;ve had a working relationship with China nearly all my adult life. I&apos;ve seen the remarkable progress they&apos;ve made and are still making. They&apos;re quick learners. They tend to be among the best in terms of business and industry. They have learned how to use the methods of capitalism to meet their own goals of socialism. China is among the best managed countries today. Not perfectly managed, of course Where would you instinctively rather live? In China, or in the US or Canada?I&apos;ve spent a lot of time in China and, with my environmental interests, China is about as good a place to be at the moment. China was pretty slow at the beginning. [The environment] was a side issue compared to the economy. But China has now recognised that undermining the environment is one of the risks to development. They have become very environmentally minded. After the Copenhagen summit there were lots of accusations that China had pulled the rug out from any agreement\u2026 I was there, but didn&apos;t have any influence. That is a lame excuse for the West. China is actually doing more than most other countries in the world to reduce its emissions. For example, its automobile emissions standards are tighter than those of the United States. The problem is the economy is growing so fast. The Chinese will continue to do more on their own emissions than an international agreement asks them to do, but they are not prepared to do them under an international agreement unless and until those who created the problem in the first place, and brought us up to these thresholds of danger, are doing what they&apos;ve got to do. China&apos;s position is very consistent. What most people missed about Copenhagen was there was no agreement in prospect. But what it did do is underscore that China must be accorded the kind of political status that its economy now demands. It&apos;s interesting that the final statement at Copenhagen was a statement between two countries \u2013 China and the US. That in itself is very significant. China has its own internal dangers, of course, but it has never been one to take over its neighbours. It has boundary disputes. It could easily overrun its neighbours, but it doesn&apos;t do that and I don&apos;t think it is likely to. But China is on track to be the largest economy in the world and, with it, it has a growing political influence. Does this please or displease you? I would say neither of those things. It&apos;s a perfectly proper objective for it to pursue. It has already lifted more of its own people out of poverty than any other single nation. Whether it will work in the future, as it has done in recent times, I&apos;m not sure, but I don&apos;t see any signs that China increasing its power is a great threat. It sounds as if your heart and sympathies are more with China at the current time than with the West. Is that correct? I wouldn&apos;t say that. I&apos;m a westerner, but I believe that the rise of China is good. It&apos;s not a danger and it will be a benefit to create a little more balance in the world where it&apos;s not dominated by one country. The US will continue to be a major force in the world, and that&apos;s good, but it&apos;s not going to be exclusively dominant as it has been in the past. The rise of China, and others in Asia, means the centre of gravity in world geopolitics has now moved towards Asia. My sympathies are with the East to the extent that I believe that it&apos;s inevitable \u2013 and should be good \u2013 that the power structure of our world community is accommodating of the fact that Asia is the largest region in economic and population terms. I can see how it could go wrong, too, but Western leaderships haven&apos;t always provided the ideal world we all hoped for. We are still a minority in the west. We can&apos;t continue to have it all our own way. One of the strongest criticisms that you face is that, because you have had a varied career involving business interests and roles at the UN, you somehow created the climate change issue to profiteer from your business interests via, say, cap-and-trade and the Chicago Climate Exchange. Or that it is all a Trojan horse for you to advance your political objectives. How to respond to this? It shouldn&apos;t take anyone too long to understand that it would be pretty difficult for a single person to mount a conspiracy that involves most of the world&apos;s [climate] scientists and to get them all to join this conspiracy. I&apos;m not a scientist, but I&apos;ve been close to science and seen that scientists don&apos;t reach consensus very easily. There&apos;s a tremendous process of dialogue and differences. To see climate scientists reach the level of consensus that they have is a major thing and couldn&apos;t be the result of a conspiracy that one person could ever engineer. And what about the idea that you are somehow profiteering from climate change? That it&apos;s a device for you to make money through cap-and-trade? I was on an MIT panel on climate change in 1968, I think it was, before the Stockholm Conference. But I was lucky enough to have already made enough money from business at that time. It&apos;s true that I do get a modest fee from Chicago Climate Exchange, which I helped Richard Sandor to found, because I believe the cap-and-trade system, while not perfect, is one of the best ways to ensure that people have the incentive to reduce their emissions at the lowest cost. That&apos;s a long way from suggesting that I could invent the climate change issue to make profit. People call me very rich. I&apos;m rich in experience, but most of my money has always been spent on the causes I&apos;m interested in. No one should feel sorry for me for being poor, but I&apos;m certainly not very rich. You&apos;re painted as this billionaire figure who strides all these global institutions reaping profits from the so-called cap-and-trade &quot;scam&quot; and your interests in China. Do you just laugh this off? Well, it&apos;s just not true. You can check my credit report and see that I&apos;m credit worthy - but just barely [laughs] - and I&apos;ve never been anywhere close to being a billionaire. Also, it&apos;s never been my main purpose in life. I have business interests, but they are pretty modest and I believe that business has to contribute to the solutions. To do that, they have to be profitable. If people think I shouldn&apos;t have ever made a living, then perhaps I should have just passed the hat around to keep my affairs going. But I think if you look at my business record you will see that not everything I have ever done has been successful, by any means, but I have fought to contribute to the solutions of these problems. Will the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico help President Obama push through his climate-change legislation? I don&apos;t have an inside track, but I think it could help and probably should help. But the oil industry has lobbyists and the power of money has tremendous influences. No other industry has more than the oil industry. It&apos;s a good industry and I was in it myself. I was jeered when I set up Canada&apos;s national oil company \u2013 Petro-Canada \u2013 because I made every proposal that came to management have to have an environmental assessment. People in the industry at that time laughed at it and that was another source of criticism for my crazy ideas. The oil industry is very important, but it, too, has its excesses and the BP disaster is demonstrating the tremendous consequences of its excesses. We have to move away from oil now \u2013 and are at the very early stages of doing so \u2013 not because the oil is running out, but because of the economic and environmental consequences. Some of your critics claim that you are part of a shadowy elite who gather together and work out how to run the world. Your name has been linked to the Bilderberg Group, the Illuminati, and, with your connection to the Rothschilds on the record, the &quot;Jewish banking conspiracy&quot;. What are your connections to these groups? I have got lots of connections, but they&apos;re not among them. I&apos;ve never been a member of the Bilderberg. I don&apos;t have any special relationship with the Rothschilds. I knew Edmund Rothschild at one stage. He&apos;s passed away now, but was a very creative fellow who took an interest in Canada. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever done a piece of business with the Rothschilds. I&apos;ve been on various foundations: the Rockefeller Foundation, and I worked with Ted Turner in helping him to set up the UN Foundation. But I got off most of those things because I got a little older and attending all the formal meetings was difficult physically because I&apos;ve had health problems. What was the other one? Illuminati - a group that has its origins in 17th Century Bavaria and is said to be planning a new world government. [Laughs] Well, I&apos;ve certainly never had any contact with anyone from that organisation, or that I knew was connected to that group. Maybe someone I knew had a connection with it, but I certainly don&apos;t have any relationship with it. And I&apos;m not in favour of a world government, as I&apos;ve said. It&apos;s not even feasible. I do believe that governments have to work together. That&apos;s one of things that really concerns me about the future. I really do believe that our future is in doubt. So are you pessimistic about the state of the world? Analytically, I&apos;m pessimistic. I believe the odds are against us for making the changes we need to make in time. But, operationally, I&apos;m optimistic because I believe that it is still possible. Tougher the longer we delay it. That&apos;s why I&apos;m trying all these things because I believe we should still be trying as long as it is still possible. My pessimism is based on whether I think we will actually make these changes. At the Rio Summit, which I ran, a group of enterprises prepared a report called &quot;Changing Courses&quot;. These were not environmentalists, they were CEOs of major companies and they said our present industrial civilisation is not viable unless it changes course. That was back in 1992. The need to change the course \u2013 not to replace it with some communist system \u2013 on which we are now embarked was absolutely imperative way back then. Now we have more companies agreeing with us, but we also have more opposition. I do believe that we are at risk. Your name is often associated with terms such as eugenics and population control. What is your definitive position on the human population? Do we need to radically reduce the number of people on this planet? If so, how? There is no question that growth in the world population has increased the pressures on the Earth&apos;s resources and life-support systems. Now that doesn&apos;t mean that the Earth can&apos;t support this number of people. There are much more stringent and disciplined ways of supporting the increase in population. The increase in population is occurring today mostly in countries without the resources to look after these populations. China&apos;s one-child policy is not a perfect policy by any means, but, on the other hand, how do you control growth in your population? China has done a remarkable job in increasing the well-being of one of the largest populations in the world, but it&apos;s not easy. There&apos;s no question that if you look at the growth in population and the growth of the economy that the pressure on the environment and resources of the Earth have come not from the increase in population, but rather the impacts of the existing population. All the people on the Earth aspire to a better life. If all of them enjoyed the same patterns of consumption that we in the West do, then we would have an unsustainable situation, and we&apos;re actually on the way to that now. We are in a situation that is unsustainable. In some of the densest city states, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, you see that it&apos;s possible to have a decent life, but only by reaching out to the rest of the world for supplies and support. So they are financially successful, but they require a disproportionate share of the world&apos;s resources. On a global basis, that would inevitably create an unsustainable world. So, with a global population approaching 7 billion and predicted to reach 9 billion by 2050, do we just let this rise happen, or, in the West, do we have to start thinking along China&apos;s lines by introducing rules and regulations about how many children people can have? There is quite a lot of evidence to suggest that China&apos;s one-child policy hasn&apos;t been the only form of population control in that country. As the economy helps people in their lives, they tend to have fewer children. So one child in the US, could equal the consumption levels of 10 children in Africa or India? That&apos;s what I believe. It may be possible that the Earth can sustain a larger population, and seems inevitable with current trends, but it will require better constraint and discipline. It will be hard to enforce, therefore. The increase in population will create a huge dilemma and sources of conflict. For example, population growth in places like Europe used to be balanced by emigration, but today the borders of the world are closing and the pressures on Europe, for example, will grow. The combination of population growth and the growth in consumption is a danger that we are not prepared for and something we will need global cooperation on. This is the toughest issue of all, surely. How do you go to someone - unless you live in a totalitarian government such as China&apos;s - and say to them that they must limit the number of children they have? Nature will provide solutions much tougher than we could ever provide if we don&apos;t do something ourselves. Secondly, I was deputy minister in the Canadian government at a very young age and I made a speech in Canada in which I said that, with a growing global population, we will have to recognise that having children is not just a personal issue but a societal issue and at a certain point we may be faced with a need to have a permit to have a child. My minister was getting all sorts of calls from archbishops saying, &quot;what is he saying?&quot; I had to explain that I wasn&apos;t advocating this, just that this is what might happen if we don&apos;t find better ways of doing it. That was controversial and I&apos;ve been used to controversy ever since. Over the years, I&apos;ve also noticed that this is one way of getting attention. For example, you&apos;d probably never heard of me if people weren&apos;t always attacking me. It is, perhaps, a peripheral benefit that the attacks call attention to the issue. You don&apos;t lose sleep when Glenn Beck dedicates a show to attacking you? You know what? I haven&apos;t actually seen that show. But we wouldn&apos;t be having this conversation if he hadn&apos;t attacked me. I&apos;m never going to be immune from criticism. I&apos;ve always had lots of it and the internet has given it a proliferation of dissemination. I don&apos;t respond to it all, but I listen to it. My family gets irritated by it, but it&apos;s something that&apos;s been part of my life for so long that at my age I&apos;m philosophical. I concentrate on the positives such as being honoured with a professorship seven or eight times. I could just fade away and, at my age, to some degree I am, but I&apos;m not going to fade away any more than I have to."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/24/torrey-canyon-oil-spill-deepwater-bp", "sentences": ["Eventually, the Torrey Canyon&apos;s sister ship, Lake Palourde, was &quot;arrested&quot; when it docked at Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-24T07:00:05Z", "title": "Oil spills: Legacy of the Torrey Canyon", "tags": ["Oil spills", "BP oil spill", "Environment"], "article": "Flop flop flop. The sound of a bird&apos;s wings batting futilely against the gloopy blanket of black oil echoes across the quarry. Then there is silence. A pigeon has crashed into this dark pool, 100 metres from the turquoise sea on the west coast of Guernsey. It sinks within seconds, resurfaces for a final flap, then joins the other small carcasses lying face down in the swirls of black slime. Since 1967, this deadly, oil-filled crater on the Chouet headland has acquired a new name: Torrey Canyon quarry. On the morning of Saturday 18 March 1967, the Torrey Canyon ran aground on Pollard&apos;s Rock between Land&apos;s End and the Isles of Scilly. Over the following days, every drop of the 119,328 tonnes of crude oil borne by this 300m-long supertanker seeped into the Atlantic. Thousands of tonnes despoiled the beaches of Cornwall \u2013 and thousands more were propelled by winds and currents across the channel towards France. At the time it was the biggest oil spill ever, and the first involving a new generation of supertankers. Looking back, the echoes of the BP disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico are loud and eerie. The slick imperilled a beautiful and popular tourist region. Inertia and dithering were worsened by the buck-passing of multinational companies implicated in the mess. And no one knew what to do. Even BP was involved: British Petroleum chartered the vessel to bring crude to the oil refinery in Milford Haven, Wales. But the Torrey Canyon disaster is not just a history lesson; it is living proof that big oil spills plague ecosystems for decades. Forty-three years on, the crude from the Torrey Canyon is still killing wildlife on a daily basis. The Italian captain of the Liberian-registered Torrey Canyon was blamed for stranding the tanker on a well-known set of reefs. By nightfall, an eight-mile slick had slipped from its punctured tanks. The following day it was 20 miles long. In the past, tiny coastal oil spills had been cleaned up by mixtures of solvents and emulsifiers. These were called detergents, a deceptively cosy, domestic term for what were highly toxic chemicals. Within 12 hours of the spill, the navy tried to tackle it with them. Handily for BP, it manufactured these chemicals. The government warned that the stricken ship was &quot;a bomb&quot; and BP, as one man involved in the clean-up operation put it, &quot;were making a bomb, literally, both ways&quot;. More charitably, the Guardian reported: &quot;British Petroleum, which has the Torrey Canyon on charter but does not own her (and therefore disclaims any responsibility for the oil pollution) has sent all the detergent it can lay hands on.&quot;     Torrey Canyon quarry, Guernsey. Photograph: Graeme Robertson    The &quot;sluggish black smear on the Atlantic&quot; was an eyesore but Dutch experts dispatched by the ship&apos;s owners, the Bahamas-based Barracuda Tanker Corporation, itself part-owned by the American Union Oil company, insisted the ship could be salvaged. The government agreed, and its man in charge of the crisis, Maurice Foley, undersecretary for defence (navy) \u2013 a title that did not suggest the spill was a top priority \u2013 insisted there was &quot;no question&quot; of deliberately destroying the supertanker. Dennis Barker, now 81 and still writing for the Guardian, was dispatched to report on the spill. &quot;It was the first of those ecological disasters. Nobody knew what to expect. All that sunk in was that a boat was stuck on the rocks. The implications were slow to filter through,&quot; he says. Barker intercepted Harold Wilson, the prime minister, on the railway platform at Penzance. Wilson had been due to spend his Easter holidays on the Scilly Isles. &quot;He rather liked to be at the scene of the action but it all seemed a bit slow by the standards of today,&quot; says Barker. Like everyone, Barker most vividly recalls the smell. He leaned out of a helicopter to inspect &quot;the greeny, browny gunge&quot; in the sea below. &quot;Suddenly I felt decidedly ill and I thought I was going to vomit over the Sun photographer. The stench was indescribable,&quot; he says. This &quot;abominable smell of oil&quot; \u2013 as the Guardian reported \u2013 could be smelt at Land&apos;s End on Good Friday. Waves of oil broke on the shores near St Just the following morning, a week after the shipwreck. On Easter Monday, the tanker broke into two pieces. The oil, Barker noted in his reports, was winning. Using detergents to break up slabs of oil on the ocean was &quot;like trying to pick up quicksilver with boxing gloves&quot;, he wrote: &quot;There is this constant feeling that the government has fluffed the issue, and that an early political decision might have worked.&quot; The government continued to insist it was right to leave salvage attempts to the companies involved. &quot;Clearly we have no responsibility in law for what has happened,&quot; observed Foley. Les Hosking from Marazion, Cornwall, remembers the moment the government began bombing the tanker in an attempt to sink it and some of its deadly cargo, and burn off the slick. &quot;We saw the Buccaneer bombers coming in. They dropped bombs and that didn&apos;t do anything,&quot; says Hosking. The press was critical because a quarter of the 42 bombs missed the target. Other methods also failed. Foam booms to contain the oil slick took ages to assemble and broke up in rough seas. Attempts to burn off the oil by dropping aviation fuel on it also foundered when high tides put the fires out. So, extraordinarily, the authorities dropped Napalm on the slick. &quot;When that came in there was a sheet of flames,&quot; remembers Hosking. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything like it. The smoke went up into the sky for what seemed like miles.&quot; The slick contaminated 120 miles of Cornish coastline. An estimated 15,000 birds were killed. Seals and other marine life also perished. An awareness of the environmental damage caused by oil &quot;hadn&apos;t reached anywhere near the public consciousness that it has now,&quot; says Barker today. &quot;It could have been an emergency from the last war. In an emergency you are not terribly worried about the pigeons.&quot; Local residents fretted about their livelihoods in fishing and tourism, but were they angry? &quot;Obviously there was a lot of anger and distress and then we thought, &apos;Let&apos;s just get this stuff off our shores&apos;,&quot; says Hosking. Although the government got a kicking in the press, the attitude towards the implicated oil companies was strikingly mild compared with today&apos;s blame game. &quot;If Wilson had been going on at the people responsible like Obama is, he would have been regarded as a bit eccentric or out of order,&quot; says Barker. In 1967, BP chartered the vessel but was widely exonerated. There was little hostility towards the ship&apos;s captain. &quot;Today there would have been a lynch mob after him,&quot; observes Barker. Residents of Cornwall did not realise it but they got off lightly. A freakish absence of prevailing south-westerlies in the weeks after the disaster kept much of the oil from hitting the mainland. The oil washed up on Britain&apos;s shores amounted to just 15% of the total that leaked from the Torrey Canyon. The vicissitudes of wind and current deposited more oil on the distant coastline of Brittany. Nineteen days after the disaster, a huge slick hit western Guernsey. The oil lay so thick that 3,000 tonnes could be pumped directly into sewage tankers. &quot;It was, &apos;We&apos;ve got to clear our beaches, we&apos;re a tourist destination, right, there&apos;s a quarry, let&apos;s put it there.&apos; It was a decision that had to be made very quickly,&quot; says Rob Roussel of Guernsey&apos;s public services department. Roussel remembers the oil on the island&apos;s beaches as a boy; he is now in charge of cleaning up Torrey Canyon quarry. Moving oil to the quarry was a solution that created another problem. This dirty legacy of the Torrey Canyon has refused to disappear. &quot;It stinks. It absolutely honks. Everybody&apos;s known about it but no one has wanted to do anything about it,&quot; says Jayne Le Cras, director of operations at the Guernsey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. &quot;Because of its thickness and stillness birds see it as a solid surface, they land on it and then the weight of the oil holds them down. I would hate to know how many are underneath it.&quot; A family of kestrels is nesting in the quarry wall and short-eared owls breed in adjacent pines trees. When passing walkers hear the flapping of stranded birds they alert the GSPCA but staff can&apos;t always reach the quarry quickly enough to rescue birds. Last autumn, a GSPCA officer filmed a pigeon struggling in the oil on his phone and posted it on Facebook. The resulting furore helped prompt the authorities into action again. Guernsey&apos;s government says it has spent thousands trying to clean up the quarry. It was cleared in the 80s; more recently, 160,000 litres were taken to a processing plant in Hull. But each time the oil has been removed more has seeped from the sediment below, which cannot be dug out because the quarry was a German armaments dump when they occupied the island during the second world war. Last year, the water level rose and the changing pressure released more crude from the bottom. &quot;The company that was responsible for the Torrey Canyon should be paying for it under the polluter-pays principle but the international laws weren&apos;t in place back then,&quot; says Roussel. In 1967, as the cost of the clean-up grew, the British government sought \u00a33m compensation from the ship&apos;s slippery owners. Eventually, the Torrey Canyon&apos;s sister ship, Lake Palourde, was &quot;arrested&quot; when it docked at Singapore. Legend has it that a young British lawyer was only able to board the ship to attach a writ to its mast because the crew believed he was a whisky salesman. The French, also seeking compensation, continued to pursue the company \u2013 and its ships \u2013 for many more months. Meanwhile, long after the disaster had slipped off the front pages, Hosking remembers balls of oil, like giant Maltesers, washing up on Marazion&apos;s beach: &quot;At the time we thought, &apos;This is it.&apos; This is Cornwall messed up for the rest of our days. My first thought was, how the hell are they going to get rid of this lot? Mother nature is a very powerful thing. Eventually, I expect nature did most of it.&quot; In fact it turned out that human ingenuity was not just powerless against the oil slick; it made it much worse. Three days after the ship ran aground, Anthony Tucker, then science correspondent of the Guardian, warned that no toxicity tests had been carried out on the detergents being sprayed on the oil and their effect on marine life had never been studied. &quot;There may be little point in spending many millions of pounds simply to convert an unpleasant but visible marine poison into another kind of poison that is insidious and entirely unknown in its effects,&quot; he presciently wrote. In the event, the use of detergents turned out to be &quot;the worst thing possible&quot;, according to Dr Gerald Boalch, a marine biologist with 52 years&apos; service for the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. After the spill, the MBA&apos;s staff devoted all their days to studying it. At first, the chemical sprays seemed to work. &quot;The detergents made it look good,&quot; says Boalch. &quot;We thought at the time it was doing a good job because the oil was disappearing.&quot; But colleagues conducted lab tests &quot;and it was realised that it was making the oil more toxic because it was accessible to organisms&quot;. At sea, the oil was made soluble by the detergents, which then meant it was taken in by more living organisms. On shore, the chemicals destroyed lichens and other beach-life probably for ever, says Boalch. A year after Torrey Canyon, the MBA published its conclusions: it was scathing about the disastrous use of detergents, applied by methods &quot;that were largely ineffective, uneconomic, and wasteful of effort&quot;. The Torrey Canyon disaster did have some beneficial consequences. International maritime regulations on pollution were created. A charismatic young botanist called David Bellamy was asked to comment on the disaster and became a television star; he, and the oil slick, helped raise awareness of pollution. If our growing addiction to oil was not questioned, our methods for tackling spills were. When the supertanker Cadiz spilt crude oil off Brittany in 1978, Boalch &quot;insisted&quot; the authorities should not use detergents. &quot;They didn&apos;t and it recovered much quicker,&quot; says Boalch now. But the French had already proved wiser than the British when cleaning up Torrey Canyon crude. Rather than bombard the slick with Napalm or toxic detergents in 1967, they used powdered craie de Champagne \u2013 humble chalk, which sunk the oil more effectively than expensive, toxic British detergents. &quot;It would seem that the French were successful in preventing the bulk of this very large oil mass from coming ashore,&quot; the MBA researchers concluded. In Guernsey, in 2010, the authorities are also now trying to remove the last of the Torrey Canyon oil in an environmentally friendly way. Last month, they began to pump micro-organisms into the oily water, which is aerated by a small generator running 24 hours a day. This process of &quot;bioaugmentation&quot; uses naturally occurring bacteria for whom oil is a food source to break down the oil. The government predicts that the rapidly multiplying micro-organisms will have eaten the oil by the end of the year. Does Le Cras think it will work? &quot;Proof is in the pudding, isn&apos;t it?&quot; she says. &quot;I hope everything they say comes true. It will be a great day for us when it happens.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jun/25/renault-formula-one-resurgence", "sentences": ["That saga was the &quot;accident&quot; in which Nelson Piquet Jr crashed his car at the Singapore grand prix so that his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, could win."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-25T18:51:08Z", "title": "Renault's fresh faces breathe life into tainted team", "tags": ["Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Robert Kubica", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "It is unlikely that the two Renault cars will glint into the Spanish sunshine here tomorrow freshly liveried, with the traditional yellow replaced by deep purple and pink spots \u2013 but if they did so, no one should be entirely surprised. With two new drivers this season, a new team principal and a new main stakeholder, they resemble a reformed felon attempting to purge his past which, of course, is hardly an inappropriate analogy since the team were Formula One&apos;s panto villain after the &quot;Crashgate&quot; scandal two years ago. That saga was the &quot;accident&quot; in which Nelson Piquet Jr crashed his car at the Singapore grand prix so that his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, could win. The team principal, Flavio Briatore, was handed a lifetime ban, the most severe in the history of the sport while Renault were given a two-year suspended sentence. Today, though, they have emerged from the shadows to establish themselves as the best of the rest in the paddock. They are not only cleansed, but are thriving too. The brash Briatore&apos;s replacement might be his alter ego. The 36-year-old Eric Boullier is a generation younger, a quiet, bespectacled engineer who is known to frown upon the paddock excesses which are part of the sport&apos;s glitzy appeal. He had no experience in Formula One before this season, although his background in GP2 and A1GP is extensive. &quot;There is no real secret for this transformation,&quot; he said. &quot;It is all down to the team.&quot; Under interrogation, though, he concedes: &quot;Maybe I do have some management skills and an understanding of human nature.&quot; Boullier represents the new generation of team principals. A short time ago it seemed that one had to be a cross between Stalin and Caligula to fill this particular role; today someone with sensibilities is required, a Richard Briers or a vicar who is handy with spanners. &quot;Formula One needs to work more as a global industry,&quot; he said. &quot;We should work more together for the interests of the sport rather than just look after ourselves. I am not naive. There are egos and interests out there. But F1 needs to behave and have one voice, like the Olympic Games. We need to develop for the interests of F1, we need to walk as one community and with one aim.&quot; Boullier is an impressive leader. But the man who has done most to revitalise Renault&apos;s fortunes is the extraordinary Robert Kubica, one of the five or six best drivers on the planet yet someone who, outside his native Poland, could walk unrecognised. He claims, with a wicked wink, that he is the third most famous Pole, after the late Pope John Paul II and the economist Leszek Balcerowicz. This lover of snooker, ten-pin bowling, skiing and poker still has one obsession \u2013 driving \u2013 and he frequently races in rallies, which he dominates with embarrassing ease. He has regularly overperformed in Formula One this season too, with a second, third and a fourth, although he has been unable to add to his solitary victory, in Montreal in 2008. Unfortunately television viewing figures dipped at the time because Poland were playing Germany in Euro 2008. Kubica, 25, simply does not make mistakes and has been described by Lewis Hamilton as the most difficult driver to overtake. He is certainly the best driver not at one of the leading four teams and was strongly linked with Ferrari until the Scuderia gave Felipe Massa a fresh two-year contract. Valencia, too, has been kind to Renault over the years Now, with Mark Webber re-signed by Red Bull, there is no top drive for Kubica next season, unless it is with Mercedes, for whom Michael Schumacher continues to toil. When Kubica was asked whether he would be staying with Renault today he said: &quot;I don&apos;t know. I haven&apos;t made my decision yet. It&apos;s not keeping flexible. I don&apos;t think what I will be doing in three years&apos; time \u2013 I don&apos;t think what I will be doing in three weeks&apos; time.&quot; Boullier is confident that Kubica will be driving for a top team next season and that the team will be Renault. &quot;We are optimistic,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s nearly done \u2013 there is a contract in my suitcase.&quot; From Kubica&apos;s point of view this reinvented team probably offer the best seat next season."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/jun/26/mbna-balance-transfer-failed-debt-arrears", "sentences": ["Towards the end of my secondment in Singapore I began to receive emails from MBNA telling me that my accounts were in arrears."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-25T23:01:21Z", "title": "All that was transferred by MBNA was countless bills for arrears", "tags": ["Consumer affairs", "Consumer rights", "Money"], "article": "I returned to the UK in April after working for nearly four months overseas.

Born in Wisconsin on 9\u00a0March 1959, Barbara Millicent Roberts is the world&apos;s most famous supermodel. She drives a Corvette convertible, owns a dream home with a pool, parties with jocks and adores shopping. In the US,\u00a0she was a\u00a0prom queen and a role model. In\u00a0China, she is emerging as an ambassador for consumer culture. Better known as Barbie, this 30cm-tall icon was first sold in China in the early 1990s, but it was not until 2009 that she was given her own home in the retail heartland of Shanghai. Mattel,\u00a0the world&apos;s biggest toy company, marked her 50th\u00a0birthday by opening the planet&apos;s largest Barbie emporium. Covered in pink plastic, the six-storey doll&apos;s house on Huaihai Road became an instant landmark. Martial arts star Jet Li and the actor Christy Chung were among the celebrities at its launch. This was more than a party; it was the start of a marketing campaign aimed at prolonging and expanding the lifestyle championed by the toy firm. For the Barbie market to continue to grow for another 50 years, the doll would have to\u00a0make it big in China. When I lunch at Barbie&apos;s place, in the fantastically kitsch restaurant with a menu devised by chef David Laris, it doesn&apos;t seem to be hugely popular. Along with Barbie\u2122 burgers with Barbie\u2122 pink sauce, Ken burgers, pinktastic pasta, doll-icious desserts and Barbie\u2122 tini cocktails, the restaurant boasts generous promotional offers: those opting for the special meal receive a boxed set of Barbie plates and cutlery to take away. I ask Liu Yunting, who works for an advertising company, what she plans to do with her new tableware. &quot;I will use it myself,&quot; she says. Isn&apos;t it a little childish? &quot;Not at all. It is cute. This is much better than the stuff for children. We\u00a0know better how to appreciate it.&quot; Liu is a member of the fastest-growing consumer class: single women \u2013 or xiaobailing (white-collar princesses). They have high levels of disposable income and a craving for designer labels. For marketing moguls, they are the future face of consumer power. State\u00a0planners forecast that half the population will be middle class by 2020. Until recently, China was living within the planet&apos;s means. If everyone in the world consumed what the average Mr or Mrs Wang did in 2007, we&apos;d just about stay within the sustainable resources of our planet. Humanity would have a balanced ecological budget. But, understandably, Mr and Mrs Wang wanted to keep up with Mr and Mrs Jones on the other side of the Pacific. That was human nature. It was also bad news for the environment, because if we all ate, shopped and travelled like those average Americans, we&apos;d need 4.5 Earths.     A mall in Xujiahui, Shanghai. Photograph:  /Reuters    In recent years, the planet&apos;s largest corporations have become dependent on the Wangs catching up with the Joneses. The US had shopped until its economy dropped. Sinking in debt, plagued by obesity and increasingly dependent on military might to protect its lifestyle, the world&apos;s superconsumer was groaning with indigestion. Europe was too decrepit and conservative to take up the slack, so global manufacturers, retailers and restaurant chains were desperate to stimulate the Chinese appetite. Shanghai was their beachhead. While information firms and political lobbyists headed to Beijing and manufacturers flocked to Guangzhou, retail giants almost invariably chose Shanghai for their China headquarters and their first showrooms. From Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald&apos;s and Starbucks to Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Chanel, international brands made the city a giant shopping mall. Shanghai became the biggest, richest, most globalised mass of modernity in China, home to the most luxurious boutiques, the tallest buildings, the nation&apos;s first formula one track, the biggest auto companies, the second busiest port in the world and a gathering horde of international salesmen trying to sell the American consumer lifestyle. Chinese consumers have never had more options. America&apos;s Wal-Mart, France&apos;s Carrefour, Britain&apos;s Tesco and Japan&apos;s Ito Yokado are expanding in China faster than in any other country. Each year, they open hundreds of new stores in the expectation that demand will surge as more rural migrants move into cities and work their way into the middle class. Young urbanites are becoming as enthusiastic about french fries, burgers and fried chicken as their counterparts in New York or London. When the first KFC opened near Tiananmen Square in 1987, it was seen as a novel western dining experience; 20 years later, the company has 2,000 outlets in 400 cities, employing 200,000 people, making it easily the biggest restaurant chain in China. In roughly the same period, McDonald&apos;s had grown from one restaurant to 800. Along with the changing diet came a surge in obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Obese children used to be rare in China; now nearly 15% of the population is overweight. Shanghai is often cited as the worst affected city. Barbie\u2122 burgers and the like are part of an increasingly carnivorous diet. To\u00a0feed its growing livestock, China imports huge quantities of soya, much of it from Brazil, which has resulted in accelerated clearance of Amazonian forest and Cerrado savanna. Like many other wealthy cities, the high-protein, high-octane, jet-set lifestyle is being paid for elsewhere. I meet my guide, Emily Zhang Huijia, a connoisseur of consumption, outside number 18 the Bund. Once the China HQ of Standard Chartered Bank, the Bund is now a centre for shopping, eating and clubbing. Emily is its PR manager. A fashionista since her teens, she has worked for Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Chanel, and says she was brought up on Vogue, Glamour and OK! magazines. By western standards, her childhood was not privileged. In 1985, when she was three, her family got its first colour television. In 1992, around the time the first Barbies went on sale in China, they bought their first air-conditioner; so did everyone in the neighbourhood. The Zhangs had their first fixed phone line installed when Emily was six. By the time she was 16, they were connected to the internet. My family in the UK had a phone three generations before Emily&apos;s, but her parents went online four years earlier than mine. By 2006, the average person in Shanghai owned two mobile phones, 1.7 air-conditioners, 1.7 colour television sets, more than one fridge and spent 14,761 yuan a year (around \u00a31,455), some 70% more than the rest of the country. They use almost twice as much toilet paper as the average in developed nations and have a bigger carbon footprint than people in the UK. The city is consuming beyond the planet&apos;s means, and its appetite is growing by the day. By the time Emily&apos;s generation were earning a salary, they could afford more than the essentials; they could buy style. &quot;I&apos;m a Shanghai girl,&quot; she says. &quot;We don&apos;t earn so much, but we see luxury brands every day. We don&apos;t want to buy anything else.&quot; Most of her friends are in the industry and\u00a0they share information about discounts and sample sales. At her first sale, she blew a third of her salary on Fendi sunglasses. &quot;It is like a fever,&quot; she says. &quot;The price is so low, you cannot refuse.&quot; Like many a proud shopper, Emily lists how much she saved rather than how much she spent. She is wearing a half-price Dior watch reduced by 2,900 yuan (\u00a3286). In her 40 sq m flat near Fuxing Park, she has dozens of other bags, accessories and clothes, including an Armani coat for 999 yuan (\u00a398), discounted from 9,900 (\u00a3976). Compared with friends, she says, she is restrained. In the last three years, Emily&apos;s monthly salary has increased from 3,000 yuan to just under 20,000, putting her firmly in the middle-class bracket. She eats at restaurants at weekends, has a French boyfriend, plays poker every Thursday. Business and pleasure are mixed. Her favourite after-hours hangout, she says, is the building where she works. &quot;Bund 18 has the coolest nightclub in Shanghai, so it&apos;s probably also the coolest in China.&quot; We agree to meet there again at midnight. After dark, the Bund&apos;s spotlit neoclassical pillars and low-rise architecture are reminiscent of London. On the other side of the Huangpu river, however, the futuristic Pudong skyline rises higher than almost anywhere on Earth, including one of the world&apos;s tallest buildings, the 492m bottle opener-shaped Shanghai World Financial Centre. Twenty years ago, most of Pudong was farmland. Today, it pulsates with light and colour. The crowd in the club is made up mostly of expat western men and their Chinese girlfriends. In the cigar lounge, Emily introduces me to a French food and beverage manager, Julian Desmettre, who describes how the nouveau riche from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have made the city their playground: &quot;Shanghai is like Paris during la belle \u00e9poque. This is the city of wealth and style, where people must show their money, where they are judged by how they dress, where they look down on those with less than themselves.&quot; Julian arrived in Shanghai as a student eight years ago with 5,000 yuan in his pocket. Now, he has on his wrist an Omega watch worth six times that amount. &quot;My life here is better than in France. I have a big apartment, a cleaner, a compound with a pool and a gym. It is so comfortable, it is almost too much.&quot; Most revellers in the lounge are European. &quot;Where can I meet Chinese partygoers?&quot; I\u00a0ask Emily, but she is reluctant to recommend anywhere: &quot;There are clubs, but they are the type of place you&apos;d find in a second-tier city. The music and decor are not as good, but Chinese men prefer them because they don&apos;t want to be near foreigners. Chinese women are different. They are\u00a0more open. They go where the quality is.&quot; Wandering around local bars and restaurants, I\u00a0meet bar owners who organise prostitutes for customers and set up trips to karaoke parlours, where hostesses strip off to sing. Shanghai seems to be emulating the consumer sex industry of Tokyo; the hostess bar scene is reminiscent of Japan at the height of its &quot;bubble economy&quot;. The next day, Emily introduces me to Cindy Tai, the head of a marketing agency and former head of EMI Music in China, who helped organise the first Rolling Stones concert in Shanghai. As a child during the Cultural Revolution, Cindy and her academic parents were sent from Shanghai to a farm on the nearby island of Chongming. &quot;We had enough to eat, but nothing to spare. We were very happy if we got a little meat on the table once a week. My\u00a0parents suffered. I vowed that one day I\u00a0would buy them whatever they wanted.&quot; She has achieved that ambition; now, her dream is &quot;to create an organic farm. I&apos;d like to grow fruit, vegetables and rice, raise pigs and chickens. And to have a helicopter, because the traffic is so bad.&quot; But like many affluent consumers around the world, Cindy&apos;s environmentalism seems selective. She has blueberries delivered from an organic farm, baguettes from a French bakery in Xintiandi and olive oil from Italy. She eats out at least once a day, and at one point she and her French husband had four cars: a BMW, an MG and two Mercs. Now they have two; a sign, she says, of their increasing concern for the planet. Later, however, she reveals that her interest has switched to yachts. One is moored near their second home in Cannes. She may yet get another luxury car. Cindy is a member of the Shanghai Porsche club, mainly to\u00a0keep up with her friends, and has been invited to an awards ceremony hosted by Jaguar. I\u00a0shamelessly ask if I can come along. The venue for the Jaguar Gorgeous Award Party is a renovated mansion off Huaihai Road, a few minutes&apos; walk from the Barbie store. In cocktail dresses and designer suits, guests sip wine in the courtyard, where they are treated to a sales pitch for the new 5-litre XKR: &quot;It is a wow car!&quot; gushes a PR lady who introduces herself by her westernised name, Seraph. I am sceptical: &quot;But you can barely move in Shanghai&apos;s traffic. Why would anyone want such a\u00a0huge engine?&quot; &quot;Rich people never take the subway,&quot; Seraph replies. &quot;Even if the traffic is bad, they need a car. Jaguar is nothing but gorgeous and beautiful.&quot; In the five years to 2009, sales of luxury cars in China rose five-fold, de luxe villas seven-fold and luxury goods tripled. This was just the start of a spending splurge: the number of wealthy households is forecast to double again by 2015. Earthwatch Institute estimates that if China&apos;s 1.3 billion people were to consume at the same rate as Americans, global production of steel, paper and cars would have to double, oil output would need to rise by 20m barrels a day and miners would have to dig an extra 5bn tons of coal. If it followed the US appetite, China would chew its way through 80% of current meat production and two-thirds of the global grain harvest. &quot;China is telescoping history,&quot; says Lester Brown, president of Earthwatch. &quot;It forces us to focus on what happens when huge numbers of low-income people rise rapidly in affluence. Chinese consumption shows the need to reconstruct the world economy.&quot; Instead of relying on an ever greater consumption of resources to generate growth, Brown says mankind needs to move to a fairer, more sustainable model. Yet the opposite seems to be happening. Global corporations and the communist government are trying to make China the greatest shopper of them all. In Shanghai, that goal is already being realised. By one estimate, the average carbon dioxide emissions of its residents have already overtaken those in Tokyo, New York and London. If there is a glimmer of environmental hope, it is that even in Shanghai people have not yet fully embraced western levels of throwaway consumption. Many still prefer flasks of hot tea to cans of Coke, and in the supermarkets the average basket of goods is smaller than in the west and profit margins are lower. This thrift is not inspired by environmental concerns, but by a\u00a0traditional desire to live within one&apos;s means. Even so, the rest of the country has some way to go to catch up with Shanghai, which is what the government wants. This will require a great deal more energy and raw materials. To provide everyone with a Shanghai lifestyle, factories will\u00a0need to churn out an extra 159 million refrigerators, 213 million televisions, 233 million computers, 166 million microwave ovens, 260 million air-conditioners and 187 million cars. The retail market, meanwhile, is becoming less diverse the bigger it grows. Paul French, a Shanghai-based marketing consultant, says the problem is that the shopping malls designed to create the image of a good life do not reflect reality for most people: &quot;They are building more and more malls filled with luxury brands. Like the power stations in Soviet-era Russia, they are being built not because of demand but because of prestige. Every official in China wants one to show their city is on the international map.&quot; These emporiums are designed to generate desire, not meet needs. Many are dismissed by locals as gui gouwu zhongxin (ghost malls) because they attract so few customers. Yet in Shanghai they are everywhere. Xujiahui intersection, for example, is ringed by six department stores. Among them is the Orient Shopping Mall, boasting Est\u00e9e Lauder cosmetics, Rolex watches, Cartier pens and Dior lipstick. Passing through the revolving door one weekday morning, I\u00a0see not a single customer. Not even a window shopper.

Separately EnCore Oil and Nautical Petroleum - which each own 15% of the licence - said the whole Catcher block could contain up to 300m barrels, although it was too soon to say the likely recovery rate. EnCore has added 15p to 50.5p while Nautical is up 29.75p to 168.5p. On Premier, analyst Richard Rose at Oriel Securities said:  Regardless of further upside, the discoveries are clearly commercial and we would expect that development studies will begin soon to bring the fields rapidly into production. We have upgraded our net asset value for Premier by 57p a share to 1696p a share, and now include 113p for Catcher based on 65m barrels recoverable gross (mid-point of the guided reserve range) risked at 75%.

These are the applicants for Chevening scholarships, whose hopes for receiving education in Britain are now in limbo as the government reviews its expenses. First started in 1983, the Chevening programme is touted by the UK government as a prestigious international scholarship scheme that fully or partly funds some 1,000 individuals from over 130 countries to pursue postgraduate studies in British universities every year. In May, the Foreign Office \u2013 which administers the scheme \u2013 announced that it was reviewing the scholarships programme as part of its planned \u00a355m budget savings in line with the new government&apos;s directive to trim expenditure by \u00a36bn across the public sector. For current applicants, the next few days will be crucial. A statement on the Chevening website says existing offers cannot be confirmed until the end of this month or early next month. &quot;We do understand the frustration that this will cause but ask those affected to be patient.&quot; Some of these people are likely to have turned down job offers and other funding opportunities after being offered a scholarship while the Labour government was still at the helm. Little wonder, then, that a group of Chevening alumni and hopefuls have banded together to lobby for the programme&apos;s continuation, taking their campaign to Facebook by forming the Save Chevening group. As a former recipient who can vouch for its worth first-hand, I find the Chevening&apos;s possible death of a lamentable, even grim, prospect. On a personal level, the scheme had changed my life. It accorded me the opportunity to pursue a credible overseas education that would have otherwise been closed off to someone with limited financial resources. I have met fellow cash-strapped scholars who would attest likewise. Yet Chevening is more than just a developmental aid programme; it is above all Britain&apos;s best attempt at solving transnational issues. For one thing, the Chevening scheme can help plug knowledge gaps in other countries. In my case, the disciplines I chose to pursue \u2013 comparative literature and translation studies \u2013 were not offered at Singapore universities during my candidacy. Today, comparative literature still remains elusive. While reading these subjects at the University of Edinburgh, I met two south-east Asian scholars who were pursuing environment-related programmes that were not taught at their respective home countries. In a densely forested region struggling to cope with issues of climate change, their choice is naturally apt. It is also significant that the Foreign Office is willing to sponsor individuals undertaking intellectual pursuits in unconventional fields like comparative literature. Our pursuit of alternative ideas helps us to inject fresh perspectives into existing problems in our non-British contexts. That process for me began sooner rather than later when a Singapore newspaper published my article urging local policymakers to study Scotland&apos;s strategy of celebrating its diaspora. In our quest to retain talents, Singapore&apos;s thrust has been to bemoan our lost sons and daughters, and the Scottish example suggested an alternative approach. For Britain, the Chevening programme offers its people a chance to engage with the brightest in emerging countries in a way that is not condescending. This is especially significant in advancing its relations with former colonies like Singapore and India where Britain is vulnerable to accusations of re-colonisation given its imperial past. If I could factor in my personal \u2013 albeit small \u2013 contribution, then this could be exemplified in the way my collaboration with other non-western coursemates at the University of Edinburgh led the comparative literature department to introduce modules on postcolonial and world literature in a programme that until then was largely Eurocentric. By ensuring that the British people remain in the thick of innovative developments worldwide, the Chevening scheme is an important nation-building tool that also benefits Britain. In fact, in many countries it has become as much a symbol of Britain as the Queen. Long live Chevening."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/30/tate-lyle-sugar-business-sale", "sentences": ["Tate has also mothballed a factory in Alabama and shifted all its production of the artificial sweetener to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-06-30T20:00:42Z", "title": "Tate & Lyle's sugar division to be sold for \u00a3200m", "tags": ["Tate and Lyle", "Business", "UK news", "Food & drink industry"], "article": "The world&apos;s oldest brand \u2013 Lyle&apos;s Golden Syrup \u2013 is to change hands tomorrow when Tate &amp; Lyle announces the sale of its historic sugar business to American Sugar Refining for about \u00a3200m. The company behind Splenda sweetener and the Mr Cube adverts is expected to reveal the details of the deal to the stock exchange tomorrow morning. Three years ago ASR snapped up Tate&apos;s Canadian sugar business for \u00a3130m. The deal is likely to raise fears of job losses at Tate &amp; Lyle&apos;s refinery in Silvertown, in the East End of London, which has been operating for more than 130 years. Tate &amp; Lyle is valued at more than \u00a32bn on the stock exchange, and City analysts had forecast in the spring that the new Tate boss, Javed Ahmed, was likely to cut ties with the 150-year-old sugar business. Ahmed \u2013 who was lured from the top performing stock market favourite Reckitt Benckiser \u2013 conducted a strategic review of the business when he was appointed last year. However, in May he appeared to scotch rumours that he wanted to sell the UK sugar business, which now only accounts for one-third of Tate &amp; Lyle&apos;s profits. The other two-thirds comes from sweeteners, starches and ethanol production. Ahmed outlined a new strategy centred on the food ingredients business as &quot;the key focus of investment and long-term growth&quot;. He also promised &quot;a number of important changes to the group&apos;s organisation&quot;. Last year the company made underlying profits before tax of \u00a3229m \u2013 down 7% from the previous year. &quot;Our core value-added food ingredients delivered a strong result,&quot; Ahmed told the City. &quot;We are refocusing our strategy, with our speciality food ingredients business being the key focus of investment and long-term growth.&quot; Tate &amp; Lyle traces its roots back to 1859, when the Lancashire-born grocer Henry Tate, the son of a Unitarian minister, went into partnership with John Wright, a sugar refiner in Liverpool. When that partnership came to an end, Tate was joined in business by his two sons to create Henry Tate &amp; Sons. The company went on to introduce the sugar cube to the UK in 1875. At around the same time he also funded the building of the Tate Gallery in London and donated his own art collection. Abram Lyle, a Scottish shipowner, was also a Victorian entrepreneur. Having transported sugar for years, he expanded into sugar refining in 1875 and by 1885 he was turning out Lyle&apos;s Golden Syrup \u2013 a waste product from sugar refining. The two companies merged in 1921 and at that time they refined half the country&apos;s sugar. The merged business was one of the original constituents of the FTSE-30 index created in 1935, and only two still exist. Mr Cube was created in 1949 as part of a fierce campaign to prevent the post-war Labour government of Clement Attlee nationalising the business but went on to be an advertising icon long after the threat had disappeared. In 1965 a period of diversification began, into starch production in the US, sugar refining abroad, citric acid (used in everything from flavour enhancers in food to metal polish and cough mixture) and salmon feed for farmed fish. In 1976, working with researchers from the then Queen Elizabeth College at the University of London, Tate &amp; Lyle discovered the calorie-free sweetener Sucralose, later renamed Splenda. Tate &amp; Lyle became the sole manufacturer and seller. By the 1980s it had moved into the soft drinks market in the US, buying AE Staley, which manufactures high-fructose corn syrup \u2013 a common ingredient in processed foods and drinks. However, in recent years the company has run into problems in the sugar business: falling demand, intense competition, supply problems and rising energy costs means Tate&apos;s refining business barely makes a profit. Elsewhere, the company&apos;s Fort Dodge corn plant, in Iowa, has been mothballed, resulting in a \u00a3217m write-off charge last year. Tate has also mothballed a factory in Alabama and shifted all its production of the artificial sweetener to Singapore."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/01/tate-lyle-sale-sugar-business", "sentences": ["Tate has also mothballed a factory in Alabama and shifted all its production of Splenda to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-01T12:38:00Z", "title": "Tate & Lyle agrees sale of historic sugar business for \u00a3211m", "tags": ["Tate and Lyle", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "The world&apos;s oldest brand \u2013 Lyle&apos;s Golden Syrup \u2013 is changing hands, with confirmation this morning that Tate &amp; Lyle has agreed the sale of its historic sugar business to American Sugar Refining (ASR) for \u00a3211m.

We need these operations, and Tate &amp; Lyle&apos;s refinery in Lisbon.&quot; Valued at more than \u00a32bn on the stock exchange, Tate &amp; Lyle is Europe&apos;s leading cane sugar producer, but now makes two-thirds of its profits from sweeteners, starches and ethanol production; it is the company behind Splenda sweetener. City analysts had forecast in the spring that the new Tate boss, Javed Ahmed, was likely to cut ties with the 150-year-old sugar business. The cash raised from the deal \u2013 which gives ASR use of the Tate &amp; Lyle brand in connection with sugars in perpetuity \u2013 with be used to reduce Tate&apos;s \u00a3814m debt pile. Ahmed, who was lured from top-performing stock market favourite Reckitt Benckiser last year, wants to concentrate resources on growing Tate &amp; Lyle&apos;s food ingredients operations. Unveiling the deal this morning, he said: &quot;Sugar refining has enjoyed a long and proud history within Tate &amp; Lyle, but we believe the interests of this business and its employees are now best served by being part of a company for whom sugar refining is core.&quot; Some analysts, however, questioned Ahmed&apos;s strategy and the low price he has achieved for the sugar business. Howard Wheeldon at BGC Partners, said: &quot;Reducing debt is one thing \u2013 selling a company birthright for a pittance to become what management apparently term as something more focused and less volatile is quite another.&quot; He added: &quot;Refining sugar might be a pretty humdrum and boring business using plants that often look as if they were built at the time of the ark, but it has served Tate &amp; Lyle shareholders very well over past 100 or so years. Better still it has and continues to generate oodles of cash.&quot; However, analyst Dirk van Vlaanderen of Jefferies said selling the sugar business was the right strategy: &quot;We see the move as positive as it offers a cash injection and a move away from commoditised businesses.&quot; Three years ago ASR snapped up Tate &amp; Lyle Canada for \u00a3130m, having already acquired Tate&apos;s subsidiary North American Sugars in 2001. Ahmed said the deal would result in a &quot;more focused, less volatile business&quot;, enabling it to deliver sustainable long-term growth in food ingredients, supported by cash from its bulk ingredients operations. &quot;This disposal will enable us to concentrate our resources on delivering our strategic objectives as we focus, fix and grow our business,&quot; he added. As well as the golden syrup factory and the London refineries, the deal includes Tate &amp; Lyle&apos;s cane sugar refineries in Lisbon together with associated sugar and syrup brands. The businesses had sales of \u00a3689m in the year to end March and operating profit of \u00a314m. The sale is expected to throw up a book loss of about \u00a355m before disposal costs, but will be earnings neutral in 2011. Tate said it also planned to sell the remaining businesses within the division, principally its molasses and Vietnamese sugar operations. Luis Fernandez, co-president of ASR, said the Tate &amp; Lyle heritage was safe in his company&apos;s hands: &quot;Tate &amp; Lyle is steeped in 130 years of tradition and consumer loyalty,&quot; he said. &quot;We recognise the importance and history of the Tate &amp; Lyle sugar brand and are proud to add it to our existing brand portfolio.&quot; ASR, based in Yonkers, New York, owns and operates six cane sugar refineries across North America. Its brands include Domino, Florida Crystals and Redpath. Birth of a brandTate &amp; Lyle traces its roots back to 1859, when Lancashire-born grocer Henry Tate, the son of a Unitarian minister, went into partnership with John Wright, a sugar refiner in Liverpool. When that partnership came to an end, Tate was joined in business by his two sons to create Henry Tate &amp; Sons. The company went on to introduce the sugar cube to the UK in 1875. At around the same time Henry Tate also funded the building of the Tate Gallery in London and donated his own art collection. Abram Lyle, a Scottish shipowner, was also a Victorian entrepreneur. Having transported sugar for years, he expanded into sugar refining in 1875 and by 1885 was turning out Lyle&apos;s Golden Syrup \u2013 a waste product from sugar refining. The two companies merged in 1921 and at that time they refined half the country&apos;s sugar. The merged business was one of the original constituents of the FTSE 30 index established in 1935, only two of which still exist. The cartoon character Mr Cube was created in 1949 as part of a fierce campaign to prevent the post-war Labour government of Clement Attlee nationalising the business, and went on to be an advertising icon long after the threat had disappeared. In 1965 a period of diversification began, into starch production in the US, sugar refining abroad, citric acid (used for many applications, from flavour enhancers in food to metal polish and cough mixture) and salmon feed for farmed fish. In 1976, working with researchers from the then Queen Elizabeth College at the University of London, Tate &amp; Lyle discovered the calorie-free sweetener sucralose, later renamed Splenda. The company became the sole manufacturer and seller. By the 1980s it had moved into the soft drinks market in the US, buying AE Staley, which manufactures high-fructose corn syrup \u2013 a common ingredient in processed foods and drinks. However, in recent years the company has run into problems in the sugar business: falling demand, intense competition, supply problems and rising energy costs mean Tate&apos;s refining business barely makes a profit. Elsewhere, the company&apos;s Fort Dodge corn plant, in Iowa, has been mothballed, resulting in a \u00a3217m write-off charge last year. Tate has also mothballed a factory in Alabama and shifted all its production of Splenda to Singapore."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jun/30/obama-bush-us-trade", "sentences": ["Beginning with its treaty with Chile \u2013 a nation that has almost unanimously been seen as using capital controls effectively, the US barred capital controls in trade deals with Singapore, Peru, Central America, and Morocco."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-01T13:00:27Z", "title": "Obama must ditch Bush-era trade deals | Kevin Gallagher", "tags": ["International trade", "Globalisation", "South Korea", "US news", "World news", "Business"], "article": "South Korea will join the growing group of nations that have recently resorted to currency controls in the wake of the global financial crisis. As a rash of new research has shown, such controls are legitimate tools to prevent and mitigate financial crises.  Yet if the pending South Korea-US free trade agreement that the US just agreed to expedite at the G20 meetings had been ratified by now, South Korea&apos;s actions would be deemed illegal.  As the Obama administration works to put Bush-era trade policy behind and forge a &quot;21st century trade policy&quot; it should fix this flaw that could be fatal to South Korea&apos;s financial stability. Like many other emerging markets, South Korea experienced highly volatile levels of capital both leading up to and in the wake of the global financial crisis. The most recent bout of capital inflows \u2013 that pushed up the value of the won \u2013 was largely due to the carry trade given the extremely low interest rates in the US and beyond. However, as the European debt crisis has caused a &quot;flight to safety&quot; where capital is again flocking to the US, the won has been pushed downward.  Starting today, South Korea will impose controls on capital to curtail on the amount of currency forward and derivatives trading that financial institutions can engage in. By putting caps on such leveraging, these measures should tame speculation on the currency and reduce volatility.  These policies are put in place after the nation already lowered interest rates to 2% so as to not attract speculative inflows. In addition to taming volatility then, the Economist adds that with &quot;the foreign-exchange limits in place it may be easier for the Bank of Korea to raise interest rates to a more appropriate level given the economy&apos;s rapid growth&quot;. South Korea joins Brazil, Taiwan, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil, and Venezuela on the list of nations that have deployed capital controls in the wake of the crisis. China has recently said that it may follow suit as well. While such moves would have been seen as blasphemous only a decade ago, they have recently been endorsed by the mainstream. Indeed, these measures follow a mountain of economic evidence in academia and by the international financial institutions, most notably the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. The IMF study found that those nations that deployed capital controls were among the least hard hit by the crisis.  Under the Bush administration, the US began outlawing capital controls in the investment chapters of its trade and investment treaties. Beginning with its treaty with Chile \u2013 a nation that has almost unanimously been seen as using capital controls effectively, the US barred capital controls in trade deals with Singapore, Peru, Central America, and Morocco. Such moves were highly controversial \u2013 then US trade representative Robert Zoellick had to go to Chile and personally grace the Chileans over this very issue in order to ink the deal. The pending treaty with South Korea was also negotiated by the Bush administration and remains marred in controversy on both sides of the Pacific. Like the other Bush deals, the South Korean deal shuns capital controls. Though it does provide cover for some of South Korea&apos;s prudential regulations, recent legal analyses suggest that many of the provisions would still be deemed illegal under the US treaty. The US treatment of capital controls is outdated, out of touch with contemporary economic analysis, and out of step with the treaties of its trading partners. Even Robert Zoellick (now president of the World Bank) has now cautiously lent support. On 16 June Zoellick had this to say about controls in Asia: &quot;In a time of policy turmoil like this, people are going to be experimenting with different things&quot;, and &quot;it&apos;s not a silver bullet but it doesn&apos;t surprise me that people are trying them and they may help at the margin&quot;. In terms of being out of step with the treaties of other major capital exporters, in a recent report for the United Nations, I find that almost every other multilateral, regional, or bilateral treaty either fully grants nations to deploy capital controls or at least provides a safeguard mechanism for times like these.  The Obama administration has pledged to do better and create 21st century trade agreements that are more in touch with today&apos;s realities. If the new plan doesn&apos;t give nations the room to manoeuver to prevent and mitigate financial crises it will stay stuck in the Bush era."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/04/grindr-the-new-sexual-revolution", "sentences": ["Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-03T23:07:37Z", "title": "Grindr: a new sexual revolution?", "tags": ["Social networking", "Sex", "Social trends", "Relationships", "Grindr"], "article": "Ever heard of Grindr? If you have, I&apos;m going to guess that you are male and gay; or male, technically straight and somewhat curious; or the straight friend of a gay man. If not, allow me to enlighten you. Grindr (pronounced &quot;grinder&quot;) is a free downloadable iPhone app which, it promises, will help you &quot;Find gay, bi, curious guys for free near you!&quot; Grindr harnesses GPS, allowing you to establish who else in your direct vicinity is also using Grindr. It shows you \u2013 on a gridded display \u2013 who these men are and what they look like; it&apos;ll tell you how far away from you (in feet, and even more thrillingly, fractions of feet) they are standing; and it will allow you to &quot;chat&quot; them, if they take your fancy. Although buried deep in the Grindr ethos is the idea that you shouldn&apos;t do in cyberspace what you could be easily be doing in person. Don&apos;t &quot;chat&quot; when you could actually, you know, chat. Grinding is an intoxicating experience. I was first introduced to it on the roof terrace of a bar in east London by my friends J and W. J launched the app on his iPhone and I got palpitations as the grid of portraits (ordered in terms of geographical proximity \u2013 your nearest Grindr user is posted at the top left) instantly unfurled itself across the screen. All these men, effectively coming on to \u2013 well, not me, but still\u2026 It is literally a sexy app and the overflow of that sexual potency, the decadence, sweeps you along on a wave of lust, regardless of who you are and what your gender or sexual orientation might be. I was reminded of the first time I entered words into the search criteria on Google, of the first time I downloaded music from iTunes \u2013 I knew I was engaging with a bit of technology that would alter things on a profound level. I scrolled on and on through the grid of gay offerings, furtively trying to match the pixelated images with the real-life men ranged around me in the bar. &quot;But do you want to know the funny thing?&quot; J said. &quot;The best nights you can have on Grindr are the nights when you stay in.&quot; And he laughed, wickedly. Grindr is reconfiguring the landscape of human relationships. Partly because it&apos;s sex in an app, the sexual equivalent of ordering take-away, or online fashion (my friend Kevin calls it &quot;net-a-port-gay.com&quot;, and he&apos;s so pleased with himself for this he says I can use his real name. Everyone else asked to remain anonymous). Grindr was launched on 25 March 2009; now more than 700,000 (and counting) men in 162 countries around the world are using it to phenomenal effect, if J, W, Kevin and the other gay men I&apos;ve asked are any kind of a guide. &quot;I&apos;ve never, ever had so much sex in my life!&quot; R told me gleefully. &quot;I&apos;ve probably had as much in the past eight months of Grinding as I have over the 20 years since I came out. Maybe more.&quot; It&apos;s only going to get bigger, to facilitate more sex. Two thousand people download it every day, and a BlackBerry-friendly version of the app launched less than a month ago \u2013 a development which could triple Grindr&apos;s reach. But Grindr is more significant even than that suggests. It marks a major evolution in how all of us \u2013 gay, straight, alive \u2013 will meet and interact with each other. Depending on who you talk to, this is either brilliant (liberating, socially enabling \u2013 the end, even, of loneliness and boredom); or a potential disaster (signalling the end of monogamy, facilitating sex addiction). Either way, it matters. Arguably we are living in a post-gay era. The divide between gay and straight worlds diminishes daily. Gay culture and straight culture become increasingly intertwined. For example, Grindr&apos;s biggest boost occurred in June 2009, after gay icon Stephen Fry told the boorishly straight Jeremy Clarkson all about it during an interview on super-hetero TV show Top Gear. So Grindr would matter even if it was not in the process of developing a straight version of its sexy self. But it is. It is likely that the Grindr experience will be open to a straight market by the end of 2010. &quot;Oh, at the very latest,&quot; says Joel Simkhai, the founder of Grindr. He&apos;s a wiry, neatly handsome 33-year-old man with an American accent, a hectic manner and a sharp business edge. I meet him for coffee in a chic hotel in London. This is where he&apos;s basing himself while he checks out Grindr&apos;s flourishing UK market; he usually lives in Los Angeles. &quot;The UK is the second biggest country for Grindr after the US,&quot; he tells me. &quot;London is the third biggest city after New York and LA. You love us.&quot; Simkhai was born in Tel Aviv and he and his parents moved to New York (&quot;State, not the city&quot;) when he was three. He came out in his mid-teens &quot;just as AOL was taking off. I was born \u2013 gay-born \u2013 with online. And that was a huge help to me in terms of meeting people \u2013 people who unfortunately were a ways away in Wyoming or wherever \u2013 but still, I was meeting people who were gay and who weren&apos;t freaks.&quot; But Simkhai says he still felt isolated as a young gay teenager. He found himself asking: &quot;The question. I think every gay man starts asking it, from the moment he realises he&apos;s gay. You are somewhere and it&apos;s: &apos;Who else here, right now, is gay? Who?&apos; You are looking around, you are constantly wondering. Because coming out is a lonely process.&quot; Still? &quot;Yes! Very much so! And every gay man who asks himself that question also thinks: &apos;Wouldn&apos;t it be good if there was some way for me to tell? Some way for me to know?&apos; Every gay man has had the idea for Grindr.&quot; Nearly two decades later, after Simkhai had finished a degree in international relations and economics and worked for some years in finance, Apple launched its second-generation iPhone. &quot;It was almost as if someone was handing Grindr to me on a silver platter. The first iPhone didn&apos;t have GPS, and it only had about eight apps. They were all Apple apps, too \u2013 you couldn&apos;t develop your own. It really wasn&apos;t that great a device. But in the same announcement of the second-generation phone, they said: &apos;This phone will have GPS and now you can create apps!&apos; I was like: &apos;Wait a minute! I know an app I want to do!&apos;&quot;\u00a0 Did he have a complete notion of what he wanted from Grindr? How it would work, what it would look like, what sort of commotion it would create? &quot;Ha! No. My notion was use GPS, see who else is near. Simple as that.&quot; In August 2008, Simkhai contacted Morten Bek Ditlevsen, an app developer based in Denmark. &quot;He had a passion for GPS, just as I did. He&apos;s straight, but he liked the idea; he had a full-time job, but he said: &apos;Yeah, I&apos;ll do this as a hobby.&apos; Didn&apos;t ask for much money.&quot; Simkhai brought another friend, &quot;Scott Lewallen, an expert in branding, marketing and design&quot;, into the fold. Both still work on Grindr. It took Simkhai, Bek Ditlevsen and Lewallen six months and $5,000 to build Grindr. About the name: where did it come from? &quot;Nowhere specific. We liked the word. We liked the notion of a coffee grinder, mixing things together\u2026 And there&apos;s the term &apos;guy finder&apos; in there, too. We wanted something that was masculine but was not about pride flags. Was not about\u2026&quot; A politicised idea of gayness? &quot;Yes! And was fun! And was in a way \u2013 not about being gay. I&apos;m gay; I am a proud gay man. It&apos;s not that we have any issues, right? But Grindr&apos;s not about gay rights, or gay anything. It&apos;s about finding guys. Being among your peers. Socialising. Being part of your community. It&apos;s not about: &apos;We&apos;re here, we&apos;re queer.&apos;&quot; So Grindr launched in spring 2009. For the first few months uptake was steady but modest. Then Stephen Fry showed it to Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear &quot;and 40,000 men had downloaded it within a week. Amazing.&quot; Simkhai talks with great passion about his creation. He builds a beautiful case for Grindr. He trumpets its international, unifying aspect, making it sound like the United Nations of gayness. &quot;Here we are, 8,000 miles from home and we have 50,000 guys here in London. How? What? I haven&apos;t been here for 10 years \u2013 the first thing I did when I landed at Heathrow was launch Grindr! Sydney. Melbourne. Singapore. Tokyo! Tokyo is our fourth largest city, one of our top cities! I&apos;ve never been to Japan! I don&apos;t speak Japanese!&quot; He points out that Grindr is a response to online dating, which causes as many problems as it solves. &quot;With missed connections and back and forth, and: &apos;Oh actually, this week I&apos;m in New York, and you&apos;re in LA\u2026&apos; Online dating is frustrating! It is a lot of work!&quot; Grindr, on the other hand, is immediate. There is no messing about, no toing and froing, no building up your hopes via weeks of emails only to discover on your first physical date that you just don&apos;t fancy whoever in the flesh. You see someone&apos;s picture on Grindr, you meet immediately, you establish whether or not you&apos;re attracted to each other: &quot;Grindr reintroduces the aspect of chemistry. And \u2013 it&apos;s real. It is not a Second Life. It is not a virtual world. It&apos;s a tool. It enables real life, it doesn&apos;t replace it.&quot; And it leads, I say, to very real sex. None of this virtual nonsense. Simkhai pauses. &quot;Er\u2026 From my perspective\u2026 it&apos;s not sex. It&apos;s a precursor to sex. It&apos;s just before. That&apos;s how I see Grindr. We want to be sexy. We think sex is part of life, the basis of life. But Grindr is sexiness rather than sex.&quot; Simkhai is concerned, perhaps, about the conservative elements of the US media. Editorials on the danger of the &quot;new gay hook-up app&quot; pop up periodically. Simkhai is keen to make the point that Grindr is not uniquely concerned with procuring sex. &quot;I meet guys all the time who say to me: &apos;I know it&apos;s for hooking up, but\u2026 &apos; But they met some really good friends. But they met their boyfriend. But. But.&quot; Simkhai says his main hope for Grindr is it will help young gay men through the process of coming out. I am moved by Simkhai&apos;s passion, by the tales of the non-sexual impact of Grindr. I appreciate that it is still not easy to come out, and how important that sense of geographical proximity, of being part of a visible and accepting community, would be. The David Laws story breaks a fortnight after I interview Simkhai; a high-profile, sad piece of evidence that gay men still encounter problems in making their sexuality public. Yet the men I speak to tell me Grindr is all about sex. &quot;Internet&apos;s for dating; Grindr&apos;s for sex,&quot; D tells me. &quot;Well, sometimes the internet&apos;s for sex, too, but Grindr: definitely sex.&quot; I ask around and am inundated with Grindr stories, all of which end in a sexual encounter. &quot;Sometimes you don&apos;t really fancy them , but\u2026&quot; There&apos;s a sense of obligation to have sex anyway? &quot;Yeah. But that&apos;s OK.&quot; I begin to develop an idea of the culture that surrounds it. Many gay men see Grindr as a way to round off an evening. &quot;I&apos;d had dinner at a friend&apos;s house in west London and I was walking back to the tube; thought I&apos;d launch Grindr, see what was going on. This guy pops up and chats me: &apos;You&apos;re near!&apos; I chat back: &apos;I know\u2026 &apos; He says: &apos;I&apos;m here with my boyfriend. Come and see us.&apos; So\u2026 I did.&quot;\u00a0 Others use it as you might a glass of wine at the end of a stressful day. Kev lives near a major station: &quot;And so I get a lot of literal traffic. Men get off the train on Sunday night after a weekend somewhere stifling, probably with their parents; they launch Grindr \u2013 guess who pops up first?&quot; It&apos;s mixing formerly segregated elements of gay society. My 30- and 40-something gay male friends tell me they&apos;re having much more to do with younger gay men: &quot;Which is weird, and yeah, sometimes not totally comfortable, if you think about it,&quot; says one. &quot;You have to work out what&apos;s too young for you and stick to that limit. But \u2013 you&apos;re always honest about who you are. You&apos;ve got to be. You can&apos;t say you&apos;re younger or hotter than you are; you can&apos;t post someone else&apos;s photo. If you lie you&apos;re just going to get found out, and that pisses people off, obviously. Lying isn&apos;t done on Grindr.&quot; Cheating, on the other hand, definitely is. &quot;You always see on Grindr: &apos;Oh, I&apos;ve got a boyfriend \u2013 just interested in chatting!&apos;&quot; says Matthew Todd, editor of gay lifestyle magazine Attitude. &quot;Oh really? Why? Why do you need to chat to people? Why do you need to be on Grindr? Call your mum up!&quot; A gay man who is in a long-term relationship tells me he&apos;s aware of Grindr, but is choosing not to try it. &quot;It would change everything. I&apos;m very tempted, of course I am! But ultimately I don&apos;t want to go there, and I don&apos;t want my boyfriend F to go there either.&quot; &quot;The vast majority of guys on Grindr are in a relationship,&quot; says P. &quot;And I reckon a quarter of the guys who use it are straight. Not curious or bi or whatever. Straight.&quot; &quot;The straight ones are all talk!&quot; says D. &quot;They love the idea that sex with a stranger could be that easy, could be downloaded on their phone\u2026 But when it comes to it, they won&apos;t do anything.&quot; Not every gay man is enamoured of Grindr. Attitude&apos;s Matthew Todd has reservations. &quot;A friend with an iPhone showed me it about a year ago and said: &apos;Can you believe it?&apos; I rolled my eyes and thought: &apos;There is no way of stopping this.&apos; Find any new technology \u2013 we will always bring it back to sex.&quot; Todd&apos;s used it (&quot;I dip in and out&quot;) and he knows from feedback that Attitude&apos;s readers are using it a great deal. &quot;I think it&apos;s good for people to be able to connect. Especially young people. It&apos;s good to be able to see that there are other gay people around, and to be able to interact. But at the same time I think it&apos;s a very adult world. The commercial gay world \u2013 which Grindr is part of \u2013 is a very adult, very sexual world. And I worry when I see these young kids coming out on to the gay scene, and everything is about sex. There&apos;s no real concept of relationships.&quot; Others condemn it more directly. &quot;Grindr&apos;s addictive,&quot; writes one man \u2013 the ex-boyfriend of a close friend \u2013 by email. &quot;Grindr and Gaydar [the UK&apos;s biggest gay dating site]\u2026 A lot of gay men have addiction issues. I feel crap even writing it, but there it is. We drink, we use drugs and we use sex to overcome the shame we feel. And we feel worse because we know we shouldn&apos;t feel shame, we should feel pride \u2013 so we abuse drugs and sex more. Things like Grindr and Gaydar enable that sort of sex, sex which is compulsive and which dehumanises you; and means you in turn dehumanise the people you are having sex with.&quot; He puts me in touch with G, a man he met while seeking treatment for sex addiction. &quot;I&apos;ve lost entire weekends to sex,&quot; writes G. &quot;Downloading porn, going on Grindr, meeting men whose names I don&apos;t find out, having sex; downloading more porn\u2026&quot; &quot;Low self-esteem,&quot; says Todd. &quot;I see it a lot in gay men \u2013 it&apos;s inevitable after years of repression and shame. And what&apos;s better for self-esteem than someone having sex with you?&quot; Could Grindr work for a straight market? There is, I think, an undeniable gender divide on the things that men and women will do for sex, and the things they expect and want from sex. Yes, women are capable of having inconsequential flings. We are capable of one-night stands. We are capable of having sex without becoming emotionally involved. FitFinder \u2013 which allowed undergraduate users to post descriptions of people they&apos;d seen and fancied on their university-dedicated website \u2013 became extremely popular earlier this spring, before university authorities banned it, which would suggest that there is a straight market for a location-specific dating concept. But I&apos;m not sure Grindr could fully accommodate the complexities of male-female interactions. The gender politics, the power games, the ebb and flow of interest, the tedious but totally authentic need most men feel to pursue a potential sexual conquest\u2026 I ask a handful of straight women \u2013 some single, some not \u2013 if they think they might be interested in a Grindr equivalent; they say they can just about envisage it working, although none of them would commit to the notion of using it themselves. The straight men I poll say they&apos;d think less of any woman who &quot;advertised herself like that&quot; \u2013 and then all insisted on downloading gay Grindr on to their phones, &quot;just to see how it works&quot;. If anyone can make and sell a straight Grindr, Simkhai can. He does concede: &quot;I&apos;m a gay man and I know how to think like a gay man\u2026 actually, my sense is I know how to think like a man. I&apos;m not a woman. I don&apos;t know how to think like a woman.&quot; Yet he says he gets more requests for a straight Grindr from women than he does from straight men. &quot;Many more. Which might be because straight women are often friends with gay men, so know about Grindr\u2026 But I do think it would be relevant for women. I do.&quot; Furthermore: &quot;We&apos;ll redesign it; we&apos;ll call it something different, market it differently. We have to. Gay men are very territorial. They want to keep it all to themselves, but they say: &apos;If you have to make a straight version, call it something else. Grindr is ours.&apos;&quot; I am still sceptical, but then Simkhai says: &quot;This notion of: &apos;Who is around me? Who is in this room now? Who else is like me?&apos; \u2013 this is not just a gay thing. And this thing where: &apos;I want a more fulfilling life. A richer life!&apos; This is not just a gay thing either.

Talk that BP could bring in new investors pushed its shares up almost 5% this morning. Libya&apos;s state-owned oil group has expressed its interest in buying a stake in the bombed-out oil group and there are rumours that management have approached several sovereign wealth funds. BP&apos;s chief executive, Tony Hayward, meanwhile, has just arrived in Azerbaijan for a one-day visit which should provide investors with some insight into the firm&apos;s plans for its assets in the Caspian Sea. BP has interests in offshore gas and oil fields as well as a stake in an export oil pipeline which goes to Turkey. The company is looking to raise $10bn (\u00a36.58bn) through a series of disposals but its Caspian assets have not yet been among those earmarked for sale. Discussion of BP&apos;s options among traders has helped offset reports that the British government has become increasingly concerned that the company could collapse. A report in the Times said that the Department for Business and the Treasury are examining the potential impact of a takeover of BP, once Britain&apos;s biggest company, on UK interests domestically and around the world. As well as employing more than 10,000 people in the UK and providing a crucial dividend stream to pension funds, it owns key domestic infrastructure including the Forties Pipeline System that links up oil and gas fields in the North Sea. Billions of pounds have been wiped from the value of BP&apos;s shares since the Deepwater Horizon disaster, making the company vulnerable to a takeover. The environmental damage has now affected all the US states along the Gulf of Mexico, with &quot;tar balls&quot; reportedly discovered over the weekend along the Texas shore. Samples of the tar are currently being tested to determine if the oil came from the Deepwater Horizon spill. On Monday BP said that the spill has so far cost it $3.12bn (\u00a32bn). Vulnerable to rivals The dramatic fall in BP&apos;s share price as a result of the political and environmental storm that has erupted since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April, has left it vulnerable to a takeover. Rivals ExxonMobil, Total and Royal Dutch Shell have all been mooted as potential predators. In an effort to see-off unwanted advances, BP has been talking with major international investors in order to drum up interest in its shares. The company does not, however, want to issue new shares. Instead it would like new investors to pick up their stakes in the market. It has approached several sovereign wealth funds, a senior source in the United Arab Emirates told Reuters, including representatives in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Qatar and Singapore. The Kuwait Investment Authority already has a stake of 2.8% in BP while the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund has a 1.3% stake. On Monday Shokri Ghanem, chairman of Libya&apos;s national oil company, told the Zawya Dow Jones news service that BP is a bargain and the North African nation&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, should invest in it. &quot;BP is interesting now with the price lower by half, and I still have trust in BP,&quot; Ghanem added. Separately, it has emerged that BP has contacted its partners in the well to demand that they pick up part of the bill for the Gulf clean-up operation. BP has sent out demands for almost $400m to Anadarko and Japan&apos;s Mitsui Oil Exploration Company, both of which are minority shareholders in the well. Anadarko owns 25% of the well and Mitsui has 10%."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/06/hsbc-offshore-accounts-us-tax-clampdown", "sentences": ["The US government has begun a criminal investigation into whether clients of HSBC are evading tax by putting money in undeclared bank accounts in Singapore and India, widening a crackdown on offshore secrecy that began with a successful prosecution of Switzerland&apos;s UBS.", "He recently toured Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing to meet regulators and bankers."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-06T20:00:58Z", "title": "HSBC offshore accounts under investigation by US tax authorities", "tags": ["HSBC", "Business", "US economy", "Tax avoidance", "Banking", "UBS", "US news", "Singapore", "Switzerland", "World news", "US taxation", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The US government has begun a criminal investigation into whether clients of HSBC are evading tax by putting money in undeclared bank accounts in Singapore and India, widening a crackdown on offshore secrecy that began with a successful prosecution of Switzerland&apos;s UBS. A senior official at the US department of justice, Kevin Downing, has written to certain US residents with accounts at HSBC asking for details of their offshore holdings. The move has sparked speculation that HSBC has handed over clients&apos; personal information to the authorities. The US internal revenue service has been tightening the screw on alleged tax cheats who hide money overseas. Last year, UBS paid a $780m (\u00a3515m) fine and agreed to disclose the names of 4,450 account holders in a landmark softening of Switzerland&apos;s banking secrecy tradition. HSBC refused to comment today. But Robert McKenzie, a tax lawyer at Arnstein &amp; Lehr in Chicago, said several of his clients with HSBC offshore accounts had received enforcement letters. &quot;It appears there&apos;s been some compromise to the security of information at Asian HSBC branches,&quot; McKenzie told the Guardian. &quot;I don&apos;t know whether HSBC has co-operated with the authorities.&quot; He said the department of justice&apos;s action appeared to be a broadening of its attack on secret Swiss bank accounts: &quot;I don&apos;t believe the US government&apos;s purpose is to give up after one victory. They&apos;re not going to stop here.&quot; International banks must strike a delicate balance in co-operating with increasingly aggressive investigations by US authorities while protecting customers&apos; privacy. The government&apos;s foray into Swiss accounts caused a political storm in Bern and created a rift in US-Swiss relations. In an effort to claw back some of the billions of dollars believed to be lost to the US through offshore banking, tax authorities offered a deal last year under which Americans who disclosed secret accounts could settle for an agreed penalty. US residents voluntarily disclosed 14,700 offshore accounts under the deal, ranging in value from $10,000 to more than $100m. Marketing practices by banks offering offshore accounts have come under scrutiny. UBS was accused of sending staff to visit wealthy Americans to trumpet the virtues of private accounts. A former UBS employee turned whistleblower told a court he had even smuggled diamonds into the US on behalf of a client. C Evan Stewart, a partner at law firm Zuckerman Spaeder in New York, said HSBC fell into a different category: &quot;HSBC doesn&apos;t have the same sort of secrecy laws as the Swiss banks invoked \u2013 there will be a question of whether it was trying to market [secrecy] as a competitive advantage in the US.&quot; Downing has made it clear he envisages broader prosecutions. He recently toured Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing to meet regulators and bankers. According to Bloomberg News, he told a conference of tax lawyers in New York last month that banks in Asia were well aware of the issue, saying: &quot;Neither the banks nor the governments want to have a UBS-type situation. They want to do it nice and quiet. They don&apos;t want to be the focus of attention. The department of justice and IRS are devoting a ton of resources to this issue.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jul/07/wu-guanzhong-obituary", "sentences": ["Major exhibitions of his work were held in the British Museum in 1988, in the US in 1988-89, in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore, and today he is recognised around the world as one of the masters of modern Chinese painting."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-07T17:42:34Z", "title": "Wu Guanzhong obituary", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "In the summer of 1950, soon after Mao Zedong had proclaimed the founding of the people&apos;s republic, Wu Guanzhong, happily studying painting in Paris, made the fateful decision to return to China. Appointed to teach in the Central Academy of Art in Beijing, his head full of C\u00e9zanne and Van Gogh, he soon found that he was forbidden to\u00a0mention those names, and felt unable to face his radical students until he could talk about socialist realism in the Soviet Union, and its foreshadowing in the art of Ilya Repin. This was the beginning of almost three decades of\u00a0harassment and victimisation that, for him and countless others, ended only after the death of Mao in 1976.     Wu Guanzhong     One of modern China&apos;s leading artists, Wu, who has died aged 90, was\u00a0born into a peasant family in a\u00a0village near Yixing, in the east-coast province of\u00a0Jiangsu, where his father was head of\u00a0the primary school. In\u00a0his teens he was training to be an electrical engineer when he met Chu Teh Chun, then studying art under Lin Fengmian at the Academy of Art in\u00a0Hangzhou, to the south. He\u00a0transferred to that delectable lakeside institution, where his talent blossomed under Lin&apos;s guidance. When war came in 1937, Wu moved with the school to the far west \u2013 first to Yunnan, then to Chongqing, the wartime capital, where Lin, who had spent several years in France, fired his most gifted students with a longing to go there. Wu, Chu and the equally gifted Zhao Wuji set about learning French, and by 1948 they were settled in Paris. Wu, a favourite student of\u00a0Jean\u00a0Souverbie, felt increasingly cut\u00a0off from his roots until, after agonising heart-searching, he returned to Beijing, leaving Chu and Zhao to flourish as major figures in the art world of Paris. Exiled from the Central Academy, Wu took a job in the architecture department at Qinghua University, Beijing, and later at the Academy of\u00a0Decorative Arts, founded by Pang Xunqin in 1953 with the support of the premier, Zhou Enlai. Thereafter, he held several teaching posts until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in August 1966, when he was forbidden to teach, write or paint. Eventually he was sent to the country to work as a farm labourer. After two years of backbreaking work, he was permitted to paint, on any bit of board he could find, on Sundays. He remarked later that he had become a member of\u00a0the dung basket school of painting. Gradually, things got better. In\u00a01973 Wu was one of the leading artists brought back from the countryside \u2013 on the initiative of Zhou \u2013 to decorate hotels and public buildings. He was painting again, travelling around China, writing articles. His rehabilitation was marked by an exhibition of his work in 1978 at the Central Academy. From that moment, he never looked back. Major exhibitions of his work were held in the British Museum in 1988, in the US in 1988-89, in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore, and today he is recognised around the world as one of the masters of modern Chinese painting. Wu was trained as an oil painter, chiefly of the human figure. When his nudes were condemned in the early 1950s, he destroyed them all and did not paint another until 1990, after a longed-for return visit to Paris. Unwilling to paint heroic workers, peasants and soldiers, he had turned to landscape, painted both in oils and in ink on paper. Unlike some other modern Chinese artists, he never found the choice of styles a problem. Asked whether he preferred the Chinese or the western style, he said: &quot;When I take up a brush to paint, I paint a Chinese picture.&quot; Wu&apos;s style, or rather styles, are unmistakable. His landscapes in oils are marked by a delicacy of touch and colour, a purity and fluidity of line, that are very seductive. He also liked to work in the traditional Chinese medium of\u00a0ink on paper, and his studies of trees and plants have a vitality and freedom that sometimes verges on abstract expressionism, although Wu always denied that abstraction was an issue. Indeed, perhaps his chief contribution to the development of\u00a0Chinese painting since 1950 was his defence of\u00a0abstraction. &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid of it,&quot; he insisted, &quot;because it is all around us in nature \u2013 in the design of the trellis in a garden pavilion, in\u00a0the\u00a0shadow of\u00a0the bamboo leaves on a white wall... The line that connects the painted image to the real thing can never be broken.&quot; He would even say that the compositions of Piet Mondrian were not pure abstractions, because they obeyed the laws of harmony in nature. To the Chinese artist, there is no art that does not have a reference in\u00a0nature. Wu was a remarkable man, not only for his prodigious talent, but for the courage with which he stood up to the Maoist ideologues \u2013 unlike his teacher Lin, who was crushed by them \u2013 for the lucidity of his writings about art, and for the demands he made upon himself. He\u00a0was a prolific painter, perhaps excessively so, and not all his work, in particular in the too-fluid Chinese medium of brush and ink, is up to his best standard. Realising this, in 1991 he destroyed several hundred of his paintings. He died a much-admired &quot;old master&quot;, survived by his wife, Zhu Biqin, two sons and a daughter, and many young artists who had felt his inspiring influence in stressful times. \u2022 Wu Guanzhong, artist, born 29 August 1919; died 25 June 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/08/spirit-level-book-critique", "sentences": ["Yet beyond these clusters the search for evidence that links inequality and negative social outcomes is in vain, as other more egalitarian countries such as Japan and Austria do not appear to support the hypothesis any more than less egalitarian ones such as Portugal or Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-08T11:00:55Z", "title": "The Spirit Level is not on the level | Natalie Evans", "tags": ["Society", "Equality", "Money", "Books", "UK news", "The Spirit Level"], "article": "Last year, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett published The Spirit Level, which caused quite a stir as it appeared to offer empirical evidence that egalitarian societies benefit rich and poor alike. The report argued that income inequality harms not only the poorest in society but almost everyone, no matter how prosperous they are. Wilkinson and Pickett based their claims on statistical evidence, which they argued showed that more unequal countries (and within the US, more unequal states) suffer from, among other things, higher crime, lower average life expectancy, higher infant mortality and less social mobility. The authors concluded that we would all benefit from a more egalitarian distribution of income. The Spirit Level was lauded by politicians and commentators on the left who believed they finally had empirical proof that economic inequality leads to a wealth of social ills. However, a new report by Peter Saunders, published by Policy Exchange, finds significant flaws in Wilkinson and Pickett&apos;s analysis that fatally undermines their arguments and conclusion. Beware False Prophets re-examines the empirical claims made in The Spirit Level and finds that of the 20 statistical claims made in it, 14 are spurious or invalid and in only one case (the association internationally between infant mortality and income inequality) does the evidence unambiguously support their hypothesis. Contrary to Wilkinson and Pickett&apos;s claims, income inequality does not explain international homicide rates, childhood conflict, women&apos;s status, foreign aid donations, life expectancy, adult obesity, childhood obesity, literacy and numeracy or social mobility rates. Nor does it explain variations among US states in homicide, infant mortality or imprisonment rates. Saunders identifies a couple of key analytical failures that run through The Spirit Level. First, there are many instances where the authors draw conclusions from data where one or two extreme cases are used to support unwarranted generalisations. These &quot;outliers&quot; totally skew the data but give the conclusion the authors seek \u2013 for example, the claim that there is an association between a country&apos;s homicide rate and its level of income inequality depends entirely on the high murder rate in the US, while the claim that average life expectancy is linked to income inequality rests entirely on the long lives of the Japanese. Across the other 22 countries analysed, there simply is no association. Second, many of Wilkinson and Pickett&apos;s claims rest on the influence of &quot;clusters&quot; of countries or states that do not hold true across the wider sample of countries. So the (more equal) Scandinavian countries routinely appear at one end of their graphs, and the (less equal) Anglo nations often appear at the other. Yet beyond these clusters the search for evidence that links inequality and negative social outcomes is in vain, as other more egalitarian countries such as Japan and Austria do not appear to support the hypothesis any more than less egalitarian ones such as Portugal or Singapore. Peter Saunders contends that the single-minded focus of Wilkinson and Pickett to prove their hypothesis led them to resist consideration of the impact of factors such as history and culture, which in fact are often one of the key factors behind their findings. It also meant they were selective in their choice of evidence, so The Spirit Level ignores a range of social indicators such as suicide rates, HIV infection rates, alcohol consumption and divorce rates, which are in fact worse in more equal countries. Beware False Prophets is a hard-hitting critique that shines a powerful spotlight on the flaws in the analysis, assumptions and conclusions of The Spirit Level. We all want to improve people&apos;s quality of life and tackle deep-rooted social ills, but as Saunders clearly identifies, the case for radical income distribution to achieve this is no more compelling now than it was before The Spirit Level was published."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jul/08/facebook-international-growth", "sentences": ["Indonesia is just 500,000 users behind the UK, Facebook&apos;s biggest userbase, and is top, according to comScore, in the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-08T11:38:49Z", "title": "How Facebook will take over the world", "tags": ["Facebook", "Media", "Digital media", "Social networking", "Internet", "Technology"], "article": "Facebook will announce its 500 millionth user any day now, and that&apos;s around 22% of all internet users globally.

But given that take-up among those key demographics in the developed world isn&apos;t far from saturation, the next phase of growth will be in developing markets and will prove harder work for the firm in the face of domestic incumbents, technological differences and government censorship. So how is Facebook moving in on those markets? \u2022 Venturebeat interviewed Facebook&apos;s head of international growth, Javier Olivan - the guy who led Facebook&apos;s crowdsourced translation project. He described the development of a free, low-bandwidth mobile version. Facebook is making deals with at least 50 operators across India, Russia and more that means the expense of using data services is carried by the operators rather than users. Photo by orphum on Flickr. Some rights reserved \u2022 Across Asia, the growth pattern varies from one extreme to another. Indonesia is just 500,000 users behind the UK, Facebook&apos;s biggest userbase, and is top, according to comScore, in the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. But in Vietnam and China Facebook is blocked, and elsewhere, like Russia, it faces an uphill struggle to overtake domestic rivals. \u2022 Facebook acquired a Malaysian contact importing service called Octazen Solutions, which means it can tap a wide range of email services in the region. \u2022 In India, the site built a database of school details to pre-populate lists and make it easier for users to search for friends, one of a number of &apos;under the hood&apos; strategies for growth. \u2022 Facebook is closing in on Google&apos;s Orkut in both India, which appears to be stalling, and Brazil, where it has a quarter of Orkut&apos;s traffic. \u2022 In Japan, where it has 5% of the traffic of market-leading Mixi, Facebook had to focus on making a decent mobile web version rather than replying on apps. In Japan and South Korea, more users access social networks via mobile than by desktop, so Facebook has some substantial catching up to do given that Olivan admits its mobile site was &quot;unusable&quot; eight months ago. \u2022 Interestingly China appears a no-go area, with Google&apos;s problems and eventual withdrawal, the current block on Facebook and the dominance of domestic sites like RenRen, 51 and Kaixin001 presenting too much of a challenge at this stage. Olivan puts this down to &quot;an ROI calculation that goes into every country we consider entering&quot;. \u2022 The New York Times also points out that though Olivan only has a team of 12, he is backed by Facebook&apos;s $1bn annual revenues, which means significant investment in new products and a steamrolling of its rivals. It also means Facebook can continue to hire much of the world&apos;s best developer talent, which it regularly poaches from Google. Will Facebook reach 1 billion? I don&apos;t doubt it. We can expect them to focus on the highest growth countries with strong commercial potential and the least established incumbents. But this will still be like Bagneres-de-Luchon to Pau on stage 16 of the Tour de France. Tough, in other words.  Also in Facebookland \u2022 The New York Times has helpfully compiled an introductory guide, for those who might have been living in a cave for the past four years. Or, my mother. \u2022 A Futurescape report predicts Facebook will fight Twitter for the $180bn global TV ad market as these social networks and back channels are formally built into new TVs. While social media has some impact on TV ratings now, the report predicts recommendation, discovery and content sharing will be central to pay-TV services in the future.

Several sides who thought they were good turned out not to be. Absolutely every South American team lost within hours of everybody noticing how well all the South American teams were doing. Pundits were sacked for selling their tickets, told off for wearing branded clothing and embarrassed by their mobile phones. Every World Cup seems to launch one person from obscurity to global fame, and 2010 was no different \u2013 except that usually that person is a footballer and on this occasion it is an octopus. We are all pretty bad at being told what to think about sport. TV stations spend thousands hiring people with impeccable records of footballing achievement to clue us in on what&apos;s going on and still we sit on our sofas and proclaim them idiots. Yet the opinion of Paul le Poulpe \u2013 he might have been born in England and adopted by Germans, but like pretty much everything else he just sounds better in French \u2013 is considered of such importance that it makes the evening news. It took until yesterday for anyone to emerge who had a better record than Paul at predicting events in South Africa and, with exasperating inevitability, that turned out to be a parakeet. Mani, the bird in question, lives in Singapore and had correctly identified all four semi-finalists, but one of the clairvoyant critters will be sick as a parrot by the end of the weekend:Mani thinks Holland will win the final, and Paul&apos;s backing Spain. Me, I&apos;ve never bought into the cult of Paul le Poulpe. For some reason, when I look at pictures of him, his tank surrounded by acolytes and all eight of his legs slithering hideously all over the place and leaving him grotesquely glued to the glass, one word springs immediately to mind: suckers. Blanc plays it by ear  One thing that doesn&apos;t sound better in French is humiliation. Still, that is all behind them now. Laurent Blanc has already begun the process of rebuilding his disgraced side after their hideous and unimaginable failure. His first move, proving instantly that he possesses the bravery required to stand up to the squad members who made the last days of Raymond Domenech&apos;s reign so shameful and catastrophic, was to ban them from using headphones. It was a curious opening gambit. Clearly, Blanc decided, something or someone had to be at fault for the disaster in South Africa, and music won the vote. Not since the Beastie Boys inspired a generation to snap the badges off Volkswagens and wear them as jewellery has popular music been held responsible for such wrongdoing. Nicolas Anelka and Patrice Evra may have seemed the more likely scapegoats, but Blanc chose to take the Jacksons&apos; advice and blame it on the boogie. Italy, too, have a new manager to drag them clear of the humiliation that accompanied their first-round exit, and Cesare Prandelli has already set out his vision for the future. &quot;What has happened has happened,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope to organise a team based on real human values.&quot; That was precisely the problem with the final iteration of Marcello Lippi&apos;s side, though in these circumstances there are perhaps better choices of human values than greed, sloth, pride and envy. Plus, to be fair, and particularly when a Slovakian forward was around, charity. As for England, well, perhaps it is just as well we didn&apos;t sweep to glory. World Cup victory seems to encourage people to act up to the furthest extremes of their national stereotypes. When Brazil win they head to the beaches and throw a carnival. When France won everyone stopped working and marched through the streets of central Paris holding placards. The last time Germany won the victorious team sped down the autobahn in Mercedes and then held a big rally. In Italy the entire population drives around erratically while hooting their horns and leaning out of their windows to shout at each other. If that&apos;s really how it works an England victory would be insufferable: millions of people would take to the streets of London and steadfastly refuse to talk to each other, and then it would rain. But there&apos;s no need to worry about that, not for another four years at the very least. England&apos;s future is in the hands of the same manager and more or less the same group of players, and is almost certain to feature the same sort of results. We&apos;ll leave the major change to others. Of course, though, with change comes uncertainty. Nobody in France, for example, can know how well Blanc will take to international management. Though they can be pretty confident that he&apos;ll think it&apos;s as easy as ABC."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/jul/10/graduates-overseas-jobs", "sentences": ["&quot;Outside Europe, think of Asia and places like China and Singapore, where jobs markets are considerably better.&quot; Jamie Foster, 24, is a UK graduate working in Beijing, China."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-09T23:01:05Z", "title": "Graduates look overseas as jobs dry up", "tags": ["Graduate careers", "Job hunting", "Work & careers", "Money", "Unemployment and employment statistics", "Business", "Higher education", "Education", "Guardian Careers", "All sectors", "Graduate"], "article": "For beleaguered graduate job hunters, the news just seems to get worse and worse. Figures released last week by the Higher Education Statistics Agency showed that about 10% of 2009 graduates failed to find work during the past year. As if that weren&apos;t bad enough, the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) this week released the findings of its biannual survey, showing an average of around 70 applications for every graduate job, with employers expecting to see a further 6.9% drop in vacancies this year \u2013 a forecast nearly four times worse than the AGR&apos;s own predictions just six months ago. The AGR&apos;s chief executive, Carl Gilleard, points out that the depressing forecast reflects a fragmented graduate jobs market in which sectors such as finance are now showing high levels of growth, while others, including law and engineering, remain in the doldrums. &quot;The important thing for graduates is to keep their ears to the ground,&quot; he says. &quot;A snapshot survey of our members reveals that 30% haven&apos;t yet filled their vacancies.&quot; Yet for those prepared to look farther afield, there may be a glimmer of hope from the increasing numbers of UK graduates who are successfully finding work overseas. Nannette Ripmeester, a Rotterdam-based international careers expert who has worked in 17 countries, says the jobs outlook is not as bleak everywhere. &quot;Within the European Union, the UK and Spanish jobs markets have been worst-hit, but other countries such as the Netherlands, and also newer member states like Poland, have not suffered as much,&quot; she says. &quot;Outside Europe, think of Asia and places like China and Singapore, where jobs markets are considerably better.&quot; Jamie Foster, 24, is a UK graduate working in Beijing, China. Having obtained a history and Chinese degree from Nottingham University, followed by a business master&apos;s from the School of Oriental and Asian Studies, he admits he &quot;always had an eye on China&quot;, but his lack of success job hunting in the UK hastened his passage east. &quot;It&apos;s a bit like the wild west out here,&quot; says Foster, who arrived in Beijing in January after five months of applying fruitlessly to City financial institutions. &quot;It&apos;s unlike any other country in the world. The incredible thing about Beijing, or Shanghai for that matter, is the number of new companies popping up every day.&quot; Through CRCC Asia, a company that, for a fee, arranges internships in China for UK students, he undertook a\u00a0two-month work placement in Beijing while at university. He found networking opportunities abundant and met the American start-up entrepreneurs for whom he now works full-time, helping to form private equity companies. Foster says that while speaking a\u00a0little Mandarin beforehand helped, a lack of local language need not be a\u00a0barrier to finding work \u2013 although he warns would-be gold prospectors to expect a fast-moving, entrepreneurial environment rather than structured graduate schemes. &quot;So many entrepreneurs come out looking to make a buck and they want graduates from the UK and the US who have the tangible skills to work in a business like that,&quot; he says. Neil Chowings, managing director of Work Group, a Hong Kong-based recruitment firm, says that while the Chinese graduate recruitment market has massive problems of its own \u2013 with 30% of university leavers annually unable to find jobs \u2013 UK graduates can bring something unique to China&apos;s rapidly growing economy. &quot;There&apos;s a huge shortage of innovative, entrepreneurial, free-thinking graduates in China,&quot; he points out. &quot;Culturally, it is still a very controlled government state. Workers are not used to voicing their own opinions, which is where foreign graduates tend to do better.&quot; Opportunities in China are not confined to financial whizzkids, either. Akram Shalabi, 23, studied for a mathematics degree at King&apos;s College, London, followed by a law course at BPP law school. Last summer he undertook a two-month internship in international law in Beijing. &quot;I was applying for law training contracts in the UK and I wasn&apos;t getting any,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought, why not go to\u00a0China and enhance my CV?&quot; After returning, Shalabi still found it difficult to break into a UK law firm, so decided to study for a master&apos;s in mathematics at Cambridge University. Now he is going back to Beijing later this month to teach maths at university there, while keeping an eye out for suitable openings with law firms. He thinks it is quite feasible for graduates to find work in China and has been astonished by the quality of experience on offer. &quot;What really surprised me is how UK graduates have real credibility, which you don&apos;t have here,&quot; he says. &quot;On my internship I\u00a0was given real responsibility, not just making tea or doing photocopying. I chaired meetings and I even held a press conference. I experienced things you probably wouldn&apos;t experience in five years in your career in the UK.&quot; Closer to home, the change of government looks set to herald new graduate opportunities in a rather unexpected overseas location. William Hague&apos;s comments last week about increasing the UK&apos;s representation at the European Commission&apos;s Brussels headquarters delighted senior British EU officials who had been anticipating a further distancing of relations from the new foreign secretary, hitherto renowned as a eurosceptic. &quot;In our last main recruitment competition for graduate administrators, the UK made up only about 1.7% of applications, which is incredibly poor in relation to its population,&quot; says David Bearfield, director of the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO), which recruits EC staff. &quot;We&apos;re not allowed to recruit by nationality, but we want to work with the UK government to see how we can dramatically increase the number of applications.&quot; EPSO mainly recruits graduates with language skills for jobs as translators, conference interpreters and lawyer-linguists. Bearfield says that in response to Hague&apos;s olive branch, the EC will seek to establish itself with UK universities and careers services as a genuine graduate destination. &quot;We believe we have a really attractive and unique career offering,&quot; he says. Charles Gittins translates documents into English \u2013 mainly from Greek, Estonian and five other official EU languages \u2013 at the EC&apos;s English language department in Brussels. &quot;Seven is kind of average,&quot; he says. As much as anything, he enjoys the mixed international working environment. &quot;You go to the canteen and you can hear all the 23\u00a0official EU languages being spoken.&quot; Drawn to the work and the political surroundings, Gittins decided to apply to the EC after completing his degree in modern languages at Oxford. After passing the written and oral parts of the EC&apos;s recruitment competition, he was then put on a reserve list for potential vacancies. It took two years from his first test to being offered a\u00a0job, &quot;and I was one of the quickest&quot;, he jokes. But the good news for those interested is that the process has now been streamlined considerably. Bearfield admits that the necessity of speaking two other languages (one of which must be French or German) has historically been a sticking point for many UK applicants to the EC. But he says the first round of the competition \u2013 which until now has had to be completed mostly in a second language \u2013 has changed, so the bulk is in English which, it is hoped, will encourage more British graduates to apply. &quot;We hope to work more and more with the UK government on schemes like the Fast Stream, which has just been brought back,&quot; he says. &quot;I think there&apos;s been this perception in the UK that the EC just offers awful, bureaucratic jobs, but nothing could be further from the truth. They&apos;re brilliant, exciting careers where you can really make a difference.&quot; Nannette Ripmeester points out that in the long run, working abroad can make you more employable at home. &quot;Once the jobs market picks up again in the UK, which it will do eventually, international experience gives you something extra when applying to your home jobs market,&quot; she says. And while moving abroad can seem like a risk, particularly to far-flung destinations such as China, for Foster the rewards on offer easily make up for it. &quot;I&apos;m getting exposure to $100m deals,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m dealing with the kind of figures I wouldn&apos;t touch in a UK investment bank for five or 10 years. Frankly I wouldn&apos;t have dreamed of this six months ago.&quot; Five tips for finding work abroad 1. Be focused. It might sound obvious, but having a specific goal in mind will help focus you. &quot;Either look for particular sectors, companies, or countries,&quot; suggests international careers expert Nannette Ripmeester. 2. Consider work permits/visas. This may not be a problem if you&apos;re heading to the EU, but for other countries it&apos;s essential to check with the relevant embassy or consulate. Agencies can help with this process \u2013 expect to pay for the service, though. 3. Brush up on your languages. Obviously a grasp of local languages is a\u00a0big advantage in mainland Europe, &quot;but UK graduates are lucky in that English is still the lingua franca of business,&quot; says Ripmeester. Chinese employers might want you to take a\u00a0crash course in Mandardin \u2013 but they may even sponsor you if they like what they see. 4. Be culturally sensitive. &quot;Almost more important than not speaking the language is the way British workers often forget jobs markets differ in other countries,&quot; says Ripmeester. &quot;For example, employers may not place such value on things like your hobbies as they might in the UK.&quot; So do your homework and show you understand the locals before you apply. 5. Think tactically. Do you know people who already live where you&apos;re heading? If so, ask them to put the feelers out on your behalf, and if possible take advantage of their hospitality (but don&apos;t overdo it). And network as much as possible, both before you go and while you&apos;re there. A personal recommendation can be invaluable in any culture.

No less exciting, though rather more unsettling, is the real-life drama taking place on the world&apos;s financial markets, where investors have piled into gold on fears that capitalism is about to crumble. As a result, the gold price has soared to record levels, rising 9% this year to reach a peak of $1,264.90 (\u00a3834.44) an ounce, with influential names in the world of finance predicting it could top $2,000. Among them is Jim Rogers, the investment guru who called the start of the commodities rally in 1999. Having narrowly averted a financial Armageddon in 2008, investors are worried the authorities have transferred western indebtedness from banks and consumers to national governments. In their worst moments, panicky investors and savers visualise a world that has been turned upside down by a sovereign debt crisis that breaks both the euro and flattens the once mighty dollar. As the west sinks into a quagmire of its own making, demand plummets and the world is dragged into another Great Depression. Even the emerging markets of China, India and Brazil are affected as export markets shrivel. Political instability follows, with riots on the streets and unemployment at levels not seen since the 1930s. This nightmare vision has rattled investors around the word, driving the gold price ever higher. Of all the precious metals, it is the most popular as an investment. Since the earliest times, it has been seen as both a symbol of prosperity and a store of wealth. In the modern era, it has been bought as a hedge against economic, political or social crises, and as protection against the plummeting value of currencies. &quot;Debt on government balance sheets and worries that the world could be heading towards a double-dip recession are behind the gold surge,&quot; says Charles Cooper at Oriel Securities. Cooper says there is concern we could be heading towards a second leg of the financial crisis and governments &quot;could be tempted to print more money to dig us out of a hole. &quot;That could precipitate inflation, making gold even more popular as a safe haven.&quot; Hundreds of miles away from Cooper&apos;s offices in London, Kerry Tattersall, marketing director of Austrian Mint, is in ebullient mood. Sales of gold coins and gold bars to the public rocketed in May to a record for a single month at 485,000 ounces. At the same time last year, the comparable figure was just 83,000 ounces. Tattersall says: &quot;This is an incredible time. We have had people coming into the mint and asking for advice on how to convert all their savings to gold. Not that we think that&apos;s a good idea. We recommend customers have a diversified portfolio.&quot; The mint&apos;s most popular product is its 1 ounce gold coin, which currently retails for about \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3835). Also on offer are 1 kilo gold bars that sell for a mere \u20ac31,300. Silver is also growing in popularity, with Tattersall saying that sales have soared from 1m ounces in May 2009 to 1.85m now. Deep beneath the Swiss Alps, nervous Germans are storing gold in military bunkers that have been sold off by the Swiss state. Mindful of the hyperinflation that wreaked havoc in Germany during the 1920s, German investors have been at the forefront of gold purchases in Europe. A growing number are keen to store the precious metal outside the banks, which have been distrusted since the onset of the credit crunch. And, with the future of the euro in doubt, investors are seeking a refuge against the threat of monetary depreciation and want to store gold outside the eurozone. Switzerland is cashing in on those concerns. Old military bunkers in the Bernese Oberland now serve as maximum security vaults for nervous Europeans. They come equipped with sophisticated alarm systems and armed guards and are designed to withstand terrorist attacks, natural disasters and even a nuclear war. In Britain, Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.com, says the company is looking after $800m worth of gold for its international clientele, up about 20% on a year ago. &quot;We are the beneficiaries of uncertainty which has grown since the Greek crisis,&quot; he says. The World Gold Council says shareholders are deepening their exposure to gold-mining companies and central banks are buying bullion on the open market. Marcus Grubb, WGC managing director, says: &quot;The backdrop is the continuing financial crisis and people&apos;s desire to protect their wealth in uncertain times.&quot; The Bank of England recently published figures that showed the value of gold in its vaults had risen from \u00a372bn in early 2008 to \u00a3125bn in February 2010. Much of the rise in value can be accounted for by the increase in the price, but analysts say there is evidence of central banks either stocking up on gold or deferring sales. Britain would have far more in gold if former chancellor Gordon Brown had not taken the decision in 1999 to sell 415 tonnes of UK bullion, the equivalent of 60% of the country&apos;s gold reserves. Philip Newman, research director of precious metals consultancy GFMS, says central banks sold 365 tonnes of gold in 2006, but just 41 tonnes in 2009. In Bristol, Mark Dampier of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown says retail investors are seeking greater exposure to gold by investing in commodities funds. &quot;Another option is to invest in gold-backed exchange-traded funds that have become increasingly popular since they were introduced in 2003.&quot; Diversified mining companies such as Anglo American and Rio Tinto have seen a two-way pull on their stock prices. That&apos;s because the value of many commodities they produce has been pulled down by worries about the fragility of economic recovery. But specialist gold miners such as Randgold Resources have seen their shares rise strongly. Dampier believes gold will continue its upward trajectory because &quot;governments have printed money like there is no tomorrow, debasing their currencies. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they print even more before the crisis is over,&quot; he says. Not everyone is bullish about gold, however. Julian Jessop of Capital Economics says some of the fears about a double-dip recession are overdone and inflationary pressures will remain subdued for several years. But one support for gold could be continuing uncertainty about the euro. Suki Cooper, commodities analyst at Barclays Capital, says in the short term gold will be supported by demand for jewellery from the Far East; at the same time there is &quot;a re-evaluation of how gold is perceived in the market&quot;. Cooper reckons the floor for gold in the long term is $850 an ounce against an average price of $310 in 2002. But in real terms the price of gold is still a long way off the inflation-adjusted $1,600 that it reached in 1980 when inflation was rampant and the economic downturn was at its worst. Read into that what you will. Opening up the vaults  Egged on by prime-time television commercials trumpeting the virtues of special-issue gold coins, investors in the US have been moving into precious metals since the financial crisis began. But storage is becoming a headache. One of the biggest banking vaults in New York lies beneath HSBC&apos;s US headquarters in downtown Manhattan. With demand on the up, HSBC last year decided to restrict access to the vault, telling small investors to go elsewhere in order to open up space for lucrative institutional clients. HSBC&apos;s vault is said to contain 4.2m troy ounces of gold. Other banks have reported an upsurge in demand for vault space, which was once considered a &quot;white elephant&quot; service for storing grandmothers&apos; pearls and family jewellery. JP Morgan has recently opened a new vault in Singapore while a Swiss firm, Via Mat International, has opened a secure facility in London.

Thomson&apos;s intellectual and intuitive understanding of how cities work, and how traffic flows, made him the brains of a campaign against roads that could have caused huge damage to London. Thomson, whose father was a\u00a0businessman, was born in Hull and grew up in Yorkshire and Kent. John, as he was christened, demonstrated at an early age a determination that was to be a hallmark of his life. Climbing to the top of a ladder at the age of four, he\u00a0refused to come down unless he was called Michael. And so he was. After school at Bedford, followed by the London School of Economics (LSE), he\u00a0tried his hand at banking with Barclays in Dubai. Deciding he had taken a wrong turn, he\u00a0headed off in the direction of\u00a0transport, first at the ministry itself and then at its research wing, the Road Research Laboratory. There, as secretary of an expert panel on pay-as-you-drive road pricing, he made his first major contribution to transport thinking. The Smeed report of 1964, which Thomson drafted, argued in favour of the development of\u00a0pricing methods. Transport ministers have since shied away from the idea, but others, from Singapore to central London, drew on an analysis of consummate clarity, set out in sparse and fluent prose. Thomson&apos;s next contribution followed his appointment as research fellow in transport at the LSE in October 1965. Britain was by then increasingly committed to the motor age, and planners at the Greater London council (GLC) had decided to circle the capital, at astronomical cost, with radial motorways. Residents across the city soon learned that these huge roads would mean the destruction of 20,000 homes, blight more and, on countless streets, add to traffic, noise and fumes. Opposition began to mount locally, but Thomson and others saw the need to put forward a case that was London-wide. This need was filled by the London Amenity and Transport Association (LATA), a\u00a0grouping of 60-odd local societies. Thomson was its chairman. The LATA gave Thomson a broad platform. He argued his case, first in the LATA publication Motorways in London (1969) and then at a public inquiry as chief witness for both LATA and the London Motorway Action Group, headed by Douglas Jay, Labour MP for Battersea North. Thomson&apos;s proposition was that &quot;ringways&quot; would not only be destructive, but would also fail to deliver what Londoners wanted. By\u00a0creating room for more, and longer, car journeys, they would lead not to less congestion, but more. And by encouraging more car travel, they would withdraw passengers and revenue from the buses and tubes. London&apos;s transport problem was not only poor roads: it was equally the difficulties faced by pedestrians, cyclists and passengers by bus and rail. In seeing this so clearly, Thomson was far ahead of his time. The objectors at the inquiry did not win the battle, but the war against the ringways was duly won. Although planning for the roads had gone on under both Labour and Conservative London councils, it fell to the former, following the 1973 election, to cancel them. Lack of funds was a key issue but Thomson&apos;s arguments made it easier for the politicians to override their highway engineers. In the 1970s Thomson moved to Paris and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where he headed a study of inter-city transport. In 1977, after a world tour, he published Great Cities and Their Traffic. In it, he noted that choosing a transport strategy is &quot;a choice of way of life ... a choice that may affect different sections of the population very differently ... (and thus) a highly political question&quot;. In a still valued textbook, he made abundantly clear the nature of that choice. Aged 48, and by then a global transport authority, he worked worldwide as a consultant. A colleague in Bangkok noted: &quot;Michael was an original thinker. Others in the team would arrive with computers and boxfiles. He took out a pen and pad and said, &apos;what exactly are we trying to do?&apos;&quot; And, whether in Bogota or Taipei, thanks to a mixture of observation, theory and intuition, he always seemed to know. In 1955 Thomson married Elizabeth Paish, with whom he had three daughters. For 27 years they lived in Kentchurch, Herefordshire, where he learned to play the church organ and, every morning, after a run, plunged into a cold bath. In 1997 he was widowed. The following year he married Wendy Webb. He is survived by Wendy and his daughters, Calvia, Pippa and Lydia. \u2022 John Michael Thomson, transport economist, born 1 January 1928; died 4\u00a0May 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/14/us-senate-legislation-libel-tourism", "sentences": ["A handful of countries, notably Britain, Australia, Brazil and Singapore, have stricter libel laws than the US, leading to cases where plaintiffs search for the jurisdiction most likely to be sympathetic to their case."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-14T18:44:05Z", "title": "US Senate committee moves to curb libel tourism", "tags": ["US news", "US Congress", "Libel reform", "Law", "UK news", "Freedom of speech", "World news"], "article": "The US Senate is moving closer to passing legislation that would make it harder for plaintiffs to sue Americans in overseas jurisdictions, such as Britain, where laws governing free speech are weaker. Legislation to crack down on the rise of &quot;libel tourism&quot; has passed through a key Senate committee and has cross-party support in Congress. The measure, known as the Speech Act (Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act), will now progress to a full Senate hearing. A handful of countries, notably Britain, Australia, Brazil and Singapore, have stricter libel laws than the US, leading to cases where plaintiffs search for the jurisdiction most likely to be sympathetic to their case. Some human rights campaigners and legal experts say the practice is used by the powerful to stifle dissent and criticism. The growth of publishing on the internet has raised fears that libel tourism will grow rapidly. The bill will make it difficult to enforce judgments made in foreign courts on US nationals if those decisions are seen as hurting their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech. It would allow defendants to obtain an American court&apos;s judgment that the decision was not enforceable under US law, and would protect the assets of American citizens from being used to pay damages. The bill is based on a New York state law that was passed after the American author Rachel Ehrenfeld wrote a book on the financing of terrorism and was sued for libel in London by a Saudi billionaire. In a blogpost, Ehrenfeld has said the bill is vital for opposing libel tourism. &quot;[It] will help deter libel tourism and secure Americans&apos; right to speak, write and publish freely to preserve the safety and integrity of our democracy,&quot; she said. The bill was sponsored by Republican and Democrat senators. &quot;We take seriously the challenge of getting this right \u2013 to be respectful of foreign nations, many of whom are allies. But at the same time we could have a major detriment to the right to publish and speak freely in America if we don&apos;t confront this problem,&quot; said Jeff Sessions, a Republican senator.&quot;The first amendment is a cornerstone of American democracy,&quot; said Senator Patrick Leahy, the committee&apos;s chairman. &quot;Freedom of speech and the press enable vigorous debate over issues of national importance, and enable an exchange of ideas that shapes our political process.&quot;Supporters of libel law reform in the UK described the Senate vote as highly significant but warned of a strong reaction from some jurists and academics who consider libel tourism to be a red herring. &quot;There will be fierce lobbying against it, but there is general agreement that the bar should be set higher for bringing libel cases,&quot; said Jo Glanville, editor of Index on Censorship, part of a group pushing for libel reform. The government last week unveiled plans for a major review of libel law to better protect freedom of speech in the media and the research sector and to cut down on libel tourism. The Ministry of Justice announced that it is to publish a draft defamation bill that will be put out for consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny in the new year. Acknowledging the impetus that has developed behind the libel reform campaign, the government said it was seeking to introduce a bill as soon as parliamentary time can be found following the consultation process. The government said it was seeking a wide range of views to reach a &quot;fully informed assessment&quot;, adding that it recognised the impact of current law on freedom of expression, &quot;particularly in relation to academic and scientific debate, the work of non-governmental organisations and investigative journalism&quot;.The Ministry of Justice announced that it is to publish a draft defamation bill that will be put out for consultation in the new year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/17/geetie-singh-organic-pub-commune", "sentences": ["She was in London modelling and studying at the London School of Economics when she met my father.&quot; Geetie&apos;s father was a Sikh, originally from the Punjab, who had grown up in Singapore where he remembers, as a three-year-old, seeing Japanese soldiers chopping off heads and putting them on spikes at the side of the road."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-16T23:05:31Z", "title": "'It was an amazing way to grow up'", "tags": ["Family", "Life and style", "Food & drink", "Communities"], "article": "If you are raising your children in the city, in a flat or a modest terrace with a postage-stamp back garden, then a huge, rambling country house with sprawling grounds, inhabited by a small, enlightened community sounds appealing. There&apos;s the space, the ready-made playmates for the kids, the shared parenting, the cooking once in a blue moon. But what is it like to be a child growing up in a commune \u2013 is it as idyllic as it seems? And what sort of adults do these children become? Geetie Singh, an award-winning entrepreneur who opened Britain&apos;s first organic gastropub, the Duke of Cambridge, in north London, grew up at Birchwood Hall, a Victorian mansion in the shadow of the Malvern hills. It&apos;s still there, with its 40 rooms, eight acres, volleyball/tennis court and orchards full of coxes, bramleys and russets \u2013 and it&apos;s still a commune, though they struggle a bit to find new recruits these days. According to its website there are currently 10 adults and one teenager in residence. But in the 70s, when Geetie moved in at the age of two, the country house commune, with its hippy idealism, was in its heyday. Geetie&apos;s uncle was one of the founding members who bought the beautiful red-brick house for \u00a317,500, and with it the chance of an alternative lifestyle. When her parents&apos; marriage broke down, Geetie&apos;s mother, Liz, moved in with her and her brother Dylan (older by two years). &quot;My mum grew up in Sevenoaks, in Kent,&quot; says Geetie. &quot;It was all very English. Her father was lead violinist in an orchestra; her mother was a matron. She was in London modelling and studying at the London School of Economics when she met my father.&quot; Geetie&apos;s father was a Sikh, originally from the Punjab, who had grown up in Singapore where he remembers, as a three-year-old, seeing Japanese soldiers chopping off heads and putting them on spikes at the side of the road. He went to Australia, but was deported for fighting the White Australia Policy and came to Britain in 1960. &quot;They met in CND. Both were politically active. She got pregnant with my brother, and they got married. Mum&apos;s parents were quite shocked,&quot; says Geetie. &quot;They were worried that Dylan and I were going to have a very hard time in life because we were brown.&quot; They were right, up to a point. Her mother was spat at in the street because her children were mixed race; her father received threatening phone calls and letters, one of which contained a razor blade. The marriage ended, not because of their differences, or the attention it attracted, but because Geetie&apos;s father was a workaholic, and her mother did not want to be a housewife alone at home. So they moved to Birchwood and, though the initial period was chaotic, it became everything you could wish for in communal living \u2013 interesting companions, freedom from the constraints of conventional family life and lots of space, indoors and outside. Everyone paid according to their income; everyone took it in turns to do the shopping and the housework. They shared the cooking, which meant it came around once every 10 days, and there was a laundry rota. Everyone ate together (which was crucial to the success of the commune, according to Geetie \u2013 &quot;a lot of communes collapse when you have separate kitchens&quot;), and the children played together. There was a shared television room but separate bedrooms \u2013 enormous great cathedral-like spaces you could retreat to. &quot;It&apos;s something I remember very strongly,&quot; says Geetie. &quot;Quite often Mum wouldn&apos;t come down to dinner because she was pissed off with something or other. &quot;There were often very heated arguments and tension between people. It wasn&apos;t always a great experience. But it was healthy watching your own parents being challenged by other adults, and having to negotiate with each other. It was good to understand that adults were not perfect. We knew from a young age that our parents were just normal human beings. All of us kids became very good at communicating with grown-ups. Our opinions were respected.&quot; &quot;Feelings meetings&quot; were introduced, following a suggestion from a visiting psychologist \u2013 10-minute sessions devoted to unpicking differences and smoothing out problems, rather than leaving them unsaid and simmering; children learned that their feelings were valid and valued. &quot;It had an enormous impact on how the commune worked,&quot; says Geetie. But living in a commune is not everyone&apos;s cup of tea. Geetie keeps in touch with people from her time at Birchwood, who remain there, and she has happy memories. But when she went back for a visit recently, she chatted to two little girls who had moved in. &quot;Do you like living here?&quot; she asked. &quot;No I don&apos;t,&quot; said the girl, painfully. &quot;It&apos;s really dirty.&quot; &quot;Which was true,&quot; says Geetie, who remembers the balls of dust and scuffed skirting boards, though it didn&apos;t bother her at the time. Where she seems to have felt let down by her communal upbringing is in her education, by which she means her formal, academic education, rather than the informal education she received in relationships, the natural world and political engagement. &quot;That&apos;s where my real education was at home \u2013 in this fabulously alternative way of living. We grew our own food; we went to every demo; we wrote letters and took politics very seriously. It was the best education I could have had.&quot; But there were problems in the commune. One, according to Geetie, was that, like everywhere else in society, the adults had different ideas about how to bring up children. Some were strict, others laid-back. There were those who would tell parents if they saw their children smoking in town, others did not. But the different approaches became divisive; it was impossible to draw up rules that everyone believed in and would adhere to. As a result, the children of the commune, while they lived communally \u2013 eating and playing together \u2013 grew up with subtly different values. &quot;There was a great sense of different children being brought up in different ways,&quot; says Geetie. &quot;It was quite poor shared parenting. They found it very difficult to draw up unified rules. As a child growing up through it, I ended up feeling they should have spent more time discussing it.&quot; Education was one of the key areas of dissent \u2013 and one with lasting effect for the children who grew up there. While some were pushed academically by parents, others (usually well educated themselves) were dismissive of conventional education. It was part of a world they had chosen to leave behind by moving into Birchwood. They had dropped out and the children (not always their own) were encouraged to drop out with them. &quot;Particularly some of the communards who passed through,&quot; says Geetie. &quot;It was quite fun being negative about education and society, and then pissing off. But that was very difficult as a kid to hear.&quot; As a result, the Birchwood kids ended up on very different paths academically. Geetie went to a local primary school \u2013 not only did she stand out because of her colour, but she lived at Birchwood with all those other hippy families. &quot;It was a shock to go from a society where we had freedom and were respected to somewhere you had to ask to go to the toilet.&quot; The other pupils didn&apos;t understand the concept of the commune. To them, Geetie just seemed freaky \u2013 when she had a party, no one turned up. &quot;Their parents didn&apos;t want to come and see our weird home. I was teased for living in a commune and I was teased for being brown.&quot; When she complained to the headteacher, she was told to get used to it. Later, when she went to secondary school, she punched the first person who called her a name, cutting his lip. &quot;I decided I was going to be really hard.&quot; She defended herself and anyone else she thought needed her help. The result was that she ended up being suspended from school three times for violence. Otherwise, her teenage years were fantastic, she says. The commune, which had always been considered strange by her peers, suddenly became cool; her friends loved to visit and they would hide out all night at Birchwood. But her education did not prepare her well for life after Birchwood. At 16, she moved out with her mother and her mother&apos;s new partner to live in a more conventional family home, a cottage. &quot;I was really happy to move on,&quot; says Geetie. &quot;I liked the idea of living in a little house, having nice plates and teapots and pretty, indulgent, homely things.&quot; She had a natural gift for singing, and got a place at the Birmingham Conservatoire to study to be an opera singer. &quot;I was a punk, I had a mohican, I was pretty and thin and I arrived with completely the wrong attitude. I couldn&apos;t read or write music. I found myself in this incredibly competitive atmosphere. I dropped out after a year, and I&apos;ve never sung since.&quot; She found another life she loved, in restaurants. She moved to London, lived with her father and got a job as a waitress. She decided that she wanted to open her own restaurant. It would be organic and run on ethical and sustainable principles. Eleven years ago, she opened the Duke of Cambridge in Islington, north London. Now, she and her partner, Paul, and their daughter, Mabel, one, divide their time between their homes in London and Wales. Neither she, nor any of the children she grew up with at Birchwood \u2013 many of them still close friends \u2013 have chosen to raise their own children in communes. They never particularly rebelled against their parents (who had done all the rebelling for them) and have all grown up to have good relationships with their parents. &quot;We all have a very positive memory of it. And it was an amazing way to grow up,&quot; says Geetie. &quot;But as a child growing up in a commune, you are aware of how hard it is as an adult. I could see the way it worked, and I respect it enormously. I don&apos;t see it as haphazard or chaotic. It was completely effective and really positive.&quot; But that kind of life is not for her and her family now. &quot;The real problem would be that I would want to be in charge, and that wouldn&apos;t work. There has to be no one in charge. And I just like things done my way.&quot; Geetie&apos;s Cookbook by Geetie Singh and Sara Berg is published by Grub Street, \u00a318.99.

Imagine the size of your wallet. Yet this is the ideal world envisaged by some of Malaysia&apos;s activists championing the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham as a new form of legal tender to replace paper money \u2013 a utopia that could see the light of day as early as the middle of next month. This is when one such group, Muamalah Council, plans to implement the dinar system in Malaysia&apos;s northern state of Kelantan. If information on its website is to be believed, the council has the blessing of the state&apos;s Islamist government, Parti Islam SeMalaysia (Pas), to kickstart the dinar in three moves. First, the state will pay a quarter of its public servants&apos; salaries using the dinar. Second, all state companies will accept dinar payments. Lastly, some 600 commercial enterprises will also embrace this currency. Inspired by selective religious sources and backed by historical precedents within the annals of Islamic history, the gold dinar system is touted by certain fiercely proud Muslims as the Islamic answer to thwart capitalism&apos;s woes. The idea was first mooted by Malaysia&apos;s former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. He argued that the coins would never hang their possessor out to dry in the same way that paper money had. As precious metals with intrinsic value, gold and silver are more resistant to market fluctuations and devaluation compared to the US dollar \u2013 an argument he took to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference as a tool to battle western hegemony. Today, Islamic gold dinar advocates would cite the recent credit crunch as proof. Indeed, the rocketing price of gold \u2013 possibly transcending a record high of $2,000 an ounce \u2013 can only strengthen their pitch. While Mahathir&apos;s grand plan for Malaysia to implement the dinar system by 2003 may have been unceremoniously scrapped by his successor, Abdullah Badawi, the idea has since gained currency beyond Malaysia&apos;s shores. In neighbouring Indonesia, for instance, an outfit known as Wakala Induk Nusantara (WIN) had begun minting Islamic gold coins for use in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. Its spokesman, Riki Rokhman Azis, claims that the number of dinars used in the world&apos;s most populous Muslim nation has more than doubled in 2009 to 25,000 pieces. What is perhaps more striking is the UK connection to the increasingly globalised Islamic gold dinar movement. The Indonesian grouping is adhering to a fatwa issued by the South African-based cleric Sheikh Abdalqadir as-Sufi, a Muslim convert in Cape Town formerly known as Ian Dallas of Scotland. Then there is Dinar Exchange, the British equivalent of Indonesia&apos;s WIN. As the &quot;official certified supplier of Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham in the United Kingdom&quot;, the company had just concluded a month-long series of roadshows in May that saw it promoting the gold dinar to Muslims in key UK cities such as London, Birmingham and Edinburgh. The group is inviting more to spread this Islamic vision as dinar agents. For a fee, of course. As the dinar movement gathers momentum, its propagators \u2013 which include some of the Muslim world&apos;s most polemical figures such as the Trinidad-born cleric Imran Hosein \u2013 would doubtless dismiss Antony Lerman&apos;s recent suggestion in the Guardian that no credible anti-capitalist doctrine exists today. To them, the Islamic gold dinar is perhaps mankind&apos;s best-formulated answer to beat capitalism&apos;s excesses. Yet, as an anti-capitalist weapon, the Islamic gold dinar is far from mint. It is motivated by politics more than benign religious values. The Kelantan example is instructive. Implementing the Islamic dinar serves as a political statement to Muslim voters that Malaysia&apos;s Islamist opposition party, Pas, is more Islamic (and hence more legitimate) compared with its competitor, the United Malays National Organisation. Even in its pristine form, the idea as it is originally propagated by Mahathir could be read as a radical attempt at power politics. But a more serious flaw lies in its contradiction. At the heart of the dinar system can still be found the same capitalistic spirit of commodification. It lacks the egalitarian spirit embodied in socialism&apos;s virtue of the common good. Its advocates say that the poor could never be taken advantage of because the coins they own have intrinsic value. But Britain&apos;s recent gold-rush dilemma suggests that the poor do not always get their money&apos;s worth \u2013 even when trading gold. Like paper money, gold is also vulnerable to the manipulations of valuers, our gatekeepers of wealth. And let&apos;s be honest, how many of the poor have stacks of gold already in their possession? Gold is a precious metal precisely because it is so rare. On a wider scale, who is to prevent gold-rich nations from banding together as a cartel to fix prices at exorbitant amounts in the same way that the oil-producing nations of OPEC did? Or multimillion corporations from exploiting poor but gold-rich nations? This is best exemplified in the case of Pacific Rim, a Vancouver-based firm that has filed an appeal via the Central American Free Trade Agreement (Cafta) to bypass local legislation so they can mine for gold in El Salvador despite local objections. In a world mired by climate change troubles, one also needs to mind the environmental cost of gold mining \u2013 an operation that involves huge amounts of water and toxic chemicals. The Islamic gold dinar could not thwart capitalism&apos;s excesses. It is only providing one more avenue for exploitation. For this reason alone, it will not have my buy-in."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/singapore-british-arrest-alan-shadrake", "sentences": ["A veteran British journalist and author promoting his book on the death penalty in Singapore was arrested in the country today for alleged criminal defamation and other offences.", "Alan Shadrake&apos;s arrest came two days after Singapore&apos;s Media Development Authority lodged a police report.", "The 75-year-old&apos;s latest book, Once A Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice In The Dock, contains accounts of high-profile cases in Singapore involving the use of the death penalty, and includes interviews with a former executioner, Darshan Singh.", "Death penalty opponents who helped to organise the Singapore launch were told by police that no bail had yet been set for Shadrake, whose passport has been impounded.", "Last week one of Singapore&apos;s biggest book retailers, Kinokuniya, withdrew the book from its shelves after it was contacted by the Media Development Authority, which controls censorship in Singapore, according to the Asian Correspondent website.", "In publicity material for the book, Margaret John, from Amnesty International Canada, described it as &quot;a timely contribution to growing criticism of Singapore&apos;s shameful use of the death penalty&quot;.", "Shadrake attracted the attention of authorities in Singapore in 2005 when he revealed the identity of Singh shortly before he executed an Australian drug trafficker, Nguyen Van Tuong.", "The case, a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in Australia, led to friction between the Australian and Singaporean governments.", "Singapore has a reputation for taking tough legal action against what it sees as unfair criticism.", "In March last year a judge found a Wall Street Journal senior editor, Melanie Kirkpatrick, in contempt of court for allegedly impugning the independence of Singapore&apos;s judiciary.", "In October the Far Eastern Economic Review and its editor-in-chief, Hugo Restall, lost an appeal in a defamation lawsuit brought by Singapore&apos;s founding leader, Lee Kuan Yew, and his son, the current prime minister, Hsien Loong Lee, over a 2006 article that they said implicitly suggested they may have abused the public&apos;s trust.", "&quot;In the interests of security, public order, morality, national harmony, or friendly foreign relations, Singapore law authorises censorship of content and distribution of print material and films, severe limits on public processions and assemblies, and prolonged detention of suspects without trial,&quot; was Human Rights Watch&apos;s verdict on the city state."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-18T17:20:20Z", "title": "Singapore arrests British author of death penalty book", "tags": ["Singapore", "Publishing", "Books", "World news", "Alan Shadrake", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "A veteran British journalist and author promoting his book on the death penalty in Singapore was arrested in the country today for alleged criminal defamation and other offences.

In his interview, Gove said that Tony Blair wanted every school to have the freedom that academies have. He said that Blair&apos;s proposals were blocked by people like Balls &quot;who didn&apos;t want the dynamism that the academies movement can bring&quot;. Gove also denied rushing the academies legislation through parliament too quickly.      It&apos;s striking that the Labour government in 1997 introduced its first piece of education legislation at an even faster pace than we did. They introduced it at speed. They didn&apos;t have a committee stage.  9.15am: At the end of last week the government said that the release Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, was a mistake. Today David Cameron went even further. In his interview on BBC Breakfast, asked if BP had lobbied for the release of Megrahi, Cameron replied:      I have no idea what BP did, I am not responsible for BP. All I know is as leader of opposition I couldn&apos;t have been more clear that I thought the decision to release al-Megrahi was completely and utterly wrong.  9.19am: Back to the &quot;Big Society&quot;. Yesterday Ed Miliband, the Labour leadership contender, accused the government of &quot;cynically attempting to dignify its cuts agenda by dressing up the withdrawal of support with the language of reinvigorating civic society&quot;. This morning David Cameron rejected that charge. According to the Press Association, this is what he told BBC Breakfast.      It is not a cover for anything. I was talking about the big society and encouraging volunteering, encouraging social enterprises, voluntary groups to do more to make our society stronger, I was talking about that way before we had a problem with cuts and deficits and all the rest of it. This would be a great agenda whether we were having to cut public spending or whether we were increasing public spending ... This is not about trying to save money, it is about trying to have a bigger, better society.  9.54am: What is David Cameron&apos;s &quot;Big Society&quot; all about? Cameron has talked a great deal already about what he has described as his key philosophy, but today&apos;s speech does go further. Here are some of the new claims and arguments (based on the extracts from the speech released by Downing Street in advance). \u2022 It&apos;s about &quot;communities with oomph&quot;. I&apos;m not quite sure how you define one, but it&apos;s a vivid phrase. Cameron says: &quot;We need to create communities with oomph \u2013 neighbourhoods who are in charge of their own destiny, who feel if they club together and get involved they can shape the world around them.&quot; \u2022 It&apos;s about &quot;a whole new approach to government&quot;. Cameron has made bold statements about his &quot;Big Society&quot; vision before. But today&apos;s he&apos;s in rhetorical overdrive.      For a long time the way government has worked \u2013 top-down, top-heavy, controlling \u2013 has frequently had the effect of sapping responsibility, local innovation and civic action. It has turned many motivated public sector workers into disillusioned, weary puppets of government targets. It has turned able, capable individuals into passive recipients of state help with little hope for a better future. It has turned lively communities into dull, soulless clones of one another. So we need to turn government completely on its head.  \u2022 It&apos;s about volunteers keeping museums open late. As Allegra Stratton reports, Cameron will announce that four areas will become &quot;vanguard communities&quot; where councils will be free to experiment with running some new public services. In his speech Cameron gives some examples of what this means.      From devolving budgets to street-level, to developing local transport services, taking over local assets such as a pub, piloting open-source planning, delivering broadband to local communities, generating their own energy and here, in Liverpool, building a volunteer program so they can keep local museums open for longer. \u2022 But it&apos;s not about pilot programmes. Cameron says: &quot;This is not an initiative. We have not hired a tsar. These are not &apos;pilots&apos; that will be &apos;rolled out&apos;. This is a big advance for people power.&quot; This is odd, because the decision to nominate four areas as &quot;vanguard communities&quot; sounds exactly like a conventional Whitehall pilot programme. I can&apos;t see, from what I&apos;ve read so far, why Cameron is claiming otherwise. Perhaps the full text will explain. There&apos;s also some fascinating political positioning in the speech. I&apos;ll write about that shortly.  10.40am: And now something about the politics of the &quot;Big Society&quot; speech. The key point is that David Cameron is sounding more and more like Nick Clegg. When Cameron and Clegg unveiled their coalition agreement at a press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden, Clegg said that the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats had a common purpose.      For me, that is what liberalism is all about: ensuring that everyone has the chance, no matter who they are and where they are from, to be the person they want to be. To live the life they want to live. You can call it fairness. You can call it responsibility. You can call it liberalism. Whatever words you use the change it will make to your life is the same. When Clegg said this in May it sounded moderately interesting, and it was an acknowledgement that Cameron and Clegg are both committed to decentralisation, but it also smacked a little of desperation, as if Clegg were trying to paper over the very real ideological differences between the two parties. But, in a speech at Demos on Friday (pdf), Clegg returned to the theme. His words sounded much the same. But this time he was speaking with some knowledge of what it is like to work with Cameron in government. And he more or less described Cameron as a Liberal. I&apos;m using a capital L because Clegg used a capital L, as you can see.      David Cameron and I just this week wrote an article together arguing in favour of a radical redistribution of power. Sometimes the differences between us are on matters of substance; but very often they are merely questions of language. David Cameron&apos;s eloquent description of what he calls the Big Society is what I would call the Liberal Society. Today Cameron says he agrees. He seems quite happy to be co-opted into the Clegg camp. This is how he puts it.      Let me briefly explain what the Big Society is...You can call it liberalism. You can call it empowerment. You can call it freedom. You can call it responsibility. I call it the Big Society.  Why does this matter? I can think of two reasons. First, it shows that Cameron and Clegg have not just entered an alliance of convenience. Arguably, they are both starting to redefine what their parties actually stand for, because they want to strengthen the coalition. Many Tories and Liberal Democrats won&apos;t quibble with this. But it&apos;s inevitable that some of them will. Second, it suggests that that Cameron and Clegg are moving towards some form of electoral pact. I&apos;m now entering the realm of speculation, not fact, but it seems worth a sentence or two. If Cameron and Clegg are still talking like this in 2014 (admittedly, a big if), it&apos;s very hard to see why they would want to fight an election campaign as rivals.  10.47am: The &quot;Big Society&quot; doesn&apos;t include the British Shipbuilders Corporation. It is one of four quangos being abolished by Vince Cable, the business secretary. In a press notice, he says the British Shipbuilders Corporation will be axed next year and that the other three - the Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property policy (SABIP), SITPRO (Simplifying International Trade) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Advisory Body (WAB) - will all get the chop within the next 12 months. The work done by SABIP will be taken over by the Intellectual Property Office and Cable&apos;s business department will take responsibility for the functions performed by the others. Cable says this shows he&apos;s serious about culling quangos.      We are absolutely committed to reducing the number and cost of quangos that we no longer need. I have already said that I want to reduce the number of these bodies by a third and we&apos;ve achieved a lot in a short space of time. This is the latest phase of that work. By bringing these functions back into government, we make their activities more accountable and can reduce the considerable administrative costs that they place on the taxpayer.  10.58am: David Cameron is delivering his &quot;Big Society&quot; speech now. A Downing Street aide has been in touch to explain why the four &quot;vanguard community&quot; pilots aren&apos;t really pilots. (See 9.54am) She says the word &quot;pilot&quot; suggests the government imposing a policy on an area. These four areas actually approached the government and asked to be given new freedoms.  11.06am: The &quot;Big Society&quot; event is still going on. Downing Street is streaming it live. Rory Stewart, the new Tory MP for Penrith and the Border, has just explained why Eden Valley in Cumbria wants to be a &quot;vanguard community&quot;. He said it was a rural place with a low population density where people were used to doing things for themselves. But some government rules were getting in the way, he said. He said that one librarian complained to him recently that in order to change a lightbulb, she needed to get an electrician from a town almost 50 miles away. Cameron spoke about launching a &quot;Big Society&quot; bank. But, according to the Financial Times, it may have to launch with reserves of as little as \u00a360m.  11.24am: Phil Redmond, the Brookside creator and creative director of Liverpool&apos;s 2008 European capital of culture programme, has been speaking at the &quot;Big Society&quot; event. He is chairman of National Museums Liverpool and he wants to extend a scheme that allows volunteers to work in the city&apos;s museums. David Cameron has given it his backing. Redmond said that he expected the elderly to volunteer, but many of the people who have come forward are under the age of 30.      Those volunteers are under the age of 30, we think, because there are young people who actually want to contribute to society, who want to do something meaningful with their time, and they want to find something meaningful to do.   11.43am: The live feed of the &quot;Big Society&quot; event on the Downing Street website has just dried up. Conveniently, it happened just the BBC&apos;s Reeta Chakrabarti asked Cameron to comment on the suggestion that many people still don&apos;t understand what the &quot;Big Society&quot; actually is. Earlier, as Cameron was summing up after the panel discussion, Cameron said that he was disappointed to hear that some of his ministers were still talking about the voluntary sector as the &quot;third sector&quot;. In many cases it&apos;s the &quot;first sector&quot;, because it &quot;got there first&quot; and is &quot;doing it best&quot;, he said. Eric Pickles, Francis Maude and Greg Clark all spoke in the discussion earlier, but I didn&apos;t hear who used the offending phrase.  11.59am: Bob Crow didn&apos;t like the &quot;Big Society&quot; speech. The RMT general secretary has just sent out this statement.      What David Cameron means is an &quot;I&apos;m alright Jack&quot; society where the majority are told to put up with crumbling, underfunded services and a handful of publicity-stunt projects are trumpeted as being the advance guard for his so-called &quot;big society&quot;.  At the weekend we heard that fares are likely to rise by 10% and that the pensioners&apos; freedom pass will be hacked about and no longer available from 60 but pushed back to the new state retirement age of 68. None of this is about a &quot;Big Society&quot;, it&apos;s old-school Thatcherite austerity and cuts that force people to pay through the nose for crumbling and under-funded services that hit the poor hardest.  12.15pm: Here&apos;s some more instant reaction to the &quot;Big Society&quot; speech. The blogger Dizzy Thinks says politicians have been talking about using money from dormant bank accounts - which Cameron plans to use for the &quot;Big Society&quot; bank - for at least five years.      Back in 2005, Gordon Brown, as the then Chancellor, said he was going to use money in dormant bank accounts and give it to community projects. The Tories attacked it, quite rightly, on the issue of whether it was even legal to seize the funds from people&apos;s dormant bank accounts. David Blackburn at Coffee House says that Cameron failed to sell the &quot;Big Society&quot; idea during the general election:      The authors of the Big Society erroneously assumed that people care about community. But community is a turn-off for many, and the Big Society sounded like a nationalised Parish Church meeting \u2013 intrusive, vacuous and dominated by shrill busy-bodies. From Westmoreland to Richmond-upon-Thames, voters hated it.  Hopi Sen says on his blog that Labour should record every time the government cuts a programme that fufils a &quot;Big Society&quot; function.      To begin \u2013 this week the government cut the entire budget of &quot;National Tenant Voice&quot; an organisation that exists to stand up for the interests of tenants in social housing.  12.31pm: The full text of the &quot;Big Society&quot; speech is now on the Downing Street website.       12.50pm: Here&apos;s a lunchtime summary. \u2022 David Cameron insisted that the &quot;Big Society&quot; was not just about saving money. In a major speech in Liverpool (which was effectively a relaunch for an idea that only had a limited impact during the election campaign), the prime minister promised a new approach to government.   The rule of this government should be this: if it unleashes community engagement \u2013 we should do it. If it crushes it \u2013 we shouldn&apos;t.  Cameron said that he would be in favour of decentralisation even without the need to cut central government spending. He also said that he wanted the &quot;Big Society&quot; to be seen as his legacy after &quot;this five, 10-year period from 2010&quot;. (In other words, he&apos;s already planning for the second term.) \u2022 Labour figures claimed the &quot;Big Society&quot; was an excuse for cost-cutting. Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, said:   Make no mistake, this plan is all about saving money, and it will cost even more jobs and lead to more service cuts. The government is simply washing its hands of providing decent public services and using volunteers as a cut-price alternative.  John Prescott put a message on Twitter saying that the Cameron speech showed that this spoof video that Labour produced during the election was now coming true. (For some reason I missed it during the election, but I&apos;ve just caught up now. It&apos;s very funny.)  Interestingly, responding officially on behalf of the Labour party, the shadow Cabinet Office minister Tessa Jowell took a different tack. She said that many of the &quot;Big Society&quot; ideas promoted by Cameron were actually introduced by Labour.   The content of today&apos;s speech is simply a brass-necked rebranding of programmes already put in place by a Labour government. Funding for a social investment bank and for community pubs was put in place in March, and residents have been involved in setting council budgets for a number of years.  \u2022 Vince Cable announced the abolition of four more quangos. (See 10.47am) \u2022 Michael Gove denied pushing the academies bill through parliament too quickly. Speaking ahead of this afternoon&apos;s second reading debate, he said Labour put its first education legislation through the Commons even more quickly. (See 9.09am)  1.10pm: In his speech this morning, David Cameron offered alternative definitions of his &quot;Big Society&quot; concept:   You can call it liberalism. You can call it empowerment. You can call it freedom. You can call it responsibility...  On Twitter someone called Simon Mills has offered his own explanation. Big Society is &quot;a neoliberal hallucinogen,&quot; he says. &quot;It induces delusions of social cohesion but is really a gateway drug for privatisation.&quot;  1.32pm: On the World at One Eric Pickles and Ed Miliband have been debating the &quot;big society&quot;. Pickles referred to the story that Rory Stewart told at the event this morning about a librarian not being able to change a lightbulb without summoning an electrician from nearly 50 miles away. Milband accused him of trivialising the issues. The Labour leadership contender went on:      I&apos;m in favour of people having more voice in their own lives. What I&apos;m not in favour of is government abdicating its responsibility for what it should be doing. That&apos;s what I think this is about.  1.39pm: It&apos;s not all &quot;big society&quot; today. Andrew Lansley has put out a consultation document on the &quot;outcomes framework&quot; he is creating for the NHS. Put bluntly, these are the five criteria that the government will use to decide whether the NHS Commissioning Board (which oversee commissioning in the new devolved system) is doing a good job.  The five proposed criteria are: \u2022 Preventing people from dying prematurely\u2022 Enhancing the quality of life for people with long-term conditions\u2022 Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury\u2022 Ensuring people have a positive experience of care\u2022 Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm. There are more details on this Department of Health press release.  1.43pm: It&apos;s not just the government that&apos;s short of cash. LabourList needs \u00a32,000 just to stay online until the leadership election is over, Alex Smith says. He&apos;s put up a post asking for contributions.  2.03pm: Matthew Taylor, Tony Blair&apos;s former head of strategy and now the head of the Royal Society of Arts, has warned Labour not to dismiss Cameron&apos;s &quot;big society&quot; idea too crudely. This is what he said just now on BBC News.      If Labour is going to criticise the &quot;big society&quot;, it has to criticise it on the basis of agreeing with the idea, but questioning the way it is being implemented. What we&apos;ve heard today, this kind of very crude attack, &quot;it&apos;s nothing but a cynical smokescreen&quot;, it will work in the Labour party, it will work in the trade unions, but I think the public wants to hear something more open-minded from the opposition. Taylor seems to be referring to some of the union reaction. (See 11.59am.) As I pointed out at 12.50pm, Labour&apos;s official response (delivered by Tessa Jowell) was quite different. Far from attacking Cameron&apos;s approach, she said he was just rebranding projects already started by Labour.  2.27pm: Phillip Blond, the founder of the ResPublica thinktank and the champion of &quot;Red Toryism&quot;, has just been on BBC News defending the &quot;big society&quot; idea.      If you talk to all the policy professionals, everybody agrees that this is the way forward for public services and for communities in the future. In a way, the &quot;big society&quot; is beyond party politics, and many on the left see it as well. Interestingly, Blond seemed to spend more time in the interview defending David Miliband than defending David Cameron. That&apos;s because Miliband acknowledged the importance of &quot;big society&quot; thinking in his Keir Hardie lecture earlier this month.  &quot;I take the big society seriously,&quot; Miliband said. &quot;But it is a piece of doublethink \u2013 a small society maintained by voluntarism and charity alone. I want a bigger society, based on reciprocity not just kindness or charity, and I intend to make that a Labour issue.&quot; At one stage &quot;Red Toryism&quot; was very fashionable in certain Conservative circles. But now Blond must be kicking himself. For reasons that I explained at 10.40am, Blond may have found himself more in tune with David Cameron&apos;s thinking if he had invented &quot;Yellow Toryism&quot; instead.  2.59pm: Vince Cable has been touring the Farnborough airshow today. He said the government would promote apprenticeships to deal with the dire shortage of engineers for the aerospace industry. &quot;There is a chronic shortage of advanced engineers - a terrible shortage,&quot; he said. &quot;There are different ways of supporting an industry without just injecting cash. One way is through vocational training.&quot;      Peter Mandelson publishes his memoir The Third Man this week.    3.28pm: Westminster seems to have finally lost interest in Lord Mandelson (for now). Sky has been running clips from an interview this morning but it&apos;s not particularly interesting. However, if there are any readers who are not completely fed up of hearing about him, I can recommend two excellent articles that appeared over the last few days. I try not to hand out &quot;must read&quot; stickers too often, but, in response to these two pieces, it&apos;s unavoidable. First, Matthew Norman&apos;s interview with Mandelson in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. The interview contains Mandelson&apos;s observation that the Labour leadership contest &quot;is going slightly wrong&quot;. But mainly I&apos;d recommend it because it&apos;s perceptive, well written and very funny.      Let me quote your rebuke to Mr Blair recollected in the opening chapter: &quot;You saved your own skin by constantly stringing Gordon along, and then landed him on the rest of us when you went.&quot; &quot;He didn&apos;t lie,&quot; [Mandelson] declares, finishing a bowl of cherry soup he describes as &quot;delicious. Cool, elegant, refreshing \u2026 much like its consumer&quot;.  He knows and loves his food, briefly dismissing the old mushy pea/guacamole confusion myth in the book, and has a paunch he means to banish by running, cycling and walking the dog in Regent&apos;s Park near his home. So what did Blair do if not lie? &quot;It would be better to say that he managed.&quot; Ah, of course. Pinnochio managed pretty well, didn&apos;t he? Walter Mitty had quite a knack for management. Did you ever read the Keith Waterhouse novel Billy Manager?  And the second is the post about Mandelson&apos;s book on the Economist&apos;s Bagehot blog. This is terrific because of the candid description it contains about the way Mandelson controls journalists.      I cannot claim to know Lord Mandelson well: I was a reporter in Brussels when he was an EU commissioner, and I saw him several times in that context. But even as a professional acquaintance of not very long standing, I heard him saying similarly startling things. He is a politician who uses indiscretion as an instrument of control: telling journalists such radioactive things that they understand there is no way they can be put in print. And thus without knowing quite how it has happened, the journalist self-censors, and becomes a complicit part of Lord Mandelson&apos;s world. Or rather, even that is too simple. I remember once interviewing the commissioner, and there was all this palaver that preceded the meeting about how he was very tired, so tired, and did he have to do the interview now. And then we did the interview, and afterwards his ever-patient press spokesman, Peter Power, phoned to say that &quot;Peter is worried that he was not on good form, so suggests you telephone him tomorrow and he will say some more.&quot; I duly telephoned, and the commissioner was stunningly, eye-wateringly indiscreet about what he thought of Gordon Brown, among other things (these were the Brussels years, when the then Mr Mandelson was not on speaking terms with the then chancellor). Was that on or off the record, I asked him at the end. &quot;Oh, you decide,&quot; he murmured. I knew what that meant: if I quoted something that caused too much trouble, I risked having the commissioner rebuke me for breaking a confidence. If it did not cause too much trouble, well, it was all at my risk.  3.41pm: Michael Gove is opening the academies bill debate. Ed Balls will be replying. These second reading debates generally don&apos;t tell us anything new, and there won&apos;t be any surprises when MPs vote at 10pm. But they do allow ministers and their shadows to debate the pros and cons of a bill. I&apos;ll be keeping an eye on the opening exchanges before winding up today&apos;s blog in about an hour or so.  3.47pm: Here&apos;s the text of Labour&apos;s &quot;reasoned amendment&quot; to the bill. In parliamentary terms, it&apos;s the list of reasons why Labour thinks it&apos;s a bad idea.      That this house declines to give a second reading to the academies bill because it creates the legal framework for the expensive free market schools reforms which will be funded by scrapping existing school building programmes; because this approach is based on reforms in other countries which have seen falling standards and rising inequality; because it contains no measures to drive standards, improve discipline or deliver greater equality in our schools; because it fails to build on the success of the previous government&apos;s academies programme and instead focuses additional support and resources on those schools that are already succeeding at the expense of the majority of schools; because schools with the biggest behaviour and special educational needs challenges will lose local authority support for these services, the funding for which will go to those with the fewest such challenges; because it permits selective schools to convert to academy status which risks the unplanned expansion of selective education; because it removes any proper requirement to consult with local authorities or the community before the creation of an academy and centralises power in the hands of the secretary of state over the future of thousands of schools without adequate provision for local accountability.  3.58pm: The Labour leadership contest hasn&apos;t been exhilarating, but at last it has now produced a decent joke. As Paul Waugh reports on his blog, it came from Ed Miliband at the weekend, when he was asked about the Mandelson memoirs at the Unite hustings.      I was tempted to say that Peter Mandelson is his own worst enemy. But I note that Charlie Whelan is in the room.  4.27pm: Michael Gove has just finished his speech on the academies bill. It contained a fair amount of knock-about and, although there were some hostile interventions, Gove never got into serious difficulties.  He described himself as a &quot;born-again Blairite&quot; and he said that his reforms were similar to those proposed by the former Labour prime minister. He had a good response when asked who he had consulted about his plans (&quot;the electorate&quot;). And he claimed that Labour&apos;s reasoned amendment (see 3.37pm) was full of &quot;unjustified assertions&quot;.  The bill did not create a new legal framework, Gove claimed. Money for academies would not come from the school building programme. The reforms had worked in other countries, such as America, Singapore, Canada and Finland, Gove said. And the government did have plans to improve standards and raise discipline.  4.40pm: Ed Balls is speaking in the academies bill debate now. Unlike Gove, he&apos;s not doing any jokes. Here&apos;s a flavour of what he&apos;s saying:      This bill will rip apart the community-based comprehensive education system we have built in the last 60 years and which has delivered record rising standards over the last decade. To rush this bill through in this way is a complete abuse of parliament.  The right honourable gentleman should be ashamed of himself. We will challenge this coalition, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, to support our amendments and put a halt to this deeply ideological, free-market experiment before it&apos;s all too late.       4.47pm: Time for an afternoon summary. \u2022 Labour continued its attack on David Cameron&apos;s &quot;Big Society&quot; proposals. Speaking in the Commons, Yvette Cooper, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said:       All of this talk about the big society is simply a big con to hide cuts in jobs, cuts in help for the unemployed and cuts in support to get people back to work. Rachael Maskell, a national officer for Unite, said:       David Cameron&apos;s big society is an intellectually flawed creed that harks back to a vision of 1950s Britain that never existed. We have been down this road before when John Major had a similar pipe dream of an idyllic Britain of 60 years ago. Earlier Tessa Jowell said that Cameron was proposing ideas already implemented by Labour, and Matthew Taylor urged Labour to support the principle of what the government was trying to achieve. But most of the Labour or union figures commenting on Cameron&apos;s speech seem to have rejected this approach and opted instead of outright condemnation. \u2022 Ed Balls accused the government of wanting to &quot;rip apart&quot; the comprehensive education system. In the debate on the academies bill, the shadow education secretary condemned the plan to allow all schools to become academies as a &quot;deeply ideological, free-market experiment&quot;. Hundreds of teachers, councillors and parents joined a rally in Westminster against the bill. But Michael Gove said his legislation would improve education.  He told MPs:       It grants greater autonomy to individual schools, it gives more freedom for teachers and it injects a new level of dynamism into a programme that has been proven to raise standards for all children and the disadvantaged most of all. That&apos;s it for today. Thanks for the comments."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jul/20/england-cricket-central-contracts-ashes", "sentences": ["A month-long operation in Malaysia, Macau, Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore and Thailand led to the seizure of $10m (\u00a36.6m) and the arrests of 5,000 people allegedly involved in criminal gambling syndicates."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-19T23:06:31Z", "title": "England central contract impasse could derail Ashes campaign", "tags": ["England cricket team", "ECB", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "England cricketers risk boarding the plane to Australia for the Ashes in October with the distraction of not having signed their central contracts. There had been high hopes that a meeting at Lord&apos;s yesterday between the managing director of England cricket, Hugh Morris, and the chief executive of the Professional Cricketers&apos; Association, Angus Porter, would lead to an accord being struck. However, despite talk of &quot;very good progress&quot; in the negotiations, it is understood that both parties have decided to push back sign-off until October. &quot;We are reasonably close but there are some more details that need to be worked through,&quot; Porter told Digger. One reason for the delay is the attempt to broker a three-year contract template in an effort to avoid the perennial negotiations. Yet that has been the ambition for some time and there may be suspicions of a similar breakdown in talks in yesterday&apos;s meeting since it did not translate into final contracts being submitted for approval. &quot;We&apos;re now working on contracts for October 2010 when they come due, rather than trying to rush something out that will only have two months to run,&quot; Porter added. For now that seems an eminently sensible strategy. But if there is any slippage at all in that timetable then England&apos;s players risk heading Down Under for what Shane Warne, Australia&apos;s all-time leading Test wicket-taker, has described as &quot;their best chance ever&quot; of retaining the Ashes with their minds on administrative matters. Behind every great man ... Toni Poole, AKA Mrs John Terry, has perhaps a better chance of representing England in future than her husband. Whereas Terry is among those whose international career is under the spotlight following his atrocious defending in the World Cup match against Germany last month, Poole is awaiting selection for a home international. She is rather a handy dressage rider and has achieved qualification for the all-England event at the College Equestrian Centre in Keysoe in three months, having placed well in a series of British Dressage-affiliated competitions. Perhaps amusingly, given Terry&apos;s difficulties against the Germans in Bloemfontein on 27 June, she owes her success to a horse called Diamond Fritz. Fix probe Interpol has not ruled out the possibility that its trawl through computer and mobile telephone equipment seized in coordinated raids in the Far East last week could lead to evidence of matches having been fixed at the World Cup. A month-long operation in Malaysia, Macau, Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore and Thailand led to the seizure of $10m (\u00a36.6m) and the arrests of 5,000 people allegedly involved in criminal gambling syndicates. Illegal betting in the Far East has been linked with several incidents of football corruption in the past and the volumes of cash involved in betting on the World Cup would have made certainty of outcome particularly lucrative. Although match-fixing is not a central focus of the Interpol investigation, officers will notify Fifa and other forces around the globe if it is suspected. Tables turned David Lampitt, Portsmouth&apos;s chief executive and the former head of the Football Association&apos;s compliance department, will find himself in an unfamiliar position if the Fratton Park club can finally contrive an exit from administrative receivership. That is by no means certain, following Her Majesty&apos;s Revenue and Customs&apos; challenge to the administrator&apos;s Comp-any Voluntary Arrangement last week.

We represent better value for money,&quot; says Chris Bones, dean of Henley Business School. The reputation of a UK MBA has been underpinned by consistently high research ratings, as business schools are mostly semi-autonomous departments of major universities, which draws a steady influx of overseas students. London Business School, Manchester Business School, Cambridge Judge Business School, Said Business School (University of Oxford), Imperial Business School, Lancaster University Management School, Warwick and Cass in London have all seen a rise in ranking and student numbers. In addition, Cranfield, Durham, Strathclyde and Open University Business School have joined an international elite of business schools that are triple-accredited by UK, European and US quality kitemarks. Business education in the UK has never been more widely respected. The rise in international students has accelerated a long-term trend. The Association of Business Schools says more than 80% of all students on full-time UK MBA courses are now from overseas. Henley Business School, part of Reading University, reflects the trend, with most students from India, Hong Kong, China and eastern Europe. Just 20% of its full-time MBA cohort are from the UK. &quot;Students are looking for an internationally recognised brand name,&quot; says Susan Rose, head of MBAs at Henley, where a full-time MBA costs \u00a333,500. Global demand In fact, the MBA is more international than ever, as demand for the gold standard business qualification goes global. Multinational companies want a qualification that crosses borders and the MBA, with its Harvard-based core modules in business strategy, finance and marketing, is widely regarded as the passport to senior management and boardrooms across the world. The rise of the Asian tiger economies of China, Hong Kong, Singapore and India led huge numbers of international students to apply to study MBAs in the west before sparking an academic gold rush as US, UK and European business schools set up branch campuses overseas, usually in partnership with local universities. The top US business schools, Harvard, Stanford and Wharton, attract many of the best students, and numerous US institutions offer generous bursaries for international students. But they are nowhere near as international as UK and European counterparts, and their two-year MBA programmes make them more expensive compared with UK or European rates. At Tuck Business School at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, 65% of students are American, with the rest split roughly from across Europe, Asia and Latin America. Tuck attracts around 250 students a year and its full-time cohort of 500 students is split into small groups for personal tuition according to the areas of business they want to specialise in. &quot;Demand for MBAs is higher than ever. We have 10 applicants for every place and academic standards are extremely high,&quot; says Tuck&apos;s dean, Paul Danos. &quot;Learning at Tuck is like being part of a great big family group. In your two years you will do internships with top companies, and 80% of our alumni stay in the US for their first job working for global companies like Google, Goldman Sachs or McKinsey.&quot; With fees of $50,000 a year most students take out a loan. Like many Ivy League institutions, Tuck has an in-house finance company that arranges low-interest student loans. Starting salaries on graduating are on average 2.5 times what a person was earning on entry. European leaders In Europe, IMD, Insead and the two Spanish schools IESE and IE (formerly known as Instituto de Empresa) lead the world rankings. Other schools are catching up fast. Set up as an executive training arm of Nestl\u00e9, Lausanne-based IMD is a private, not-for-profit foundation specialising in executive education for multinational corporations. &quot;That makes us a lot closer to business,&quot; says IMD&apos;s MBA faculty director, Martha Maznevski. &quot;Students who study with us are looking to change career, industry sector or location. More than half will change all three.&quot; IMD MBA students are older and more experienced than in many business schools. Their aim is jobs in senior management and even boardroom appointments. &quot;Companies are taking fewer risks in hiring. They want people with a significant track record and they are not just looking for a generic MBA. They are looking for individuals,&quot; says Maznevski. Five years&apos; management experience and fluency in two languages and a high Gmat (entry test) score are essential entry requirements. Based at Erasmus University, Rotterdam School of Management (RSM) is among the top 10 in Europe and one of the most international. &quot;We are 95% international and are noticeably more European than business schools in France or in the UK,&quot; says RSM&apos;s dean, George Yip. The Dutch school specialises in MBAs with a conscience. The Aspen Institute, an international thinktank from the US, ranks the school second in the world for teaching corporate social responsibility and sustainability. &quot;The financial crisis has made a difference to public perception of business. It is clear that the American model of shareholder capitalism is not working. Our [MBA] model [provides a] multi-stakeholder perspective,&quot; says Yip. Yip, who has taught in Harvard, UCLA, Judge Business School and London Business School, believes European institutions are where change is happening. To prove his point he cites RSM&apos;s move towards introducing technology that will encourage virtual online discussion. One thing is sure \u2013 competition between the world&apos;s top-ranking business schools is driving innovation and best practice. Embas: Stepping stone to the top job Global executive MBAs (Embas) are on the rise. Tailor-made for time-pressured senior executives whose jetsetting lifestyle leaves little time for conventional study, these qualifications bring together students from across the world. Rotterdam School of Management&apos;s global OneMBA is delivered in Washington, Mexico and Brazil, while the Trium MBA is taught on the Paris campus of \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris (HEC), at the London School of Economics and at the Stern Business School, New York University. The global Emba from the Business School of the University of Navarra (IESE) connects Madrid, New York and Shanghai. &quot;The bar for acceptance is very high and we&apos;re open to people from many cultures,&quot; says Frank Brown, dean of Fontainebleau-based Insead Business School. Insead&apos;s global Emba is aimed at senior executives with a minimum seven years&apos; management experience as the stepping stone to becoming a chief executive. Launched in 2003, the Insead programme spans France, Singapore and Abu Dhabi, where students fly in turn every six weeks for a week-long taught residential module. During the MBA, students will spend 12 weeks in face-to-face classroom sessions and the rest of the time distance learning. &quot;You can do it and keep the day job!&quot; says Brown. Choice of location is paramount. Insead&apos;s Fontainebleau campus is within easy reach of France&apos;s main transport hub, Charles de Gaulle airport. Abu Dhabi is within easy flying distance of India and Africa and serves a significant expatriate business community based in the Gulf, while Singapore is one of the world&apos;s fastest growing economies."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/20/bali-tourism-boom-culture-threat", "sentences": ["But Indonesia still lags behind Singapore and Malaysia, with 9 million and 17 million visitors a year, respectively, so there is a constant effort to improve the country&apos;s image."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-20T13:01:06Z", "title": "Bali fears for its cultural heritage as tourists flood into Indonesia", "tags": ["Bali", "Indonesia", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "People laughed when the Indonesian minister of culture and tourism bragged at the start of the global recession that tourists would soon be flocking to Bali to escape the stress.

The flotilla will join the 24 specialist ships that have been spraying dispersal agents, soaking up crude with panels of absorbent felt and using a floating barrage to prevent the slick from contaminating the beaches near Dalian. Investigators have also launched a probe into the pipeline explosion that caused the seepage on Friday night and has subsequently forced the authorities to restrict access to Dalian Xingang oil terminal. A 300,000-tonne crude oil tanker, owned by Singapore Pacific Petroleum which was unloading its cargo at the time of the accident, has been held for checks. The domestic media said there have been safety concerns at the port for some time. An environmental protection bureau study on the petrochemical industry in 2006 identified five projects at the Dalian Xingang Port as potential risks, according to Global Times. Economic activity in the north-eastern port has been seriously disrupted. Six &quot;very large crude carriers&quot;, with about 12m barrels of oil, were expected to be diverted, possibly to South Korea or other terminals in China with the capacity for such large vessels. Ships carrying imported corn have also been forced to dock elsewhere. Thousands of firefighters have doused the flames and port engineers have staunched the leak, but the clean-up mission will take at least four more days, according to the domestic media. Officials said the dispersal operation was making progress despite rough seas. Considerably smaller in scale than the BP leak in the Gulf of Mexico, the slick has reportedly shrunk by more than a third from its peak of 50 square kilometres. But local reporters said the crude was evident on nearby beaches, where patches of sand and rocks were coated in a layer of oil. The leak is likely to add to persistent calls for tighter environmental regulation in China. The need for improved standards was also highlighted by a toxic spill from a copper mine in Fujian month that poisoned a major river, killed countless fish and threatened the drinking supplies of downstream communities.

Is India a high risk area and what can we do to prevent getting malaria?Carly Elia, by email I&apos;ve just visited all sorts of websites I don&apos;t normally frequent trying to find out whether Cheryl Cole was taking anti-malarial pills and other preventatives, but while my life is now richer for knowing who Derek Hough is, the answer is inconclusive. While no treatment is 100% effective, you can dramatically reduce the risk of contracting malaria by taking the course of tablets for where you&apos;re going, and reduce it even further by liberally using mosquito repellent and covering your arms and legs with loose, light clothing. The useful Malaria Hotspots website suggests that the risk of contracting malaria in Goa is variable and anti-malarials are usually advised. Not everyone does though, and you will find different opinions if you look around the web. It always seems odd to me, however, that given what a dismal and dangerous experience having malaria is so many people don&apos;t take prophylactics. Speak to your doctor and get what you need. Useful for general travel health advice is the website fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk. I have recently decided to go to Australia over New Year. I was wondering if it&apos;s best to book flights out there now or leave it to the last minute? Would there be a big price difference the later I leave it? Alice Laura Jenkins, by email If you&apos;re travelling anywhere between early December and early January you should book early. There are no late deals available for this, the busiest of times to travel. When it comes to Australia, demand for economy fares is high and you may find that choice is already restricted. Ben Briggs of Austravel  says: &quot;It&apos;s not a case of how much flights will be if customers wait until the last minute to book, it&apos;s a case of whether there will be any seats left. Currently, December is Austravel&apos;s most requested departure month and customers are realising that the most popular dates around 9 December have already sold out. It is around this date that airfares also tend to rise significantly. What&apos;s more, there is also very little availability to return before 12 January.&quot; The fact that January is summer holiday time in Australia adds to the congestion. Austravel also notes that if customers are flexible with their travel dates, good-value fares are still available. Malaysia Airlines has an offer flying to Sydney from \u00a3899 departing 2 December and returning 13 January. For dates nearer to Christmas, Thai Airways has availability departing 15 December and returning 5 January from \u00a31,499. Briggs also suggests that &quot;if you are happy to stop over en route for a couple of days more options become available&quot;. We will be in Dubrovnik next May. I&apos;ve been trying to figure out the best way to get from Dubrovnik to Verona in Italy. I thought about a boat from Split to Ancona and then the train, but that means about two hours from Dubrovnik to Split, 4 1/2 hours on the ferry (if there is a fast boat at that time of year) and then four or more hours on the train to Verona. Of course that doesn&apos;t include time to make the connections. What about a flight from Dubrovnik to Venice or Bologna and then the train? Which airlines do those routes? How much do you think it might cost? David Chudnovsky, by email Ironically, the cheapest route I have found involves flying back to the UK from Dubrovnik with British Airways, changing planes at Gatwick and catching another flight to Verona \u2013 both legs are currently on offer in May for around \u00a3160 in total and the whole journey takes 10 hours. But I&apos;m assuming this isn&apos;t what you had in mind. Dubrovnik&apos;s transport links reflect the fact that Croatia&apos;s Dalmatian coast is a holiday destination rather than a national capital or business and travel hub. Therefore fast ferries are seasonal \u2013 last year the SNAV-operated Split to Ancona fast boats ran from early June to early September \u2013 and most flights go to and from northern European destinations. If you want to get somewhere out of the main season then the journey is complicated. Slower ferries will be your main no-fly option unless you wanted to do the whole route by bus. There is a bit of land travel involved whichever route you take, either heading direct from Dubrovnik to Bari or first heading north and going from Split to Ancona. Both these services are run by Jadrolinija and fares depend on which class and route you opt for. The only faster option is taking two flights to Verona, requiring travel via Rome and costing at least \u00a3250 with Croatia Airlines and Alitalia. It would be cheaper to travel to Milan or Bergamo instead of Verona, via Rome, Zagreb or both, but you then need to travel onward to Verona by rail. I&apos;ve been invited to visit a mate who lives in Singapore and to watch the Grand Prix while I&apos;m there in September. I&apos;d like to combine my trip with a few weeks of sunshine and had planned to head up to Thailand for 10 days or so with my girlfriend but from the various forums I&apos;ve read, it looks like it might be a bit wet. Should we risk it? If so, where should we go for a bit of peace and quiet, maybe a bit of pampering. Looking at a budget of \u00a3100 a night between the two of us. Also, what&apos;s the latest situation in Thailand in terms of the protests?Simon Towndrow, by email There&apos;s a remarkably detailed and helpful post on Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorn Tree about wet-season travel to Thailand, which is well worth a read. The usual advice on this \u2013 that it rains most days but is sunny in between downpours \u2013 is essentially true, but it&apos;s important to note that there&apos;s no guarantee that this will be the case. At the end of September it is drier on the southern Gulf islands, such as Koh Samui, than it is on the Andaman Coast, which bears the brunt of the southwest monsoon. While there shouldn&apos;t be enough rain to ruin your trip, you will find that some smaller or more remote resorts are closed. You may wish to play it safe by heading somewhere you&apos;re not dependent on getting to by boat, but many travellers also suggest the only precaution you need take is packing an umbrella. If you do choose to head for a flight-only option, you can fly direct with Bangkok Airways from Singapore to Koh Samui (returns from \u00a3170; bangkokair.com) and either settle in here or divide your time between this island and neighbouring Koh Pha-Ngan. Both have a real mix of accommodation available, from cheap and cheerful shacks to blow-out resorts, with lots of reasonably priced and fashionable options available. I-escape has a good selection of places to stay on these islands. One stand-out is the Muang Kulaypan resort on Koh Samui (kulaypan.com), a design hotel whose rates drop to \u00a385 per night in the wet season. It&apos;s business as usual for many in Thailand after the protests in May and June \u2013 even though the state of emergency has been extended.

Once again, the BBC has issued a humiliating apology for its output, although this time the beneficiary is not Alastair Campbell but Eamonn Holmes. The main thing is, the good guys are still winning. As one of the key pieces in the Lost in Showbiz Summer Collection, Eamonn Holmes matters. I mean really matters \u2013 like celebrity lesbians and small fluctuations in the Singapore tea markets. His pain is our pain \u2013 so imagine our relief to learn that the Sky breakfast presenter had taken the sensible course of action after being teased on Jon Culshaw&apos;s The Impressions Show. To wit, he called in his lawyers. Eamonn, it seemed, was not amused by a recurring sketch on the programme, which saw him portrayed as a television presenter given to eating everything in sight, only for his long-suffering producer to wonder where key items have got to. Everything from a sofa to studio guest Frankie Dettori vanished down the Holmes gullet, before Culshaw-as-Eamonn would deploy a variation of the catchphrase, &quot;I was fierce hungry, so I was.&quot; I need hardly tell you that the United Nations dithered over the appropriate course of action to take over this flagrant breach of international law, with that gutless talking shop reduced to bleating that poking fun at Eamonn Holmes wasn&apos;t technically in breach of the Geneva Convention. You&apos;ve got lard on your hands, Ban Ki-Moon. Lard on your hands. Happily, Eamonn was more bullish, and to this end instructed his lawyers to fire off a legal letter to the BBC. On what grounds, you might ask? As a source close to Eamonn told reporters: &quot;It was the fact that it wasn&apos;t just one sketch, there were several, and they repeated the same joke over and over again.&quot; Well. You might have spotted that Eamonn&apos;s pal has provided a useful description of what is known as &quot;a running gag&quot; and &quot;a catchphrase&quot; (stop me if this is getting too comedically technical), upon which almost all sketch shows are hugely reliant. So you&apos;d assume the Beeb immediately realised that despite the ludicrousness of the spat, there was a serious principle at stake here, and gave the letter short shrift. Prepare for disappointment. Instead of dismissing the letter, the BBC \u2013 and I can scarcely believe I am typing these words \u2013 has issued Eamonn Holmes with not simply a public apology, but a guarantee that the character will be dropped for future shows. Attempts to establish from the Corporation on what legal grounds they set this preposterous and dangerous precedent have proved fruitless. In fact, the idiocy is exacerbated by the fact that the sketches in question are so innocuous. The Impression Show is miles away from vicious, and I defy you to view them on YouTube and judge that they are anything other than gentle, surreal teasing. Of course, we know Eamonn is sensitive about his weight, because he recently informed the public of that fact during an interview. (Not the two-part wedding special he flogged to Hello! magazine for a hefty sum; another one.) &quot;It&apos;s because I&apos;m a man,&quot; he explained. &quot;Women have it much easier . . . No one would ever say, &apos;Oh you&apos;re fair piling on the beef there&apos; or &apos;That&apos;s some ass you&apos;ve got on you.&apos;&quot; Mmm. It&apos;s too much to hope that Eamonn was striking a blow for irony in choosing to make these very comments to the Daily Mail, who scarcely observe anything else of the women they parade through their pages, only occasionally leavening the mix by observing that some female is now &quot;too thin&quot;. But if Eamonn has such a powerful aversion to running jokes, perhaps he could spare us the thrice-weekly spectacle of his excruciatingly unfunny attempts to tease Sky News sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao \u2013 whom he persists in referring to as &quot;Jacqueline&quot;, presumably in the belief that it is one of his amusing quirks \u2013 or making smug comments to camera whenever Manchester United win. Or does that sort of repetitive tedium count as banter in Eamonn&apos;s intriguing moral universe? In order to settle the argument, perhaps next time United win, a group of the opposing side&apos;s fans should launch a class action against him claiming mental torture. Because as Eamonn well knows, we can all be a good sport about a gag once or twice, but it&apos;s the cumulative effect of listening to him &quot;repeat the same joke over and over again&quot;, in the words of that chum of his, that leaves the scars. In the end, though, we can hardly blame the old poltroon for trying it on via his lawyer over the Culshaw fiasco. Asking Eamonn not to act like a plonker is about as pointless as arguing against gravity. But in the name of sanity, can&apos;t we expect the BBC not to cave in and compromise past and future editorial content just because \u2013 and forgive the legalese \u2013 some prat off Sky can&apos;t take a joke? Given that this sorry affair has yet to be fitted with its obligatory -gate suffix, I would move for Bloatergate. Yet this is hardly ringing up a so-called national treasure and claiming you had sex with his granddaughter. Come to that, it isn&apos;t even ringing up Eamonn and asking if he&apos;s eaten your granddaughter, and the BBC&apos;s hideously craven reaction is genuinely depressing."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jul/22/power-snooker-ronnie-osullivan", "sentences": ["We love new ideas and it comes down to the viewers and the people who buy the tickets.&quot; If the autumn event is a success, Gunner plans to launch a global series with legs in China, Germany, Singapore and the Middle East, culminating in a London final back at the O2."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-22T19:11:34Z", "title": "'Crowds will love new Power Snooker,' says Ronnie O'Sullivan", "tags": ["Snooker", "Ronnie O'Sullivan", "Sport"], "article": "It was not quite a Gerald Ratner moment. But not for the first time Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan raised eyebrows today by dubbing the world championship &quot;really boring&quot; as he helped launch a new format that is hoped will do for snooker what Twenty20 did for cricket. Power Snooker will begin on 30 October at the O2 in London, with eight hours of live coverage on ITV4. The four top ranked players in the world will appear alongside four wild cards, likely to include crowd-pleasers such as Jimmy White. The new format will feature games lasting half an hour each, with 20 seconds allowed for each shot and double points scored for a two-minute period if the &quot;power ball&quot; red is sunk. The format, created by Rod Gunner and sanctioned by Barry Hearn&apos;s World Snooker, which sees it as an element of its ongoing attempt to overhaul the sport and introduce it to new audiences, will attempt to ape the razzmatazz of Twenty20 through the use of loud music, fast-paced camera action and crowd interaction. &quot;I&apos;ve got to be honest, I find the world championship really boring,&quot; said O&apos;Sullivan, who helped develop the new format. &quot;I&apos;ve won it three times but 17 days in Sheffield is draining. People just want to pitch up and play. Anything new is a challenge. I definitely think this is the future of snooker. It is the year 2010 and we are not stuck in the 1970s any more. Snooker needs a new audience and the idea of a game coming to an end in 30 minutes is exciting. The crowd will love it and the public will enjoy it.&quot; Power Snooker is just one of several experimental formats and Hearn hopes new fans will be drawn in and then migrate to the traditional version of the sport. He continues to see the world championship and the other major tournaments screened on the BBC as the &quot;crown jewels&quot;. Hearn likened the appeal of Power Snooker to the Prizefighter format he recently introduced to boxing and the crowds flocking to darts in search of an unpretentious good night out. &quot;We could be at the birth of something very exciting and something truly global to work alongside existing snooker,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s all aimed at giving more earning opportunities to the professionals that play this great sport.

Peter Rushton, a spokesman for Merseyside fire and rescue service, said: &quot;The bikes will be used to put out small fires and car fires, not fires that represent a danger to property or people. They can get to an incident pretty quickly, so they can turn back fire engines if it is a secondary fire or a false alarm. &quot;Fire engines carry four or five crew members and rescue equipment, so if there is a serious fire this will mean they are more likely to be available.&quot; The service&apos;s group manager, John McCormack, said: We have no intention of using them to replace fire engines.

The company&apos;s shares jumped nearly 12% - the top riser by far in the FTSE 100 - after it unveiled a new licensing deal with Microsoft which could lead to closer ties between the two. They have been partners since 1997 but today&apos;s deal gives Microsoft access to Arm&apos;s chip architecture rather than licensing one product at a time. &quot;With closer access to the Arm technology we will be able to enhance our research and development activities for Arm-based products,&quot; said Microsoft. Some analysts believe this could give Arm access to the Windows-based PC market, which is currently dominated by Intel. RBS analyst Didier Scemama raised his recommendation from hold to buy, saying:  While the announcement is short on details, we believe that this contract could be the precursor of two major developments for Arm. First, it could indicate that Microsoft will design its own apps processor for smartphones and gaming consoles. Second, we believe this deal substantially raises the odds that Microsoft supports the Arm architecture in next generation Windows-based PCs. Microsoft only supports Intel&apos;s x86 architecture for PCs today and if our views are validated, it would help Arm penetrate the 400m plus PC market.  Investec added:  Before this announcement, Arm processors supported both Windows CE (a cut-down version of Windows 7) and Windows Mobile (Microsoft&apos;s mobile phone operating system). However Microsoft had not signed a licence to allow Windows 7 to run on Arm processors. To be clear, today&apos;s announcement by Microsoft does not confirm Windows 7 will be able to run on Arm processors. However we believe it would be logical to assume this now has a much higher chance of transpiring over time, enabling Arm to compete with Intel in this space.  Arm closed 36.8p higher at 353.3p but overall the FTSE 100 had a fairly volatile day, finishing 1.19 points lower at 5312.62 after falling as low as 5272. Despite more positive signs from the US, with better than expected results from Microsoft and Ford, there was much uncertainty before the long awaited stress test results were released.

Standard Chartered slipped 18p to \u00a318.24 as UBS UBS reduced its recommendation. UBS said:  We are cutting our rating on Standard Chartered from buy to neutral.

Better than expected UK GDP figures served mainly to revive the spectre of a sooner-than-expected rise in interest rates. Elsewhere AstraZeneca fell 76.5p to 3146.5p ahead of a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel meeting next Wednesday to discuss its new heart drug Brilinta. Analysts at Jefferies International said:  We suspect that the panel of key opinion leaders may vote in favour of approval. We expect the FDA to follow with a subsequent request for more clinical trials to be conducted before an approval for the US market is given. We continue to see Brilinta as carrying a number of commercial handicaps regarding its future sales, i.e. twice daily dosing, higher dyspnoea rates than Plavix or Effient, increased minor bleed rates, potential exclusion populations and significant cost/efficacy hurdles once Plavix generics penetrate its potential markets. We estimate peak sales for Brilinta of $2bn, though with the added caution of a possible delay to US approval against consensus expectations.  Miners gave the market some support, with Anglo American adding 45p to 2522.5p following news from its 45% owned subsidiary De Beers of strong first half demand for its diamonds. Better than expected figures showed profits rising from $3m to $255m, although the company also announced the surprise departure of chief executive Gareth Penny.

Intercontinental Hotels climbed 29p to \u00a311.89, benefitting from a positive update from US rival Starwood, while Millennium and Copthorne Hotels rose 15.4p to 483.4p after Morgan Stanley moved from underweight to equal weight with a 480p price target. The bank said:  We think recent weaker share price performance fails to reflect that trading in key cities continues to improve, currencies are moving in its favour, and the proposed disposal of the Singapore shopping centre suggests that its attitude to low-return assets is changing. We increase forecasts by around 10% and while momentum is good, a low-return business that is relatively fully valued keeps us at equal-weight.

Ferrari were found guilty of &quot;bringing the sport into disrepute&quot; for ordering Brazil&apos;s Felipe Massa, in coded messages, to relinquish the lead to his team-mate Fernando Alonso, who went on to win the German grand prix at Hockenheim yesterday. They were fined \u00a365,000 and, more significantly, summoned to appear before the World Motor Sport Council, with a hearing due next month. A range of options are open to the council including stripping the team of their one-two finish, deducting points, and, although unlikely, expelling them from the world championship. Button said: &quot;Personally I think team orders in Formula One are wrong, in any motor sport category, although sometimes they are inevitable. &quot;We all want to win, and I know that every team wants to win, both the constructors&apos; and drivers&apos; championships. But they have to give both their drivers the same opportunity to do so. This was very early in the season. How early is it going to start in the future?&quot; For any driver given the message &quot;your team-mate is faster&quot; \u2013 as was Massa by his race engineer, Rob Smedley \u2013 the natural reaction would be to speed up, not slow down. &quot;If I was told my team-mate is faster, I would think my team-mate is faster, so I would keep driving and hope he doesn&apos;t overtake me,&quot; said Button, who now hopes he can take advantage of the sour aftertaste that has no doubt been left within the Ferrari ranks. &quot;We are in front [in the drivers&apos; and constructors&apos; championship] of all of those people who are having issues. Whatever happened, Felipe didn&apos;t look very happy so it is not going to help the environment within the team is it? We are all big boys and we have all experienced things in the past that maybe we are not 100% happy with. But you move on.&quot; Although Ferrari are adamant that they did nothing wrong, Button&apos;s sentiments have been echoed around the sport. The Red Bull principal, Christian Horner, said it was a shame the race had been &quot;manipulated&quot;. He added: &quot;We came in for a lot of criticism in Istanbul for allowing our drivers to race but I think that it&apos;s the fair and sporting thing to do. &quot;The only losers today are Formula One. Ferrari are a big enough team that they shouldn&apos;t need to do that and Fernando is a good enough driver not to, particularly at this point in the season when there are still hundreds of points available.&quot; Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive of Formula One&apos;s commercial rights holders, said he believes the rule forbidding team orders should be scrapped. &quot;I must confess I would agree with anyone who thinks that,&quot; said Ecclestone, who sits on the world council. He added: &quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned a team is a team, and they should run it whichever way they want to run it. Nobody should interfere.&quot; Asked whether he would propose writing the regulation out of the rule book, he said: &quot;I don&apos;t know, we&apos;ll have to see. It&apos;s something that needs to be discussed.&quot; The Ferrari president, Luca di Montezemolo, said rival teams were guilty of &quot;hypocrisy&quot; with their criticisms. &quot;These things have happened since the days of [Tazio] Nuvolari,&quot; he said, referring to the 1930s&apos; Ferrari driver, &quot;and I experienced it myself when I was sporting director, in the days of Niki Lauda and not just then. &quot;Therefore enough of this hypocrisy, even if I can well believe that some people might well have liked to see our two drivers eliminate one another, but that is definitely not the case for me or indeed for our fans.&quot; He added: &quot;I simply reaffirm what I have always maintained, which is that our drivers are very well aware, and it is something they have to stick to, that if one races for Ferrari, then the interests of the team come before those of the individual.&quot; Alonso&apos;s win in Germany put the Spaniard back in the title fight and Button was not sure whether McLaren could close the gap in speed to Red Bull and Ferrari at this weekend&apos;s Hungarian grand prix. &quot;We are a long way behind so I don&apos;t know. All I can say is we will be better and more competitive. Whether we will be quick enough, I don&apos;t know yet,&quot; the world champion said. After such an upturn in fortunes Alonso might have been expected to seem a little happier after his win but the double world champion looked as though his parents had forgotten his birthday as he faced the press afterwards. Where once Alonso was Formula One&apos;s breath of fresh air, bringing the curtain down on Michael Schumacher&apos;s domination with world championship wins in 2005 and 2006, he has been a controversy magnet since he left Renault for McLaren at the start of 2007. During that turbulent season when he partnered the rookie Lewis Hamilton, Alonso became increasingly disillusioned, as he could not get the Woking team to dance to his tune. His deliberate blocking of his team-mate in the Budapest pit lane during qualifying earned him few friends and his demeanour as the Spygate saga enveloped McLaren also did him no favours. At the end of a year he had gone back to Renault and was back under the wing of Flavio Briatore, the man who had brought him into F1 with Minardi in 2002. In 2008 Alonso could only rarely drag his Renault beyond mid-grid but did manage two wins; but the first of these was in Singapore, the race in which his team-mate Nelson Piquet Jr was ordered to crash so Alonso could benefit from the deployment of the subsequent safety car. When the truth broke a year later the Renault team were in tatters, Briatore was banned from the sport and Alonso jumped ship to Ferrari. According to sources within Ferrari, Alonso is the most popular driver to have driven for the Scuderia since Gilles Villeneuve in the early 1980s. That is quite some compliment to be compared to the revered Canadian by anyone at Maranello. Now Ferrari sit under the cloud of a team-orders scandal in which Alonso was the prime beneficiary and it was obvious to all that the Spaniard knew that he and his team had messed up despite his utterances to the contrary. Ferrari may suddenly have the car to beat but the whiff of trouble that has followed Alonso around these past few years will not go away.ends"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jul/27/ferrari-cheating-alonso-massa", "sentences": ["After Crashgate, one of the worst examples of cheating in all sport, when Alonso was the beneficiary of Renault&apos;s decision to fix the 2008 Singapore grand prix by getting his team-mate Nelson Piquet Jr to risk serious injury by deliberately crashing, it seems that F1 is able to brew up its own, very special high-octane scandals."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-26T23:55:00Z", "title": "Formula One, Integrity Nil: Ferrari and the worst brand of cheating | Paul Weaver", "tags": ["Ferrari", "Fernando Alonso", "Felipe Massa", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "When Felipe Massa slowed down so suddenly in the German grand prix \u2013 as if hindered by the unexpected penalty of a brick wall \u2013 and allowed himself to be overtaken by his Ferrari team\u2011mate Fernando Alonso, it evoked murky memories of the boxer who has been sold out by his manager and told to take a dive. The best depiction of the betrayed fighter was Robert Ryan&apos;s Bill &quot;Stoker&quot; Thompson, in the RKO classic The\u00a0Set-Up, and there was much sympathy for him, as there was for Massa on the first anniversary of the day he fractured his skull while racing in the scarlet colours of the Scuderia. Formula One followers, rather mawkishly, used to watch drivers cheat death, or fail in the attempt. Now they watch them cheat each other, and are cheated themselves in the process. Trust F1, in this exceptionally enthralling season, to shoot itself in the F-duct. Hockenheim, already infamous as the place where Jim Clark was killed in 1968, will now be remembered as the circuit where Ferrari, the biggest and most exotic name in motor sport, pulled a slow one. &quot;Dirty air&quot; is a phrase often used in this esoteric world of techno\u2011babble and the track was full of it at the weekend. That is not to say that there is something fundamentally crooked about the team from Maranello \u2013 in fact their best defence may well be that their cheating on Sunday, and its shoddy aftermath, was so splendidly maladroit, so heroically and naively hamfisted, that underneath all the Clouseau clumsiness there must somewhere lurk a sheepish honesty. Team orders which interfere with the race were banned in 2002 after, yes, Ferrari ordered Rubens Barrichello to move over for Michael Schumacher. Many hoary paddock voices say the rule is unworkable and is flouted on a regular basis the entire length of the pitlane. But the problem for F1 in general and Ferrari in particular is that what happened on Sunday represented the worst aspect of cheating. We are cynically resigned to the fouling footballer, to the cricketer who claims the catch even though he knows the ball has bounced or not touched the bat. But the sportsman who deliberately underachieves \u2013 who subverts the bible\u2011sworn evidence of our own eyes, who by decreeing that seeing is no longer believing destroys the integrity of himself, his sport and his witness \u2013 is a more sinister being altogether. After Crashgate, one of the worst examples of cheating in all sport, when Alonso was the beneficiary of Renault&apos;s decision to fix the 2008 Singapore grand prix by getting his team-mate Nelson Piquet Jr to risk serious injury by deliberately crashing, it seems that F1 is able to brew up its own, very special high-octane scandals. What also shames Ferrari is that the instruction to Massa was not made by the team principal himself, Stefano Domenicali, a man under intense pressure, but by the driver&apos;s trusted mechanic, the Englishman Rob Smedley. Today we should be celebrating the team&apos;s resurrection in Germany, for the prancing horse can now be added to what was already an engrossing two\u2011horse race; unfortunately, though, we are looking at five drivers, not six, for Massa appears as a stooge, cut adrift for the sake of his demanding team-mate, for whom this drive-through was more welcome than the one he received in the previous race. After watching five hours of the BBC&apos;s excellent, digitally extended coverage of Sunday&apos;s race I still did not know who had won. We may not know that until next month, following a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council \u2013 presided over, by the way, by the former Ferrari principal Jean Todt, who was in charge during the previous fiasco eight years ago. There are many fault-lines running through the very self-important and hermetically sealed bubble that is Formula One. One is that, rather like a heroine from Russian literature, it is slightly deluded. For all its ostentation and glamour, several established teams, including Renault and Williams, are cash-strapped because of disappearing sponsorship deals. F1 will survive, or otherwise, on its sporting credentials. And what happened at Hockenheim on Sunday afternoon had nothing to do with sport. First Milner, then Young \u2013 the manager may be next With all due respect to James Milner, who looks a decent crosser of a ball, \u00a330m sounds an awful lot of money for a winger who cannot run. That is the valuation Aston Villa have put on him after the player was linked with Manchester City and perhaps a little greed can be expected when you are negotiating with the richest football club in the world. Milner had &quot;amicable&quot; talks with the manager, Martin O&apos;Neill, yesterday but it would surprise no one if he left the club. And what would that really tell you about Villa? The future of Ashley Young is also the source of speculation and if it is true that Villa have become a selling club it could mean the game is also up for the manager, who has probably achieved all he can there. Manchester City, meanwhile, may appear to have no problems at all. But they do, and not only that they may no longer be one of the favourite &quot;second clubs&quot; that people have. Many people have had a soft spot for City because they are the other team in Manchester, and also because they have had such astonishing support of their own, long before all those blank cheques became available. But now that the money is there, there is another problem. How are they going to cut their squad down to 25, which they must do for the start of the new season? Deciding which players are no longer wanted is difficult enough. But finding a club willing to stump up exotic wages of \u00a3100,000 a week and more is something else. Everything I hear backs up the warning of Richard Williams, occasionally of this parish, that football in this country will face a fierce backlash this season, partly because of the recession but also because of that miserable World Cup showing. Most post-mortems on that particular campaign have been completed. But one thing irked me at the time which no one made anything of. It was directly after that opening 0-0 draw with Algeria that Steven Gerrard, the England captain, said: &quot;You&apos;ve got to remember that that was their cup final.&quot; The arrogance was typical. Did the England players not realise that it was their cup final, too? Higgins a hero? Give me O&apos;Sullivan any day Alex Higgins was something of a hero until I made my first visit to the World Snooker Championships in Sheffield many years ago and was told a story about him inviting out a sponsorship girl. When she said no he allegedly head-butted her, which was not exactly sporting. But when Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan says that Higgins was the greatest snooker player ever, he is a long way off the mark. For natural talent \u2013 with both hands \u2013 that is surely O&apos;Sullivan himself."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/27/olympics2012-park-legacy-housing-baroness-ford-andrew-altman-paul-norman-blog", "sentences": ["&quot;When I first looked at the masterplan with the mayor, we both said &apos;this is fine but it could be Amsterdam, Hamburg or Singapore&apos;,&quot; says Ford."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-27T08:39:19Z", "title": "2012 Olympics: Baroness Ford and Andrew Altman on creating 'a great London estate'", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Boris Johnson", "Society", "Regeneration", "Politics", "London", "London politics", "Communities", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Paul Norman at Estates Gazette has interviewed the chair and chief executive of the Olympic Park Development Company, whose task it is to deliver the East London regeneration dream.

They already have:   There will be some significant variation from the original London Development Agency framework for the site, which was produced and consulted on a year before OPLC came into existence. That masterplan, drawn up by architects EDAW, KCAP and Allies &amp; Morrison in 2008-2009, envisaged between 10,000 and 12,000 homes in six village developments at the park - just one of which would provide low-rise family homes. But Ford and Altman, the 47-year-old former deputy mayor of Philadelphia, see things differently. For much of the OPLC&apos;s first 12 months in operation, they have been evangelical about the need for more family housing. &quot;The overwhelming feedback from pretty much everyone was we want to see a greater accent on family housing, as that is plainly the part of the housing mix that is most needed in east London,&quot; says Ford.   As Norman writes, most recent estimates put the new number of future dwellings at between 8,000 and 10,000. He gets Altman and Ford to outline a vision:  What they have aimed for, [Altman] says, is &quot;family terraced housing, great neighbourhoods, crescents and squares, parks and housing around canals and the 1.9 miles of waterways at the site - the neighbourhoods that make London a great place to live&quot;.

Just like the untruth that &quot;very few cabin crew went on strike&quot; according to Willie Walsh, when it has now been confirmed over that 70% took industrial action, the published cabin crew salaries present a gross inaccuracy. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) reveals the true figures. BA cabin crew are already the lowest paid personnel within the company. The average salary cost for pilots is \u00a3107,600. Cabin crew costs are 72% lower. The average maintenance and overhaul personnel salary cost is \u00a339,800. Cabin crew costs are 25% lower. The average ticketing and sales personnel salary cost is \u00a334,600. Cabin crew are 13% lower. And, the salary costs for pilot is some 40% higher than the average market rate of UK pilots. The company compares our salaries with Virgin, easyJet and other UK carriers. But on every internal training course I have ever done, BA make it clear we are a global, full service, premium airline. Comparing our salaries with our biggest competitors, namely, Singapore and Emirates, BA&apos;s proposal for the &quot;new fleet&quot; salaries of \u00a311,000 basic plus \u00a32.40 an hour is not an attractive one. By contrast, Singapore pay \u00a320,792 (not including the annual supplement of one month&apos;s salary or the profit share), flight pay and health and pension packages CAA reports also show that BA cabin crew expenditure has been dropping since 2006 while easyJet and Virgin salaries have increased. For example, from 2006 to 2008, BA salary costs have fallen from \u00a324,709 to \u00a323,654, while easyJet&apos;s have risen from \u00a320,818 to \u00a328,998. Virgin also offer more favourable staff travel perks \u2013 10 free tickets per year for any friend as against BA&apos;s one after eight years and two after 20 years for two nominees. BA&apos;s pensionable pay is on basic pay only. After some 30 years of service, many staff will retire on less than \u00a312,000 per year. Between 2006 and 2008, BA passenger revenue increased, with 2008 being BA&apos;s most profitable year ever. Yet, according to Walsh, in June 2009 company cash reserves were so low that he asked staff to work for nothing. One year on, the BA board has awarded itself a remuneration package of \u00a314m (for 11 members) and wasted \u00a31.4bn on facing down strikes rather than reaching a negotiated settlement. BA charges the most expensive prices in Britain, yet regards its cabin crew as instantly replaceable without it affecting the quality of the brand. The standard of recruits will drop, staff morale will be low but the ticket price will remain high. Customers and shareholders will suffer the most in the end, as there will be nothing to differentiate BA from any other airline."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/jul/30/singapore-british-author-alan-shadrake", "sentences": ["Singapore&apos;s long-serving administration has won some time to ponder how it will deal with yet another self-inflicted blow to its global branding.", "The reprieve came as a Singapore court today postponed a case against the British author Alan Shadrake for three weeks.", "Shadrake, 75, faces contempt of court charges, after Singapore&apos;s Media Development Authority lodged a police report on 16 July against his book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock, which criticises the application of the death penalty.", "Published in neighbouring Malaysia, the book has sparked a criminal defamation investigation against the author in Singapore.", "News agencies, websites, blogs and social network sites are carrying news about the case around the globe and putting a sharp focus on censorship in Singapore.", "The Malaysian foreign ministry, under pressure from the public, has written to the Singapore government to plead clemency for Yong, now 22.", "Meanwhile, the British embassy in Singapore has chosen to play the Shadrake affair low key, opting to give the author quiet support without issuing public statements.", "Although most local NGOs and opposition parties have been characteristically silent, there is a high level of awareness of the two cases among the Singapore public.", "The administration has spent large amounts of money on marketing Singapore internationally, most recently over the upcoming Youth Olympic Games.", "But at the same time it continues to damage Singapore&apos;s reputation with its censorship.", "Singapore, like everyone else, has to increasingly contend with information disseminated by new media and is no longer able to ensure that only positive images of itself appear."], "publicationDate": "2010-07-30T12:14:25Z", "title": "Singapore's reputation on the line as British author fights on", "tags": ["Law", "Singapore", "Censorship", "Books", "Freedom of information", "Freedom of speech", "World news", "Alan Shadrake", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Singapore&apos;s long-serving administration has won some time to ponder how it will deal with yet another self-inflicted blow to its global branding. The reprieve came as a Singapore court today postponed a case against the British author Alan Shadrake for three weeks. Shadrake, 75, faces contempt of court charges, after Singapore&apos;s Media Development Authority lodged a police report on 16 July against his book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock, which criticises the application of the death penalty. Published in neighbouring Malaysia, the book has sparked a criminal defamation investigation against the author in Singapore. Shadrake rejected an offer of mitigation in exchange for an apology at today&apos;s contempt of court hearing and said he would fight on. This means more reputation damage is in store for the People&apos;s Action Party administration in the weeks ahead. Local groups and international human rights NGOs such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Reporters without Borders have criticised the decision to prosecute the author. News agencies, websites, blogs and social network sites are carrying news about the case around the globe and putting a sharp focus on censorship in Singapore. The Shadrake affair comes as a Malaysian, Yong Vui Kong, faces execution next month for a drug-related offence committed when he was 19. The Malaysian foreign ministry, under pressure from the public, has written to the Singapore government to plead clemency for Yong, now 22. Meanwhile, the British embassy in Singapore has chosen to play the Shadrake affair low key, opting to give the author quiet support without issuing public statements. The timing of the two incidents has regalvanised a small group of activists and bloggers. Although most local NGOs and opposition parties have been characteristically silent, there is a high level of awareness of the two cases among the Singapore public. The administration has spent large amounts of money on marketing Singapore internationally, most recently over the upcoming Youth Olympic Games. But at the same time it continues to damage Singapore&apos;s reputation with its censorship. In keeping with tradition, one strategy used at today&apos;s court hearings was to threaten legal action against the media for publicising the alleged contemptuous remarks in Shadrake&apos;s book. That was a lost cause, given the information already circulating on the internet. Singapore, like everyone else, has to increasingly contend with information disseminated by new media and is no longer able to ensure that only positive images of itself appear. Meanwhile, the book in question is flying off the shelves at bookshops across the causeway in Malaysia.

The minister reissued the government&apos;s commitment to a review of the points-based system introduced by Labour, after figures showed that the number of students coming to the UK from outside Europe to study increased by more than 75,000 in the 12 months to March. Despite the rise, the number of students who came in last year is significantly lower than it was three years ago \u2013 before the points-based system was introduced. The UK Council for International Student Affairs warned that the two-year-old system had made it more difficult for overseas students applying for visas and warned against the spectre of &quot;more change&quot;. Under the points-based immigration system, students are required to have 40 points to come to Britain. Applicants receive 30 points for holding a course offer from an approved educational provider, and 10 for proving they can pay the fees and support themselves while in the country. According to Home Office figures, some 313,011 non-EU students were granted visas in the 12 months to March, bringing with them 31,385 dependants. This figure was up from 235,295 students and 24,780 dependants the previous year, but lower than 2007, when 358,000 students entered the country to study, along with 17,100 dependants. Green said new measures would be introduced to &quot;minimise abuse&quot;. He said: &quot;We are committed to attracting the brightest and the best to the UK, and welcome legitimate students coming here for study. However, in the past there has been significant abuse of the student route, and we need to ensure that every student who comes to the UK is genuine. &quot;Therefore I am undertaking a thorough evaluation of the student system over the coming weeks and months and I will introduce new measures to minimise abuse and tighten the system further.&quot; Visas for students from Pakistan and Nepal were suspended earlier this year after an unusually large rise in applications from those countries. Overseas students are seen as a lucrative source of income for universities at a time of cuts to higher education budgets. Dominic Scott, the chief executive of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said there has been &quot;massively increased global demand&quot; from international students in the US, France, Germany and Singapore, among others, over the last year or two. &quot;The beneficial exchange rate has brought real costs down by up to 20% for many students.&quot; The UK has also benefitted very significantly from Indian students who, for a number of reasons, have turned against Australia in droves, he added. But he said the points-based system already put in place had posed difficulties for overseas students applying for visas. Scott said: &quot;UK universities and colleges will therefore be very concerned at the prospect of yet more change after what has already been a rollercoaster over the last 12 months or so and very significant tightening.&quot; Universities UK, the umbrella body for universities, said it welcomed the fact that the new points-based immigration system linked visas to specific institutions, mandatory external accreditation for institutions and greater use of risk assessment overseas. A spokeswoman said: &quot;It should be noted that the number of UK students a university can take is fixed by contracts agreed with government. International students are offered places in addition to the number of places established for UK/EU students.&quot; Aaron Porter, the president of the National Union of Students, said the government risked making studying in the UK less appealing by introducing even tighter measures. &quot;Politicians talk about the UK having world-class universities that attract students from around the world but if they create a student visa system that is overly bureaucratic and punitive, studying in the UK will seem less attractive to students looking to study outside of their home country,&quot; he said. &quot;Since changes to the rules on immigration all institutions need to apply for Highly Trusted Sponsorships from UKBA and this must be renewed annually. Attendance is closely monitored to ensure that a student visa cannot be used as cover for entering the UK simply for work purposes.&quot; A Home Office spokesman said that no details were yet available of the scope and remit of the review. Bahram Bekhradnia, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, said the UK ought to be celebrating the rise in overseas students. &quot;Of course we have to be careful that the system is not abused, but it would be silly to underestimate the advantages. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has calculated that fees from international students generate between \u00a35.3bn and \u00a38bn every year. That&apos;s before even considering the benefits to the rest of the economy, generated by cash spent on food, housing, travel and entertainment.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/02/f1-circuits-world-title", "sentences": ["26 Sept Singapore grand prix Marina Bay Alonso has won here before, if a little controversially, and looks to have the right package this time."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-02T15:22:23Z", "title": "F1: Seven circuits that will decide the world title", "tags": ["Formula One", "Red Bull", "Ferrari", "McLaren", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "29 Aug Belgian grand prix  Spa-Francorchamps Plenty of high-speed corners will suit the beautiful handling of the Red Bulls and Ferraris.

But Washington&apos;s move was less an acceptance of claims that Kopassus has reformed itself than recognition of Indonesia&apos;s growing strategic importance in the face of China&apos;s inexorable rise. Suciwati Munir, widow of the Indonesian rights activist Munir Said Thalib, whose poisoning in 2004 remains unexplained, warned that Barack Obama was &quot;making a dangerous mistake&quot; if he believed Kopassus had changed its ways. &quot;Members of Kopassus have no fear they will be prosecuted for serious wrongdoing \u2026 This will not change until members who have committed abuses are brought to justice,&quot; she wrote in a Washington Post op-ed headlined &quot;Getting away with murder&quot;. Pentagon chief Robert Gates announced the end of the 11-year ban on contacts during a visit to Jakarta, following reported assurances from Indonesia that convicted abusers had been removed from the unit. &quot;These initial steps will take place within the limits of US law and do not signal any lessening of the importance we place on human rights and accountability,&quot; Gates said. But regional analysts suggest the relaxation may quickly lead to the resumption of full-scale, military-to-military co-operation, including combat training of Indonesian forces (suspended in 1998 during the East Timor crisis) and increased financial aid and weapons sales. Such moves would mirror recently enhanced US security collaboration with other regional countries with questionable human rights records, including Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Laos, as well as with long-standing allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia. China&apos;s rulers appear to have little doubt what Washington&apos;s security-first approach signifies. Friction over planned US-South Korean naval exercises in the Yellow Sea and US arms sales to Taiwan was exacerbated by secretary of state Hillary Clinton&apos;s surprise announcement last month that the US has a &quot;national interest&quot; in resolving territorial disputes and keeping international sea lanes open in the South China Sea. Beijing had previously declared that pursuing its sovereign rights in various disputes there involving Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and others was a &quot;core interest&quot;, indicating for the first time that its position was non-negotiable, as with Tibet and Taiwan. Reacting to Clinton&apos;s rejection of this stance at a regional summit in Hanoi, foreign minister Yang Jiechi accused the US of ganging up with other countries while state media claimed angrily Washington was trying to &quot;contain&quot; China. Yang even appeared to threaten unpleasant consequences. China, he said, &quot;is a big country and other countries are small countries, and that&apos;s just a fact&quot;. With a population of 240 million living in a vast archipelago of over 17,000 islands, &quot;small&quot; is not an adjective readily applicable to Indonesia. But Yuri Octavian Thamrin, the country&apos;s ambassador to London, agrees that Indonesia&apos;s increasing strategic importance is of growing interest to the two jousting superpowers. &quot;We see the US as one of our closest friends. We admire and respect them,&quot; Yuri said. Relations had improved under Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child, was personally very popular, and is expected to visit later this year. &quot;Indonesia is at a strategic chokepoint between the Indian and Pacific oceans. 50,000 ships pass through the Malacca Strait each year \u2026 We can be a regional asset for stability, like Egypt in the Middle East,&quot; he said. Co-operation on terrorism, piracy, security and investment between Washington and the world&apos;s most populous Muslim democracy were all improving \u2013 although Jakarta would like to see additional US military aid in recognition of its expanding role, he said. But given the country&apos;s significant economic, institutional and environmental challenges, and its remarkable but still youthful democratic transformation since the end of the Suharto era in 1998, Indonesia was definitely not interested in getting squeezed between China and the US. &quot;Our president [Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono] says our policy is one of &apos;having no enemies and making 1,000 friends&apos;. For us what&apos;s important is promoting national values, institution building, the economy. We would like to see a situation in which the great powers co-operate to enhance regional stability,&quot; Yuri said. The nuances of professional diplomacy aside, it seems Obama is knocking on an open door in Jakarta, non-aligned or not. Gates&apos;s announcement on Kopassus was welcome &quot;but should have happened sooner&quot;, Yuri said; notwithstanding the human rights criticism, a recent survey found 68% of Indonesians believed Kopassus had &quot;more or less reformed&quot; and was no longer a pressing issue. &quot;Civilian-military relations are OK now. People are more concerned now about corruption, terrorism and good governance.&quot; After turbulent decades of &quot;strongman&quot; politics, he said, Indonesia was writing its own success story."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/03/pakistan-india-clinton-cameron", "sentences": ["And in 2008-9, Britain was only India&apos;s seventh-largest trading partner, below China, the US, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Singapore, but above Hong Kong, Belgium and Switzerland."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-03T10:00:10Z", "title": "Pakistan and India care about Clinton, not Cameron | Anita Inder Singh", "tags": ["David Cameron", "India", "Pakistan", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Hillary Clinton", "US foreign policy", "World news"], "article": "David Cameron has been blamed by some in the British media for suggesting that Pakistan exports extremism and for sucking up to his Indian hosts last week. And Charles Moore, former editor of the Daily Telegraph, thinks that it is hypocritical of Cameron to blame Pakistan, since Britain itself tolerates extremists. Actually, Cameron said nothing new on Pakistan. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has repeatedly urged Pakistan to do more to stamp out extremists on its soil \u2013 and she did so again in Islamabad last month. Pakistan did not react by breaking off talks with Washington, as its spy chief has done with London this week. Nor did it protest loudly against Clinton&apos;s statements, as it has against Cameron&apos;s censure of its double-dealing on extremists. This is because Islamabad cannot afford to push its relationship with Washington to the brink. The US has been its largest military and economic donor since the early 1950s \u2013 and by the late 1980s, the official British archives had revealed that London could never offer as much as Washington. Threats to cancel talks with the US \u2013 or carrying out the threats \u2013 could cost Pakistan more than $1bn a year in aid, which it says it needs to quash extremists on its turf. But Britain is just another middle-ranking European country itching to get out of Afghanistan. It is not even the major troop contributor there, so Pakistani intelligence officials can shake their fists at Cameron. At the moment, however, it appears that President Asif Zardari will stick to his London schedule, shake hands and engage in dialogue. At different levels \u2013 and in very different ways \u2013 &quot;America&quot; also explains why Cameron got little coverage in the Indian media, why Barack Obama will address the Indian parliament during his state visit in November, and why Cameron couldn&apos;t in July. No country in the world can offer India as much as the US economically, intellectually or militarily. The sale of 57 Hawk aircraft is simply not in the same league as the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal of 2006. And in 2008-9, Britain was only India&apos;s seventh-largest trading partner, below China, the US, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Singapore, but above Hong Kong, Belgium and Switzerland. More generally, Indians do not carry American historical baggage. The US did not found an Indian empire, and imprison Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru for 11 and nine years respectively for daring to demand independence. Cameron&apos;s wish to reduce the number of non-EU students and immigrants in Britain will not enhance his appeal to Indians. Currently there are more than 34,000 students in Britain and just over 1.5m British subjects of Indian origin. But there are more than 100,000 Indian students in the US and more than 3 million American citizens of Indian origin. It is rare to meet an Indian who has not been a victim of racism in Britain. But an Indian in the US are more likely to tell you that he or she beat 500 white Americans and got the top job in a top American firm, and that more generally, Indians feel accepted as equals by Americans and have close American friends. Indians do not have a British dream. Indians dream an American dream, not just of going to the US but of making their country jump from rags to riches, and finding a pot of gold at the end of the Indo-American rainbow. The national interests and resources of Britain, the US, India, Pakistan will shape their relationships. Cameron should not be criticised for understanding this obvious fact."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/03/singapore", "sentences": ["With the financial crisis a thing of the past, the authorities in Singapore are looking at ways of letting in a fresh wave of immigrants.", "Singapore aims to achieve the world&apos;s highest growth rate in 2010: 13% to 15% of GDP.", "&quot;We have to accept that.&quot; The prime minister is understandably cautious, the government having reasserted its determination to end Singapore&apos;s dependence on foreign labour in February.", "Foreigners account for about a third of the city-state&apos;s 4.7 million inhabitants, a situation that fuels tension among Singaporeans who are afraid of being sidelined.", "In 2009, as Singapore&apos;s economy dipped into recession, shrinking by 1.3%, there was a drastic cut in the number of foreign workers and departures exceeded arrivals.", "According to labour minister Lim Swee Say, the 100,000 workers allowed into Singapore this year will need to be better qualified and more productive."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-03T13:00:40Z", "title": "Singapore plans for new wave of immigrants to help economy's growth", "tags": ["Singapore", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "With the financial crisis a thing of the past, the authorities in Singapore are looking at ways of letting in a fresh wave of immigrants.

The England and Wales Cricket Board lodged an official protest during the final Test in Johannesburg concerning three decisions made by Harper, the most controversial being his not out decision against South Africa&apos;s captain, Graeme Smith, when England referred an appeal for a catch at the wicket, refused by the on-field umpire Tony Hill, to the third umpire. Smith, 15 not out at the time, went on to make 105 and South Africa took the Test by an innings to draw the series. After a laborious six-month inquiry, the ICC has finally concluded what cricket has known all along, namely that Harper was let down by the failure of a sound feed provided by the host broadcaster SABC and, to make matters worse, other broadcasters, including Sky Sports, received their own superior feed, enabling them to lambast him for getting the decision wrong. Harper will be relieved that the inquiry, conducted by the ICC cricket chairman Clive Lloyd and code of conduct commissioner Brent Lockie, has declared in his favour, but believes the explanation could have been given in hours, not months. Many remain adamant that South Africa&apos;s overriding priority at the time was to avoid embarrassment ahead of its coverage of this summer&apos;s football World Cup. The ICC said the Lloyd/Lockie inquiry had concluded that the claims made by the England coach Andy Flower and the ECB chairman Giles Clarke \u2013 that Harper had failed to turn up the volume on his video feed \u2013 were &quot;manifestly wrong and entirely unfair&quot;. The ICC went on: &quot;The volume control had been set by technicians, and they did not operate or adjust the volume control during the entire series. However, differing sounds were heard on the footage of the various broadcasters, namely SABC, Supersport and Sky. The inquiry concluded that it was most likely that the actual sound feed coming through to the third umpire&apos;s room was lost at the crucial time.&quot; The ECB made no comment but, far from being guilty about making false allegations, senior officials feel that by making their protest they have forced the ICC to improve an umpire decision review system that last winter was barely fit for purpose. The ICC executive board has ruled in Singapore that a referral should not be lost if it is overturned because of a failure of technology. It has accepted recommendations in the Lloyd/Lockie report that the best possible equipment should be made available to the third umpire; that a single feed of sound and pictures should be controlled and standardised if multiple broadcasters are covering a match; and that a comprehensive training programme should be devised for all those directly involved in the DRS. That these requirements were not implemented last winter, and that Harper, as the umpire in charge, was not controlling his sound feed, gives the impression of a DRS system introduced into Test cricket on an experimental, make-it-up-as-you-go-along basis. David Richardson, the ICC&apos;s cricket manager, said: &quot;It is unfortunate that the sound feed failed at a crucial time due to equipment failure. Clearly, all cricket stakeholders involved in delivering the DRS need to work together to consider the recommendations arising from the investigation.&quot; Harper provided his own defence on Facebook back in January. &quot;The truth about Smith&apos;s decision may come out eventually,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The host broadcaster didn&apos;t provide the appropriate sound to match the picture.&quot; He added: &quot;The host broadcaster Matthew Hoggard told the viewers that there was no sound so that Smith would be given not out. Five minutes later they found a sound and blamed me. Other networks got their sound immediately but we didn&apos;t get their sound feed. &quot;Sadly when the technology fails ... and that means that some sound engineer has failed to do his job ... they must find a scapegoat and the umpire is an easy target because we can&apos;t fight back \u2026 usually.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/03/wine-investment", "sentences": ["The company has offices in London, Hong Kong and Singapore, with about half of its clients in Asia, and the other half in Europe."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-03T19:32:19Z", "title": "Investors develop a taste for wine", "tags": ["Food & drink industry", "Investing", "Investments", "Business", "Money", "Alternative investments"], "article": "Investments should improve with age.

The fund, which started in December, invests in companies involved in production from the vineyard through to the retailer. Its holdings include farm and fertiliser companies as well as makers of bottles, corks and barrels. Winemakers feature, as you might expect, along with firms operating cellars and wholesale retailers. All the way up the chain, companies connected to the wine trade are cashing in on soaring prices and demand. In March, an Asian collector splashed out \u00a345,000 for a six-litre bottle of Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus 1982. &quot;Wine is such an alternative investment, not too correlated to the stock market; it has limited supply \u2013 as one can&apos;t buy more land in Bordeaux or the Rioja \u2013 and fast-growing demand from emerging countries,&quot; says Jos\u00e9 Luis Jim\u00e9nez, the fund&apos;s creator and managing director at March Gestion. &quot;It won&apos;t go out of fashion as it&apos;s a culture, people go back. And few heart doctors won&apos;t recommend one glass of wine a day.&quot; About 70% of the \u20ac18m (\u00a315m) fund is invested in Europe, while 20% is allocated to the US and the rest is in Asia. Top holdings include champagne maker LVMH, British-based spirits company Diageo, and Spain&apos;s Bar\u00f3n de Ley winery. With a minimum investment of \u20ac6,000, the fund is now looking for a partner in London. Britain is not only a financial centre, it is also the world&apos;s No 1 wine importer, at 1.6bn bottles a year. Would-be investors should proceed with caution and deal with reputable operators as there have been scams. The Serious Fraud Office jailed three men and a woman in 2008 for operating a fraudulent wine scheme promising stellar returns. Wine has proved as resilient as gold during the recession, as investors consider it inflation-resistant, and at least you can drink it if all else fails. Educated palate Consumers are imbibing more and better quality wine as people dine out less and entertain more at home. Majestic Wine, Britain&apos;s biggest independent wine chain, said last month that full-year pre-tax profit soared by 25% to \u00a316m, following an 8% increase in like-for-like sales. It operates 153 stores in Britain, after adding six last year. The shares have gained 33% this year. Wine-focused hotels, such as Hotel du Vin, have proliferated, while EHD, a wine storage business, recently opened an underground facility in Weybridge, Surrey, with a mile of tunnels. Apart from celebrity wine connoisseurs, the site, now 10% full, is targeted at the increasing number of private clients who want to keep quality bottles for about 10 years, says managing director Michael Phelps. &quot;Wine is an interesting commodity, you get good returns, and it&apos;s certainly more fun than seeing a bank statement,&quot; he says. &quot;Wine had an exclusive tag before, but now we see more and more people.&quot; The company is in talks with Waitrose about offering storage services to the supermarket&apos;s clients, Phelps says. Consumers around the world are getting more knowledgeable about wine, becoming more demanding at shops and restaurants. Interest in wine courses is also exploding, and the number of students enrolled at the Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust school in London has doubled to 3,000 over the past nine years. The trust accredits 365 schools worldwide, with a combined 28,000 students, almost three times as many as in 2001, says its chief executive, Ian Harris. A more educated palate is lifting prices. The Bordeaux Index, which tracks about 85 &quot;investment grade&quot; wines of the famous French region, has gained 22% since the beginning of the year. &quot;The cake is getting bigger. Emerging markets are looking to acquire wine, also as a way of investment,&quot; says Joe Marchant, who runs the investment group at Bordeaux Index. The company has offices in London, Hong Kong and Singapore, with about half of its clients in Asia, and the other half in Europe. China China is now the world&apos;s fifth-largest wine consumer, followed by traditional wine-producing countries, such as France, Italy, the US and Germany. Britain ranks seventh, with an annual 19 litres per capita. Despite strong growth over the past few years, Hong Kong only consumes 3.7 litres per capita, a figure that makes wine sellers flock to Asia in search of growth. Asia&apos;s increasing interest in wine is &quot;exponential&quot;, says Stephen Wickens, a Hong Kong-based wine merchant, who recently sold 12 bottles of 1982 P\u00e9trus wine for \u00a350,000 to an Asian businessman. P\u00e9trus, near Saint-\u00c9milion, only produces about 30,000 bottles a year. &quot;It is sublime, it has an additional layer, it has to do with the richness, the power and the elegance,&quot; Wickens says. As much as an investment, Asian consumers &quot;want to share it&quot;. There is also an element of &quot;show-off&quot; buyers, keen to impress clients or bosses. Some of France&apos;s most prestigious names are giving their labels a gilded look, a symbol of status in Asia, a wine merchant says. Names such as 1982 P\u00e9trus, or Chateau Lafite Rothschild, are regular at auctions held by Sotheby&apos;s, which started in Hong Kong last year. Since then, each auction has been a &quot;white glove&quot; sale \u2013 100% sold, by value and by lot, the company says. Asian collectors are now the most important buyers at Sotheby&apos;s wine sales worldwide, representing 57% of the total, compared with 20% in Europe and another 20% in North America, the auction house says. In 2008, the Chinese government eliminated all wine duties in Hong Kong, spurring demand. The city is now aiming to become a wine hub, competing with London and New York. The appetite for high-quality wine is also increasing in developed markets, Sotheby&apos;s says. All but one of the 18 wine sales held at Sotheby&apos;s in 2009 surpassed the company&apos;s estimate. In London, sales reached \u00a39.3m in 2009, a 100% increase over the past five years. Wine boutique hotels, tour companies and educational centres are flourishing around the world. In Spain, the Rioja region hosts five-star design hotels such as Marqu\u00e9s del Riscal, which charges about \u20ac288 a night. Local communities have designed cycling routes and walking tours connecting wineries, re-inventing themselves as upmarket hubs, a radical change from their previous agricultural focus. Behind the returns, the business and the hype, wine cognoscenti such as Jim\u00e9nez say the best cellar is one full of empty bottles bearing the names of people one has shared them with."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/03/london-pr-rwanda-saudi-arabia", "sentences": ["If the direction of travel is right then I am perfectly happy to help them.&quot; Another big UK firm, Hill and Knowlton, has contracts with the Malaysian government&apos;s cyber security agency; the Singapore prime minister; city governments in Beijing, Shanghai and Chonqing; and Saudi Arabia&apos;s investment authority."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-03T19:51:21Z", "title": "Does this picture make you think of Rwanda?", "tags": ["Marketing & PR", "Media", "Rwanda", "Saudi Arabia", "London", "UK news", "World news", "Africa"], "article": "When Louise Mushikiwabo, Rwanda&apos;s foreign minister, was due to speak at her country&apos;s high commission in London reporters from the world&apos;s media waited inside a fake Rwandan village hut and leafed through glossy brochures promoting the country&apos;s famous gorilla trails. Smart-suited young British PR executives poured Rwandan coffee and burbled about presenting &quot;a different image&quot; and focusing on &quot;mountains, gorillas, crops&quot; \u2013 all part of the country&apos;s increasing efforts to reinvent itself 16 years after it was torn apart by genocide. Alluring offers were held out of trips to the nature reserves for journalists willing to write up such topics, and when Mushikiwabo arrived she wanted to share &quot;the good news that has been taking place in Rwanda&quot;. There are more women in parliament than any other country and it has been admitted to the Commonwealth. &quot;We are at a time in our post-genocide history where we have to move on,&quot; she said. As Rwanda prepares to go to the polls on Monday to elect a president for only the second time since 1994, this public relations drive, masterminded by the incumbent president, Paul Kagame, this week faces its sternest test. The government is facing accusations, which it denies, of state murder and corrupting the democratic process. Will the international community accept that Rwanda has indeed, moved on? Tasked with persuading the world is London PR firm Racepoint, hired by Kagame. &quot;You used to Google Rwanda and the first thing you would see would be about genocide,&quot; said Cathy Pittman, Racepoint&apos;s managing director. &quot;Now we are feeding content and stories to journalists about the economy and culture. A lot of it is about images.&quot; It sometimes works. A writer from Foreign Direct Investment magazine was taken on a trip to Rwanda by Racepoint and wrote a piece in February which stated Rwanda &quot;prides itself on having zero corruption&quot; and that &quot;Rwanda is poised to become Africa&apos;s newest success story&quot;. The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, in a report last year, found that Rwanda has &quot;excellent public relations machinery&quot; which has succeeded in &quot;persuading the key members of the international community that it has an exemplary constitution emphasising democracy, power-sharing, and human rights which it fully respects&quot;. It concluded: &quot;The truth is, however, the opposite.&quot; Rwanda&apos;s constitution, the report said, was &quot;a facade which hides the exclusionary and repressive nature of the regime&quot;, &quot;basic human rights are in an unsatisfactory state&quot;, &quot;censorship is prevalent&quot; and there are &quot;serious concerns about the level of political freedom&quot;. On 24 June Jean Leonard Rugambage, a dissident journalist, was approached at the gate of his home in Kigali by two gunmen and shot twice in the neck. The killing sparked accusations and denials that his murder was commissioned by the government, which had already withdrawn his newspaper&apos;s licence to print. Hutu opposition politician Victoire Ingabire has failed to secure registration to stand in the election, leading to claims Kagame&apos;s regime is blocking her candidacy. At Racepoint&apos;s suggestion, James Musoni, Rwanda&apos;s local government minister, wrote an opinion piece for British newspapers, which was pitched to the Guardian, among others, to try to deal with these issues. It concluded somewhat ambiguously: &quot;The government is determined to ensure these elections go ahead peacefully and fairly \u2013 without interference from those inside and outside the country who stand to gain from stirring up instability.&quot; Racepoint also arranged for a Guardian journalist to interview Kagame in Kigali. The resulting story was published on 28 May and focused on the allegations. Earlier this month, opposition politician Andre Kagawa Rwisereka was found dead, reportedly nearly decapitated, sparking concern that the killing was politically motivated. Rwanda is not alone among regimes with controversial human rights records to turn to London&apos;s PR firms for help. Others have hired leading outfits such as Bell Pottinger, led by Lord Bell, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher; Portland PR, which counts Michael Portillo among its advisers; and Hill and Knowlton, better known for representing Adidas, Castrol and Nissan. Leading consultants have fanned out from London to win contracts as far afield as China, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Zambia. A recent report into the phenomenon in Brussels by Corporate Europe Observatory, a campaign group which researches the power of corporate lobbying, said: &quot;Secrecy among both embassies and consultancies keeps much of this phenomenon out of public sight \u2026 some of the consultancies are lobbying on behalf of governments which are directly or indirectly responsible for serious human rights violations.&quot; London&apos;s growing status for reputation management is partly down to the time zone, language, and the important role for their clients of British publications with large international readerships including the Economist and the Financial Times, PR executives said. &quot;If you are managing a client&apos;s reputation, whether individual, company or country, it is the Anglo-Saxon media that matters and particularly the London-based media,&quot; said Ivo Gabara, who advises the Kazakhstan foreign ministry on press relations in London. &quot;Coverage in the US is important but what is said out of London will determine your global reputation.&quot; An Amnesty report on Kazakhstan earlier this year stated that &quot;torture or other ill-treatment of individuals deprived of their liberty, whether formally detained or in de facto unacknowledged detention, continue to be routinely used&quot;. &quot;I take on business I am comfortable to identify myself with,&quot; said Gabara. &quot;In Kazakhstan I see a country making progress on every front including its human rights record, media legislation and political freedom.&quot; The doyen of this business is Lord Bell, the chairman of Chime Group, which runs Bell Pottinger. His firm&apos;s political contracts include Sri Lanka, where the government was recently accused of war crimes and Madagascar, where he acts for the former president, Marc Ravalomanana, who was forced out following violent clashes and was sentenced in absentia to four years in jail for abuse of office in buying a presidential jet. Bell&apos;s position on the ethics of which contracts to take is simple. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t do anything I would do a bad job on,&quot; he said. &quot;It is about the direction of travel. I don&apos;t choose to sit in judgment on whether they are going fast enough. If the direction of travel is right then I am perfectly happy to help them.&quot; Another big UK firm, Hill and Knowlton, has contracts with the Malaysian government&apos;s cyber security agency; the Singapore prime minister; city governments in Beijing, Shanghai and Chonqing; and Saudi Arabia&apos;s investment authority. Portland PR works for the Kremlin while Africa Practice, whose director, Marcus Courage, helped run Mwai Kibaki&apos;s presidential campaign in Kenya which was followed by a wave of violence, is working for the government in Gabon. A PR executive who has worked for governments in eastern Europe and Africa said working for foreign governments was sometimes an exercise in &quot;spinning them into legitimacy&quot;. &quot;You are often paid a lot to do something that you know from the outset you will not be able to achieve,&quot; he said on condition of anonymity. &quot;It is almost like a con. You can&apos;t spray perfume on a turd. It will smell nice for a while, but eventually it will smell like what it is.&quot; He said he was once offered, but turned down, a \u00a32m two-year contract by the Sudanese government to produce PR about Darfur. With such fees on offer competition is growing. &quot;Firms distinguish on whether they are being asked to do anything unethical rather than whether their client is acting in that way, rather as a lawyer would take on the case of a criminal,&quot; said a senior partner in a leading firm which contested the recent Kazakhstan contract. &quot;We are paid to put the best case on behalf of the client.&quot; Another PR firm with an office in London, Marston Nicholson, produces the Kazakhstan Live website, which has featured items on folk music and apple harvests. Morris International Associates, a London firm, manages UK media relations for the Saudi Arabian government, including arranging briefings with the London ambassador, Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf al-Saud, and press trips to the kingdom. In 2009 Saudi authorities executed, mainly by beheading, 102 men and women for offences ranging from drug possession and blasphemy to rape and murder, according to Amnesty International. In its latest annual report on the kingdom, the human rights organisation said: &quot;Torture and other ill-treatment continued to be widespread and committed with impunity. Commonly cited methods include severe beatings with sticks, electric shocks, suspension from the ceiling, punching, sleep deprivation and insults.&quot; Ann Morris, a director of the company, acknowledged the country had a mixed reputation and &quot;terrible things happen everywhere&quot;, but she insisted the Saudi government &quot;deserves to have the many, many positive things emphasised and pushed forward&quot;. She said: &quot;Our aim is very much to develop a better understanding,&quot; she said. It is quite often lop-sided. It is quite difficult for some countries to swim above that and show the good things they are doing. Nobody is suggesting any country is perfect but we are trying to get a balance.&quot; Her firm has arranged meetings with Saudi officials for the Guardian and other newspapers. PR consultants who profess to maintaining high ethical standards said they would not take contracts if they believed their clients&apos; values would reflect badly on them. &quot;You need to see the whites of their eyes and if you think they want you to spin and promote a picture of their regime which is untrue, it is an unacceptable contract,&quot; said Simon Cohen, managing director of Global Tolerance, an agency which has worked for the Dalai Lama, the Wallace &amp; Gromit&apos;s Children&apos;s Foundation and the Green Party. &quot;PR and communication agencies have to ask if the people they are working with are aligned with their values.&quot; Beneath the PR fa\u00e7ade Rwanda The PR says: &quot;The Rwandan government has gained significant international support in the past few years precisely because of the stability and reconciliation it has brought to the country.&quot; - An article written by James Musoni, minister of local government in conjunction with Racepoint, a London public relations firm, June 2010 A human rights NGO says: &quot;It uses the constitution opportunistically as a fa\u00e7ade, which hides the exclusionary and repressive nature of the regime; relies on power structures that sometimes run parallel to, and sometimes cross-cuts, the formal government; and in which the army plays a central role.&quot; - Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative report August 2009. Sri Lanka The PR says: &quot;We are ready to engage positively with anyone and everyone around the world who wishes to help us achieve our dream of a united and prosperous land and enable Sri Lanka to take its rightful place in the world as an island of unsurpassed beauty, enterprise and now peace.&quot; - Sri Lankan president Rajapaksa in an article pitched to the Guardian by Bell Pottinger, a PR group, in December 2009. Amnesty says: &quot;At the end of the war, atrocities against civilians and enemy combatants appeared to be fuelled by a sense that there would be no real international consequences for violating the law.&quot; - Madhu Malhotra, Amnesty International&apos;s deputy director for the Asia-Pacific region in March 2010 Kazakhstan The PR says &quot;Political stability, religious tolerance and a unique location at the crossroads of China, Russia and Europe gives Kazakhstan a stabilising role for the whole region \u2013 as well as making it the perfect host for the Congress of World Religions.&quot; Kazakhstan Live \u2013 website created for the Kazakhstan foreign ministry by Marston-Nicholson. The UN says &quot;I conclude that the use of torture and ill-treatment certainly goes beyond isolated instances. I have received many credible allegations of beatings with hands and fists, plastic bottles filled with sand, police truncheons; of kicking, asphyxiation through plastic bags and gas masks used to obtain confessions from suspects.&quot; Manfred Nowak, the Special Rapporteur of the UN Human Rights Council on torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment following a visit to Kazakhstan in May 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/06/booker-prize-lisa-moore", "sentences": ["The sharpener vibrates the counter beneath her fingers; John had phoned last night from the Singapore airport.", "Johnny called last night to say the sun was rising over Singapore.", "He was somewhere in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-06T08:53:48Z", "title": "Extract: February by Lisa Moore", "tags": ["Booker prize", "Lisa Moore", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "Awards and prizes", "Booker prize 2010"], "article": "Sunrise or Sunset, November 2008 Helen watches as the man touches the skate blade to the sharpener. There is a stainless steel cone to catch the spray of orange sparks that fly up. A deep grinding noise grows shrill and she thinks: Johnny is coming home. The sharpener vibrates the counter beneath her fingers; John had phoned last night from the Singapore airport. The roar of a plane landing in the background. She&apos;d sat up on one elbow, grabbed the receiver. Her grandson Timmy stands before the bubblegum dispenser, transfixed. There is a cardboard sign written in pen promising a free skate sharpening if you get a black jaw-breaker. I&apos;ve got a quarter in here somewhere, Helen says. Unzip-ping the beaded coin purse. She is the mother of one son and three girls and there are two grandchildren. My daughters complied, she thinks, digging for the quarter. She thinks of a slap, stinging and loud; she slapped Cathy&apos;s cheek once, the white print of her hand flooding red \u2014 this was years ago, a lifetime ago. Helen demanded of the girls that they give in, do what she said; but Johnny had been ungovernable. A boy just like Cal, is what she thought when she discovered she was pregnant with Johnny. The nurse didn&apos;t tell her the sex of the fetus that first time but she&apos;d known it was a boy. The ultrasound was at five in the morning and she rode her bike. Lime Street covered in an early October frost. There were still stars at that hour. Her hands cold on the handlebars. Having to walk the bike up Carter&apos;s Hill. How desperately her son had wanted everything when he was a kid. He had wanted that puppy he&apos;d found behind the supermarket sitting on a scrap of cardboard. She had said about the cost and fleas and the exercise a dog needs. But Johnny wanted the dog. The grinding wheel revs and squeals when the blade touches it, and Helen pulls out a handful of change and lets Timmy take a quarter. His mother will be furious. Timmy doesn&apos;t eat his vegetables, lives on macaroni and cheese. They have rules; Helen&apos;s daughters all have bitter rules. The fate of the world can hang on a jawbreaker. If you say no, you mean it. All profits, Helen reads, go to the Canadian Mental Health Association. She watches the boy slide the quarter into the notch and turn the stiff handle and the jawbreakers slump against each other behind the glass. Timmy lifts the little gate with his finger. Black. A black jawbreaker rolls out into his hand. He turns to show it to Helen. His pale freckled skin, lit up. The blue vein in his temple. Orange hair. The spit of his mother. The very spit out of her mouth. It is joy, the colourless eyelashes, green eyes flecked with hazel. The sharpener on the second skate blade. The smell of burning metal. And the fan of orange sparks. Timmy holds up the black jawbreaker and the man behind the sharpener stops the machine and lifts his goggles and lets them rest on his forehead. A free one, he says. He frowns, running a thumb down the blade. Johnny called last night to say the sun was rising over Singapore. Rising or setting, he did not know. I don&apos;t know what day it is, he said. He was coming from Tasmania and he&apos;d slept on the plane, lost track of time. His cellphone kept cutting out, or there was a zooming in and out of his voice. He&apos;d woken her up. A telephone at night scares the hell out of her. It might be Monday, he said. Or it might be Sunday. A big red ball hanging over the palm trees at the edge of a landing strip. Have you ever tried to figure out the difference between what you are, he said, and what you have to become? He said it softly and Helen sat up straighter. Sometimes his voice was perfectly clear. Johnny was capable of grandiose philosophizing while encountering a sunset; that was all. Maybe there was nothing wrong, she&apos;d thought. He was thirty-five. He was somewhere in Singapore. She thought of him: a day at the beach when he was seven years old, his tanned chest, his shins caked with sand. Some bigger boys had been whipping him with strips of seaweed, forcing him farther out into the waves. She&apos;d looked up from her book. Helen had been lost in a novel one minute, and the next she was knee deep in the water, striding, screaming her lungs out. The boys couldn&apos;t hear her because of the wind. Bullies, she screamed. You big bullies. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Then she was upon them and they froze. He started it, Missus. Look at the size of you. Just look. Pick on someone your own size. And the boys took off, plowing through the waves, glancing back, half saucy but scared. Where had the girls been on that day? Cal must have given her a break. A day at the beach long ago, three decades or more, and now here was the dresser, her perfume bottle pierced by a street light, the brown liquid full of a still fire, the fringe of the rug, her housecoat on a hook; Johnny was a grown man. She was clutching the receiver. She was fifty-five; no, fifty-six. What you have to become, she&apos;d said. Johnny was the kind of guy who phoned his mother infrequently, but when he did he was by turns pithy and incoherent and, inevitably, he had a bad connection. Or else something was wrong. He wanted to share the sunset with her; that was all, she&apos;d thought. The sun was going down. Or the sun was coming up. But no, it was more than a sunset. This time he had something to say."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/aug/05/1", "sentences": ["Photograph: David Moir/REUTERS    \u2022 Alan Travis reckons that it is  time to review the surveillance tribunal after it rules that Poole council&apos;s spying was unlawful\u2022 Siobh\u00e1n McCarthy argues that we need more nuanced debate on Kenya&apos;s proposed constitution\u2022 James Gomez: Singapore&apos;s reputation on the line as British author Alan Shadrake fights on What you said: best comments from our readers     Comment icon: News Photograph: guardian.co.uk    tomwatsonwestbrommp on recent strong-minded judgments in contrast with the government&apos;s shallow pledges on legal aid  MPs are over-worked generalists."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-06T10:20:11Z", "title": "The Bundle", "tags": ["Law"], "article": "To dispel any wrong impression that readers may have gained from the media frenzy over the 90 minute testimony from a certain supermodel in the Hague, there was some other law news this week.

I want to sell out arenas and sell millions of records.&quot; The cover of her new album, Teenage Dream, features the singer semi-naked draped on a bed of pink tufty clouds. Perry had each cover individually spritzed to smell like candyfloss. &quot;It actually smells a bit like My Little Pony,&quot; she says, a frown threatening to form. &quot;You know, the toys?&quot; The frown disappears. &quot;So it smells of your childhood, which is always endearing.&quot; Perry is plenty endearing herself \u2013 unguarded, unpretentious, flirtatious in a slightly camp, Carry On kind of way. She swears like a sailor, rattling off the first thing that pops into her head, although her loose tongue has landed her in trouble in the past. When she described herself as a &quot;fatter version of Amy Winehouse and a thinner version of Lily Allen&quot;, Allen came out blasting, &quot;It&apos;s like, you&apos;re not English and you don&apos;t write your own songs, shut up!&quot; In fact, she writes her own lyrics; a producer helps flesh them out into songs. Teenage Dream features the already released single California Gurls, whose Velcro hook has probably already attached itself to the inside of your cranium, and a handful of love songs \u2013 Hummingbird Heartbeat, Not Like The Movies \u2013 inspired by Brand. &quot;One of the things that attracted me to him is his brain,&quot; Perry says. &quot;He&apos;s one of the smartest men I&apos;ve met. I feel smarter just standing next to him.&quot; At the MTV music awards, she engineered an introduction by throwing a bottle of water at his head. He tried to get her into bed; she insisted on dinner, and a few weeks later they were on holiday together in Thailand. There&apos;s been a\u00a0rash of speculation about how she &quot;tamed&quot; the self-proclaimed &quot;S&amp;M Willy Wonka&quot;, although such talk misses the fact that Brand is the reformed hellraiser, 25-year-old Perry the pin-up for &quot;gin-n-juice&quot; hedonism. You wonder how that combination is going to work. &quot;He knows that I&apos;m young and have friends and a social life, and he was attracted to me. Not, &apos;Oh let&apos;s find a version of myself in a female.&apos; Every once in a while I need to remind him of that and he listens. It&apos;s all about communication. It&apos;s not about taming, because that won&apos;t last. Everyone gets saggy tits. Not everything stays perfect. We all start to slow down. I think he was ready for change. I mean, you just don&apos;t have the stamina to be in bed with 80 different women a week when you&apos;re 35 and trying to do good work.&quot; They met while she was recording her album \u2013 exactly halfway through the writing of the title track, which means the intriguingly personal verse-lyrics (&quot;You think I&apos;m pretty without my make-up on&quot;) were written pre-Brand and the anonymous chorus (&quot;You make me feel like a\u00a0teenage dream&quot;) post-Brand. &quot;It&apos;s about that feeling that I think so many people relate to,&quot; Perry says, &quot;when they get to their 20s and 30s and remember being a teenager and putting all or nothing into a relationship, and usually getting hurt, but it was such an amazing feeling \u2013 so pure and lovely and raw.&quot; This unarguable truth \u2013 that there is something pure and lovely and raw about teenage emotions \u2013 is the driving force behind the Perry phenomenon; a success story that seems custom-made to make the heads of NME readers explode like melons. For all the retro stylings, her lyrics are cut with just enough Jagged Little Pill realism to satisfy tween fans that they&apos;re not just being fobbed off with fluff (&quot;There&apos;s a\u00a0stranger in my bed/And a pounding in my head&quot; she sings on Last Friday Night, a rousing anthem to binge-drinking). Beneath the puppies-and-peppermint cuteness lies an unsentimental take on the industry that sustains her. &quot;You have to bust your ass at this,&quot; she says, &quot;which is why you don&apos;t find me getting shitfaced in bars that much. It&apos;s so intense, it&apos;s like you catch a rocket and you&apos;re hanging on for dear life and you&apos;re like, &apos;Gooooooo!&apos; The second record I&apos;m more buckled in because, God, how many times do you see people slump on their sophomore record? Nine out of 10. But I&apos;m still working, like, 13-hour days, five, six days a week and singing on top of it. And knowing that there&apos;s someone right behind me, ready to go, ready to push me down the stairs, just like in Showgirls.&quot; The middle child of three, her parents were both born-again pentecostal ministers in southern California \u2013 Christian camp, Christian friends, no MTV, no radio \u2013 but press stories of a parental rift over Perry&apos;s lyrics ignore the &quot;born again&quot; bit. Before they came to their faith, her parents were 60s scenesters, her mother briefly dating Jimi Hendrix. Her father took acid and hung out with Timothy Leary. &quot;They&apos;re kooky little critters,&quot; she says. &quot;Of course they&apos;ll hear a song like Peacock, and there&apos;s a little moan that comes out of them: &apos;Ooooh, Katy.&apos; Or when they see a magazine cover, they&apos;re like, &apos;Put some clothes on.&apos; But we get along fabulously. There&apos;s no disowning. They know that the best thing they can do is support and love me and pray for me and not judge me. That&apos;s why you don&apos;t see me having a breakdown. That&apos;s why I&apos;m not hooked on drugs.&quot; At 17, she started travelling back and forth to Nashville to record an album of Christian rock, but when her record company went bankrupt, she moved to Los Angeles to start again, this time getting as far as an actual record, with actual sleeve notes, before that deal, too, collapsed. Broke, she got a job in A&amp;R at a small record label just outside LA. &quot;That was the most depressing moment of my hustle,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I was sitting there in a cubicle, with 25 other trying-to-make-it-some-failed-artists in a box listening to the worst music you&apos;ve ever heard in your entire life. Having no money, writing bad cheques, renting a car after two cars had been repossessed, trying to give people constructive criticism and hope, when really I wanted to jump out of the building or cut my ears off and say, &apos;I\u00a0can&apos;t help you! I can&apos;t catch a break. What am I\u00a0gonna say to you? And you sing off tune.&apos; &quot; By the time Capitol records fished out an old demo of hers from the slushpile, she was ready. &quot;I was like, someone throw the ball. I will hit that home run. I knew I Kissed A Girl was going to have an impact. It was hooky for me. I\u00a0couldn&apos;t stop singing it.&quot; Her innuendo-laden floor filler, released in 2008, topped the charts in 30 countries; while the album from which it was released, One Of The Boys, went platinum, selling more than 7m copies. Promoting the follow-up, Perry will soon leave for Malaysia, Singapore, then Australia, Japan. &quot;My air miles are impeccable,&quot; she says. The biggest challenge faced by her and Brand, these days, is scheduling. Though she was miffed to find her fiance beating her to the cover of Rolling Stone. &quot;I was like, &apos;You bitch! I was working in America first!&apos;&quot; she says, faux outraged. &quot;For his birthday invitation, I did an e-vite superimposing my face\u00a0on his Rolling Stone cover. &apos;Come to my birthday party.&apos;&quot; What do her parents make of him? &quot;My mother&apos;s in love with him. And my father, I think he sees a lot of himself in him.&quot; Perry and Brand have just bought a $3m home in LA and are looking for a place in New York. When I ask whether this onrush of domesticity is likely to have any influence on her music, she groans. &quot;Everyone asks me that. You look at someone like Beyonc\u00e9 singing Single Ladies, when we all know she&apos;s married. Some of it is just for entertainment.&quot; But you can&apos;t stay singing about being a teenager for ever. &quot;Oh, I will always be honest with my music,&quot; she says. &quot;The records are black boxes for me. Like if you want to know who I am, my views, my perspective, things I love, things I hate, my convictions, my anthems. I&apos;ve never let people&apos;s opinions affect the way I write.&quot; Worrying about the future is not really Perry&apos;s style. She&apos;s all about the now, and right now, she and her music are, as the lyric to California Gurls has it, &quot;undeniable&quot;. \u2022 Teenage Dream is out on 30 August"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/08/red-plenty-francis-spufford", "sentences": ["It&apos;s become commonplace to hear Britons returning from Moscow, Dubai or Singapore ridiculing democracy as so much &quot;faffing about&quot;, getting in the way of business."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-07T23:05:14Z", "title": "Red Plenty by Francis Spufford | Book review", "tags": ["Fiction", "Communism", "Russia", "Books", "Culture", "Europe"], "article": "One day in 1992, just after the USSR collapsed, I met a mid-ranking officer from the old Soviet interior ministry on a train heading to southern Ukraine. He&apos;d lived in the Soviet system since he was born half a century earlier and knew no other way of doing things. We got talking. He was astounded when I told him that in Britain we had no ID cards or system of residence permits to keep track of who lived where. I saw a look of panicked incomprehension forming on his face and waited for a question such as, &quot;How do you keep tabs on people, then?&quot; What he actually asked was, &quot;How do you know how much bread to make?&quot; I&apos;d known the Soviet Union had a planned economy, where bureaucrats, rather than the market, decided what goods and services would be supplied to whom and how much they&apos;d cost. But that system died at the end of 1991, replacing a world of shortages (full pockets, empty shops) with a world of poverty and hyperinflation (empty pockets, full shops) overnight, and it was only in occasional startling remarks like the officer&apos;s that I glimpsed the deep otherness of the communist system from that with which I\u00a0grew up. Insofar as there&apos;s a general, popular sense of the past, the first thing we forget is the way people used to do business. When we think of the Soviet Union we think of Stalin, the labour camps, parades on Red Square and propaganda posters, not men in suits and ties in a Moscow skyscraper working out how many summer dresses the ladies of Vladivostok should be allowed to buy. Daily life in the Soviet Russia, Ukraine or central Asia is generally considered to be contained in one word: queues. In this strange, risky and compelling book, effectively a collection of short stories with the Soviet economy of the 1950s and 60s as its theme, Francis Spufford points out that westerners didn&apos;t always see it that way. In the 1950s, the Soviet Union was growing faster than any other country except Japan. &quot;For a while, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, people in the west felt the same mesmerised disquiet over Soviet growth that they were going to feel for Japanese growth in the 1970s and 1980s, and for Chinese and Indian growth from the 1990s on,&quot; writes Spufford. &quot;Beneath several layers of varnish, the phenomenon was real.&quot; Not everyone in the non-communist world felt disquiet, of course \u2013 socialists in the west took inspiration from what seemed to be a working alternative to capitalism. In the middle years of the cold war, the Khrushchev-Eisenhower-Kennedy era, competition on the economic front between the superpowers was as intense as on the military. As Spufford puts it in the voice of Khrushchev, one of his characters, it was &quot;a race to see who could do the best job at supplying the ordinary fellow on the beach with his cold\u00a0drink&quot;. Disappointingly for romantic socialists, the book highlights the materialism of Khrushchev&apos;s project and, indeed, the Russian admiration for American consumerism that predated his rule. &quot;The Americans got it,&quot; muses Spufford&apos;s Khrushchev on his first visit to the States. &quot;They understood that if ordinary people were to live the way the kings and merchants of old had lived, what would be required was a new kind of luxury, an ordinary luxury built up from goods turned out by the million so that everybody could have one.&quot; Moscow failed; Moscow lost. For all the idealism, brilliance and ingenuity of the minds that tried to fashion a Marxist utopia on the ruins of post-second world war Russia and Ukraine, the greater part of Red Plenty is given over to why and how the Soviet communist project failed. There were plenty of Soviet economists in the 60s who wanted to bring computers into the system, who wanted to put prices on things that bore some relationship to the labour required to make them, who knew that rules like the tonne-kilometre target \u2013 whereby a factory that did its job by moving 100 tonnes of materials over 1,000 kilometres was thought more successful than a factory that achieved the same result by moving half the goods over half the distance \u2013 made no sense. But with the death of Stalin, the director class had lost the main incentive it had to be more efficient \u2013 fear. The replacement of Khrushchev by the Brezhnev clique in 1964, and the discovery over the next few years of vast reserves of oil in Siberia, made it easy for the people running the country&apos;s economy to brush the reformers aside. Even Karl Marx, I suspect, would have found the Soviet economy of the 1960s an inside-out sort of place. Each spring, factories would guess the quantities of goods and materials they were going to need the following year, and order them; only in summer would the state planning committee Gosplan tell them what they were supposed to produce, and how much. In a piquant series of linked short stories in the middle of the book, Spufford shows how it worked in practice. We see Maksim Mokhov, a kindly bureaucrat in Gosplan, helping out a viscose factory that has had one of its machines destroyed in an accident by commanding a plant in the Urals to supply them with an updated version of the machine. We move to the bosses of the viscose factory, who secretly got their engineer to arrange the accident, as the original machine couldn&apos;t make enough\u00a0viscose to fulfil the plan they&apos;d been given. Next, we cut to Chekuskin, the shady middleman working outside official channels to help desperate factory bosses deal directly with one another. Chekuskin is called in because the Urals plant is refusing to give the viscose factory the updated machine. It&apos;s the wrong price, apparently \u2013 it&apos;s not too expensive, it&apos;s too cheap. The reason it&apos;s too cheap is because it weighs less than the machine it replaces, and since it&apos;s a machine from the chemical industry, it&apos;s priced according to how much it weighs, as if it were an amount of coal. It should be pointed out that this isn&apos;t an actual, recorded event. Spufford&apos;s method is to create fictional characters and fabricate incidents closely based on real anecdotes and contemporary observations. His book comes without an index, but it does have 53 pages of notes explaining the convergence and divergence of fact and fiction. It&apos;s a method that would normally repel me, but the audacity of the subject and the superb craftsmanship of the writing won me over. This is not a dry book, even though at times the economic reasoning can be hard to follow. Spufford invests his characters with loves, joys, whimsy and weakness and puts them in believable worlds \u2013 sometimes eerily so, given that he doesn&apos;t speak Russian. He can get carried away with his own virtuosity \u2013 the detailed descriptions of how a computer works and how cancer begins are as superfluous as they are brilliant \u2013 but more often his stories cut richly, subtly to the point. The interlude where Chekuskin the middleman enters the parallel Soviet universe of life criminals, the Lawful Thieves, foreshadows the criminalisation of the Soviet economy, and a gruesome tale of childbirth, with pain forcing a woman to exploit her husband&apos;s party connections to get some painkillers, suggests the birth of corruption in a grimly literal way. Apparently Soviet obstetricians used to tell expectant mothers that labour pain was a myth invented by capitalist doctors. Red Plenty is not merely a series of quaint historical vignettes. By presenting a society in which business and finance were ordered so differently from our own, it provokes us into comparisons and connections; to consider, for instance, the extent to which ingenious software, marketing and the consolidation of big corporations has put us at the mercy of a kind of ad hoc capitalist\u00a0Gosplan. In the end, although there were moments in the 20th century when the Soviet Union ran the US and western Europe pretty close when it came to the war on want, it was never a contender in the war of people getting what they want. But the materialism of both sides, the idea that plenty is the ultimate goal of society, is a mean-minded sort of dream. Soviet planning of the kind Spufford writes about lives on now only in North Korea and Cuba. But in the contrast between the two kinds of capitalism today \u2013 authoritarian capitalism like modern China&apos;s versus democratic capitalism like America&apos;s \u2013 we see the same race to be the better provider of consumer plenty. It&apos;s become commonplace to hear Britons returning from Moscow, Dubai or Singapore ridiculing democracy as so much &quot;faffing about&quot;, getting in the way of business. I&apos;d like to think that Britain and America would prefer democracy even if we lost Khrushchev&apos;s race to get the best cold drink to the guy on the beach, not because we&apos;ve won so far. But I&apos;m not\u00a0sure."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/08/astana-kazakhstan-space-station-steppes", "sentences": ["It most resembles the controlled cleanliness of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-08T00:59:00Z", "title": "Astana, Kazakhstan: the space station in the steppes", "tags": ["Kazakhstan", "Design", "Architecture", "Norman Foster", "Art and design", "Culture", "South and Central Asia", "Cities"], "article": "&quot;Peas and beans! Peas and beans!&quot; The famous Japanese architect was in his office, high in a Tokyo tower, its walls crowded with framed honours and diplomas. Assistants of exceptional beauty shimmered in with tea, but what he wanted to talk about was pulses. Rising prosperity in China would lead to rising meat consumption, and in turn a global protein crisis. It was the greatest problem, he said, facing mankind today. The solution lay in Kazakhstan, the vast former Soviet republic, for whose president the architect, Kisho Kurokawa, was masterplanning a new capital. This country, to the south of Russia, stretches from the eastern edge of Europe almost to Mongolia. For Kurokawa it offered ample opportunity for growing peas and beans, and \u2013 in a symbolic way \u2013 his plan would help. It was based on the interweaving of city and nature, with swaths of green between the buildings. It represented an idea of interdependence of which pulse-growing on an immense scale would be the practical outcome. This meeting was in 2001, and Kurokawa died in 2007, but his city is now there, more or less following his plan. There are plenty of parks and trees. Called Astana, it is the world&apos;s latest example of a rare but persistent type, the capital from zero. It is in a line that includes St\u00a0Petersburg, Washington DC, Canberra, Ankara and Brasilia and like them it provokes a question: can a city, in all its teeming complexity, really be planned? Or does the attempt lead only to a synthetic simulacrum, a kind-of city that is not quite the real thing? To look at, Astana is so strange that it has one grasping for images. It&apos;s a space station, marooned in an ungraspable expanse of level steppe, its name (to English speakers) having the invented sound of a science fiction writer&apos;s creation. It&apos;s a city of fable or dream, as recounted by Marco Polo to Kublai Khan. Except it&apos;s not quite so magical: it&apos;s also like a battery-operated plastic toy, all whirring noises and flashing colours, of a kind sold by the city&apos;s street vendors. Astana&apos;s ornaments include a 62-metre-high silver pyramid, designed by British architects Foster + Partners, giant gold-green cones and a gold orb resting on a structure of erupting white steel. At night its buildings go purple, pink, green and yellow. Astana&apos;s latest, most technically ambitious addition is a 150-metre-high translucent tent, also by Lord Foster. Called Khan Shatyr, a single leaning mast props its roof, which offers shelter from a harsh climate to a shopping and entertainment complex underneath. It follows a familiar Foster strategy, to be seen in the Great Court of the British Museum, or his airports at Stansted, Hong Kong and Beijing, which is to create an impressively engineered roof \u2013 a thing to be looked at and admired but not inhabited \u2013 hovering over a lower, less ordered, zone where the activity of the buildings, in this case shops and theme-park rides, takes place. This strategy, derived from the geodesic domes which the visionary American designer Buckminster Fuller once proposed throwing over whole cities, makes for striking architecture but also for awkward clashes where the two zones meet. Top and bottom seem to be different worlds. Khan Shatyr opened last month with an extravagant celebration which coincided with the 70th birthday of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is the beginning and end of everything that happens in Astana. The building is there &quot;because the idea came from the president&quot;, says its German-born manager: that there were four other malls within a square kilometre &quot;didn&apos;t matter for him&quot;. The gold orb on the white steel tower, which signifies the egg laid annually on the tree of life by the mythical bird Samruk, was designed by Nazarbayev himself. When Nazarbayev commissioned Foster to design his Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, he told them he wanted it pyramid-shaped, which may be the first and only time a client has told the mighty Foster what a building should look like, and been obeyed. Such cities are often the work of a single strong man. There is a museum of the founder in Astana, as there are of Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in Ankara and President Kubitschek in Brasilia, pharaonic insurance against the afterlife that contains such things as Nazarbayev&apos;s grandfather&apos;s seal of office as a local judge. There is the president&apos;s palace, which stands on a long axis linking the two Foster works, the tent and the pyramid, and the golden orb. The palace is a version of the White House, improved by the addition of a blue dome. Also by its dominating location: the American original is placed off-centre from Washington&apos;s Mall, signifying a separation of powers that is not quite the Kazakh style. The common view of Nazarbayev, among those western politicians who have one, is that he is by some distance the best of the extremely bad bunch running the former Soviet republics of central Asia. Margaret Thatcher has written a foreword to Nazarbayev&apos;s book The Kazakhstan Way, praising him for throwing off &quot;the Soviet yolk [sic]&quot;. He established himself as a reformer in the 1980s, enough for Gorbachev to ask him, unsuccessfully, to be prime minister of the Soviet Union. The west was also extremely grateful to him for giving up his ballistic missiles when the collapse of the Soviet Union left him the master of the world&apos;s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal. Kazakhstan may rank 142nd in the world press freedom index, and 120th in the corruption perception index, and he may win elections and referendums with suspiciously high votes of 91% and 95%, but \u2013 goes the pro-Nazarbayev argument \u2013 nobody else could have stabilised his country&apos;s potentially explosive ethnic combinations, and ridden the violent post-Soviet economic storms. This argument is set out in Nazarbayev and the Making of Kazakhstan, an eloquent, if oily, book by the British former minister Jonathan Aitken. Among its gems is a description of the romance between the president and his future wife, which flourished after an accident at a steel works: &quot;While the flames of the blast furnace were damped down, the fires of love ignited.&quot; Aitken reports how his subject, as a young champion of steelworkers&apos; rights, was scathing about both grandiose building projects and the decision to locate a steel plant in a site with an appalling climate. Yet he chose to build Astana, which can fairly be called grandiose, in a place that had been notable previously for its Soviet penal colonies and where the temperature runs from -40C to 40C (-40 to 104F). His logic was that the previous capital, Almaty, was too close to China, too congested, and prone to earthquakes.One can guess that, as for other rulers, building a new capital gave Nazarbayev a place he could control, made on his own terms. In keeping with his status as a better-than-average dictator, this is done subtly: Astana is not littered with statues and images of its maker, and when his followers suggested that it should be named after him, he modestly demurred. (Although the somewhat neutral &quot;Astana&quot; \u2013 it means &quot;capital&quot; \u2013 might indicate that the space is being kept open for a renaming in the future.) Instead you hear, again and again, that things are the way they are &quot;because the president wants it&quot;, which is delivered as a sufficient and unarguable statement. The shopping centre manager says it, as does the waiter serving horse steak. President Medvedev of Russia said that Nazarbayev &quot;has given this city not only his work but also his soul&quot;. He wanted the city, and he specified its monuments in detail. He had his government officials, who initially left their families in more hospitable Almaty, shipped in. David Nelson, of Foster + Partners, describes long design meetings with the president: &quot;He had thought about the building. That&apos;s what&apos;s impressive.&quot; What he wanted he got, thanks partly to oil revenues from the distant Caspian Sea, which Nazarbayev claimed for Kazakhstan in a protracted haggle with Boris Yeltsin \u2013 closing the deal with the help of vodka and a map doodled on a napkin, which is now in the Museum of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Like Gulf cities, Astana floats on an exhalation of petrodollars. Like Gulf cities and new Chinese cities such as Shenzhen, Astana inspires wonder that it is there at all; but while having some buildings of eye-aching ugliness, it has a greater sense of order. At street level in Dubai all is congestion. Here it is trimmed hedges, well-behaved traffic, well-kept paving and a complete lack of litter, or of visible signs of prostitution, drug-taking or beggary. It most resembles the controlled cleanliness of Singapore. The world&apos;s most famous Kazakh is the fictional Borat, but people in Astana are nothing like him. Except, perhaps for a taxi driver who growled like a tomcat whenever he saw a woman. In general Astanans are placid and dignified. They gather in the hour or so around dusk, when the hammering heat of the day gives way to deliciously balmy air, and promenade in the city&apos;s grand avenue. Children career over the pavements in electric cars like unfenced dodgems, while everyone gasps obediently at the pre-programmed fountain displays. The avenue is decorated with topiary giraffes and elephants, and vast swirling carpets of brightly coloured bedding plants. There are artificial trees, made of steel rods, blossoming with pink or orange lights and the plastic roof of Khan Shatyr now joins the display, lit from within with a spectrum of disco colours. Sam Cooke&apos;s Wonderful World plays from the shrubberies. The place offers childish delights, laid on by the unseen hand of a benevolent daddy. There is not, yet, much more to Astana than this. It doesn&apos;t have bohemian quarters, or a rich nightlife, or hidden surprises. It feels sedated. The striking architecture is combined with a lack of excitement in the street life, as if the design of buildings were a cipher for risk and drama. These are very early days, of course, and over the decades Astana might mature into something different."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/10/google-street-view-seoul-police-raid", "sentences": ["Street View cars have been collecting Wi-Fi data in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Macau, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the US."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-10T13:41:03Z", "title": "Google's South Korean office raided", "tags": ["Google Street View", "Google", "Technology", "Internet", "Privacy", "South Korea", "World news"], "article": "Police in South Korea have raided Google&apos;s Seoul headquarters as part of an investigation into data collected by the company&apos;s Street View cars.

The search giant has admitted to accidentally intercepting fragments \u2013 amounting to 600MB \u2013 of personal data through Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries as it sought to map towns and cities.

A string of code in the production systems of Street View cars allowed Google to retrieve and store information about the networks&apos; location, names and Media Access Control (MAC) addresses on wireless networks that were not password protected.

The construction group revealed today that it had won a \u00a3460m contract to develop part of Heathrow airport, which is run by Spanish-owned group BAA, as it unveiled a 32% increase in first-half profit. The group also said its close relationship with the airport group would continue to generate business, and the increasingly foreign-owned UK energy sector is likely to prove another source of profits as power generators invest in new sites. Ian Tyler, Balfour Beatty&apos;s chief executive, said: &quot;Government spending cuts affect only about 20% of our business. It is an important part but the other 80% has got a lot more growth in it. Our relationship with BAA goes very deep. The fact that [a lot of the investment in the energy sector] will be foreign money is not particularly relevant. They are conduits for capital and skills, which will be essential for keeping the lights on in the UK.&quot; The company said it would deliver the second phase of a satellite building to support Heathrow airport&apos;s new Terminal 2, including a facility with 10 new aircraft gates, an underground link to the new Terminal 2 building and a large baggage facility. It also claims to be the largest supplier to National Grid. The company added that pre-tax profits had increased from \u00a3107m to \u00a3141m on revenues up 3% at \u00a35.2bn.

Asia has overtaken Europe as the world&apos;s biggest beer producer for the first time in 35 years, according to a study by the research arm of the Japanese brewing giant Kirin Holdings. Asia&apos;s comparatively quick rebound from the global economic crisis was matched last year by a 5.5% surge in beer production \u2013 to 58.6m kilolitres \u2013 from 2008, the Kirin Institute of Food and Lifestyle said. It was the first time that Asia had topped the global beer-production rankings since Kirin began surveying the industry in 1974. By contrast, Europe, which has struggled to emerge from the economic doldrums, saw beer output shrink 5.1% to 55.1m kilolitres in 2009. The Asian surge was led by Vietnam, where the domestic and international popularity of labels such as 333 \u2013 pronounced &quot;ba ba ba&quot; locally \u2013 leaped 24.3%, followed by India (12.3%) and China (7%). The growing international reputation of Vietnamese beers was reinforced by the selection of two of the country&apos;s labels, Hanoi Beer and Saigon Beer, as official beverages at last week&apos;s Berlin International Beer festival. Other labels from across Asia \u2013 from Singapore&apos;s Tiger Beer to Thailand&apos;s Singha \u2013 are now familiar sights on supermarket shelves outside the region. In Japan \u2013 where consumption is in long-term decline \u2013 beer shipments fell by 2.2% last year.

Barcelona&apos;s Terminal 2, completed in 1991, makes a virtue of this fact. It treats the airport as an unusual kind of city, with broad urbane avenues, highly polished purplish marble, big glass walls, dignified concrete and ample proportions. As a result it is much more relaxing than airports where you feel like a piece of baggage on its way to the carousel. Its architect, Ricardo Bofill, has recently also completed the rebuilt Terminal 1. Santos Dumont, Rio de Janeiro     Santos Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil Photograph: imagebroker/Alamy    Since the 1998 closure of Kai Tak, Hong Kong, with its thrilling descent past mountains and above apartment blocks, the approach to Santos Dumont Rio de Janeiro, is unrivalled as the best in the world. Planes wheel past the Sugarloaf mountain and down to a short waterside landing strip that requires special training for pilots. Then a stroll through the terminal takes you almost into the heart of a great city \u2013 which is air travel as it should be but almost never is. The airport, which now serves only domestic flights, is named after a great Brazilian aviator and dandy, and its original terminal is a refined work of 1930s modernism. Dulles Washington DC     Washington Dulles International Airport Photograph: Look Die Bildagentur Der Fotogra/Alamy    Before his death at the age of 51, Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen designed two celebrations of the jet age that reinvented the design of airports. One, the freeform TWA terminal at JFK, has been compromised by later additions, and is currently closed for refurbishment. The other is Washington Dulles, built in 1962, whose concrete roof, concave side down, hangs like a canvas between rows of angled pillars. It pioneered the idea of the sweeping roof as a metaphor for flight that has since become a well-worn theme of airport design, while its white, temple-like form also has some of the gravitas ofWashington&apos;s political monuments. Kansai Osaka     Kansai International Airport Japan Photograph: Amana Images inc./Alamy    After Norman Foster&apos;s Stansted of 1991 gave new impetus to Saarinen&apos;s big-roof concept, Renzo Piano&apos;s Kansai airport gave it its most impressive realisation in 1994. The roof rises and falls like a big wave, before neatly morphing into the long, tapering tubes that get you to the departure gates. Built on an artificial island, it looks beautiful from above, with all the complexity of an airport resolved into a single silvery object. It also deals with the inevitable retail better than most, by stowing it into deep canyons under the roof. The fact that the island used to sink at an alarming rate need not worry you too much. Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong     Chek Lap Kok International Airport Hong Kong Photograph: Michele Falzone/Alamy    Norman Foster&apos;s practice Foster and Partners has designed three impressive airports \u2013 Stansted, Chek Lap Kok in Hong Kong, and the enormous new Terminal 3 in Beijing. Of these Hong Kong gets my vote, Stansted being too compromised by later changes, while Beijing has slightly queasy-making Chinese references: it is allegedly dragon-like, and takes its red-gold colours from the Forbidden City. Hong Kong has a calm, rhythmic series of vaults with views through big glass walls to planes and mountains. As at Stansted and Beijing the design still gets embarrassed by the presence of shops, as if it were hoping they would go away. They won&apos;t, and airport architects should get used to it. Barajas, Madrid     Barajas International Airport, Madrid Photograph: Hemis/Alamy    Barajas, Madrid, by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, is yet another swoopy roof, but the simple idea of lining the ceiling with bamboo gives it a different feeling. It is soothing, rather than mechanical. Steel\u00a0struts are painted in all colours of the rainbow, grading from red to violet along the length of the building \u2013 a potentially cheesy idea that comes off. The joyfulness of Barajas compared with the clunkier Terminal 5 at Heathrow (which\u00a0was designed by the same architects) says much about the way this\u00a0country goes about getting big buildings built. Charles de Gaulle, Paris     Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Paris Photograph: Arcaid/Alamy    The original terminal building of Charles de Gaulle airport, completed in 1974, is the sort of futuristic fantasy for which the French have a special talent. A great concrete cylinder, its central void is criss-crossed by glass tubes, enclosing smooth-moving travelators as if in a Dalek city. On the outside, roads sweep up high on its flanks on vertiginous bridges. Designed by Paul Andreu, a French architect whose most famous work it is, it is playful and inspiring at the same time. Pleasure in its design is limited, however, by knowing about the fatal collapse of part of the later Terminal 2E, in 2004. Banjul Gambia     Banjul International Airport in The Gambia Photograph: Jack Sullivan/Alamy    Banjul Airport, Gambia, wins a prize for its\u00a0sheer indifference to all the usual clich\u00e9s and conventions of airport design. True, it goes like many others for something a bit wing-like, but the gratuitous projections at its sides are nothing like the swoops of Saarinen or Piano. It also goes, for no particular reason, for an arch in its centre with a bigger inverted arch above. A tongue-like canopy then sticks out from the mouth-like arch. The work of the Senegalese Pierre Goudiaby Atepa, its main design principle would appear to be to do stuff for the sheer hell of it. Changi, Singapore     Changi Airport, Singapore, Indonesia Photograph: imagebroker/Alamy    I don&apos;t know why so many airports are designed as metaphors for flight. Why do you need a metaphor when you&apos;ve got the real thing? Why not have a metaphor for the ground on which you&apos;re landing? In any case Singapore Changi Airport has always opted instead for symbols \u2013 not metaphors exactly \u2013 of opulence. They like fish tanks, fountains and verdant planting, and school parties are taken round in obedient crocodiles to admire it all. Since 2008 it has also included its Terminal 3, by American architects SOM. The roof is as flat as the many football pitches it equals in area, but is fitted with an intricate system of shutters and louvres that filter the light in intriguing pixellated patterns. It&apos;s a bit bling, but in a nice way. King Abdulaziz Jeddah     King Abdulaziz International, Jeddah Photograph: Alamy    SOM also designed Jeddah airport, which, as the place of arrival for Mecca, handles a huge increase in passenger numbers during the annual hajj. SOM created a 120-acre canopy composed as a series of tents. It could have been patronising, and I confess I haven&apos;t seen it in person, but the effect looks impressive in photographs. It was completed in 1981, and it&apos;s hard to imagine an American practice being given a commission of such sensitivity to Muslims now. Indeed, at the time of writing, someone has described SOM on Wikipedia as &quot;futki&quot;, which in the Bangladeshi dialect of Sylheti means &quot;arsehole&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/aug/16/bubbleideas-startup-social", "sentences": ["BubbleIdeas&apos; two co-founders want to formalise feedback for enterprise and government - and they are doing it with a bootstrapped business headquartered in Singapore, developed in India and hosted in the US."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-16T09:07:20Z", "title": "Elevator Pitch: BubbleIdeas and the feedback business", "tags": ["Technology startups", "Social networking", "e-Government", "E-commerce", "Media", "Digital media"], "article": "BubbleIdeas&apos; two co-founders want to formalise feedback for enterprise and government - and they are doing it with a bootstrapped business headquartered in Singapore, developed in India and hosted in the US.

It counts plus or minus votes (simple Digg-style stuff) like other tools but that&apos;s not all. BubbleIdeas is careful about hijacking of ideas with only negative votes. So we count number views, comments, duration, rate of change, and also semantic analysis of the text and comments to arrive at a score of popularity for a given conversation. Then we rank the thoughts of the crowd in the order of popularity. Companies can take decisions according to the popularity of ideas.&quot; \u2022 How do you make money?&quot;We earn in two ways.

In light of this debate, we have asked Comment is free readers for their take on retirement from a personal perspective as part of our People&apos;s panel series (you can read our previous readers&apos; panels here). Because of the personal nature of the debate, moderation will be strict. Judy Staton       I retired about three months ago at just over 60, having spent the last nine years of my working life as a self-employed researcher and consultant in the field of post-16 education and training. Initially I felt totally bereft, just as I had at the start of my first spell of maternity leave 30 years ago! The problem wasn&apos;t a lack of things to do, rather that I felt that in giving up work I&apos;d lost a key element of my identity and an essential component of my self-esteem. It has taken me these three months to accept that my most recent stint of self-employment (home-based, mostly phone contact and interviews followed by report-writing, nearly always acting as &quot;second fiddle&quot; to colleagues) had, in fact, done little to nurture my sense of self-worth. I now genuinely believe that life &quot;post-work&quot; offers many more opportunities \u2013 both to develop myself and to make a difference to the lives of others. I&apos;ve signed up to offer my services as a charity trustee, am taking an active role within my local U3A branch and am determined to achieve fluency in Spanish after years of dabbling. Perhaps most important of all, I&apos;ve started writing humorous and factual pieces for online sites. I am not sure I will earn much if any money, or get many readers, but I&apos;m really enjoying the experience! My recommendation: I support this government&apos;s move to abolish the mandatory age for retirement of 65 but think it needs to be coupled with measures to encourage employers to facilitate &quot;winding down&quot; through part-time working. It&apos;s fairly clear that most people will need to work on beyond this age for financial reasons, and having this option will be very important. In this respect, people like me, who can choose to retire at 60 let alone 65, have been extremely lucky. Paul Nethercott aka ManchePaul      The baby-boomer generation now reaching retirement is probably the first generation where both partners have worked for most of their lives, and certainly the first where many women have: 70% of women aged 50 to 59 are working. Because \u2013 so far \u2013 retirement ages for women are lower than for men (60 and 65 respectively) in the UK, and women are on average two years younger than their male partners, most couples are finding that one wants (or is able) to retire some years before the other. Retirement creates enough changes for couples. If one stops work and has to wait for the other to retire, any anticipated major changes such as relocation, downsizing, travel and adventure, or even extending general shared hobbies, are put on hold. The one not working may find this difficult, especially as each passing year increases the chance of ill health, which may prevent their plans altogether. I retired two years before my partner, but we were able to make enough adjustments. But we have friends where the age difference means that there are 10 or more years difference. In one case, the man is nearing 75 and has less energy than he used to, but his wife is not yet 60 and is still brimming with the stuff. Apart from the delays in beginning a proper retirement life together, the fact of one partner having lots of things to talk about at the end of each day, and the other much less, is a potentially dreadful issue, involving loss of self-esteem and a feeling of being found dull for the retired one \u2013 not to mention the possibility of mutual resentment. This has to be actively worked at to avoid. My recommendation: There is very little information available about the differential in retirement dates. Commercial organisations only talk about financial planning and pension investments. The government website Directgov doesn&apos;t mention it, although there is a lot of other useful information on non-financial issues of retirement. It seems to me that there is a clear need for people to think about this well before the first retirement is on the horizon, and for official sources of information and advice to reflect the potential problems. Madeley      I&apos;m 48 and had never really taken saving for my retirement seriously. I am a &quot;spending my money now&quot; sort of person, as you can&apos;t take it with you, but I also have a cautious side. But fatherhood has changed my outlook on life. I now want to make sure I have something to leave my children so they don&apos;t have to struggle to go to university or buy a house.  What worries me, though, is the mixed message we are getting from pension experts and ministers. They encourage us to save for our retirement, but if at the end of it there&apos;s another downturn, they might just shrug their shoulders and say: &quot;We don&apos;t know where your money&apos;s gone, and you can&apos;t have it back even if we could find it.&quot; I understand there are no guarantees in life (except death and taxes!), but would appreciate a bit more backup from both private companies and the government. My recommendation: More assurances to help us save for our pensions would help. Perhaps a scheme linked to your last salary, or telling companies they have to use their profit, when they make any, to pump cash back into people&apos;s pensions following a financial crash would be helpful. We already pay compulsory taxes and NI \u2013 perhaps we could divert 5% of our salaries, when we reach a certain level, into a savings plan, backed by the government who would guarantee our money back if the markets crashed. Martin Allinson aka GreatGrandDad      My feelings about retirement, as about work, are rooted in what I feel is my identity. I fancied being an explorer and was lucky to be able to explore many lifestyles in various parts of Canada and Britain while earning my living as an electronics engineer in industry and academia. A small early-retirement package in 1985, at 50, let me take teaching contracts in Brunei and in Singapore later on. A year of unemployment in Yorkshire in 1993/94 was pure hell. Following up newspaper ads is not the way to go about it, but I didn&apos;t know to &quot;get out and about&quot; doing odd bits of agency work, or volunteering. Hearing about a job that wasn&apos;t going to be advertised, I got it. But I packed it in when my wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer. In bereavement, I started proper retirement. Having a &quot;second youth&quot;, doing some of the things that hadn&apos;t come my way in my first one, and redoing some of the things that I had found enjoyable as a youngster. That has included a foray into politics as a parliamentary candidate (but not in any danger of being elected!), a return to trekking in the Himalayas and to the far east, and remarriage that has brought me to living in a rice-growing village in rural south-east Asia.  Needing to supplement my pension in order to get set up here, I used to fly over to Yorkshire for short periods and do whatever came my way. Mostly it was supply teaching in the rougher, tougher comprehensives (but you can stand a lot when you already have your flight booked back to civilisation \u2013 and anyway, what doesn&apos;t actually kill you strengthens you). Since I turned 70, though, I have been taking things easy \u2013 just pottering down to the local university and cogitating about &quot;well-being&quot; with the folk in social sciences (and frequenting CiF, of course). My recommendation: In my opinion, policy should be aimed primarily at encouraging those who have experience, understanding and knowledge to pass it on to the younger generations; &quot;use it or lose it&quot; cuts both ways.  My generation has been too indulgent of their children&apos;s and grandchildren&apos;s generations. For instance, we were brought up to save up 25% of the purchase price of our first house and could only get a mortgage of 250% of the husband&apos;s salary (with the wife&apos;s salary not being allowed to be considered). I once moaned to my father that this was too tough, but he told me sternly: &quot;Those rules protect my generation&apos;s savings against your generation&apos;s overconfidence \u2013 and, incidentally, protect your generation against mine&apos;s greed to get unearned income.&quot; If only my generation had passed the message on. The very word &quot;retirement&quot; is as out of date as the phrase &quot;job for life&quot;. Drop it. We are now entering the post-industrial era. Substitute &quot;the gardening years&quot; and start morphing those golf clubs into gardening associations. You&apos;ll be glad you did when facing the price of food within a very few years \u2026"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/aug/21/gap-year-planning-insurance-health", "sentences": ["STA Travel (0800 988 7470, statravel.co.uk/gap) says one of its most popular \u2013 and cheapest \u2013 tickets is UK to Bangkok, overland to Singapore, fly to Darwin, overland to Sydney, fly to Auckland in New Zealand, fly to San Francisco, overland to New York and back to the UK, which starts from \u00a3739.", "&quot;Singapore-Bangkok is one of the most popular pages on my website,&quot; Smith says."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-20T23:06:07Z", "title": "Ready, steady, go \u2013 planning your gap year", "tags": ["Gap year travel", "Backpacking holidays", "Travel", "Insurance", "Flights", "Rail travel", "Coach travel"], "article": "Transport Flights There are lots of round-the-world tickets, offering dozens of stop-offs. You can go from east to west, or vice versa, but it&apos;s not possible to back-track. Most tickets have mileage limitations, usually around 25,000-30,000 miles. Prices of a basic ticket are often not much more expensive than a standard return to Australia; generally, the more stopovers you wish to make the more expensive the ticket. Most tickets are valid for 12 months from your first date of travel, with set departure dates for each leg. You can however change your dates for a small fee (STA Travel charges a flat \u00a335 fee). A good place to start is Roundthe worldflights.com (020-7704 5700), which allows you to search and compare thousands of flights using an interactive map, with fares from about \u00a31,000 for six stops. STA Travel (0800 988 7470, statravel.co.uk/gap) says one of its most popular \u2013 and cheapest \u2013 tickets is UK to Bangkok, overland to Singapore, fly to Darwin, overland to Sydney, fly to Auckland in New Zealand, fly to San Francisco, overland to New York and back to the UK, which starts from \u00a3739. Also check out Trailfinders (020-7938 3939, trailfinders.com/around-the-world) and Flight Centre (0844 815 7100, flightcentre.co.uk). Trains An epic train route can make a trip, or is a real alternative to air travel. In Europe, it still makes sense to buy an InterRail pass (interrailnet.com), which allows you unlimited travel in your chosen countries on as many days as you choose to cover; for example, a one-month Global Pass, covering 30 European countries, costs from \u00a3329. For travel in the US, Amtrak (amtrak.com) is a useful booking website, covering more than 500 destinations in 46 states. A 15-day pass costs $389 (half price for children) The Trans-Siberian has long been a favourite for gappers. Start at London St Pancras, on the Eurostar, then connect with a Cologne-Moscow direct sleeper taking two nights (from \u00a3200 one-way for London-Moscow with sleeper). The journey proper from Moscow to Beijing costs $450 one-way with a berth. (You&apos;ll also need to buy visas for Belarus, Russia, China and possibly Mongolia.) &quot;The most popular option is to travel from Russia to China, using one of two weekly Moscow-Beijing trains, or stopping off to explore using other trains in Russia,&quot; says rail travel guru Mark Smith, founder of The Man in Seat Sixty-One (seat61.com), which gives information on rail travel all over the world. From there, some go on by ferry to Japan, or take the twice-weekly train from Beijing to Hanoi in Vietnam. &quot;Singapore-Bangkok is one of the most popular pages on my website,&quot; Smith says. &quot;The luxurious Eastern &amp; Oriental Express runs weekly and costs over \u00a3900 but gappers can do the same 1,249-mile, 48-hour journey on daily scheduled trains for a mere \u00a340, including sleepers. Stopovers at Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia and southern Thailand are easy \u2013 ferries also link Surat Thani on the rail route to the beach island of Koh Samui.&quot; Vietnam is becoming increasingly popular, adds Smith: &quot;You can take the train from Saigon to Nha Trang to Danang (for Hoi An), on via the scenic Hai Van Pass along the coast and over the mountains to Hue (Perfume River trips and visits to the demilitarised zone), then Hanoi. Saigon-Hanoi takes two nights.&quot; Bus and truck Many areas of the world now have hop-on, hop-off bus services for backpackers, which are easy to use, good for meeting other travellers and getting travel advice. The Feejee Experience (+679 672 5950, feejeeexperience.com) circuits Fiji&apos;s Viti Levu island, stopping off at small rural villages. Valid for up to 12 months, the Hula Loop pass (from \u00a3208) includes free activities such as sandboarding down the Sigatoka sand dunes, a trek through the Namosi rainforest, and rafting down the Wainibuka river. The bus also stops at schools and communities where travellers are welcome to volunteer with teaching or building projects. In South Africa, the Baz Bus runs in both directions from Johannesburg to Cape Town, via the Drakensburg mountains or Swaziland, and taking in the Garden Route and Sunshine Coast, linking more than 180 hostels in 40 towns and cities, often dropping you at the door. Travellers buy a time-based or distance-based ticket to their final destination, and can hop on and off as often as they like (from \u00a3110 for a seven-day ticket; +27 21 422 5202, bazbus.com). &quot;I&apos;ve met people of all nationalities and ages on these buses, not just gap-year students or party-seekers,&quot; said Katie Monk, a travel writer and regular user. STA Travel (as before) already has its own hop-on, hop-off bus routes operating in Australia, Canada and South America, and is planning to launch more routes this year in the Northern Pass in China, and also Laos. This will be Lao&apos;s first flexible bus network for travellers in the country and can be joined from Bangkok (but its purpose is not to explore Thailand). Both routes will be bookable from September; prices yet to be confirmed \u2013 keep an eye on the STA Travel website. If you don&apos;t want to struggle with all the getting on and off the bus, look at operators that arrange overland group adventures. Dragoman (01728 861133, dragoman.com) takes a group on their own special bus on journeys from six days to 47 weeks, right across the globe, providing activities and accommodation along the way. For example, departing 29 December, a 119-day trip from Cairo to Cape Town costs \u00a34,370, plus \u00a32,030 kitty. Intrepid (020-3147 7777, intrepidtravel.com) has similar trips, including a 79-day Quito to Rio de Janeiro trip leaving on 16 December for \u00a32,445 (plus \u00a31,480 kitty). Other operators include oasisoverland.co.uk, kumuka.com, africantrails.co.uk, onthegotours.com and oz-bus.com (overland from London all the way to Australia). Ridesharing is increasingly popular with backpackers. Websites such as liftsurfer.com in New Zealand, gumtree.com and rideshare.co.uk, connect lift seekers with lift providers, the idea being that they share the cost of petrol and perhaps the driving on long trips, and that it is a safer version of hitchhiking. Working abroad You can teach English in almost any country in the world, often earning decent money and sometimes with free accommodation, paid holiday and even money towards your flights thrown in too. Many schools insist on a formal qualification, and it will make it much easier to bag a job \u2013 see tefl.com for how to train. See jobsabroadbulletin.co.uk, seasonworkers.com and teachabroad.com, for vacancies in destinations from Brazil to Bulgaria. For ski season work, natives.co.uk has an extensive database of jobs in Europe, from chalet hosts to chefs. For the US, check coolworks.com; seasonal-jobs.com and seasonworkers.com, which list ski jobs available across the globe. Freeradicals.co.uk also recruits for ski companies in Europe and America. Keep an eye on tour operators&apos; websites, too: for example markwarner-recruitment.co.uk and firstchoice4jobs.co.uk. In Europe, Australia and New Zealand, picking fruit is an obvious way to earn extra cash. The work is flexible but can be physically demanding and you usually get paid according to the amount of fruit you pick. In most places you can earn about \u00a3150 a week and farms often let you camp on site or provide hostel accommodation. See fruitpicking.org and pickingjobs.com for listings. For details of the Australian working holiday visa, visit australia.com/workingholiday. If you&apos;re in Sydney and struggling to find work, check into Sydney Beachouse YHA (sydneybeachouse.com.au from AUS$27 per night). The hostel is so sure it can get guests work it is offering two nights&apos; accommodation free (out of five) if its employment service doesn&apos;t find you a job. Accommodation Increasingly a hit with backpackers, couchsurfing.com connects travellers with people willing to host them in their spare rooms or on the sofa for nothing \u2013 it has 600,000 members around the world. Similar services include globalfreeloaders.com, hospitalityclub.org and stay4free.com. Homestays are another great way for backpackers to immerse themselves in the local culture. While some remain simple room-and-a-meal experiences, others offer extras, such as cooking lessons or trekking tours, with your host acting as guide, interpreter and confidant. Mahindra Homestays (020-3140 8422, mahindrahomestays.com) has options throughout India; staying with a family in a posh residential neighbourhood of Jaipur in October costs \u00a335 a night, and your hosts will take you on sightseeing trips. Other companies that offer homestays are Tribes (01728 685 971, tribes.co.uk), Responsible Travel (01273 600030, responsibletravel.com), Intrepid (020-3147 7777, intrepidtravel.com) and South American Experience (0845 277 3366, southamerican experience.co.uk). Useful websites include homestayweb.com and villagehomestays.com. If you&apos;re willing to work for your board and keep, try WWOOF (wwoof.org.uk), which offers volunteering schemes on organic farms all over the world, and Workaway (workaway.info), which sets up all sorts of work placements, many with adventure operators, wilderness lodges and hotels (in amazing locations), where you spend a few hours a day doing basic tasks in return for food and board. Money Insurance You need insurance. Fixing a broken leg can cost a whopping \u00a322,000-plus in the US, for example. Shop around. A search on moneysupermarket.com for a backpacker and long-trip policy providing 12 months&apos; worldwide cover for an 18-year-old male (excluding winter sports cover), for example, turned up almost 40 policies, most offering broadly the same cover but varying in price from \u00a3110 to \u00a3435. Note that insurers may not provide cover if you plan to travel to a country if the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (fco.gov.uk) advises against it. Make sure you check what sports and hazardous activities are covered. To add cover for skydiving to a standard backpacker policy with Infinity Insurance Solutions (0845 658 0570, holidaysafe.co.uk) costs \u00a370.50, whereas with Insurewithease.com (0844 334 0155, insurewithease.com) it costs an additional \u00a3346.76. Other good providers include insurefortravel.co.uk and primaryinsurance.co.uk. Keep copies of your policy with you and if you receive treatment, keep receipts, a doctor&apos;s letter stating what was wrong and how you were treated. If you require treatment, try to get it pre-authorised by calling your insurer. Prepaid cards Prepaid currency cards help you keep track of your spending, and give better rates for foreign ATM withdrawals and currency exchange. You open an account, load money onto the card and use it like a debit card. According to moneysavingexpert.com, the FairFX prepaid card is the cheapest. There is a 1.5% transaction charge every time you make a payment or use an ATM, but that is usually lower than a debit card (most charge 2.75%). It charges no loading fee and can be topped up in euros, US dollars or sterling by debit card or bank transfer, online or by phone, and other people (eg, your parents) can top it up for you. You get FairFX&apos;s own exchange rate, which changes daily but generally beats the other prepaid cards. Apply for free via fairfx.com/opodo (usually \u00a39.95 via fairfx.com). According to Which?, the best cards are the Caxton FX (caxtonfxcard.com) and Travelex Cash Passport (cashpassport.com). The Caxton FX can be loaded with sterling, dollars or euros online or by phone; you get Caxton&apos;s exchange rate, which usually doesn&apos;t beat FairFX, and there&apos;s a 2.5% transaction fee. From Monday, if you apply before 30 September you get a second back-up card free (they usually cost \u00a35). If you&apos;re flying with Ryanair (ryanair.com) during your travels, use your prepaid card to avoid the hefty administration fee of \u00a35 per person, per leg you pay with conventional credit or debit cards. Health  For health advice on the countries you are visiting, see masta.org and fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk. Check well in advance to see what jabs you need and when you need to have them \u2013 you&apos;ll need to have some of them at least six weeks beforehand. Carry an official record of all your immunisations \u2013 some countries demand proof of them at border crossings. Nomad Travel Clinics (nomadtravel.co.uk) in London, Bristol, Manchester and Southampton offer a same-day travel vaccination service. You can get malaria tablets delivered from travelpharm.com. Safety The Foreign Office website (fco.gov.uk) gives updates on the safety and political events in every country, as well as general travel advice. For example, the FCO is advising against all travel to the Preah Vihear (Khaoi Pra Viharn in Thai) temple area in the D\u00e2ngr\u00eak mountains in Cambodia (near the Thai border, and popular with backpackers) because of violence in the region. Stay in touch If you&apos;re staying for a long time in one country, buy a local sim card and put it in your existing phone (get it &quot;unlocked&quot; before you go away). If you&apos;re travelling in several countries, a global sim card is better. According to moneysupermarket.com, one of the best value on the market is the Story Telecom TravelTalk roaming sim (storytelecom.com) \u2013 the sim costs \u00a330, but for that you get \u00a325 credit, 100 minutes of free incoming calls, and 100 outgoing calls cost \u00a316. The runner-up is the Simply travel sim (simply-fone.com), which costs from \u00a329.99, with \u00a315 starter credit, 100 minutes of free incoming calls, and the cost of 100 outgoing calls is \u00a315. But probably the best way to keep in touch is to use Skype over the internet for free or low-cost calls; many internet cafes now have Skype, or you can download it to your smartphone.

These days, that sort of thing has migrated away from central casting and set construction into the realm of computer graphics. If you see a medieval city on screen today, chances are it was knocked up on a computer, and even as you watch it, all this on screen opulence \u2013 based on binary units of data \u2013 will look as convincing a year from now as the back-projection in Hitchcock&apos;s Marnie. In happier, plumper bygone years, though, film-makers, especially Italian film-makers, had vaults full of money, and an insurmountable urge to expend it prodigiously. Take The Leopard, Luchino Visconti&apos;s adaptation of Giuseppe di Lampedusa&apos;s novel about the decline of the Sicilian nobility during the Risorgimento: The Thousand \u2013 Garibaldi&apos;s Red Shirts \u2013 look like The Ten Thousand, thanks to the massed slave-armies of the cinematic city-state of Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios, and it seems there are more figures crowding its lavish ballroom sequence than there were on the Normandy beaches in The Longest Day, released the year before. Money on screen is all well and good, but not if your recreated past is unpersuasive. Here, Visconti was doubly lucky; not only was he adapting a novel by Di Lampedusa, melancholic scion of a dwindled dynasty much like the one in The Leopard, but he himself \u2013 Luchino Visconti di Madrone, Count of Lonate Pozzolo \u2013 was himself such a figure, the playboy descendent of a powerful feudal family that had controlled Milan and Pisa before the Renaissance. Call it The Godfather Principle: hire a director who knows how the material tastes and smells and feels. It worked here. There are dozens of great historical novels that could use the same kind of cash infusion, plus a director who feels the material in his soul. But the studios lack any stomach for such grandiose outings, and I&apos;m certain that amnesiac US audiences have no thirst for them either (historical stories often fail \u2013 and fail historically). But me, I have an appetite for them, one that I suppose will never be sated. Most are wide-canvas stories of epic sweep but \u2013 hey! \u2013 why not? In my dreams, I see the British Empire coming to its knees in 1942 \u2013 the sky black with fighter planes, Japanese and British troops in their hundreds of thousands \u2013 in a magnificent adaptation of JG Farrell&apos;s The Singapore Grip. I also see the 2 million-strong exodus from Paris in 1940, so vividly rendered in Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky&apos;s Suite Francaise. I&apos;d be happy with just one Alan Furst adaptation, but even that might break the bank, or we&apos;d end up with something naff like The Good German. But in our aged of diminished expectations, I fear this kind of past is exactly that \u2013 passed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/aug/22/discover-virtual-worlds-revolution", "sentences": ["Vistors to Twinity can also enjoy virtual replicas of Berlin, Singapore and Miami."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-21T23:03:57Z", "title": "Where virtual worlds collide with real money", "tags": ["Virtual worlds", "Second Life", "Facebook", "Culture"], "article": "Recently a man bought a space station for $330,000, while last month Small Planet Foods, a subsidiary of General Foods, introduced a new brand of organic blueberries. What have these two products got in common? Neither actually exist. Well, not except as pixels in the virtual worlds where they are traded. Only the money is real. The space station was sold in the virtual world Entropia Universe, which has its own economy and currency. The buyer, who converted his $300,000 into 3.3m PED (Project Entropia dollars), is convinced that virtual shops on his virtual space station will produce virtual profits that can be converted back into real dollars. The blueberries represent a &quot;brand extension&quot; of a product that exists in the real world as US company General Foods aims to establish a presence in FarmVille, a game which exists as an application on Facebook and which at its peak has had nearly 80 million players. It is a classic example of a new genre. Farmers in FarmVille buy cartoon-like virtual farm animals, which have to be regularly fed, or crops that require fertiliser (virtual, of course) to help them grow, in order to be more successful than their friends. The real-time game has its own virtual currency that makes it easier for members to trade and for the game&apos;s makers to profit. Parent company Zynga has revenues of more than $600m a year which come mainly from FarmVille, despite competition from half a dozen other farm games on Facebook. Zynga is reckoned to be worth between $4bn and $5bn, based on the value of investment stakes that have been taken in it. To many, this seems crazy: why spend real money to buy a virtual currency to purchase food in order to stop a pig that doesn&apos;t exist from dying through lack of food? The easy answer is why not \u2013 if that&apos;s what you want to do. It is arguably a lot more &quot;real&quot; \u2013 whatever that means these days \u2013 than, say, sitting like a couch potato watching a soap on\u00a0television. This might still seem the stuff of fantasy but it&apos;s where real life seems to be heading: according to some analysts, we are in the midst of a virtual revolution that might one day be considered as important as the industrial revolution. Nic Mitham, founder of KZero, a Cambridge-based consultancy, says that there are 175 virtual worlds that are live or in live beta and that the number of registered users to them has risen from 880 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 1.1 billion today, a 25% increase within six months in the middle of a recession. The registered population of virtual worlds (even if this is not the same as active users) is greater than the populations of the US and Europe combined. Children are already, and perhaps inevitably, very familiar with all this. Habbo Hotel, a virtual world where teenagers trade goods and clothes, has increased the number of its registered residents to 175 million from 160 million a year ago and the London-based Moshi Monsters, a sub-teen world where kids meet and trade virtual goods with each other now has 20 million members compared with 12 million at the end of last year. Meanwhile, going in the opposite direction to General Foods, Moshi Monsters recently announced that the branded goods it has developed within its virtual world are to be sold in the real world, an example of something else we will have to get used to: a convergence of real and virtual\u00a0products. Little wonder that Will Walsh, CEO of Sharpcards, which creates virtual cards for people to send to each other from their mobiles, believes &quot;there will be a time in the future when kids spend more money in certain areas on virtual goods than they do in the real world.&quot; Second Life, where you can choose your own avatar, build your own house and buy and sell clothing, is still the best-known virtual world in this country. Launched in 2003, it claims up to 20 million registered users, although only about 1.4 million have been active in the past 60 days. For some it&apos;s been a rocky road: its San Diego-born creator Philip Rosedale stepped down as CEO in 2008, but is now back in charge following recent redundancies at developers Linden Lab. The latest published figures claim that virtual transactions (sales of land, clothes and artefacts) in Second Life came to $500m last year and that the volume of user-to-user transactions (selling each other clothes, furniture and land) rose between April and May this year from $49.9m to $52.6m. However, it would be surprising if this growth were maintained in view of Second Life&apos;s managerial problems and a sharp decline in the value of land within the virtual world. Casual visitors are arriving in fewer numbers and long-term residents seem increasingly to keep themselves to themselves \u2013 focusing on niche educational projects, virtual business meetings, sex or art. I joined Second Life five years ago and, with the help of a neighbour there, set up an art gallery. To begin with, I displayed other people&apos;s artworks before \u2013 after I realised that the game&apos;s tools enable anyone to transform creative ideas into (virtual) paintings or sculptures without formal training \u2013 showing off works of my own. My neighbour Juanita Deharo (her SL identity \u2013 in real life she is Judy Barrass and lives in Australia) now produces artworks that bridge the real and virtual worlds. But citing falling sales of her work because of problems there, she has thought about leaving Second Life. &quot;There are signs the community is on the move into other virtual worlds,&quot; she says. Other virtual worlds? Competing with Second Life now are several similar online communities, including OpenLife, Blue Mars and Inworldz. The former bills itself an an open-source alternative grid for Second Life, set up in Australia in 2007, &quot;to create a user content created virtual world orientated towards users, affordable ownership and community&quot;. Blue Mars is more restrictive than Second Life in terms of allowing its users to make their own content, but this 3D virtual world platform (developed in Hawaii by a company called Avatar Reality) has let more than 200 developers \u2013 mostly individuals or indie game designers \u2013 loose on creating cities, games and 3D environments on a terraformed version of Mars. Opened to the public in September 2009, and still in beta testing, it promises users better graphics and a more streamlined experience as a result. Blue Mars further differs from Second Life in that avatars cannot be fully customised and the emphasis is on shopping and gaming rather than social interaction. Nonetheless, successful (virtual) fashion designer Estelle Parnall is taking her business away from Second Life into Blue Mars. &quot;Everything will be better, once the content gets created,&quot; she says. &quot;The graphics, and in particular avatar appearance and clothing, are of a much higher standard than could be reproduced in SL and in virtual platforms relying on social engagement, this is of paramount importance.&quot; For Juanita Deharo, &quot;what keeps me in Second Life is the international community of artists, audience and curators, and these new grids can&apos;t match the diversity, stability, performance and security of SL at this stage.&quot; She acknowledges none the less that &quot;the scene is changing rapidly&quot;. The growth in virtual worlds for children is also continuing. Last month, for instance, saw the launch of Innerstar University, created by a US toy company, in which pre-teens can create doll avatars to navigate the campus of a virtual university, earning stars by competing cheerleading or horseriding games that can then be redeemed for pets or a haircut. Closed virtual worlds dedicated to business or education are also flourishing. Based in Florida and Boston, ReactionGrid was founded by three Second Life programmers in January 2009. They build bespoke virtual worlds for business clients (including Microsoft and a number of universities) \u2013 usually as a &quot;fun&quot; way of facilitating business tutorials, such as an interactive arcade version of a PowerPoint-like presentation. Worlds created include classrooms, campuses, and bar lounges. Side by side with the trend to build escapist worlds such as these is a dash to construct 3D reproductions of actual places in the real world in the hope of attracting people to buy goods and entertain themselves without an irksome journey to town. There is a virtual London in Second Life, with a 40,000-strong community, which according to its founder Debs Regent (or Debs Butler, as she is known offline) made a small profit last month, mainly from renting out shops and clubs. But at least five virtual versions of the capital have been built or are in the throes of construction by companies such as Twinity, NearGlobal and Microsoft, as well as by University College, London. Vistors to Twinity can also enjoy virtual replicas of Berlin, Singapore and Miami. Earlier this month, the company hosted a virtual barbecue in (its recreation of) South Beach, Miami, while in a game of one-upmanship with the mayor of London, the company&apos;s vehicle engineers have just built a (virtual) motorcycle that lets visitors tour the cities (without ever being required to wear a helmet). For sheer ambition all these projects are dwarfed by Project X, the brainchild of Mike Fotoohi from Egham, Surrey, who intends to reproduce the entire planet as a virtual world in which members will be able to build replicas of their homes on the same street as in real life. Project X is still in closed beta and at the moment Fotoohi and his team have only finished building central New York and a few other places, but after merging the open source Openstreetmap \u2013 a free and open source editable map of the world \u2013 with publicly available satellite image mapping from the US government to produce a 3D skeleton of practically every road on the planet, users will be invited to take over the planet. Fotoohi and his colleagues believe that virtual worlds \u2013 in which social media will integrate with a three dimensional web \u2013 have a great future. &quot;We have only scratched the surface,&quot; he says. &quot;As bandwidth increases and technologies like ray tracing [simulating 3D effects] and video delivery become more realistic thanks to increasing processing power and faster connections then we will have worlds that will look very real in the future. &quot;Project X is the initial phase of what I believe will be the next generation of how people will use the internet.&quot; One feature being developed using mobile technology aims to synch the virtual and the real worlds \u2013 so that your avatar in a virtual world will follow you in real life wherever you go. &quot;Shopkeepers who advertise their products in our virtual world can actually see customers attracted to their store as a result of that advert,&quot; says Fotoohi. &quot;This is something that has never been done before and for the first time you can measure accurately the pounds and dollars that you spend. The person who uses this system will also get a revenue share, which is great for the consumer and advertiser.&quot; The early virtual worlds, most of which have been grossly underperforming for their investors, according to Nic Mitham at KZero, found it difficult to establish their virtual brands in real life. Mitham now sees two trends. First, virtual worlds are changing from levying monthly subscriptions to charging small amounts for virtual goods, a practice made popular by FarmVille. The second driver, he says, is brands creating their own virtual worlds to sell their products. Virtual goods that carry real-life brands, Mitham says, have 10 times the buying power of virtual brands. How big is the virtual revolution? Factor in games like FarmVille, massively multiplayer online games such as Entropia Universe and World of Warcraft and other virtual services and it is a case of pick your own number. Some unofficial estimates claim that virtual products are worth $1bn in the US and $5bn in Asia. This is a woeful underestimate since one part of Facebook, FarmVille, may soon be worth a billion and it is already capitalised at more than $4bn. In the future, too, the mobile phone, is likely to be a major incubator of virtual products. FarmVille may one day be seen as a milestone in accustomising non-geeks to the idea of online currencies and virtual products. Virtual products have a particular attraction to businesses because beyond the cost infrastructure already in place, overheads are few and manufacturing costs zero. Carbon footprints become less of a concern, too. And in a recession, virtual worlds offer their colonists the chance of a cheap escape from everyday\u00a0reality."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/22/john-burton-obituary", "sentences": ["Burton&apos;s first exercise, in 1965, brought leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore together while there was still armed fighting between the first two on Borneo, where they both held territory."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-22T17:26:09Z", "title": "John Burton obituary", "tags": ["Australia news", "World news", "Foreign policy", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "In the 1960s, the Australian international affairs expert John Burton, who has died aged 95, mounted a radical challenge to the conventional wisdom of power politics and deterrence. A diplomat turned academic, he was concerned not only with the causes of conflict, but also with the conditions necessary for a lasting peace. He rejected a conventional historical approach, based on studying archives dealing with past crises. From his own practical experience, he felt that they told neither the whole truth nor reflected the fears, hopes, perceptions and feelings of the players at the time. Burton contended that to get to the heart of a conflict, he would need to bring the present leaders in a current conflict together in a process of controlled communication. Burton&apos;s first exercise, in 1965, brought leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore together while there was still armed fighting between the first two on Borneo, where they both held territory. He had sufficiently strong contacts to get the respective heads of state to send high-level representatives to workshops in London with the team of Anglo-American academics that he led; Harold Wilson, the then British prime minister, was informed and gave his blessing. These meetings usually lasted for a week. They proved to be a success not only for the academics, who could test their theories on the real situation, but also for the practitioners, who were able to explore the nature of their conflict, test their perceptions of other participants and explore likely outcomes in confidence. A number of political factors, including the shift in power from Sukarno to Suharto, led to Indonesia abandoning its attacks on Malaysian Borneo in 1966. Burton&apos;s workshops can have contributed only positively to this. Others from Burton&apos;s group soon tried their hand, such as Herbert Kelman, who took the idea to Harvard and promoted contacts between leading lights of Israel and the PLO. However, the birth of &quot;second-track&quot; diplomacy, outside government institutions, owes most to Burton, who was well suited to leading workshops through his previous experience in international problem-solving. A native of Melbourne and the son of a Methodist minister, Burton studied at Newington college, Sydney; gained a degree in psychology at the University of Sydney; and, in 1942, a doctorate at the London School of Economics. From 1943 onwards, he was involved in planning for postwar reconstruction, and in 1945 attended the UN charter conference in San Francisco. He became the permanent head of the Australian ministry of external affairs in 1947, and together with his Labor minister, Bert (HV) Evatt, he helped to create Australian foreign policy \u2013 almost literally, since it had previously been handled by a small section in the prime minister&apos;s office, and largley shadowed that of Britain. Evatt and Burton declared Australia&apos;s independence from Britain in foreign affairs. At the UN San Francisco meeting, Australia played a leading role among the small countries, including opposition to the veto. At the same time, Australia began to take a greater interest in its immediate environment. Under Evatt and Burton&apos;s leadership, it played an important role in aiding Indonesia&apos;s independence. Moreover, Australia challenged the received wisdom about the future orientation of the People&apos;s Republic of China, which was that it was tied inextricably to the Soviet Union. Burton was particularly active in asking awkward questions about the outbreak of the Korean War and the mutual provocation on the 38th parallel, and espoused the philosophy of non-alignment. When a Liberal-Country party coalition came into office after the 1949 Australian election, this activity came close to costing him his job. After leaving the civil service and failing to gain a seat in the 1951 election, he became a farmer and undertook research at the Australian National University, Canberra. In 1963 Burton joined the staff of University College London (UCL) and quickly became a fully-fledged academic. Indeed, he was one of the two or three genuinely international academic figures in British international relations in the 1960s and 70s. His books were translated into several languages and were the subject of debate at the highest level, not least in the US. Burton was not just a critic of conventional wisdom, but had a new framework with which to replace it. If International Relations: A General Theory (1965) was a critique of power politics, then Systems, States, Diplomacy and Rules (1968) and World Society (1972) amounted to a statement of an alternative way of explaining how the world works, namely the cobweb model, with many players at many levels transcending national frontiers. At the end of the 1970s, Burton embarked upon a new tack, putting great emphasis upon human needs by arguing that each individual would pursue such needs whatever the circumstances. Drawing on the work of the American psychologist Abraham Maslow, Burton argued that such needs constituted navigation points for governments. The only restraint on individuals was that constituted by legitimised relationships. Burton was now looking at conflict in holistic terms and arguing that all conflict had, at its roots, the search for and denial of basic human needs. The individual therefore became his basic unit of analysis. He developed his ideas in a series of books, beginning with Deviance, Terrorism and War (1979). Burton&apos;s work has had a great impact upon the study of international relations. That many of the aspects of his world society approach are now in the mainstream is a tribute to his forward thinking, while his approach to conflict underlies a major school of conflict resolution, for both theorists and practitioners. The Centre for the Analysis of Conflict that Burton established at UCL in 1966 moved to the University of Kent in 1979. Three years later, he left Canterbury for the US, where he held a number of posts. In 1992, Burton retired to Australia, where a new generation of historians has set about exploring his role in developing an independent Australian foreign policy. He married three times, and is survived by his third wife, Betty, and by two daughters and a son from previous marriages. A daughter predeceased him. \u2022 John Wear Burton, international relations expert, civil servant and academic, born 2 March 1915; died 23 June 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/aug/23/human-centipede-most-horrific-film", "sentences": ["It even failed to perturb the hypersensitive censors of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-08-23T10:38:20Z", "title": "Is The Human Centipede the most horrific film ever?", "tags": ["Horror", "Film", "Culture", "The Exorcist", "Pier Paolo Pasolini"], "article": "The production notes for The Human Centipede (First Sequence) say it&apos;s been described as &quot;the most horrific film ever made&quot;. Not bad for a microbudget movie helmed by a horror novice. The claim that this accolade&apos;s been bestowed has been widely aired; even this site has repeated it. Yet who&apos;s supposed to have arrived at this weighty judgment? On this, the notes are silent. Google can unearth no trace of any such verdict. So I asked the director, who&apos;s called Tom Six and hails from Holland. He responded with a wriggle of which his eponymous arthropod might have been proud. &quot;I think it was The Sun, in England,&quot; he ventured shiftily. That discerning red-top has indeed pronounced on The Human Centipede. It called the film &quot;twisted&quot;, &quot;depraved&quot;, &quot;sadistic and vile&quot; and &quot;the ultimate video nasty&quot;. But &quot;most horrific film ever&quot;? The nearest it came was &quot;sickest film ever&quot;, and even that was followed by a question mark. Perhaps this is indeed the sickest film to have yet hit the screen. The moment when the leading constituent of the beast with three backs defecates into the mouth of the young woman sewn to his anus would surely take some beating. Yet, what self-respecting film-maker could be content with such a laurel? &quot;Sickest&quot; makes you a bit of a card. &quot;Most horrific&quot; turns you into a cinematic legend. In the latter stakes, The Human Centipede is up against it. Only this year, Srdjan Spasojevic&apos;s A Serbian Film has shown a newborn baby being raped to death while still attached umbilically to its mother. Spasojevic has explained: &quot;This is a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government ... It&apos;s about the monolithic power of leaders who hypnotise you.&quot; Of course in this contest, pretensions to profundity might actually lose you points. Sensitive feminists might think last year&apos;s Antichrist worthy of consideration, what with that clitoris snipping and stuff. Even a few men might have been impressed by its testicle-crushing and bloody ejaculation. Something from the Saw series could make the cut for the easily pleased. Those who can still summon up fear of the unearthly might want to put in a word for Paranormal Activity or The Blair Witch Project. These are, however, merely some of the more recent candidates; cinema has a rich history of horrification on which to fall back. For many, The Exorcist remains unmatched. It&apos;s not only one of the top-grossing horror films ever, but it won two Oscars from 10 nominations. Still, demon fanciers might look instead to Rosemary&apos;s Baby or The Omen. The devout could go for The Passion of the Christ. The straightforward claims of Halloween, Psycho, The Amityville Horror, The Thing, Poltergeist, Friday the 13th or Night of the Living Dead might satisfy some. Those favouring the more esoteric could be tempted by the likes of Slaughtered Vomit Dolls, The Gateway Meat or Nekromantik. Wags might want to nominate almost any of Jennifer Aniston&apos;s romcoms. In 2006, A Nightmare On Elm Street topped a poll of the scariest movies of all time, with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre coming second. Jaws won three Oscars and did even better at the box office than The Exorcist. Those preferring something more subtle could consider The Shining. Internationalists might favour Ju-on, Suspiria or Men Behind the Sun, while the forthcoming Meat Grinder also sounds promising. It could be argued that film-makers working in cinema&apos;s earliest days deserve extra points for both originality and technical privation. Bring on Nosferatu, The Phantom of the Opera, Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy and Island of Lost Souls. In the face of this cornucopia, how does The Human Centipede shape up? Shamefully, the film picked up its 18 certificate without a single cut. It even failed to perturb the hypersensitive censors of Singapore. By way of comparison, Tod Browning&apos;s Freaks was banned in Britain for more than 30 years. None the less, The Human Centipede is not without its claims. Six believes that body horror surpasses all other varieties, because invasion of the person is humanity&apos;s greatest fear. The enduring impact of Alien&apos;s spontaneous Caesarean section and Marathon Man&apos;s involuntary dentistry suggest that he may indeed be on to something. Perhaps even more significantly, Six&apos;s film is one of the few contenders aspiring to credibility. Bizarre though The Human Centipede may seem, it conforms to the rules of the Newtonian universe. Dr Heiter&apos;s ambitions are not all that outlandish: at Auschwitz, Josef Mengele sewed people together to create artificially conjoined twins. The feasibility of the film&apos;s surgical methods enjoys expert endorsement . But then, Six makes a shock revelation. Does he himself believe that The Human Centipede is the most horrific film ever? &quot;Er, no, I don&apos;t think so,&quot; he replies. Centipede&apos;s humour, it seems, rules it out of contention. So what actually is the most horrific film ever made? Six ought to know.

His family soon moved to London where his father worked in West End theatres. They could not afford to keep Ron at school, so he took a string of odd jobs before joining the army, where he became a lightweight boxing champion and played rugby. When he was posted to Shanghai, he was shocked by the poverty around him and was detailed to collect frozen corpses from the streets in winter. When the Japanese invaded in 1937, he escaped first to Singapore and then to Java, where he was wounded, and on to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and India, earning him the nickname &quot;Lucky&quot; Garside. After eight years away from home, he was shipped back to the UK by way of Australia. Within two weeks he had joined up as a paratrooper and was dropped at Arnhem, in the Netherlands, again having a lucky escape when his glider crashed. After the second world war, Ron was a film distributor in Berlin, working with many actors and directors. In Berlin he met his future wife, Dilys, an army secretary. Returning to London, they married and had two children, Theresa and Christopher. Ron then worked for 27 years for Reuters in Fleet Street, usually walking the 10 miles to work and back. On retirement, he taught himself French and classical guitar, and took his French O-level aged 69. He would go off for weeks at a time to France on a motor scooter, making friends wherever he went. He remained a keen walker, and knew the North York moors and the Welsh hills intimately. Aged 82, he climbed Mont Ventoux, in Provence, with his grandchildren. In later years, despite his failing eyesight, he continued to read French and German poetry, much of which he could recite perfectly to any willing audience.

For shame! This humanitarian catastrophe can only be exacerbated by competitiveness. If one group can provide supplies and another group has the means to deliver those supplies, then this is surely the time when cautious co-operation can enhance the chance of saving lives and bringing relief. Where roads are washed out and helicopters cannot fly, people and pack animals are often the only means of reaching those cut off by the waters. Together, military provincial reconstruction teams, Taliban relief workers, NGOs and Afghan and Pakistan governments have a chance to pierce the fog of war with a ray of hope.

Peter Scott Elora, Ontario, Canada Failure of the Iraq war Seumas Milne says that the Iraq war &quot;has been a historic political and strategic failure for the US&quot; (Occupation of Iraq is rebranded, 13 August). I disagree: the US has achieved its goal perfectly. A recent article in the London Review of Books pointed out that behind the scenes the aim of US sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s was &quot;to destroy its ability to function as a modern industrial state&quot;. The May 2009 cover of The Atlantic Monthly displays a map of the Middle East as the US would like to see it: all of Israel&apos;s neighbours have been dismembered and fragmented into ethno-religious enclaves. The aim is to ensure Israeli military hegemony in the Middle East. Stable prosperous independent states in the region would threaten this. The current campaign against Iran is merely the next stage in this process. The real beauty of this is that American blood and money is spent to benefit Israel while weakening the US. General David Petraeus seems to recognise this, but the American political establishment has been totally subverted. Colin Sheppard Melbourne, Australia \u2022 Seumas Milne mars an otherwise excellent article with a prediction that oil majors operating in Iraq will sharply boost production so &quot;the global oil price can be slashed and the grip of recalcitrant Opec states broken&quot;. Why on earth would a company want to bring down the price, and therefore the profit, of its product? More than likely they will sit on supply and keep prices artificially high \u2013 just as they did before 1958. Some things never change. Giles Tuffin Perth, Western Australia Beneath the veil Regarding your editorial Beneath the veil (23 July): wearing the niqab in France and other western cultures goes against the tenets of secular, humanistic societies and most especially against a woman&apos;s right to choose whatever she wishes to wear. Muslim women wearing the niqab do so because they are under threat of violence from their husbands or families, not because it is a choice. A non-Muslim French woman can decide whether to cover her face without fearing punishment from the men around her. Denial abounds, of course, within the Muslim culture \u2013 as I well know from having lived in a Muslim country. If women are forced to wear a niqab or a burka in their indigenous countries, that is one thing. Importing these kinds of practices into western cultures that have codes of human rights is quite another. The number of women affected is irrelevant. It is the principle that counts. Human rights are human rights. Religious practices can not be allowed to supersede the law of the land in western societies. It is not the invisibility of a woman&apos;s face that is the challenge. It is the writer&apos;s own willingness to ignore the underlying issues surrounding that invisibility, and go along with a practice that, were it men who were affected, would be banned outright. Rhona Davies White Rock, BC, Canada Finding British products &quot;At the Bank of England they are scratching their heads&quot; (Why exports aren&apos;t beating UK recession, 13 August). This sent me to look around my house for British-made products. Furniture is all local Thai stuff. The fax, printer, CD player, boom box, floor fans, bath-heater, TV, oven, fridge and car are Japanese. This year&apos;s purchases are a Chinese-built computer plus a Korean monitor. Things are changing. I thought that a tin of Nivea might fit the bill, but the text on the bottom said &quot;Beiersdorf Hamburg&quot;. So I guess the only English item is a packet of Marks &amp; Spencer gingernuts, but that possession is vitiated by the fact that the packet I am currently munching away at is from Arnotts of Australia. None of this reflects deliberate spurning of British goods \u2013 it&apos;s just that they are no longer in contention. Sorry. R H Leary Bangkok, Thailand High-powered stupidity Are we becoming more stupid? asks Patrick Kingsley (Read, mark and inwardly digest, 6 August), citing our declining inability to focus on reading. The short answer is yes. Many undergraduates, coddled and entertained to death in featureless suburbs, arrive immature at university where they find that they can&apos;t read, can&apos;t think and can&apos;t cope. Read, mark, learn and inwardly digest becomes scan, highlight, rote-learn, regurgitate and forget. As some cannot conceptualise originality, plagiarism abounds, even unto the doctoral thesis. Underlying the current techno-entertainment frenzy, which appears to have doomed students&apos; concentration and focus, looms the culture of affluence, parental indulgence, credentialism and a huge sense of entitlement, which for some students is balanced by rarely expressed feelings of sheer hopelessness. These traits are compounded by those university teachers who believe that higher education, from undergraduate to doctoral, is chiefly a process of &quot;training&quot;, as if students were dogs. The longer answer, I believe, is that we are just as stupid as ever, but in a more high-powered way. Douglas Porteous Victoria, BC, Canada Bird&apos;s nest bonanza In 1995-96 I was working on an aid project in Bengkulu, Sumatra (Unusual industry draws residents&apos; ire, 13 August). The problem of finding somewhere to live for myself and my wife was solved \u2013 there being no such thing as an estate agent \u2013 when an Indonesian family of Chinese extraction discovered that their hardware shop/house in the old town near Fort Marlborough was the home of swiftlets in the rafters. They were happy to vacate their large house in the suburbs to tend the swiftlets, which were regarded as a gold mine. Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore, had his first posting with the East India Company in Georgetown, Penang, and eventually became governor of British Bengkulu. It was not a profitable colony in the pepper trade, but perhaps Bengkulu might have been more viable if Raffles had promoted the bird&apos;s nest industry, which was probably already going strong in Georgetown in his time. Raffles is still remembered warmly in Bengkulu as a beneficent governor, and there is an annual Raffles beach festival of lights.

This has seismic implications for British foreign and development policy towards Rwanda, which the present government needs to take extremely seriously. Since the 1990s the Paul Kagame regime has represented itself as the progressive and modernising &quot;Singapore of Africa&quot;, courting international support and legitimacy in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Yet, alongside the suppression of human rights domestically, it has continued to play a direct and indirect military role in North Kivu, both in pursuit of Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 and natural resources that have bankrolled Rwanda&apos;s &quot;economic miracle&quot;. All the while, the British government has continued to unquestioningly back Kagame, being Rwanda&apos;s largest source of overseas development aid. It has failed to recognise the complicity of Britain in effectively bankrolling a conflict in the Congo that has lead to millions of deaths. The argument is simple: 1) More people have died in the conflict in the eastern Congo than in any war since the second world war; 2) The UN report provides evidence that Rwanda and Paul Kagame are directly and inextricably implicated, not only in fuelling that conflict, but in possibly carrying out the most serious crime in international human rights and humanitarian law \u2013 genocide; 3) The UK \u2013 its taxpayers and voters \u2013 are Kagame and Rwanda&apos;s biggest international supporters, largely unconditionally, and David Cameron and his colleagues continue to take annual Conservative party summer holidays to promote Rwanda&apos;s international reputation.

His work was published in Flight International magazine for more than 40 years. Frank managed to make a seemingly complex subject readily understood, even down to the pilot&apos;s safety harness.     Frank Munger    Using pen and ink on art board, he\u00a0opened up aeroplanes, ranging from the lumbering Vickers Vimy bomber of\u00a0the first world war to the supersonic Concorde. In the aftermath of the Concorde crash in 2000 in Paris, Frank&apos;s cutaway showed the relationship between the fuel tanks and the plane&apos;s undercarriage. (A metallic strip found lying on the runway had burst one of the plane&apos;s tyres, and the resulting rubber fragments punctured a\u00a0fuel tank that caused a fire.) Frank&apos;s detailed knowledge of how aircraft were constructed was gained during the second world war when he was in the RAF. He was born at Walters Ash, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and attended Naphill primary school. He grew up with a\u00a0passion for drawing, mostly horses and internal combustion engines. He\u00a0learned to dismantle and reassemble the motorbike engines of his friends and\u00a0neighbours, and at the outbreak of the war was managing, without any formal engineering training, the servicing of food lorries. He volunteered for the RAF, and, to his delight, was posted to a course for engine fitters at\u00a0Squires Gate, Blackpool. Frank was then posted to a Vickers Wellington bomber squadron before moving in 1941 to Singapore. With few aircraft to service, and knowing that Japanese forces were about to strike, he\u00a0and his fellow airmen spent their time destroying anything that could be of use to the invading forces. He boarded the Empire Star shortly before the fall of Singapore in February 1942. Sailing for Sumatra, he and his comrades, armed with rifles, lined the decks to shoot at Japanese bombers that were attempting to sink the vessel. By 1944 Frank was stationed at Guadalcanal, in the eastern Pacific, servicing Royal New Zealand Air Force Curtiss P-40 fighters. To his delight, these American-manufactured aircraft came with individual toolkits (British fighters came with but a spanner). After he contracted tuberculosis, he was sent home and, to his dismay, was invalided out of the RAF, having lost a lung. In January 1945 Frank saw an advertisement for a junior artist&apos;s position at the studios of Iliffe and Sons, near Waterloo station, London. Iliffe published trade and leisure magazines on subjects ranging from nursing to yachting. Despite having no formal art training, Frank, having taken along his RAF notebook sketches, was accepted by Max Millar, the head artist. Millar knew that Frank&apos;s knowledge of aeroplane engines would be invaluable to Flight International&apos;s news of all the latest developments. In the summer of 1945 Frank accompanied Millar to Rolls-Royce at Derby to help draw the new Griffon piston engine which powered the latest Spitfires. For Frank, it was the beginning of a 65-year relationship with the company. His first cutaway drawing of an aeroplane, the box-like Bristol Freighter, was published in March 1946. In 1955 he drew the Rolls-Royce Avon jet engine, which powered the RAF&apos;s Hawker Hunter fighter. He completed the full pencil sketch in just four days. In the late 1950s Flight International published a series of &quot;probe&quot; drawings of the US&apos;s latest supersonic jet fighters. With the manufacturers unwilling to divulge information, Frank and his colleagues gathered diverse snippets of\u00a0data and production line photographs of the F-104 Lockheed Starfighter. His accurate deduction of how the jet was constructed led to an anxious call from the air ministry, demanding to know where he had obtained the facts about a\u00a0supposedly secret fighter. Frank drew more than 250 cutaway drawings; the major ones took more than 300 hours each to complete. He\u00a0retired in 1985 but continued to draw for publications. He also took up model engineering and watercolour and oil painting. A selection of his works now hangs in the RAF Museum at Hendon, north London. Frank left London and moved to West Hallam, near Derby, and joined the Rolls-Royce Heritage Trust. One of\u00a0his last projects was helping to restore and test a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. He won many awards from the Guild of\u00a0Aviation Artists. Frank was a quiet, unassuming man but at his studio desk, cutaway in progress, he always gave those interested a warm welcome. His skill with the pen, knowledge of what was needed and which details to omit, gave clarity and understanding to his drawings. He was once asked what makes a good cutaway artist. He replied: &quot;An artist who really wants to know what goes on under the skin.&quot; He is survived by a son, Derek, and a daughter, Tricia. His wife, Helena, predeceased him. \u2022 Frank Munger, artist, born 2 May 1920; died 24 June 2010"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/01/tesco-bids-carrefour-asian-stores", "sentences": ["Tesco has put in a bid for more than 60\u00a0stores in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, currently owned by its French rival Carrefour, as part of its strategy to conquer Asia and cement its position as a global force in supermarket retailing.", "Others include the Japanese Aeon group, Dairy Farm of Singapore and the French Casino group.", "The portfolio consists of 40 supermarkets in Thailand, 19 in Malaysia and two in Singapore.", "It currently has no presence in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-01T19:31:22Z", "title": "Tesco bids to increase dominance of Asian market with basket of Carrefour stores", "tags": ["Tesco", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Supermarkets", "Retail industry", "Business", "UK news", "France", "Thailand", "Malaysia", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Tesco has put in a bid for more than 60\u00a0stores in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, currently owned by its French rival Carrefour, as part of its strategy to conquer Asia and cement its position as a global force in supermarket retailing. The French hypermarket group put the stores on the market after a strategic decision to pull out of Asian countries where it stood no chance of becoming market leader. Tesco is already the market leader in Thailand and Malaysia, and more than a third of its shopfloor space is in Asia. The Cheshunt-based retail group has operated in Asia for more than a decade. It has more than 1,230 shops in Asia and expects to open another 270 by February 2011. It views the region as &quot;a significant long-term opportunity&quot; even though its like-for-like sales in Thailand, Malaysia and Japan went into reverse last year as a result of the economic downturn and local political problems in Thailand. Tesco has particularly ambitious plans for China, where it intends to open 80 vast shopping malls in the country by 2016. Earlier this year chief executive Sir Terry Leahy said: &quot;We have continued to invest through the downturn to ensure that we will be in an even stronger position as the economies recover.&quot; The deadline for first bids for the Carrefour stores closed Tesco is understood to be among about 10 groups to have tabled initial bids. Others include the Japanese Aeon group, Dairy Farm of Singapore and the French Casino group. The stores are expected to fetch about $1bn (\u00a3647m) and Carrefour may decide to sell them piecemeal, if single-store or country sales will achieve a better price. The portfolio consists of 40 supermarkets in Thailand, 19 in Malaysia and two in Singapore. Tesco currently has 571 stores in Thailand, including 110 hypermarkets, and 29 shops in Malaysia, of which 28 are hypermarkets. It plans to open another 50 outlets in the two countries by March 2011. It currently has no presence in Singapore. One supermarket executive said Tesco would undoubtedly be keen to snap up the Carrefour chain: &quot;Only a few portfolios like this come along and only a few retailers have the wherewithal to consider it.

Korea is now Tesco&apos;s largest international business; in April, Tesco said sales there were \u00a34.5bn and profits were almost \u00a3300m.

And one of the first things Tony Blair has been keen to clear up is the fact that he long ago decided to donate the proceeds from the sale of the book to the British Legion. This was no 11th-hour gesture. It should raise a cool \u00a34m, he says. Which makes it all the more commendable on the part of the ex-PM. Commendable too, that while benefiting from his largesse, the Legion exhibits a spiky sort of independence by featuring prominently in the latest edition of its magazine the controversial anti-war photomontage by Peter Kennard and Cat Picton Phillips. The construct, which angered No 10, shows a grinning, sinister Blair taking a picture of himself against a backdrop of a burning oilfield\u00a0in Iraq. \u2022 He wrote the book himself, we learn. In longhand. But the writing style seems a little familiar. &quot;It&apos;s a great privilege and honour to do the job. And by the way, it really is,&quot; he writes on page 502. And recalling a terrorist threat in the skies above London after 9/11, he says: &quot;It had been a technical error. I needed to sit down and Thank God after that one.&quot; Just the style of the St Albion parody run throughout his reign by Private Eye. Was he scribbling that as well? \u2022 And with the Journey now fully under way the question must be asked: why is Prince of Darkness Peter Mandelson&apos;s own masterwork, The Third Man, on sale in the fiction section of WH Smith at Heathrow? What kind of message is that to send about the architect of New Labour? What are they trying to say? \u2022 Ex-political titans. They are everywhere. And there is another on display at Portcullis House, Westminster, where hangs a portrait of John Major, obscured at present by transparent film with a large label. &quot;Fragile artwork behind,&quot; it says. &quot;He was famously thin-skinned as a premier,&quot; our guide explains. Amazing to see that replicated in a painting. \u2022 Yes it&apos;s A Journey today. An arrival by the pope in a fortnight&apos;s time. What a life. Both requiring the most delicate preparations. Sad to say, then, that there is an unholy kerfuffle over the decision of organisers of Pope Benedict XVI&apos;s visit to stage a helpful briefing on Tuesday exclusively for the foreign press, excluding totally the British media. Not just a shut-out of our heathen mainstream titles. Conspicuously absent was the Catholic Herald. For all that, rumours of a papal visit without the pope remain unconfirmed. \u2022 And perhaps now is the time to ask exactly what information was sought by the Q magazine reader who inquired during that publication&apos;s communal questioning of Bob Geldof: &quot;Do you still have the pope&apos;s phone number?&quot; Geldof assumed, as did we on highlighting the exchange last week, that it was a matter of communication, hence his answer: &quot;He did call me once. I was watching Dynasty at the time.&quot; But Rod Davis of Cornwall gets in touch to put us right. &quot;You may just have missed the point of the original question, as indeed does Bob Geldof: the pope&apos;s telephone number = VAT69 whisky, as in, &apos;I&apos;d like a glass of pope&apos;s telephone number, please&apos;.&quot; As we now know, Tony Blair used to ring the pope almost every night. \u2022 In this time of austerity and cuts, it pays to focus on the few growth industries. The company Oil Spill Response seeks spill response specialists. Travel the world, react to disasters. Not just the Gulf of Mexico, or even the disaster waiting to happen in the Arctic.

And the closing date. There isn&apos;t one. They need clean-up types in Southampton, Singapore and Bahrain all year round. \u2022 Finally we note that the Right Rev Richard Chartres, the Bishop\u00a0of London, places his good name and reputation in the hands of PR\u00a0guardians Luther Pendragon.

Its three-day vernissage is a mighty schmoozefest of architectural clans, eased by a diet of bellinis and dinners on rooftop terraces. The vernissage, in truth, usually seems the point of the thing, rather than the three succeeding months when the humble paying punters can see the exhibition for themselves. Architects, you might think, should know something about making pleasurable spaces. It&apos;s their job. Yet the paradox of the biennale is that, bellinis apart, it is usually a physically awful experience. You are battered with strident images and turgid texts, and your vital forces drain into countless flickering screens. The Corderie dell&apos;Arsenale, the 300m-long former ropeworks where a large chunk of the biennale is shown, becomes an exhausting slog through mounds of ego and assertion. One of the good things about this year&apos;s biennale, the 12th, is that it is delightful. It alerts the senses and the mind. It has life. The content of the Corderie has presence, but is not too densely packed, and skilfully mixes up heavy and light, light and dark, cool and warm, image and object. You come early to giant beams installed by the Spanish architect Ant\u00f3n Garc\u00eda-Abril, precariously balanced. Later a light metal bridge takes you on a looping journey up into an artificial cloud. An Olafur Eliasson installation of water sprays, momentarily arrested by flickering lights, is relief from the sweltering summer heat. There is another installation of delicate steel threads, so delicate indeed that an unfortunate accident with a spectator left it in need of restoration. Then there is a room with photographs of the Iranian city of Isfahan, simply presented, and another with finely crafted drawings of some fairly humble buildings. There is another room packed with talking heads, examples of the 2,000 hours of interviews that the art curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist has carried out in his life. Here you can get your ordeal-by-screen over with, once and for all. The delightfulness of the biennale has something to do with the fact that it is, unusually, directed by a practising architect, and a good one. She is also the first female director. She is Kazuyo Sejima, one half of the Tokyo-based practice Sanaa, whose works include the recent Rolex learning centre in Lausanne. The director&apos;s job is to set a theme, and decide the content of the Corderie and of a large building called the International pavilion. Individual countries then present their own shows, more-or-less following the theme. Bigger, more established countries show these in purpose-built pavilions in the biennale gardens. Others, including Ireland and Singapore, find locations elsewhere in Venice. The theme is tricky, as it has to be both wide-ranging and focused. Usually directors settle for titles that can mean almost anything or, as in 2004&apos;s &quot;Metamorph&quot;, nothing at all. Once it was &quot;Less Aesthetics, More Ethics&quot; and turned out to be the precise opposite. Sejima chose &quot;People Meet in Architecture&quot;. It sounds a bit soggy, and also guilty of architects&apos; common pretence that they are not obsessed with buildings when, in fact, they always are. But its vagueness allows her to exercise her impeccable judgment in selecting exhibitors, while also creating an overall experience in which architecture is the main but not the only ingredient. There is also art, film and, indeed, people. So her exhibit in the International pavilion contains Fray Foam Home, a baffling but charming cloud of coloured stuff, by Andr\u00e9s Jaque Arquitectos, somehow abstracted from the contents of a typical home. There is a straightforward display of the great postwar Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi, whose lightness of touch prefigures Sejima&apos;s. There is a very serious, but subtle, plan by the Architectural Research Unit of London for a series of Korean new towns built on reclaimed land. There is a huge model of a piece of Japanese landscape, in which nestles a dewdrop-like Sanaa project. Together these exhibits, ranging from Korean cities to bits of fluff, create an atmosphere, or a series of sensations, or tastes. Architecture is the thing that makes this atmosphere possible, but it does not dominate. Outside Sejima&apos;s immediate control, the place that most responds to her spirit is the British pavilion. It is curated by Vicky Richardson of the British Council and the architect/artist practice muf. It is about cultural traffic between Britain and Venice, represented by the writings and drawings of John Ruskin and institutions such as Venice in Peril. The pavilion aims to be not just a thing to gawp at, but also a place of use to Venetians while it is there, with events, drawing classes and debates, held in a scale model of a section of the 2012 Olympic stadium. It is also about what muf call &quot;close looking&quot;, which means paying attention to the particular and specific. Examples include Ruskin&apos;s small notebooks of Venice, returned to the city for the first time since he made them, and an archive of photographs, taken over two decades, of everything in the city from palaces to gas holders. A section of salt marsh is created, of the kind that surrounds Venice and is integral to its ecology, but of which you are unaware when you are in the city. Implicit in the promotion of close looking is a criticism of the kind of masterplanning, as in London&apos;s Olympic project, which starts by sweeping away what is already there. Not everything in the biennale follows the director&apos;s lead. There is a display of the West Kowloon cultural district \u2013 a plan to correct Hong Kong&apos;s perceived lack of culture by building 15 venues all in one go. Three architects are competing for this plum job, and present their ideas in videos of stunning banality. Norman Foster promises streets that are &quot;familiar but different&quot;, before displaying spaces that look like a very undifferent kind of mall. Even the legendary brain of Rem Koolhaas has dumbed down for the purposes of this project, but he still deserves to win for having done so the least. Meanwhile, Audi presented their lavish Urban Futures project, in which an interested group of architects were asked to imagine what cities might be like in the future, especially in relation to transport. Luckily for the sponsors, the future still seems to include cars, albeit driverless ones, which use space more efficiently and allow city streets to be more actively used by pedestrians. The technology is all there, apparently: the show could be either one of those fantasies that will look quaint in 20 years&apos; time, or genuinely prescient. But it is Sejima&apos;s spirit that makes this biennale one of the best in years. The architectural world is currently in the grip of a predictable reaction to the boomtime cult of the icon, when symbols of architectural genius garnished the works of rampant capital. There is a tendency now to think the only valid form of architecture is to help earthquake victims, or do something to solve the Palestinian problem, a tendency that has its own pomposity and vanity. Sejima steps to the side of this opposition, and shows what architects should spend much of their time doing. Which is to make spaces. With people in them."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/05/eu-imf-robin-hood-tax", "sentences": ["The fact that major financial centers such as the UK, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Africa levy forms of STTs indicates that such taxes do not automatically drive out financial activity to an unacceptable extent,&quot; it said."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-04T23:07:06Z", "title": "International backing grows for 'Robin Hood tax' on banks", "tags": ["European banks", "Banking", "Financial crisis", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Business", "George Osborne", "Politics", "World news"], "article": "European Union finance ministers will step up talks on raising extra money from banks this week amid signs that the International Monetary Fund is softening its opposition to a &quot;Robin Hood tax&quot; on financial transactions. Treasury sources said the chancellor, George Osborne, was prepared to back a financial activities tax on bank profits and pay at the Brussels meeting provided it was universally introduced, but was wary of a broader Robin Hood tax. Campaigners said last night, however, that a leaked IMF report showed growing international backing for a broader tax and urged Osborne to look at the revenue-raising potential of a levy of transactions. David Hillman, a Robin Hood Campaign spokesman, said: &quot;The rug has been pulled from under critics who claim that a Robin Hood tax would damage the wider economy or is unworkable. The IMF, EC and Leading Group of 60 nations have all said it is feasible. The main losers would be those who make lots of money from socially useless trades but the winners would be millions of people at home and abroad pushed into poverty by the economic crisis or whose public services are under threat.&quot; An IMF paper, Taxing Financial Transactions: Issues and Evidence, said securities transactions taxes (STT) existed in many countries with little evidence that they distorted markets. It argued that a small levy on transactions might help to dampen the &quot;herding behaviour&quot; encouraged by computer-program trading. &quot;Unilateral STTs, even if levied on fairly narrow bases, are certainly feasible as witnessed by their use in numerous developed countries. The fact that major financial centers such as the UK, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Africa levy forms of STTs indicates that such taxes do not automatically drive out financial activity to an unacceptable extent,&quot; it said. The paper added: &quot;The impact on financial markets from a low-rate (less than 5 basis points), broad-based STT would likely be fairly modest, beyond its reduction of very short-term trading.&quot; In its letter to Osborne, the Robin Hood campaign said a financial activities tax could, if combined with other measures, raise as much as \u00a320bn a year in the UK. &quot;We hope that the Ecofin meeting will provide a platform for taking this forward at the European level. Ultimately, we believe that a financial transaction tax has the greatest potential to raise revenue from the financial sector, as it offers a robust, simple to implement and fair mechanism.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/06/cable-wireless-singapore-telecoms", "sentences": ["This followed reports that Singapore Telecoms was planning a bid for the company."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-06T08:26:47Z", "title": "Cable & Wireless Worldwide shares soar amid takeover rumours", "tags": ["Telecommunications industry", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Fresh speculation of a takeover bid for Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide sent its shares soaring in London again today.

It&apos;s not a vision from some futuristic film or doomsday novel, but the present-day intention of companies trying to launch the bulk water export business. The idea has been around since the 1990&apos;s, yet no one has succeeded in making it a practical reality. But last July, the US company S2C Global Systems, Inc. became the latest bulk water wanna-be by announcing it would begin shipping water from Alaska to India within the next six to eight months. Using large class vessels that can hold 50 million gallons at a time, S2C plans to sell the water for both manufacturing and drinking purposes to countries around the Arabian Sea.  &quot;I think it&apos;s a dream,&quot; said Peter Gleick, a scientist and international water expert, in an interview with SolveClimate News. Gleick is President of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security. &quot;I don&apos;t think bulk water transfers of any significant volume are ever going to happen, because the cost of moving water, especially across the ocean, is so high.&quot;  Rod Bartlett, managing partner of Alaska Resource Management (a partnership between S2C and True Alaska Bottling), told SolveClimate News that S2C is finalizing legal issues and logistics for a &quot;World Water Hub&quot; on the western coast of India. Once it&apos;s built, the hub will be a distribution point from which the company plans to deliver water to target destinations in the Middle East and northern Africa.  &quot;Every nation within a four-day target of the hub is a potential customer or client that will need fresh water,&quot; said Bartlett. Without revealing specific details, Bartlett added that S2C has received both spoken and &quot;written expressions of interest.&quot;  The water S2C plans to export will come from Alaska&apos;s Blue Lake near the city of Sitka, about 90 miles southwest of Juneau. Since 1999, Sitka has promoted itself as a source for bulk water exports; True Alaska Bottling owns the water rights to 8 million gallons per day from Blue Lake. As to why humans would want to move water around the world, Bartlett explained: &quot;(You move the water) because you can&apos;t move the population.&quot; Most of the world&apos;s freshwater is found near the Poles, while most people live closer to the equator. Population growth, urbanization and irrigation place are creating increasing demand for water. But climate change is exacerbating the problem of supply, most notably in the Himalayan region, often referred to as Asia&apos;s water tower. According to a report from King&apos;s College in London, about two-thirds of the Himalayan glaciers are shrinking, and decreased runoff will affect water levels in ten major rivers. All together, the rivers&apos; drainage basins are home to 1.3 billion people\u2014close to one-fifth of the world&apos;s population. Many of them live in India. S2C originally chose to build their hub there because they couldn&apos;t find an appropriate port in the Middle East. But now, said Bartlett, &quot;as you continue to look at the potential in India, it&apos;s going to be a natural place to sell water soon, no question about it.&quot; Desalinated Water 18 Times CheaperThe idea of moving vast quantities of water is hardly new. The Romans did it with aqueducts; today, California pipes the Colorado River&apos;s water hundreds of miles into its cities and farms. But when you ship water more than 1000 or 1500 miles, said Gleick, &quot;the diesel costs kill you.&quot; International water shipments do occur on small geographic scales. In 1997, Greece began shipping water to the island of Aegina, 13 miles from the Greek coast. Singapore currently imports freshwater from Malaysia but vowed to build desalination plants for increased water security. A plan for Turkey to sell water to Israel was recently suspended due to political tension between the two nations. What S2C has proposed\u2014moving water halfway around the world, 50 million gallons at a time\u2014is on a scale that dwarfs existing bulk water transfer efforts. The biggest problem, said Gleick, is that S2C will be competing with desalination plants, which are very popular in the Middle East. &quot;Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are almost completely dependent on desalinated (sea)water.&quot; Water from desalination plants costs about $1/cubic meter (this price includes the cost of building and running the plant), said Gleick. According to Bartlett, it will cost S2C $18/cubic meter to move the water from Alaska to India. In order to make a profit, the company would then have to mark up the price before selling to customers. Some of the water will be sold in bulk to pharmaceuticals and manufacturers; the rest will be bottled for drinking. And after days in storage on board the ship, the water will need further processing before it&apos;s clean enough to sell, further adding to the company&apos;s costs. Despite the abundance of cheap desalinated water, Bartlett believes that desalination has its drawbacks. In an email to SolveClimate News, he wrote that the process of purifying seawater has environmental impacts (such as pollution from the fossil fuels that power the plant). He also said that the desalinated water can leach minerals out of pipes, making the water less palatable. Gleick acknowledged that the price of desalinated water doesn&apos;t take into account the environmental costs. However, he said that the mineral-leaching problem comes from overly purified water and can be easily solved. Plant operators will either add minerals back into the desalinated water or mix it with existing tapwater. &quot;This is routine (at) desalination plants.&quot; &quot;(The process of) reverse osmosis can turn seawater into potable water,&quot; said Gleick. After that, &quot;you basically tune the system to the kind of water you want.&quot; Nevertheless, Bartlett was optimistic about his company&apos;s future. In his opinion, S2C overcame a major hurdle by finding a deepwater port in India that can accommodate the large class vessels. It also helps that the ports at either end are quipped to load and unload the water quickly. Every day that a ship sits in port costs the company $50,000-$60,000. But all those problems, said Gleick, are insignificant compared to the cost of transport. At the end of the day, S2C&apos;s water is more than 18 times more expensive than existing sources. Move to Ban Water Exports Logistics and pricing aside, the mere idea of turning water into another internationally traded commodity has drawn mixed reactions. Canada, which owns more freshwater resources than any other country, is moving to ban bulk exports. Greenland, Iceland and New Zealand are searching for investors. Bartlett argued that bulk water trade would hardly make a difference in the grand scheme of things. For context, S2C&apos;s maximum potential allocation from Blue Lake is 12 billion gallons per year (37,000 acre-feet), less than one percent of California&apos;s yearly allotment (4.4 million acre-feet) from the Colorado River. Bartlett said that S2C hopes to build two more Water Hubs, one in the Caribbean and another near eastern China. Gleick remained doubtful about the success of the India venture: &quot;I would be hugely surprised if this passed any economic or practical test\u2026until I see a contract and an actual shipment, I&apos;m going to remain skeptical.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/sep/06/homeretailgroup-barclay", "sentences": ["CWW - which despite its name has most of its business in the UK - had already been in demand last week on suggestions of interest from America&apos;s AT&amp;T, and weekend reports identified Singapore Telecommunications as another possible bidder."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-06T16:09:25Z", "title": "Bid talk helps lift FTSE, with Cable & Wireless Worldwide and Tullow in focus", "tags": ["Business", "Home Retail", "Barclays", "Smith and Nephew", "Tullow Oil", "Rentokil Initial", "ITV"], "article": "It was a volatile day for investors in Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, as the company&apos;s shares jumped as much as 8% on bid speculation before ending virtually unchanged. CWW - which despite its name has most of its business in the UK - had already been in demand last week on suggestions of interest from America&apos;s AT&amp;T, and weekend reports identified Singapore Telecommunications as another possible bidder. It would seem a good time for a predator to pounce since the company, demerged from Cable &amp; Wireless in March, recently issued a profits warning, saying that the government&apos;s planned austerity measures would damage its business. Despite the uncertain outlook, many analysts believe that CWW could be an attractive target for a large telecoms company looking to strengthen its corporate communications arm. Commenting on the recent takeover speculation analyst Jerry Dellis at Jefferies International said:  With CWW still trading around 20% below pre-profit warning levels, it is reasonable to believe that multinational telcos keen to build share in UK enterprise could be taking a closer look. CWW holds a strong number two position to BT(19% share among large enterprises, 12% public sector), with potential to gradually gain share within a fairly disciplined market structure.  Not everyone is convinced, however. Steve Malcolm at Evolution Securities said recently:  We see little logic in the rumoured interest from AT&amp;T \u2013 or any other large telco for that matter. AT&amp;T&apos;s stated international M&amp;A strategy is to look at areas which could help it serve its 1,500 multinational corporation customers better and more cost effectively, and opportunistic investments in under-developed areas, particularly wireless. CWW specifically does not target multinational customers, has no wireless business and is UK-centric \u2013 hardly the blueprint of an AT&amp;T target. We also note that AT&amp;T has no material UK profits, so would place little incremental value on CWW&apos;s \u00a33.5bn of tax losses. Telecoms M&amp;A is typically driven by the quest for extra growth, or in-market consolidation. We forecast a 4% decline in CWW&apos;s revenues this year, while BT, Vodafone, O2, T-Mobile/Orange and Virgin Media can all be ruled out as in-market consolidators.  In the end the doubters won the day, and CWW closed 0.2p lower at 72.75p. A spokesman refused to comment on &quot;market speculation&quot; Overall the FTSE 100 ended 11.04 points higher at 5439.19, its best level since the end of April, partly prompted by a new bout of takeover talk. The optimism which followed Friday&apos;s better than expected US jobs data also continued, helped by a survey showing strong export growth for UK manufacturers in the third quarter. But with the US markets closed for Labor day, volumes were again relatively thin. Meanwhile sterling fell to a six week low against the dollar on talk of selling by a UK bank. Back among the risers Home Retail added 5.8p to 227.1p ahead of a second quarter update on Thursday as Seymour Pierce moved from sell to hold. Analyst Freddie George said:  The trading update will show that sales and gross margins for the quarter ended August 2010 remain relatively weak but are likely to be better we suspect, than market expectations and better than the previous quarter. Our view is that a possible downgrade to earnings is fully reflected in the current share price. The stock, which has been the worst performing FTSE 100 stock to date declining by 28% over the last year, is beginning to look good value. The company also has a relatively strong balance sheet with cash forecast at \u00a3320m by end of March 2011, even after a share buyback of \u00a3150m, and strong cashflow, which would be attractive to a predator.  Also suggested as a takeover target was Tullow Oil, up 26p at \u00a311.82 as rumours went round the market about a possible \u00a320 a share offer. Rentokil Initial rose 2.3p to 101.9p on speculation of a 145p a share bid, possibly from private equity, while McBride, the own brand household goods supplier, was another mooted target, closing 11.5p better at 170.2p. But Barclays fell 2.15p to 322.85, hit by poor results from Australian banking group Macquarie as well as a downgrade from Evolution Securities. The broker repeated its sell recommendation and cut its price target by 12% to 298p, saying:  In our view, Barclays has a very difficult business mix: we estimate that by 2012 76% of its capital needs (\u00a336bn) will correspond to corporate and investment banking activities, activities for which we forecast a low 12.2% sustainable return on equity.  Separately the bank announced it planned to create up to 600 new jobs in Scotland. Smith and Nephew slipped 8p to 548p as analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove downgraded their growth forecasts for the second half of 2010 and 2011, saying the reasons for a recent slowdown in medical sales in the US remained unclear. ITV dipped 0.6p to 58.55p after Deutsche Bank cut its recommendation from buy to hold and its target price from 75p to 65p. The bank said:  The buy case on ITV had been high operating leverage to an advertising recovery that was underestimated by the market and would allay debt concerns. This has now largely played out. The stock has recovered most of its underperformance versus the sector and peers and bid probability has diminished.  Lower down the market Silence Therapeutics jumped 5.51p to 12.75p as the biotech company said it had received a bid approach, while Draganfly Investments rose 1p to 1.5p. The company put the rise down to an increase in the share price of one of its main investments, Sirius Exploration, a potash business which has benefited from the bid for Canada&apos;s Potash Corporation by BHP Billiton. But Armour Group fell 2.38p to 8.875p as the consumer electronics business said that the current economic uncertainty meant its full year profits would be around 25% below last year&apos;s figure."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/07/canada-tamil-refugees-racism-debate", "sentences": ["Professor Rohan Gunaratna, who is advising the Canadian government, said, in an email from his home in Singapore, that the Tamil Tigers had &quot;decided to regroup in Canada where (they) have traditionally raised funds and lobbied politicians that depended on the migrant-diaspora vote.&quot; He claimed there was evidence that the Tamil Tigers had organised the voyage."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-07T15:58:26Z", "title": "Sri Lankan Tamil refugees spark racism row in Canada", "tags": ["Canada", "Refugees", "Sri Lanka", "World news", "Americas", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "The arrival off the west coast of Canada of a rusty boat containing nearly 500 exhausted Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers has sparked an angry debate about racism that has divided national opinion. The merchant vessel Sun Sea limped, under escort, into Esquimalt naval base in British Columbia on 13 August after a four month voyage from Songkhla in Thailand. The passengers spoke of grim conditions. One man died during the journey and was buried at sea. &quot;It is a miracle that they survived,&quot; David Poopalapillai of the Canadian Tamil Congress (CTC) told the Guardian. &quot;The boat is very primitive, you wouldn&apos;t even go out fishing in it.&quot; He ascribed their survival to the fact that they had been living for many months in very hostile conditions in Sri Lanka. The 380 men and 63 women are being held in detention centres near Vancouver. The 49 children on board are with their mothers although not officially detained. Hearings into whether the Tamils can be released while applications for refugee status are processed are due to start tomorrow . Even before the boat reached Canada, it had stirred up controversy. The Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, described the vessel as &quot;abnormal&quot;, claimed that it created security concerns and warned that he could seek a change in the law to deal with similar arrivals. Canada&apos;s public safety minister, Vic Toews, said that it could contain members of the Tamil Tigers and that it was a &quot;test ship ... part of a broader organised criminal enterprise&quot;. The government has been accused of scaremongering by the opposition, immigration lawyers and refugee groups. The Liberal party leader, Michael Ignatieff, criticised suggestions that the boat should have been turned away, as happened to similar vessels approaching Australia. He said during a recent political rally in Winnipeg: &quot;This is Canada, not Australia. That means Canada has principles, the charter of rights and freedoms, our international obligations.&quot; Canada has a long history of welcoming refugees, from 200,000 Hungarians who fled after the failed 1956 uprising to more than 100,000 US draft resisters who crossed into Canada during the Vietnam war. There were also darker times; coincidentally, last week, details were announced of a monument to commemorate the St Louis, a ship carrying Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany in 1939 which was turned away by the Canadian government. Many of its 900 passengers subsequently died in concentration camps. Lorne Waldman, the lawyer representing more than 50 of the asylum seekers, told the Guardian that before the boat landed the tone was set. &quot;From the get-go, it was suggested that there were criminals and terrorists aboard,&quot; he said. &quot;The Sri Lankan government has a huge interest in portraying them this way rather than as victims of a genocidal civil war. Some of those on board are victims of torture and have shrapnel wounds.&quot; Waldman, who represented a smaller number of Tamils who arrived last October on another boat, the Ocean Lady, said that terrorist claims had been made then but none substantiated. Professor Rohan Gunaratna, who is advising the Canadian government, said, in an email from his home in Singapore, that the Tamil Tigers had &quot;decided to regroup in Canada where (they) have traditionally raised funds and lobbied politicians that depended on the migrant-diaspora vote.&quot; He claimed there was evidence that the Tamil Tigers had organised the voyage. An opinion poll last month indicated that a majority of Canadians wanted the Tamils to be sent back. &quot;Why such rage directed at such a minuscule group?&quot; asked columnist Stephen Hume in the Vancouver Sun. &quot;Perhaps it&apos;s because they aren&apos;t white ... How we respond to a few Tamils seeking safety and a future for their children says far more about us than it does about them. And what it says so far is rather distasteful.&quot; This provoked a furious reaction. &quot;Gee, could it be that we are sick of being played for Patsies?&quot; was one of the milder responses from readers. &quot;You might sing a different song if your community was flooded with Hindus, Vietnamese, etc who brought such worthy skills with them as drive-by shootings, drug wars, murder of their own wives and daughters,&quot; read another. Poopalapillai, of the CTC, which represents about 200,000 Tamils, mainly in the Toronto area, blamed the Sri Lankan government for raising the spectre of terrorism. &quot;If there are any undesirable residents, put them through due process,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of these folks went through persecution and hostile conditions. The only thing they had in their mind was to save their lives.&quot; Of the opinion poll, he said: &quot;Canada is a very compassionate country but people were not very well informed at the time this poll was taken.&quot; A government spokeswoman said that the average process time for refugee status was 21 months but the hearings this week could lead to the conditional release of at least some of the asylum seekers once their identities had been established."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/12/zero-history-william-gibson-book-review", "sentences": ["In 1993, Wired magazine sent William Gibson to Singapore.", "Singapore, gearing up for its mid-90s boom, was a futuristic technopolis of networked transportation flows and identikit malls, with an authoritarian approach to public policing.", "In Singapore, Gibson found, &quot;The physical past\u2026 has almost entirely vanished.&quot; As the title of his latest novel suggests, Gibson is still interested in the ways that postmodernity flattens history into serviceable narratives, from records of financial data \u2013 a credit check database returns the information that a character has &quot;zero history&quot; \u2013 to brand-formation and marketing strategy."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-11T23:03:18Z", "title": "Zero History by William Gibson | Book review", "tags": ["William Gibson", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "In 1993, Wired magazine sent William Gibson to Singapore. A decade on from the cyberpunk ground zero of Neuromancer, Gibson had just published Virtual Light, the first novel of what would become his second science-fiction trilogy. Singapore, gearing up for its mid-90s boom, was a futuristic technopolis of networked transportation flows and identikit malls, with an authoritarian approach to public policing. The result \u2013 &quot;Disneyland with the death penalty&quot; \u2013 was a witty, perceptive piece of reportage, hinting at a non-fiction talent equal to the vision that had elevated Gibson to digital-age guru. &quot;There was no dirt whatsoever,&quot; he wrote, &quot;no muss, no furred fractal edge to things.&quot; The city-state had all the depth of virtual reality. There was, as Gertrude Stein said of Oakland, no there there. In Singapore, Gibson found, &quot;The physical past\u2026 has almost entirely vanished.&quot; As the title of his latest novel suggests, Gibson is still interested in the ways that postmodernity flattens history into serviceable narratives, from records of financial data \u2013 a credit check database returns the information that a character has &quot;zero history&quot; \u2013 to brand-formation and marketing strategy. Since Pattern Recognition (2003), his novels have dealt not with imagined futures, but with the structured flows of information through the international data economy of the present day. Concluding the story that began in that novel and continued in Spook Country (2007), Zero History is a satisfying and tightly plotted techno-quest for &quot;a MacGuffin of ultimate scale&quot;, following international webs of complicity between military-industrial contracting, fashion branding and financial speculation. Returning from the previous book is Hollis Henry, ex-rock star and now freelance researcher for Hubertus Bigend, a sinister Belgian marketing mogul who reads like a cross between Charles Saatchi and Doctor Mabuse. The effect of Gibson&apos;s shift from speculative to contemporary fiction has been twofold. On the one hand, it has offered him ample opportunity to display the cultural acuity that distinguished the essay for Wired. He has an instinctive understanding of how we use objects, and how technology, whether new or naturalised, colours our interactions with the world. In Zero History&apos;s post-smoking-ban London, for instance, &quot;Some very considerable part of the gestural language of public places, that had once belonged to cigarettes, now belonged to phones.&quot; Later, a character communicating with her children tenderly strokes the touchscreen of her phone. Gibson has always been obsessed with technology and with luxury branding, but such moments of minute observation turn his writing into something more interesting than mere brand fetishism. A layering of narratives means that we see objects and locations from different angles as the story progresses. A room that is the natural habitat of one character seems alien to another; an object is an everyday device or a weird hallucination, depending on who sees it. Readers are vulnerable to the same confusions, meaning that a little too much of Zero History is devoted to expository dialogue about the capabilities of particular devices or the connections between separate elements of its twisting plot. Even so, Gibson knows how to pace a novel, and has enough experience to ensure that the moments of strain are few. Less welcome has been the impoverishment of invention in the Gibsonian present, meaning that most of the interesting technologies that appear here have already made their way virally around the internet. The brand-new Festo AirPenguin \u2013 a kind of robot sphenisciform blimp \u2013 might be worth watching on YouTube, but Zero History makes it the dubious centrepiece of an A-Team style denouement. Worse still is the attention lavished on Apple hardware throughout the book. Gibson used to be a master at inventing names for corporate behemoths manufacturing barely imaginable pieces of futuristic kit: now, his hi-tech has all become iTech. This flatness is the strangest feature of the world of Zero History, and more generally of the trilogy it completes. There&apos;s no question that, taken together, these three books represent one of the first great novels of 21st-century data culture. But there&apos;s no dirt in view \u2013 no muss. The cities of Neuromancer were crumbling into a kipple of obsolete technology, litter and grime. Cyberspace \u2013 clean, rational, clutterless \u2013 offered an alternative reality for those with the skills and the technology to gain access, while the wealthy could escape to exclusive orbital country-club cantons. Now that the future is here, Gibson&apos;s readers, like his protagonists, seem condemned to cities that are all surface, while yearning for a glimpse of something seedier, stickier, more troubling."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/sep/12/dna-research-short-sight-treatment", "sentences": ["In 2008, Kathryn Rose at the University of Sydney looked at rates of short sightedness in Chinese schoolchildren living in Singapore and Sydney.", "Some 29% living in Singapore had short sight, compared with only 3% in Sydney."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-12T17:21:00Z", "title": "Genetic code linked to short sight found", "tags": ["Genetics", "Medical research", "Drugs", "Science", "UK news", "Health", "Health & wellbeing"], "article": "Scientists have discovered strands of genetic code linked to short sight, the most common eye disorder in the world. The findings shed light on what goes awry to make distant objects look blurred, and raises the prospect of developing drugs to prevent the condition. Understanding the biological glitches behind short-sightedness could help researchers develop eye drops or tablets that could be given to children to stop their vision from failing as they get older. Short-sightedness, or myopia, usually starts to manifest early on in life. The extent to which genes are to blame varies, but for those with the worst vision, around 80% of the condition is caused by genetic factors. Two separate studies, published in Nature Genetics journal, found variations in DNA that were more common in people with short sight. Chris Hammond, at King&apos;s College, London, found one section of DNA on chromosome 15 was more common in people with myopia. Caroline Klaver, at Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, found another strand, also on chromosome 15, linked to short sight. The variations in DNA amount to misspellings in the genetic code. These alter the activity of three genes that control the growth of the eyeball and ensure light entering the eye is converted into electrical pulses in the retina. The discovery helps scientists piece together how a healthy eye becomes short-sighted and points the way to medicines to prevent it in children. &quot;My hope is that we can identify a pathway that we can block with eyedrops or tablets that will stop the eye growing too much and without interfering with normal brain development or other processes in the body,&quot; Hammond told the Guardian. Treating short sight in adults is a much tougher job, as their eyeballs have already grown too long. Children who inherit genes for short sight are not destined to have poor vision. In 2008, Kathryn Rose at the University of Sydney looked at rates of short sightedness in Chinese schoolchildren living in Singapore and Sydney. Some 29% living in Singapore had short sight, compared with only 3% in Sydney. One possible explanation is that those living in Sydney spent more time outdoors, and so got more natural sunlight and were used to focusing on more distant objects. Some eye conditions are already being treated by replacing the faulty genes that cause them, but Hammond and Klaver said that too many genes contribute to short sight to make it a realistic option."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/12/jenson-button-lewis-hamilton-italian-grand-prix", "sentences": ["But we got a good result and hopefully we will be as strong as this in Singapore.&quot; McLaren&apos;s team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, said: &quot;Jenson did a fantastic job.", "The important thing is that Lewis jumps out of bed tomorrow, gets into training and focuses on Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-12T21:30:00Z", "title": "McLaren rue errors after Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton lose ground", "tags": ["McLaren", "Jenson Button", "Lewis Hamilton", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "McLaren left Italy tonight cursing the mistakes that could cost Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button dearly in the world title race.

The championship is not over, but it&apos;s mistakes like I made today that lose world championships. It did not go according to plan. These things happen.

Viewed from the driving seat, Lewis would not be the great racing driver he is if he did not go for it. That&apos;s what he did and with hindsight\u00a0 he wishes he had not gone for it quite as much, and so do we. You have to go out and race.

But if you are, would you really want to buy one from a company that&apos;s been responsible for one of the biggest recent environmental cock-ups on the planet or one that&apos;s up to its neck in the arms trade? No of course you wouldn&apos;t. To help shoppers navigate this particular ethical-minefield in its latest buyers&apos; guide, Ethical Consumer magazine has identified those solar-power panels that you can stick on your roof with a clean conscience and those that you may just want to leave on the shelf. The best buys are GB-Sol, Solarcentury, SolarWorld and Yingli Solar. We found that the industry is dominated by three key issues. The first of these are what we call controversial activities. For example, as well as redecorating the Gulf of Mexico with millions of tonnes of oil, BP also laughingly now makes solar-power panels. It will come as no great shock then that BP came bottom in our table. It is perhaps less well known that a number of solar-power panel companies are heavily involved in the defence industry. Mitsubishi supplies everything from computers to satellites to the military around the world. While Romag supplies glass products to both the Israeli defence force and the Singapore army. Since the manufacture of solar-power panels involves the use of hazardous materials, toxic pollution is another key issue. In 2008 the Chinese company Luoyang Zhonggui High Technology, which makes polysilicon for solar-power panels, was accused of dumping toxic waste outside its factory. The same company was reported to be a supplier of one of the companies that we surveyed in our buyers&apos; guide. Finally given the toxic nature of the manufacturing process of solar-power panels, it&apos;s vital that the workers involved are adequately protected and aren&apos;t exposed to undue health risks. Disappointingly the vast majority of the companies that we surveyed failed to guarantee that such policies were in place. The result was that virtually every company we surveyed received a bottom rating for their supply chain policy. The one notable exception was perhaps surprisingly, the Chinese company Yingli, which scored a middle rating because it is alone in adopting an internationally recognised management system for protecting workers&apos; rights, the SA8000. As consumers we have a vital role to play in helping to drive sustainable manufacturing within the solar-power panel industry by choosing the best-performing companies. When it comes to to getting your solar-power panels fitted you won&apos;t be buying directly from any of the companies that we surveyed. Instead the system will be installed by a company approved by the microgeneration certification scheme. These companies will probably offer you the choice of one or two different systems but if these are from dodgy companies and you don&apos;t want to use either of them, stick to your principles and insist on a more ethical option. The chances are that the company will ultimately agree and if not, don&apos;t worry as the market is now growing so rapidly that you&apos;ll easily find an approved installer who&apos;ll fit the solar-power panels of your choice. The sun will indeed shine on the righteous \u2013 and the ethical. \u2022 Simon Birch writes for Ethical Consumer Magazine."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/13/jenson-button-mclaren-formula-one", "sentences": ["It wasn&apos;t deliberate on his part.&quot; Hamilton, whose mistake yesterday when he collided with Massa on the opening lap cost him the lead in the championship, is looking forward to the next race, in Singapore.", "&quot;But I can&apos;t wait to get back to Singapore \u2013 I love that track."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-13T21:30:37Z", "title": "I have to race aggressively to win the title, says Jenson Button", "tags": ["Jenson Button", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "There are times when Jenson Button appears so easy-going he looks incapable of even faking aggression on McLaren&apos;s famous race simulator in Woking.

There are two guys who can still afford to have a bad race \u2013 Mark [Webber] and Lewis [Hamilton] \u2013 but the rest of us can&apos;t. But obviously we can&apos;t sit back and hope for a good result either. We have to be aggressive. &quot;Its a very tricky situation. When you&apos;ve actually won a championship you don&apos;t sit back and wait; you take the risks. It&apos;s more exciting. Last year I was in a position where I couldn&apos;t take risks and I had to be consistent and just get points. &quot;This year it&apos;s completely different. First of all I&apos;m chasing but I&apos;ve won a championship. I want to win another one obviously. I want to go out there and be aggressive and that&apos;s exactly what I&apos;m going to be.

I&apos;m going to be aggressive towards the end of the season.&quot; Despite Fernando Alonso&apos;s third victory at Monza, Button says the Red Bull cars remain the big danger to McLaren. &quot;In terms of pace it&apos;s Red Bull, in terms of consistency I would say it&apos;s us,&quot; was how he described the season so far. &quot;Red Bull are still the biggest threat, not Fernando.&quot; Button has also conceded that his pit stop to change tyres was too slow at 4.2sec \u2013 the Ferraris of Alonso and Felipe Massa changed in 3.4sec and 3.3sec respectively. &quot;Our pit stop was not quite quick enough. Plus I lost time on pit entry by locking up, which put it into anti-stall, which means I couldn&apos;t see how fast I was going.&quot; Button added: &quot;It&apos;s great to be back in there. Obviously 25 points would have been nicer than 18 but when you don&apos;t have the quickest car everything has to be perfect. It was so mentally draining that race, knowing Fernando was faster. Any sort of mistake and he would have passed me. The damage he caused when he knocked my rear wing might have meant he was faster but we&apos;ll never know. It wasn&apos;t deliberate on his part.&quot; Hamilton, whose mistake yesterday when he collided with Massa on the opening lap cost him the lead in the championship, is looking forward to the next race, in Singapore. &quot;I&apos;ve got to start a clean slate,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve got to recover from this. I&apos;ve got to keep doing what I have been doing in the past. I&apos;ve got to finish the next five races. Because I can&apos;t afford weekends like this. &quot;But it all happened so fast. It&apos;s ridiculous how quick that happened. But that&apos;s what we love about motor racing. It&apos;s what I love about racing.

There isn&apos;t much nearby. Java is 2,000km west, and other Indonesian islands are a protracted, bobbing boat trip away. An almost entirely Muslim population of around 15,000 clings to these beautiful volcanic rocks, the oceans plunging 6km beneath them. Waves lap the white beaches and sea winds buffet the palms. If it wasn&apos;t for nutmeg, nobody would have heard of the Bandas. Nutmeg was these islands&apos; making, breaking and remaking. The spice very likely evolved here, and for centuries this was the only place it grew on the planet. The luckless archipelago has therefore suffered an importance in wild disproportion to its size, tossed and tussled over by European powers since its &quot;discovery&quot; in the 16th century. Run, the smallest island, had the hardest time of it, flicking between English and Dutch control like a metronome.Nutmeg is the rarest of spices. Its woody balls are the stones or pips of fruits that plump from the nutmeg tree, the beautifully named Myristica fragrans. You can eat the fruit, too, if you&apos;re lucky enough to get it: in Sulawesi they sugar it, then dry it in the sun so it partially ferments. It&apos;s said to taste a bit like crystallised ginger. Mace is the vividly red, lacy covering that creeps like ivy round the nutmeg stone. The trees can live to 100 and will yield up to 20,000 nutmegs a season, but that fecundity has never lowered the cost of the spice. The history of nutmeg is remarkable and illuminating. By the sixth century, the spice had reached Byzantium, 12,000km away. Around 1,000AD, the Persian physician Ibn Sina described the &quot;jansi ban&quot; or Banda nut. The Arabs traded nutmeg through the dark and middle ages, latterly funnelling it through Venice to season the tables of the European aristocracy. It was always fantastically expensive: a 14th-century German price table reveals that a pound of it cost as much as &quot;seven fat oxen&quot;. It&apos;s no exaggeration to say that the hunt for nutmeg helped build the modern commercial world. In 1453, the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople (modern Istanbul), embargoing trade across the sole sliver of land through which a few merchants had evaded the Arab-Venetian spice monopoly and forcing Europeans to find new eastern trade routes. Columbus sailed the blue Atlantic looking for a passage to India; and Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1497, his men charging on to the shores of Kerala crying, &quot;For Christ and spices!&quot; The Portuguese military genius Afonso de Albuquerque annexed the Indonesian Molucca islands, of which the Bandas form part, in 1511. The fortresses he built there established and then consolidated a Portuguese monopoly over the world&apos;s nutmeg that lasted almost a whole cushy century. But nutmeg was always worth fighting for. The Dutch East India Company (VOC), that most scrupulous and fair-minded of organisations, seized all but one of the Bandas in the early 1600s, swiftly enslaving the native occupants. In 1603, the English gained a toehold in the trade by arranging to export Run&apos;s nutmeg, seemingly without force or guile. The Dutch and English then fought skirmishes, punctuated by faltering truces, over tiny Run for the next 60 years. Eventually, they settled on a compromise. The English agreed to &quot;swap&quot; Run for a Dutch holding in the far west, a fur trading post named Manhattan ... The Netherlanders enforced their nutmeg monopoly with paranoid brutality, banning the export of the trees, drenching every nutmeg in lime before shipping to render it infertile, and imposing the death penalty on anyone suspected of stealing, growing or selling nutmegs elsewhere. When some Bandanese failed to appreciate the VOC&apos;s God-given right to control the nutmeg trade \u2013 it&apos;s possible the islanders hadn&apos;t understood the &quot;contract&quot; to which they&apos;d &quot;agreed&quot; \u2013 the then head of the Company, Jan Pieterszoon Coen, ordered the systematic quartering and beheading of every Bandanese male over the age of 15. The population of the Banda islands was around 15,000 when the VOC arrived. 15 years later, it was 600. With this militarised vision of ruthless capitalism, the VOC became the richest corporation in the world. By 1669 it was paying its shareholders an annual dividend of 40% while sustaining 50,000 employees, 10,000 soldiers and around 200 ships, many armed. The Dutch perpetuated their nutmeg monopoly by obdurate force and pathological secrecy, never revealing to traders the islands&apos; location. Then, in 1769, the impeccably named Pierre Poivre, a kind of roving French horticulturalist somewhere between the Scarlet Pimpernel and Alan Titchmarsh, swooped on to the archipelago under the noses of the Dutch and smuggled out nutmegs and nutmeg trees. The French planted the seeds on their colony Mauritius, and the Dutch monopoly was broken. Finally, the British occupied the islands from 1796 to 1802, and were then able to grow nutmeg in Penang and Singapore and thereafter in their other possessions. The Caribbean island of Grenada, a longstanding British colony, eventually became the world&apos;s second leading nutmeg exporter.  What made nutmeg so captivating, so costly, for so long? One factor was its sheer rarity: you can see a similar effect today in \u00a310,000-a-kilo beluga caviar and in a few red wines glugged mainly by boorish oligarchs. But nutmeg was always more than a flavouring. In its early history, like most spices, the Arabs traded it as scent, aphrodisiac and medicine. During the Black Death, nutmeg commanded hysterical prices because desperate people believed it might ward off plague. Perhaps it did: fleas seem to dislike (pdf) the smell of nutmeg, so it&apos;s just possible that someone carrying the spice might have avoided that fatal, final bite. But the old apothecaries were more cautious with nutmeg than with other spices. The Salerno School, the leading European medical establishment during the early Middle Ages, decreed: &quot;One nut is good for you, the second will do you harm, the third will kill you.&quot; That isn&apos;t strictly true, but in large doses nutmeg can be intoxicating. Its oil contains myristicin: in large doses this acts as a deliriant, while causing palpitations, convulsions, nausea, dehydration and pain. It&apos;s fatal to a number of animals, including dogs. In the appendix to Naked Lunch, William Burroughs&apos;s hilarious, spasmodic and harrowing novel of excess and ecstasy, he writes that South American &quot;medicine men&quot; snorted powdered nutmeg to &quot;go into convulsive states. Their twitchings and mutterings are thought to have prophetic significance.&quot; Malcolm X described US prisoners taking nutmeg in his autobiography; the authorities soon discovered and banned the practice. Nutmeg&apos;s hallucinogenic reputation survives, and thanks to the wonders of modern technology we can all join the most boring party in the world by watching videos of gangly teenagers trying to get high on it. Most of the time it doesn&apos;t work, but some thrillseekers report positive effects, while this gothy emo type declares woozily after his dose, &quot;I can&apos;t really feel my heart and my back hurts a little bit.&quot; Heroin, move over. Historically, mace was more common in cooking: it tended to be cheaper than nutmeg because it&apos;s rather more pungent, as well as easier to sell in small quantities. 16th and 17th century French fl\u00e2neurs would commission engraved portable nutmeg graters: they&apos;d bring these to dinner parties and get down to some fashionable sprinkling. But the French taste for nutmeg fell away in later centuries, and now, in that cuisine, the spice is largely restricted to white sauces such as b\u00e9chamel. Thanks to Venice, the Italians still have a taste for nutmeg, particularly in Tuscany.  The Dutch, who had time to get to know nutmeg, add it to most of their vegetable dishes. It&apos;s also popular in Qu\u00e9bec, that gastronomically forsaken province which retains a number of eating habits from 17th century France. The spice is popular in historical spheres of Moorish influence but not, oddly, in India. In England, nutmegs are essential to the spiced foods of Christmas, to custard tarts and to the mealy, stodgy brood of national puddings. It has an affinity with cinnamon and can often take its place, and I like it with \u2013 but not instead of \u2013 chocolate on a cappuccino. It&apos;s lovely in mashed potato.  Of course, the spice is almost universally available today, and not particularly expensive. Dinky, rattling jars on supermarket shelves don&apos;t begin to hint at its past, and most people grate it without a thought. But the story of food can sometimes be the story of humanity, and nowhere does that seem more true than in the case of nutmeg, the headiest, most alluring, most blood-soaked of the spices."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/15/afghanistan-election-violence-un-evacuation", "sentences": ["In the last week Singapore-based Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL) has already repatriated more than half of its observers because of difficulties finding a security company prepared to provide armed guard to election monitors who need to be able to roam around polling stations."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-15T18:53:05Z", "title": "Afghanistan election violence fears lead UN to evacuate third of staff", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "United Nations", "World news"], "article": "The UN has evacuated about a third of its permanent international workforce from Afghanistan amid fears that this weekend&apos;s parliamentary elections will be marred by violence and fraud. The exodus of roughly 300 staff deemed non-essential to preparations for Saturday&apos;s poll is ongoing, with most staff expected to remain out of the country for a week. Those who stay behind will be under draconian security restrictions, including bans on movement around Kabul. The decision highlights the risks to international organisations involved in the election, nearly all of whom have scaled back their efforts to monitor voting compared with their presence during the August 2009 presidential election, which was wrecked by electoral fraud. Safety concerns are especially acute at the UN after five staff were killed when a guesthouse accommodating election workers in Kabul was attacked following the first round of voting in last year&apos;s election. &quot;It would be naive not to take these precautions as we are a target,&quot; said Staffan de Mistura, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan. &quot;We are going to be particularly careful as the Taliban have announced they will attack anyone involved in this election and we are very much involved.&quot; Mistura said the organisation expected an increase in violence surrounding the election but denied that the departure of 300 staff constituted an evacuation. &quot;Many of them were already due to go on holiday while others were told to take their holidays now,&quot; said Mistura. The &quot;reduction of the footprint&quot; of permanent staff has also created space for some 171 election specialists who have come into the country to help the UN, he said. Already this has been Afghanistan&apos;s most violent election campaign according to Nader Nadery, the chairman of the Free and Fair Election Foundation Afghanistan (FEFA). The organisation has recorded details of more than 240 security incidents in the last two months, including various attacks on politicians, such as the five volunteers campaigning for a female candidate in Herat province who were murdered by the Taliban. Tensions have been further raised by Afghan outrage over the unfulfilled threat by a pastor in Florida to burn Qur&apos;ans last weekend. In clashes in Kabul today between police, and protesters chanting &quot;death to America&quot;, at least one protester killed and five others injured. The main international monitoring groups have drastically reduced their efforts, with some organisations abandoning attempts to mount full &quot;observation&quot; missions, opting instead for less thorough &quot;assessments&quot;, which will probably lead to only a muted condemnation of any fraud. Nearly all groups are cutting the number of foreign electoral experts and housing those that do come in Kabul or other relatively safe areas of the country. The International Republican Institute, a US democracy group with a long-term presence in the country, has cut its foreign observers by around half to just five while increasing the number of Afghan observers from 40 to 160. In the last week Singapore-based Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL) has already repatriated more than half of its observers because of difficulties finding a security company prepared to provide armed guard to election monitors who need to be able to roam around polling stations. Charles Supriedi, the ANFREL mission director, said that a recent presidential ruling restricting armed private guards has forced the group to slash its foreign observers from 74 to 30, who will deploy to 11 provinces rather than the originally planned 21. The most dramatic contraction is that of the EU, which last year fielded a 120-strong observation team and got into a furious row with the government over fraud. This year it has just seven experts taking part in an assessment mission. Most of the burden for monitoring the election will fall to FEFA, which is fielding some 7,000 Afghan volunteers. However, Nadery said the organisation would only attempt to cover 65% of the country&apos;s 5,897 polling stations. He warned that the absence of foreign observers would make the work of his volunteers more dangerous. &quot;The added value of international observers is that as well as providing technical support we do not have to stand alone if anybody wants to put pressure on us or threaten our work,&quot; he said. The sharp reduction in foreign observers comes at time of growing anxiety that electoral fraud could match the extraordinary levels of corruption that surrounded last year&apos;s presidential poll where at least 1.2 million votes were illegal. Some efforts have been made to strengthen the Independent Election Commission, the body that oversaw last year&apos;s fiasco, and to introduce anti-fraud measures, the most striking of which was the decision to not open almost 900 polling stations in the most insecure areas where effective oversight is impossible."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/sep/18/londons-best-bandbs", "sentences": ["A very spacious bathroom has a good shower, dressing gowns from Singapore and more interesting art."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-17T23:06:25Z", "title": "London's best B&Bs", "tags": ["Bed and breakfasts", "Travel", "London holidays", "Europe holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Hotels", "England holidays"], "article": "Chelsea In a quiet street facing the Chelsea Arts Club is an enticing, contemporary haven.

What they could smell was a length of crisp-skinned, charred, dense, pink, meaty andouillette, made from folds of pig gut rolled in on itself. Except that description doesn&apos;t really do it, for the andouillette is a culinary object in a very select category, the one marked &quot;really bloody stinky&quot;. And I say this as a man who loves them. Put bluntly, andouillette smells like a farmyard. Before anybody has bothered to come along and clean it. It is a smell so strong, so intense, so utterly boisterous that you can almost taste it (even though the flavour on the tongue is merely of a ripe porkiness). Even I accept it has revolting qualities, a hit that speaks of decay. My wife calls it poo sausage; I don&apos;t argue. But that&apos;s what I and people like me \u2013 and there are a few \u2013 love about it. Eating an andouillette is an experience that pounds the senses.

I adore Korean pickled vegetables that have been incarcerated for so long they are beginning to fizz, game birds hung until their butts are blue, and of course offals many and various. To my mind these are some of the very best food experiences precisely because (not in spite of the fact that) they hover on that very fine line between safe for human consumption and not. As far as I&apos;m concerned, a really good dinner is one that carries with it the faint whiff of death. I can see how some would see this as merely a kind of gastronomic adventurism. Or, as your parents might describe it, shameless showing off. It&apos;s not. It&apos;s simply a product of extended development. As kids we have tender, fearful palettes. We disdain certain foods \u2013 salty olives or blue cheeses fractured with mould. But as we grow up our tastes widen. We meet strange new foods, try them and like them. It was olives that fell first with me, just before my 10th birthday, followed by a slippery Brie de Meaux, running away across a shiny walnut board. It took me another decade before I realised salted anchovies would be a friend for ever. The difference between me and others is that my tastes continued to widen. There were peppery tripe stews with the whiff of gut, kidneys with the slight aroma of the substances they filter, heady cheeses with a stench which would probably cause them to be banned from public transport in Singapore. And of course the noble, reeking andouillette. The important thing is that I shouldn&apos;t be dissuaded by the squeamishness of others, that I should carry on eating this stuff, even as people turn from me \u2013 and hope that one day my son will stop being one of them; that I will finally get him to try one. Some people might call that cruel and unusual punishment. Some might call it gratuitous. I call it good parenting. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/sep/19/jenson-button-f1-title", "sentences": ["It is when the clamorous circus goes long haul after the European season and prepares for its climax, this year in Singapore next Sunday, followed by Japan, Korea, Brazil and Abu Dhabi.", "I think we&apos;ve seen that no one driver&apos;s going to walk away with the world title.&quot; But Singapore will have special significance for McLaren and Button because it will be the first time since Hungary that they will be running on a track with the low speeds and high downforce that have so favoured Red Bull.", "&quot;Singapore will be a very interesting weekend because I think it&apos;ll give us a clearer idea of the destiny of the world championship,&quot; Button says."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-18T23:06:28Z", "title": "Jenson Button keeps his cool as fight for F1 title intensifies | Paul Weaver", "tags": ["Jenson Button", "McLaren", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "In Formula One they call them &quot;the flyaways&quot;. It is when the clamorous circus goes long haul after the European season and prepares for its climax, this year in Singapore next Sunday, followed by Japan, Korea, Brazil and Abu Dhabi. This year&apos;s irresistible championship can be seen as a contest between the fastest car (Red Bull) and the most reliable (McLaren), although with three wins, including in the last race in Italy, Fernando Alonso may well claim that he and his Ferrari have had more than a drive\u2011on part in this noisy drama. Mark Webber and Lewis Hamilton remain the favourites of the five drivers who could take the title, although things tightened considerably after Monza. They are followed in the bookies&apos; windows by Sebastian Vettel and Alonso. Jenson Button is the last among equals, quoted as generously as 16-1 to retain his world championship. Yet if anyone decided to base his prediction on a combination of the most reliable car and the most dependable driver he would end up clutching Button&apos;s name. After last Sunday&apos;s race even Italian journalists conceded that Button had been the best driver on the day, not Alonso. The Spaniard&apos;s season has been plagued by driver errors, most notably in China, where he jumped the start, and in Monaco, where he crashed his car before the race and had to start from the back. Hamilton made a basic error on the very first lap at Monza and, as for the Red Bull pair, Vettel has made so many mistakes that Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team principal, dubbed him the &quot;Crash Kid&quot;, while the smoother and more reliable Webber is best remembered this year for driving into the back of Heikki Kovalainen at Valencia, with spectacular results. Button, though, has been error-free. A number of iffy performances in qualifying have confirmed the notion that he does need to be in a car that is perfectly set up for him, but in race mode Button has been superb. His drive to stay in front of the faster Alonso on Sunday was a piece of high-speed craftsmanship of the highest quality. He can be forgiven his lock-up as he came into the pits. Ultimately, it was the timing of that stop, and the fact that it took almost a second longer than Alonso&apos;s, which cost him the race. Button says on his website: &quot;You can&apos;t help but look at the drivers&apos; championship table and just think: &apos;Wow, how can it be so close?&apos; It&apos;s funny \u2013 after Spa, everyone was saying it was a two-horse race between Lewis and Mark, but I can easily see this championship going right down to the last race. I think we&apos;ve seen that no one driver&apos;s going to walk away with the world title.&quot; But Singapore will have special significance for McLaren and Button because it will be the first time since Hungary that they will be running on a track with the low speeds and high downforce that have so favoured Red Bull. &quot;Singapore will be a very interesting weekend because I think it&apos;ll give us a clearer idea of the destiny of the world championship,&quot; Button says. &quot;A lot has changed since that race in Budapest \u2013 not least some quite hefty revisions to the rulebook regarding bodywork flexibility and, additionally, a lot of work by the engineers at the MTC [McLaren Technology Centre] to ensure our car is now better suited to slower circuits.&quot; If Button can maintain the recent improvements to his qualifying times, while continuing to avoid making mistakes on Sunday afternoons, he could still emerge as a surprise winner of a very special championship."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/21/airline-industry-profit-uk-carriers-losses", "sentences": ["IATA said the strong performance of Asia-Pacific carriers, such as Singapore Airlines, was driven by strong export sales that had, in turn, boosted freight revenues as commercial flights shipped tonnes of goods as well as passengers."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-21T19:18:44Z", "title": "Airline industry in profit but UK carriers hit by disputes", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Travel & leisure", "British Airways", "Business", "UK news", "Europe"], "article": "British airlines are set for another underwhelming year despite new forecasts that the global industry will soar to a profit of nearly $9bn (\u00a35.8bn) in 2010 \u2013 compared to a loss of some $10bn last year. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said that the UK \u2013 Europe&apos;s largest air travel market \u2013 was lagging behind its peers in the US and Asia due to a weak economy and the impact of passenger taxes. According to IATA, the global airline business will record a profit of $8.9bn this year, up from a previous forecast of $2.5bn. However, the financial performance would have been even better were it not for Europe, which is expected to post a loss of $1.3bn. And IATA singled out the UK as the weakest performer on the continent. &quot;The UK markets are pretty much the weakest in Europe,&quot; said Brian Pearce, the IATA&apos;s chief economist. &quot;We have not really seen much of a pick-up at all in passenger numbers, which is a reflection of the recession in Britain and perhaps higher travel costs because of air passenger duty.&quot; Last year, UK airports saw the biggest fall in passenger numbers since records began, as traffic fell by 7.3% to 218 million. Pearce said he did not expect the UK market, which generates annual passenger revenues of around $40bn \u2013 to grow &quot;much at all&quot; this year. The stress on UK airlines is most evident in the case of its national carrier, British Airways (BA), which has generated a pre-tax loss of nearly \u00a31bn over the past two years and is locked in a dispute with cabin crew as it strives to pare down costs. The trade union embroiled in the BA dispute, Unite, is also suing another loss-making British carrier, Bmi, in a row over a staff pay freeze. However, IATA predicted better news for BA&apos;s international rivals in 2010. It said two regions would provide most of the industry&apos;s profits, forecasting a surplus of $3.5bn for North America and $5.2bn in the Asia-Pacific area. &quot;The differences between regions to a large part reflect their relative economic performance \u2013 and Europe has been so poor. The European population just doesn&apos;t want to travel given the economic uncertainties at home.&quot; The bounceback, in the US market in particular, has been driven by higher average fares \u2013 due to cuts in capacity that have spread demand across fewer seats. IATA said the strong performance of Asia-Pacific carriers, such as Singapore Airlines, was driven by strong export sales that had, in turn, boosted freight revenues as commercial flights shipped tonnes of goods as well as passengers. &quot;With Asia we have seen tremendous growth in the cargo business. Asia is exporting a lot and Asian airlines rely heavily on freight revenues. For some airlines, it represents 40% of turnover,&quot; said Pearce. IATA warned that renewed confidence across the industry will have an impact next year as a glut of aeroplane orders drives down fares and profits. Around 1,400 new jets are expected to join the 24,000-strong global fleet in 2011, representing a 6% increase in seats. Demand would increase by 5% next year, IATA said, creating a discrepancy between supply and demand that will put downward pressure on yields \u2013 or average fares. Pearce said Europe would be one of the worst-affected markets, with carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair still receiving streams of fresh aircraft. &quot;A lot of that capacity is coming into Europe. And that is one of the reasons why Europe is finding the going quite hard,&quot; he said. IATA expects global profits to fall next year to $5.3bn, with Europe breaking even. Average fares across the industry, which are forecast to rise by more than 7% this year, are expected to be flat. One consolation for airlines was provided by forecasts for fuel costs, which can fluctuate wildly and account for a quarter of airline expenditure. IATA said it did not expect fuel prices to deviate substantially from the current range of around $88 per barrel. A sharp spike in fuel costs in 2008 saw the industry swing from a profit of $14.7bn the year before to a loss of $36.1bn."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/sep/22/commonwealth-games-2010-crisis-live-coverage", "sentences": ["Australian and Canadian squads are in Singapore and the British in Doha, suggesting another Asian meet could be hastily organised."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-22T10:16:10Z", "title": "Commonwealth Games in crisis \u2013 live", "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2010", "India", "Delhi holidays", "Athletics", "Sport", "UK news", "Commonwealth Games"], "article": " 11.07am: The opening ceremony of the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games is just 11 days away.

Officials arriving at the athletes&apos; village found rooms in the \u00a3150m development on the outskirts of this city of 17 million people to be &quot;unsafe and unfit for human habitation&quot;. Worse still, 23 labourers were injured when a pedestrian bridge linking the athletes&apos; car park to the main stadium collapsed. Today a ceiling collapsed in the weightlifting arena and the chairman of England&apos;s athletics team said the squad&apos;s participation was &quot;on a knife-edge&quot;. Please post your thoughts and information below. Or you can email me at at steve.busfield@guardian.co.uk. Or you can tweet me @Busfield  11.37am: Latest update from the Press Association:   Team Wales have given Commonwealth Games organisers a deadline of this evening to confirm all venues and the Games Village are fit for purpose...It is not yet clear what action Team Wales will take if the deadline is not met but representatives of the English and Scottish teams have admitted withdrawal from the Games is a possibility.  A Team Wales statement read: &quot;The health and safety of our team has always been our top priority - which is why we&apos;ve been so desperate to resolve the issues in the Games Village. &quot;With yesterday&apos;s news of the bridge collapse and now the roof of the weightlifting venue, we have to take a step back and examine how safe it is to bring athletes into this environment. We have given the Organising Committee a deadline of this evening to confirm if all venues and the Games Village are fit for purpose. On the basis of that announcement, we will be contacting athletes via our team managers and advise them of the latest position and will issue a further update.&quot;    11.51am: Other Guardian Commonwealth Games coverage you may also be interested in:\u2022 Jason Burke&apos;s on-the-spot report from Delhi.\u2022 English athletes, including Christine Ohuruogu and Phillips Idowu, drop out.\u2022 Explosives taken into Commonwealth Games stadium, claims TV sting.  11.59am: We have a poll: Do you think that the Games should go ahead?  12.01pm: Here is James Meickle&apos;s report with more details on this morning&apos;s events, including the roof collapse at the weightlifting arena.  12.04pm: After criticising the accommodation yesterday, Team Scotland have delayed the departure of their first athletes to the Commonwealth Games, chairman Michael Cavanagh confirmed today. Scotland&apos;s first party of 41 athletes and staff in the sports of boxing, rugby sevens and wrestling will now not be travelling tomorrow as previously scheduled. Cavanagh said: &quot;By delaying the arrival of our athletes by a few days, we hope to give the Delhi 2010 Organising Committee the necessary time to address the concerns that have been raised by both the Commonwealth Games Federation and the countries which arrived early.&quot;  But European 110 metres hurdles champion Andy Turner is still planning to head to India. The English athlete told BBC Radio Five Live:   I&apos;ll be going. I&apos;m looking forward to it. Obviously I&apos;ve had my concerns - the things in the press about the village and the bridge collapsing - but for me it&apos;s a chance to further my athletics career so I&apos;m going to take every opportunity I get. I&apos;ve literally just heard what everybody else has heard. I&apos;m confident that by the time I get out there - I don&apos;t even get to Delhi until October 4 - I&apos;m confident by that time everything&apos;s going to be absolutely fine.  This view would chime with those who argue that these sorts of stories appear before almost every major sporting event. The bridge collapse would appear to be a little out of the ordinary though.  12.13pm: The Times of India has some footage of the problems at the stadium, including the ceiling collapse at the weightlifting venue. The footage is far from definitive, but if that shaky image is actually the &quot;ceiling collapse&quot; it appears to be relatively minor, although not insignificant.  12.15pm: Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit has dismissed talk of abandoning the Games, saying that recent events are &quot;minor glitches&quot;.   Do not make it look like the whole thing has collapsed. They are not insurmountable problems. For the past month there have been incessant rains. Sure it is a problem, but not a major one.      \t \t \t \t \t    12.27pm: Here is some video of the bridge that collapsed and footage inside some of the accommodation which is &apos;unfit for human habitation&apos;  12.50pm: Our Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell reports:      Severin Carrell. Photograph: Frank Baron/The Guardian    A source close to the organisers of the Glasgow Commonwealth games in 2014 played down fears that the Scotland squad might pull out entirely because of the clear risks to the games&apos; reputation and to Scotland&apos;s reputation as the next hosts of the event. He admitted, however, that individual athletes may independently decide not to travel, since events were moving so quickly in Delhi. But he added that since the games had not yet begun, it was still too early to judge whether it was a success or not. He said: &quot;It&apos;s a given we will be demonstrating our support for the games in Delhi, by being there. Short of travel advice changing from the Foreign Office, that&apos;s not going to change.&quot; The Glasgow games organisers, including the Commonwealth games&apos; executives and senior figures in Glasgow city council, will be heavily represented in Delhi. The council leader, Gordon Matheson, and the Lord Provost Bob Winter are due to attend the final days of the games for the official handover in the closing ceremony on October 14, where 348 performers from Scotland will take part in a mass dance routine. Winter will be handed the official games&apos; flag on behalf of Glasgow.  1.01pm: Of course, the Commonwealth Games are not just about infrastructure and accommodation.

Australian and Canadian squads are in Singapore and the British in Doha, suggesting another Asian meet could be hastily organised.   1.12pm: Here is a short list of athletes who are not going (far from comprehensive, English unless otherwise stated, and most not because of recent events in Delhi):Phillips Idowu, triple jumper, safety concernsChristine Ohuruogu, 400m runner, injuryLisa Dobriskey, 1,500m runner, injuryChris Hoy, Scotland, cycylist, tournament clashVictoria Pendleton, cyclist, tournament clashJessica Ennis, heptathleteDani Samuels, Australia, discus thrower, safety concernsUsain Bolt, Jamaica, sprinterShelly-Ann Fraser, Jamaica, sprinterPaula Radcliffe, marathon runnerBeth Tweddle, gymnastAsbel Kiprop, Kenya, 1,500m runner  1.27pm: For some slightly light relief, here&apos;s a link I&apos;ve been sent to an Armando Iannucci show about the dangers of inadequate building materials. There is no suggestion that the Delhi footbridge was made of paper.  1.36pm: Here is a gallery of images from Delhi as workers race to get venues ready in time.  1.37pm: The Hindustan Times reports the health and safety concerns of the South African team:   South Africa&apos;s top sports administrator said on Wednesday he feared his athletes could contract dengue fever at the Commonwealth Games as he gave a withering assessment on the athletes&apos; village. Tubby Reddy, head of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee, should receive a report from a team of safety inspectors later on Wednesday who will recommend whether the team should travel to New Delhi. But Reddy&apos;s initial verdict added further pressure on the organisers of the troubled tournament, which is due to begin in the Indian capital on October 3. &quot;We&apos;ve been concerned for a while now,&quot; Reddy told AFP. &quot;The athlete&apos;s village is not adequately ready and there are questions about sanitation. The general area is full of sludge, rubble and water due to monsoon rains, and we are worried about mosquito-related dengue fever.&quot; Reddy said he was now awaiting the full verdict of his fact-finding team before his organisation would make its own recommendations on whether to travel although a final decision would be left to the South African government. &quot;We sent in an inspection team last week and are due to get that final report today,&quot; he said. &quot;Once we have the report today, we&apos;ll report back and the government of our country will decide.&quot;   1.50pm: The bookmakers William Hill have cut their odds on the Commonwealth Games failing to start on schedule from 5-1 to 3-1 after a &quot;concerted gamble&quot; during the last 48 hours. They also offer 2-1 that one or more England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will officially pull out of the Games before their scheduled start date, writes Sean Ingle.  1.55pm: The latest from our correspondent in Delhi, Jason Burke:   Local officials are still reassuring everybody that all will be fine. They say that the bridge collapse was a minor incident. Another potential problem is if the Yamuna River bursts its banks. Huge amounts of rainwater have been released in states upstream. Levels in the Yamuna River have already led to some bridges being closed. If the river does flood, the athletes&apos; village is likely to find itself becoming an island in a sea of muddy water.   2.14pm: Here&apos;s an intriguing piece written by Indian blogger AmreekanDesi, headlined &quot;Open Letter To [Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive] Mike Hooper&quot;:  A good guest is nice to the host. You sleep where we put you. You eat what we feed you. No we-are-from-a-developed-country crap there. But you are behaving like that NRI (Non-Resident Indian) who visits his family in India and then complains about the coir mattresses and power cuts.... ...And what did you say about the village? Filthy and Uninhabitable? Do you know how much we sold those apartments for? And do you know how quickly they got lapped up by the people of this city? It is probably your mind that is filthy and uninhabitable... ...Did you guys come to our country to play games, or for 5 star luxury? We thought you wanted us to portray the real India. Now that we&apos;ve worked so hard at fulfilling your wish why are you turning Chicken?   2.31pm: CTV News in Toronto reports that Canada&apos;s participation in the Games is in doubt:  Canada&apos;s Commonwealth Games committee has formally declared &quot;serious concerns&quot; about the state of the athletes&apos; village. Scott Stevenson, Commonwealth Games Canada&apos;s director of sport: &quot;We are deeply concerned that the condition of the residence facilities is not at all what we expected, nor anything like what was promised.&quot; Stevenson said there were also issues with plumbing, wiring and Internet and mobile telephone coverage, and asked the organizing committee to have these issues resolved immediately. &quot;We are working very closely with Games organizers, the CGF, the Canadian High Commission, and our colleagues from other countries to try to resolve these issues as thoroughly and as efficiently as possible.&quot;    2.49pm: Here are some headlines and leaders from the Asian press (via BBC News): &quot;Commonwealth Games India&apos;s Shame&quot; - The Times of India. &quot;Double whammy of embarrassment and humiliation&quot; - The Indian Express &quot;A huge setback for the organisers&quot; - The Hindu &quot;The embattled organisers of the scandal-marred Commonwealth Games will have a lot of explaining to do to their international boss Michael Fennell when he arrives in New Delhi&quot; - DNA India  2.49pm: The top two trending tweets on the #CWG Twitter hashtag:  @swimfastrehan: &quot;will there ever be any light at the end of the tunnel for CWG,or has the tunnel collapsed as well!!!!!&quot; @offstumped: &quot;The CWG fiasco has nothing to do with &quot;Brand India&quot;, it is a reflection on all thats wrong with &quot;Brand Government of India&quot;&quot;  3.03pm: You can still register your vote on the &quot;Should they cancel the Commonwealth Games?&quot; poll. Interesting voting so far.  3.06pm: Sports news correspondent Owen Gibson reports: &quot;Commonwealth Games&apos; fate to be decided within 48 hours.&quot; His new report quotes several senior figures, here are some of the newest elements: \u2022 The Commonwealth Games Council for Wales chair, Anne Ellis, said this morning&apos;s collapse of a false ceiling in the weightlifting venue \u2013 following yesterday&apos;s collapse of a footbridge outside the main stadium that injured 27 people \u2013 had added &quot;a different dimension&quot; to the discussion. It remains unlikely that any team will take the decision to pull out unilaterally. &quot;The decision will be made, but it won&apos;t be made in isolation. We have delegations from Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, New Zealand and Australia out there and the decision will be made jointly,&quot; Ellis told Sky News. &quot;I just hope it isn&apos;t going to come to that \u2013 I hope the organising committee and the Commonwealth Games Federation will pull out all the stops to ensure it can go ahead.&quot; \u2022 Cabinet secretary, KM Chandrasekhar, told CNN-IBN television: &quot;We are absolutely prepared.&quot; \u2022Organisers on the ground said a vast team of cleaners would ensure the village was ready and insisted that over the next two days the &quot;finishing touches&quot; would be put to the 34 residential towers due to house 6,500 athletes. \u2022 Of the ceiling collapse, Chandrasekhar said: &quot;The cables which were to be set up for the data network were placed on the false ceiling and due to the weight of the cables the ceiling fell off. It&apos;s a minor thing and it will be corrected. It&apos;s not a matter to be worried about.&quot;  3.38pm: The board of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games are meeting now. Here is a statement they put out in advance of the meeting:  It is not appropriate for one Organising Committee to pass judgement on another - particularly before their Games has even taken place. Each Games is different, they take place in different countries with different cultures and different ways of working. It is not uncommon for major Games to have problems in the run-up to the Opening Ceremony. At Glasgow 2014, we are happy with our progress to date. We are a little under four years out from our Opening Ceremony and have a lot to do, but we believe we are on track to achieve our ambition \u2013 which is to deliver an outstanding, athlete centred and sport focused Games that will be celebrated across the Commonwealth, generate enormous pride in Glasgow and Scotland, and leave a lasting legacy. If we achieve this, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll pass on the Commonwealth Games brand in good shape to the next Host City.  Reading between the lines, the Glasgow committee realises that it can&apos;t be too critical of Delhi 2010 for fear of damaging the Commonwealth Games brand and stoking up resentment which might rebound in 2014.  3.48pm: Another statement from Scotland: Minister for Public Health and Sport Shona Robison said:  The Scottish Government together with our partners, remain committed to the 2010 Commonwealth Games and the presence of a strong team in Delhi. However, the safety of our athletes is paramount and we all wholeheartedly support Commonwealth Games Scotland&apos;s decision to delay our athletes&apos; departure to Delhi. The First Minister today chaired an emergency meeting of the 2014 Strategic Group where all partners were given an update by CGS as to the latest situation in Delhi. The Games venues are in reasonable order and there are no additional security concerns, however serious health and safety issues still remain with the accommodation at the Athletes Village. We need to see immediate action from the Indian Government and theCommonwealth Games Federation to resolve these concerns, and we are making the strongest possible representations to that effect. Our intention is to participate in the 2010 Commonwealth Games, but only on the basis that Team Scotland is housed in a safe and secure environment. We continue to monitor this situation closely and will examine every possibility to ensure that our athletes enjoy a magnificent event in Delhi.  Tough-ish talk, but would seem to indicate that they expect the Delhi Games to go ahead.  4.18pm: The British Swimming team has denied setting up a Plan B in case the Games are cancelled, reports the Telegraph. Earlier today (1.10pm) it was reported that the New Zealand team, led by general manager Jan Cameron, were informally discussing an alternative tournament at a Middle Eastern or Asian venue, just in case. According to the Telegraph British Swimming&apos;s chief executive, David Sparkes, said he was not making any decisions, instead relying on Craig Hunter, England&apos;s chef de mission, for regular reports from India. Hunter managed England&apos;s swimmers at the 2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine we would consider anything like that [the Games being cancelled] and the issues I&apos;m sure will be sorted out,&quot; Sparkes told the Telegraph &quot;I am confident that all will be okay and Craig remains upbeat at this stage. But of course we will maintain a watching brief.&quot;  4.42pm: Tweet from the BBC&apos;s @danroan:        The first 22 members of the England Commonwealth Games team will fly to Delhi tomorrow as planned, Commonwealth Games England have confirmed  4.52pm: Slightly peculiar announcement from the English commonwealth games team, which I think is worth quoting in full for all of its nuances:  England continues to confirm its participation in the Commonwealth Games Commonwealth Games England (CGE) continues to believe that the situation in Delhi is serious and we are monitoring this constantly with our Chef de Mission and our team in Delhi. The CGE continues to seek assurances from the CGF and the Organising Committee (OC) of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi that the Village and Venues are fit for purpose, are safe and that urgent action will be taken by the OC and the CGF to address the significant operational issues which exist. Continuous feedback and consultation is taking place with our sports teams in England. Meanwhile, our team on the ground in Delhi, led by Chef de Mission Craig Hunter continues to prepare for the arrival of the first 22 athletes from lawn bowls and men&apos;s hockey who will leave the UK for Delhi tomorrow evening. We are acutely aware that there is a small window for action and the Board of CGE has met today in London to discuss this.  The Board will be seeking assurances from the CGF and the Organising Committee and members of the Board will also be liaising with Government to ensure that we have confidence that the venues and village in Delhi are structurally sound, safe and fit for purpose before the athletes arrive.  So, to recap &quot;England continues to confirm its participation&quot; and the crown green bowling and hockey teams are the brave vanguard. Wales, meanwhile, are also sitting on an uncomfortable fence, declaring:   Team Wales will issue a statement tomorrow (Thursday, September 23) once it has reviewed the situation in Delhi...Unfortunately, we are unable to give a definite time of when that statement will be issued as events are changing on a minute by minute basis.   5.30pm: With the Commonwealth Games official countdown clock showing 11 days to go here&apos;s the summary of another dramatic day: \u2022 A portion of ceiling in the weightlifting arena fell, a day after 27 people were injured when a bridge at the main arena collapsed. Video footage later showed that the piece of ceiling was relatively small but it would still have caused injuries if it had happened when the arena was in use. \u2022 The England team boss said the competition was &quot;on a knife-edge&quot;. Sir Andrew Foster, the chairman of Commonwealth Games England, said the competition was facing &quot;a critical 24 to 48 hours&quot;. &quot;It is not certain and we will not be sending our team unless we are confident,&quot; he said. &quot;But there still is a serious chance, if the Indian government and the organising committee throw thousands of people at the village \u2013 which is what they quite often do in India \u2013 that this could still be salvageable. The village still has a lot of remedial work needing to be done. But it is the case in India, when building projects are coming to a conclusion, that that is a typical way that things happen and that is quite a big cultural difference.

The cost of official Ashes tours is very high. What do you think is best way to do this please? I do not mind staying in budget accommodation.  Bob Stather According to Austravel (0800 988 4834, austravel.com), there are flights to Brisbane starting at around \u00a31,095 with Qantas which allow for an optional stopover in Bangkok on selected dates in November.  I found a fare of around \u00a31,750 return including taxes with either BA or Qantas, with an internal flight between Brisbane and Adelaide. I based this on flying out on November 20, having two days in Bangkok then six nights in each of Brisbane and Adelaide, returning home on 9 December. An alternative option would be to fly with another airline, and instead use either Hong Kong, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur as a hub. Ben Briggs, brand manager at Austravel, says the company has been inundated with calls from both customers and agents looking for flights and accommodation. &quot;Having said that,&quot; he added, &quot;there is still availability for both flights and accommodation. Around the match dates, however, it is the internal flights that are a slight problem as these are at a premium. Travellers will therefore need to be flexible with internal travel, so they should think about alternative ways to travel between destinations. Instead of flying they could perhaps hire a car or a motorhome to get around. Another option is a rail journey.&quot; Once in the host city, beds in hostel dorms are an excellent option, with plenty of choice, low rates and a sociable atmosphere. Adelaide Central YHA is already showing no availability for male dorms while the Test is taking place, but a Hostelworld.com search reveals plenty of space in other places, with prices starting at \u00a317 a night. The huge Brisbane City YHA has vacancies for the duration of the Test starting at \u00a322 per night. If you really want to keep costs down, you can stay with local people using couchsurfing.com or airbnb.com. Tickets for some days at the Tests are sold out \u2013 but check availability and you can buy tickets at ticketmaster.com.au. Or check out getmein.com. I am free for five to six days at the end of October and am very keen to explore the Scottish Highlands, probably flying to and from Glasgow and hiring a car. Do you have a suggested itinerary? We&apos;d like to do a couple of walks, maybe see some spectacular beaches. I&apos;ve read the Lonely Planet Scotland guide and simply can&apos;t whittle down the suggested 14-day itineraries. I&apos;ve also heard that it may be shooting season and that could cause a bit of trouble when walking! Simon Ryan, London I&apos;m including this question partly because it sounds terrific and partly because I&apos;m sure readers will have plenty of suggestions. Five to six days will become four unless you&apos;re careful \u2013 distances aren&apos;t huge but getting anywhere in the north-west of Scotland takes a while, especially as you&apos;ll want to stop and gawk at the scenery and stretch your legs. One possibility would be to arrange a one-way rental from Glasgow to Inverness, which would allow you to spend longer in wilder places. With this amount of time I&apos;d head straight for Fort William, bypassing the Trossachs, which offers several days of great walking and exploring points north and west. Along the way you&apos;ll pass by Loch Lomond, cross Rannoch Moor and traverse Glencoe. This might be Britain&apos;s most dramatic drive, but you&apos;re only getting started. The obvious walk in the area is up Ben Nevis, but this is a long hike and not a gentle day out. A different option would be starting from Kinlochleven rather than Fort William and heading up the grassy slopes of the Mamores and following the ridge where, if you&apos;re very lucky, you may spot eagles. There&apos;s a suggested walk in this area at Binnein Mor and Na Gruagaichean. Continue north to the lovely village of Plockton and on to Glen Torridon for more great walking, then on to Ullapool from where you can attempt as much of dramatic, brooding An Teallach as your legs and the weather can handle. There&apos;s probably too much even here, but as you&apos;re in such a beautiful part of the country the temptation is to do more, not less. Just this once I&apos;d give in to that instinct and push yourself a little. It&apos;s rare to have your planned walk disturbed or postponed by shooting parties, especially if you&apos;re sticking to well-known routes, but check at local tourist information centres before setting out. Wearing something bright is always a good idea. I am planning to travel to Cairo via Marrakech for one week in November, and want to know if there are any cheap-ish routes? Lindsay, by email Land travel across north Africa is complicated by closed borders between Morocco and Algeria and the impossibility of overland travel through Libya, so it&apos;s by plane or nothing, I&apos;m afraid. Even if you could make it overland, it would take much longer than a week. There&apos;s neither the business or tourist traffic to merit a direct route between the two cities, so you&apos;re looking at going via either Casablanca in Morocco, or changing planes in a European hub. The best fare I could find in November was \u00a3183 with Royal Air Maroc and Egyptair, changing in Casablanca. Unless you&apos;re booking this as part of a complete package travelling to or from the UK, you are best off making this arrangement with a travel agency when you get to Marrakech. Local agents will have access to the best fares and may even be able to beat this deal. I&apos;ve just had a great time in Cuba and am now planning my next trip. I was hoping to go around June, and I&apos;ve looked at Costa Rica which appeals greatly: it&apos;s exotic, the hotels look amazing, and it&apos;s more than a beach holiday which means we can venture into the rainforests. But I was wondering would it be the best time to go weather-wise? I&apos;m worried if it was the rainy season, the holiday would be a complete wash-out. And are there any other countries that aren&apos;t the typical places everyone goes to with nice beaches and stuff to do? Paul Hibbitt, by email Your assessment of Costa Rica is pretty much spot-on. It offers beaches, wildlife and nature, often within close proximity to each other. It will feel very different to Cuba, having had several decades of visitors from North America. One thing to consider: Costa Rica isn&apos;t an exactly cheap place, especially in comparison with neighbouring countries. A reasonable mid-range daily budget would be \u00a330 to \u00a350, though you could get by on less if you were prepared to stay and eat at bottom-bracket \u2013 though still reasonable \u2013 places. You will, as you&apos;ll note from these prices, find it cheaper than visiting Europe, America or most places in the Caribbean, though. June is the early part of the rainy season in Costa Rica, so you can expect things to be stickier and wetter than usual. In reality, it rains year-round pretty much everywhere, so while it&apos;s wetter at this time, you&apos;ll benefit from cheaper rates and fewer crowds around popular spots such as Volcan Arenal and the surf beaches of the Pacific coast. Watch out for travelling later in June and July as prices can rise with summer holiday traffic. As alternatives, you might consider Nicaragua and Panama, which, while less developed, may offer a more exotic and less expensive trip. But this needs to be balanced with the ease of getting around Costa Rica. Or take a longer trip and see all three."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/sep/23/market-falls-compass-climbs", "sentences": ["Lower down the market, Aim listed life science group ValiRx added 17% to 0.41p after it sold its Belgian diagnostic development business to a Singapore cancer specialist for $1m in cash and shares."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-23T16:06:22Z", "title": "FTSE recovers from worst levels but finishes lower for the third day, while Compass climbs on contract hopes", "tags": ["Business", "Compass", "Legal and General", "Barclays", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Cookson", "Wellstream"], "article": "In another volatile day&apos;s trading, leading shares ended lower, but Compass bucked the trend with a 1% rise in its shares.

The Pentagon has delayed awarding an extension to the existing deal - due originally to run out at the end of the month - to Sodehxo and instead will not make a decision until January. Sodexho has been criticised in Congress over its handling of the contract, and some traders think Compass could be the beneficiary of the French company&apos;s problems. Elsewhere Legal and General was lifted 0.9p to 101.3p after MF Global began coverage of the insurer with a buy rating and a 115p price target. It said the sector was likely to be supported by bid speculation for some time to come - already this year Prudential has attempted to buy AIG&apos;s Asian operations, RSA Insurance has made a \u00a35bn offer for Aviva&apos;s general insurance business and Resolution bought French group Axa&apos;s UK life firm. But MF Global said investors should concentrate on companies with the ability to generate strong sustainable cashflow, and L&amp;G seemed to fit the bill. L&amp;G has also, of course, been tipped as a possible bid target for the likes of Resolution or Zurich Financial. But growing worries about the state of the global economy pushed the FTSE 100 lower for the third day running, down 4.83 points at 5547.08 after falling as low as 5471. Investors were unsettled by unexpectedly poor Irish GDP figures, as well as fears that Anglo Irish bank could default on some of its debt, with an eventual recapitalisation which may cost the Irish government \u20ac25bn. The day&apos;s US data did not help, with weekly jobless claims showing a surprise 12,000 rise to 465,000, and continuing weakness in the housing market. Teunis Brosens at ING Bank said:  US home sales have probably hit bottom. August existing home sales rebounded 7.6% month on month to 4.1m, ending the slide following the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit. But make no mistake: August sales were still very, very weak. They are the second lowest in well over a decade, with July sales the lowest. With the tax credit gone and no further stimulus measures on the cards, sales will recover only very gradually.  Banking shares edged lower ahead of tomorrow&apos;s banking commission report. Barclays slipped 0.45p to 306.25p while Lloyds Banking Group was 0.76p lower at 75.09p. Among the mid-caps Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide fell 2.3p to 74p as Morgan Stanley said the recent recovery in the company&apos;s shares following July&apos;s profit warning had gone too far. Analyst Nick Delfas said:  We think it is too early to expect any recovery after the July profit warning, the first half/second half split is not usually supportive and gross margin growth expected by the market over the next three years still looks challenging. The stock has bounced 28% from its August low, and looks vulnerable given the likely near term results.   Industrial materials group Cookson managed to divide City opinion yesterday. Evolution Securities issued a buy note on the business, saying the shares were severely undervalued, which could leave it vulnerable. Analyst Harry Philips said:  I look at the Cookson valuation and have to get my solar powered calculator out to check the multiples. To justify the current valuation you have to believe in a severe double dip that will challenge Cookson&apos;s banking covenants and to put this in context, to breech on interest cover and net debt/ebitda in 2010, earnings before interest and tax would have to fall to \u00a390m and \u00a354m respectively compared to our current \u00a3258m. Cookson&apos;s emerging market profile is one of the strongest in the sector reflecting its 60% market share in steel and foundry flow controls. Electronics runs at 25% and we feel that the considerable valuation gap leaves Cookson vulnerable given its market positions in process and safety critical applications.  But Oriel took the opposite view, beginning coverage of the company with a sell recommendation. Analyst Adrian Murray said:  Our negative stance on Cookson shares reflects a view that the group will find it increasingly difficult to achieve consensus expectations for 2011, and that downgrades to these forecasts are likely during the first half of 2011. Our forecasts for both 2011 and 2012 are, respectively, 25% and 11% below the sell-side consensus. Our target price of 400p is 20% below the current share price.  The recent recovery in Cookson&apos;s share price has, once again, raised the risk profile of the shares, in our view. They are no longer discounting the inevitable decline in earnings that a slowing US economy would cause and, therefore, holders of Cookson&apos;s shares are running the risk of underperformance as the weakening macro-economic environment feeds through to earnings downgrades for 2011 and 2012.  In the end Cookson closed 10.7p lower at 499.3p. Wellstream, the oil services group which revealed this week it had received several bid approaches fell 12p to 776p after Citigroup moved its recommendation from buy to hold. The bank said:  With the stock up around 30% since the announcement, investors ask: who are the suitors and what is a fair price. We think the suitors&apos; identity doesn&apos;t matter and a price would be hard to agree upon. Whoever tries to buy the stock is likely to be careful about the price. [This] might be difficult to agree on. The suitor(s) are likely to look for a bargain, positioning themselves as the saviors of Wellstream. Wellstream in turn is likely to point beyond the challenging years and remind suitor(s) that the stock was at \u00a315 in 2008. We move our rating to hold as the premium seems largely priced in and there is the potential for the deal to not go through. We prefer to wait and see.

The commission has a mandate to consider whether the universal banking model \u2013 where retail and &quot;casino&quot; investment arms sit alongside each other \u2013 needs to be altered to avoid another taxpayer bailout. Banks such as HSBC, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland are most concerned by this aspect of the review. Led by Sir John Vickers, the former head of the Office of Fair Trading, the commission will also scrutinise the broader issue of competition on the high street, which is dominated by Lloyds Banking Group as a result of the rescue of HBOS during the 2008 banking crisis. Mike Geoghegan, the outgoing chief executive of HSBC, got his defence in first today, declaring &quot;universal banking works&quot; as he hit out against new rules from international regulators in Basel. Geoghegan expressed doubt about the requirement under Basel III to demand that big banks such as HSBC hold an extra cushion of cash compared with smaller ones. He said he did not &quot;think it is logical to impose higher across-the-board capital requirements on a firm because it is large&quot;. He said: &quot;Capital requirements should be linked to the riskiness of its business model, not its size.&quot; He pointed out that HSBC has weathered the financial crisis without the need for a taxpayer bailout. French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has already promised to fight the proposed extra capital requirement. Speaking at a conference of banking supervisors in Singapore, Geoghegan added: &quot;What matters is not size, but risk. Our focus must be on making banks safer, not smaller.&quot; John Varley, the outgoing chief executive of Barclays, defended the role played by investment banks that are linked to high-street banks. In a comment piece in the Financial Times, Varley said: &quot;It is not the work of the casino. Offering a fixed-rate mortgage to a first-time buyer (a derivative is needed to do that) is a real economy service. So is offering a farmer the ability to hedge his euro farm-support payments to protect his business from swings in currency value (which needs a derivative).&quot; He added: &quot;If our stakeholders think of these activities as gambling then we need to do a better job of explaining this part of our work.&quot; The commission was one of the key items agreed by the coalition government when it was formed in May. It was high on the Liberal Democrats&apos; agenda before the election, with its manifesto declaring that banks that are &quot;too big to fail&quot; should be broken up into their &quot;casino&quot; and high street arms to get them lending again. The tone of the language used by the business secretary, Vince Cable, at the Lib Dem conference this week has alarmed some bankers \u2013 whom he dubbed &quot;spivs&quot; \u2013 ahead of the commission. But it is expected to be determined to show tomorrow that it is independent of the government and that it wants to conduct its research in a number of ways, including through debates held in public at venues up and down the country. The issues paper that Vickers will present will be scrutinised by the banks for evidence that he is putting more emphasis on the competition among high-street banks rather than the issue of &quot;too big to fail&quot;. The main banks upon which the commission will focus \u2013 RBS, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Spain&apos;s Santander, which owns Abbey, Alliance &amp; Leicester and parts of Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 are also expecting to receive questionnaires aimed at uncovering the specific ways in which their operations are structured. The commission is planning to publish its initial views in the spring to allow further representations to be made before it presents its findings to the cabinet sub-committee, which is overseeing its report a year from now. The sub-committee is chaired by the chancellor, George Osborne, and Cable also sits on it. Geoghegan&apos;s current boardroom colleague, Stephen Green, will also be on the cabinet sub-committee after he joins the government as trade minister in the new year. The issues paper is not expected to just set out a case for a crude break-up of banks along retail and investment banking arms, but to provide other variations such as requiring riskier operations to hold more capital. The way banks are structured \u2013 with subsidiaries or branches \u2013 may also be highlighted. Members of the banking commission Sir John Vickers The committee chairman was educated at Eastbourne grammar school and spent weekends as a youth working in his parents&apos; umbrella and handbag shop in the town. He became an economist after studying at Oriel College, Oxford, and has been chief economist at the Bank of England. He is also a former director general of the Office of Fair Trading. The 52-year-old is said to have a &quot;brain the size of a planet&quot;. Clare Spottiswoode Ebullient and enthusiastic, Spottiswoode is a former gas industry regulator keen to promote the interests of consumers. The first female undergraduate at Clare College, Cambridge, she is an economist and has already rehearsed many of the issues the commission will need to tackle, after sitting on the panel to consider the future of banking put together by the consumer group Which? last year. Martin Taylor A former Financial Times journalist, textile industry boss and chief executive of Barclays bank. He was among those grilled by Spottiswoode and the Which? panel. In response to one question, Taylor replied that the universal model had &quot;proved to be dangerous&quot; but was difficult to dismantle. His career at Barclays ended a decade ago after a boardroom row, but not before he recruited Bob Diamond, who will become Barclays&apos;s chief executive next year and has already turned the bank into one of which the Liberal Democrats disapprove. Martin Wolf Associate editor and chief economics commentator at the FT, Wolf began at the World Bank after studying at Nuffield College, Oxford. In his FT columns , he argued against simplistic, narrow banks acting as utilities, saying they may have an incentive to take extra risk to improve returns to shareholders. Bill Winters Ousted from the investment bank JP\u00a0Morgan after a quarter of a century in 2009, Winters has blamed the banking crisis on &quot;greedy bankers, investors and borrowers&quot;. He had been co-chief of the investment banking operations of the Wall Street firm since 2004 and was once regarded as possible leader of the group.

One investment is going better than the other: his beloved Palypso De Creek didn&apos;t cross the finish line of this year&apos;s Grand National. Silver Cross, on the other hand, could have the makings of a champion. The company is winning over a new generation of mothers in the UK and in developed and developing markets such as the US and China. It was a close run thing though. After surviving more than 120 years of social and industrial change the company hit the buffers in 2002 with Halsall able to buy the former market-leader for only \u00a3500,000: &quot;When I bought Silver Cross, it was regarded as a heritage brand; very old-fashioned and a bit quaint compared to companies like Bugaboo and Mamas and Papas.&quot; Silver Cross had missed opportunities: in the 1960s it turned down Owen Maclaren&apos;s first pushchair design \u2013 and had increasingly become an anachronism as nimble new entrants, such as what was to become Maclaren and Mamas and Papas, began making and importing cheaper, lightweight products for the rapidly changing Britain of the 1970s and early 1980s. But in Halsall&apos;s hands Silver Cross sales have gone from zero back up to 180,000 units in 2009. The business is profitable again and is expected to turn over \u00a320m this year. &quot;We had to be loyal to the tradition of great British design but also innovative and a little bit clever,&quot; he says of his efforts to rebuild the company. A lot remains the same. The classic coach prams (pictured) in its premium &quot;Heritage&quot; range, such as the Balmoral and the Kensington, are still the stuff of Mary Poppins, with their hand-sprung chassis, rose metalwork and elegantly curved handles once again in demand by the rich and famous. In previous decades the glamour of the brand radiated from famous clients such as the British royal family and Grace Kelly, who was photographed for a magazine shoot in the late 1950s pushing Princess Caroline in one of its prams. Celebrity culture has played a part in its renaissance \u2013 although this time the unlikely supporters include Britney Spears, P Diddy and Liverpool&apos;s Steven Gerrard. If the price tag doesn&apos;t put you off \u2013 the Balmoral costs \u00a31,100 \u2013 you&apos;d also struggle to get round Tesco with one. &quot;They are impractical,&quot; agrees Halsall. &quot;They don&apos;t fit in a car, but that&apos;s not the point. You don&apos;t buy one for practical reasons, you buy one because you appreciate its beauty.&quot; You are also unlikely to see them on eBay, Halsall says, as owners struggle to part with them \u2013 he has one in his garage. &quot;My wife won&apos;t let it go and that is typical of a lot of people who buy them.&quot; Today the Heritage range is 5% of sales: it has tackled the mass market head on with a large product range that starts at \u00a3100 and includes car seats and buggies, albeit not made at its factory in Bingley, West Yorkshire, (below) and it is holding its own in a competitive and increasingly hi-tech market. The company, named after a street in what was an industrial suburb of Leeds, has also embraced the mumsnet generation via Facebook and Twitter. &quot;In 1877, when Silver Cross was established, it was incredibly innovative,&quot; says Halsall, whose family&apos;s toy business had previously made Silver Cross dolls&apos; prams under licence. &quot;We&apos;ve got to be the same today.&quot; To that end his son Ben, who has joined him in the business, is currently setting up Silver Cross Pacific to develop sales in countries such as Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and China. Mindful of the precarious situation Silver Cross has faced in the past Halsall, who owns the company outright, is financing the expansion himself. &quot;I don&apos;t like debt and I don&apos;t like banks,&quot; says the Lancastrian businessman. Halsall \u2013 who was so passionate about the need for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty he ran a campaign in the north west \u2013 is a fan of David Cameron&apos;s &quot;big society&quot;. He founded the Skipton and Ripon enterprise mentoring service to help other entrepreneurs. &quot;I&apos;m a baby boomer, we really had it very good so it&apos;s time to give something back.&quot; The next step, says Halsall, is a Heritage &quot;Classics&quot; range and he is seeking other British manufacturers making complementary products such as nursery furniture or toys that it could lend its name to. He says China presents the biggest prize for the company and it has already exported its first Heritage pram to a couple living in Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan province. Given that its prams are famous for their suspension it seems right that Silver Cross should survive a bumpy ride. As for Palypso De Creek he will have another crack at the Grand National next year. &quot;In racing, hope springs eternal,&quot; says Halsall."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/24/lewis-hamilton-mark-webber", "sentences": ["There are five races remaining, starting here on the streets of Singapore on Sunday night, and it certainly looks likely to go to the final race in Abu Dhabi on 14 November.", "But McLaren, with their outstanding engineering team, claim they have made similar improvements on those low-speed, high-downforce tracks \u2013 such as the one here in Singapore \u2013 where they have disappointed in the past.", "&quot;Singapore might be less bumpy than it was but it could be wet and no one has any experience of wet conditions here.", "Brazil will be all about traction, while Abu Dhabi again will be very dependent on aerodynamics.&quot; The high downforce factor in Singapore is expected to suit Red Bull but McLaren and Ferrari are fancied to be highly competitive."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-24T18:51:20Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton and Mark Webber look to have edge in final countdown | Paul Weaver", "tags": ["Formula One", "Red Bull", "Mark Webber", "Sebastian Vettel", "McLaren", "Lewis Hamilton", "Jenson Button", "Ferrari", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "The cars This raucous argument of a season may need to be resolved by arbitration. There are five races remaining, starting here on the streets of Singapore on Sunday night, and it certainly looks likely to go to the final race in Abu Dhabi on 14 November. The greater speed of the Red Bull cars and the superior reliability of McLaren have given a tortoise and hare element to the narrative, if only superficially. In reality it is not that simple. McLaren are more powerful than Red Bull on the long straights, while if you take away driver error there is nothing unreliable about Red Bull these days. Red Bull have the best designer in the business, Adrian Newey, who has produced winning cars wherever he has been. Red Bull have the most adaptable chassis, which means they are now quick at most places, not just those with a high downforce. But McLaren, with their outstanding engineering team, claim they have made similar improvements on those low-speed, high-downforce tracks \u2013 such as the one here in Singapore \u2013 where they have disappointed in the past. We shall soon see. It is a worry for Ferrari that Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa have used the last of their allotted eight engines for the season \u2013 if either man uses a ninth he will be slapped with a 10-place grid penalty. Ferrari have been hot and cold this season, and consistency of performance is critical now. They have rallied after a wretched mid-season but nothing less than a strong finish will do. But there are strong signs that all three teams are upping their game as the season moves towards its climax, to produce both greater reliability and stronger all-round performances on the widely differing tracks. The drivers Who would be world champion if the drivers all had the same car? That has long been Formula One&apos;s intriguing question. Most people consider Lewis Hamilton and Alonso to be the best drivers. But only just. The famous five are separated by 24 points, which means it could be the closest finish since 1981, when the top five drivers were seven points apart. Points were given out more sparingly then. Now every point counts. &quot;From here on in we&apos;re all looking for a podium position in every race,&quot; Jenson Button says. &quot;Even fifth isn&apos;t good enough.&quot; There are three world champions out there, squeezed between the Red Bull pair who have never won the title. Hamilton and Button appear on top of their game, despite recent setbacks. Mark Webber just won&apos;t go away, is determined and an ace qualifier. Alonso has made a number of errors but, with two wins in the past four outings, he may be timing his push to perfection. Sebastian Vettel, most agree, is a champion of the future, perhaps a multi-title winner. But this may not be his year after converting only one of his seven pole positions into a win. He has been too impetuous. &quot;I fancy Mark to win the thing, but only just,&quot; says Patrick Head, one of the most respected voices in Formula One and the driving force behind the Williams team for a generation. &quot;He&apos;s got this incredible hunger. He&apos;s not making the mistakes he used to when he was a younger driver. But while we&apos;re all talking about who is the best driver, or who has the fastest car, I think the title could be decided by an accident or a reliability issue.&quot; The crews McLaren are traditionally stronger than any other team when it comes to improving the car during the season. That is one of the reasons why they trail the faster Red Bull cars by three points in the constructors&apos; championship. They have more experience at the top than Red Bull, who appear to have been pulled back a little by the FIA, the governing body, which has introduced tough new tests relating to flexible bodywork. Ferrari, like McLaren, have vast experience of winning, though they have not shown it this season. Head has been hugely impressed by all three. &quot;They all deserve to be where they are. You&apos;re looking at three very strong teams. If I had to pick one it would probably be Red Bull, just because they&apos;re in new territory. McLaren and Ferrari have been there before, so many times. &quot;Having said that Red Bull know they should have won it last year, only to make too many team mistakes, while the cars were also sometimes unreliable. They have got on top of the reliability issue but they are now desperate to capitalise on the fact that they have a very good car and the pressure may show. &quot;But Ferrari have their own pressures. They are under this really tight scrutiny from their press and it has made them a little twitchy and nervous when it comes to making decisions. The car is good but they haven&apos;t been getting the finishing points. They may well look back on the middle of the season, and those disappointing results in Turkey, Canada, Valencia and Silverstone, as the time when they lost the season.&quot; The circuits It is cars for courses in Formula One. But most teams seem to be ironing out their bumps, just as they have been here at the uneven street circuit, much to the disappointment of Renault, whose cars thrive on a bumpy ride. This is the view from Rubens Barrichello, the most experienced driver in the sport, who recently competed in his 300th race. &quot;Singapore might be less bumpy than it was but it could be wet and no one has any experience of wet conditions here. It&apos;s a bit like Valencia without the high-speed corners, though there are some 90-degree turns. Japan will be very aerodynamically dominated. No one knows much about Korea. Brazil will be all about traction, while Abu Dhabi again will be very dependent on aerodynamics.&quot; The high downforce factor in Singapore is expected to suit Red Bull but McLaren and Ferrari are fancied to be highly competitive. The high speeds and fast corners in Japan \u2013 not unlike the tracks at Silverstone and Barcelona \u2013 are again expected to be to Red Bull&apos;s advantage. Korea is largely unknown but it is expected to be something of a mixture, with slow corners and some good long straights. But no one really knows much abut the surface. Brazil presents a muscular challenge. It is a power track and will surely give Red Bull the edge again, while Abu Dhabi, with its very long straight and with no really fast corners, just might bring a smile to McLaren faces. The two most impressive drivers this season have been Webber and Hamilton and you feel it will be one of them smiling widest on the night of 14 November."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/24/hsbc-boardroom-struggle-liberal-democrats", "sentences": ["&quot;Douglas and Stuart will be an awesome team and the company is in excellent hands,&quot; he said in the early hours of the morning in Singapore where he had been attending a conference."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-24T19:00:00Z", "title": "HSBC's Geoghegan to get \u00a317m after losing out on chairman role", "tags": ["HSBC", "Michael Geoghegan", "Banking", "Business", "Financial sector", "Liberal Democrats", "UK news", "Corporate governance"], "article": "Mike Geoghegan is to walk away from HSBC with cash and shares worth a potential \u00a317m at the end of a 37-year career that will end next March after a tussle for control at the top of one of the world&apos;s biggest banks. After an emergency board meeting this afternoon \u2013 which linked directors in London, Asia and the US \u2013 the bank confirmed the chief executive&apos;s retirement minutes before the City&apos;s regulatory news service shut. The bank was forced to bring forward an announcement it wanted to make next Wednesday following days of speculation about Machiavellian machinations in the boardroom which had been sparked by the chairman Stephen Green&apos;s decision to join the government next year. Ordinarily, Geoghegan would have expected to have been promoted to the chairman&apos;s role but shareholders had urged the board to break with its traditional convention. Despite enthralling the City for days with the saga of who would succeed him, Green was adamant that there had been no turmoil in the boardroom. &quot;All the people involved in this process have behaved impeccably and graciously through it. It is nonsense to suggest otherwise,&quot; Green said. In a highly unusual move, Green is to be replaced as chairman by finance director Douglas Flint, while Geoghegan&apos;s position as chief executive to is to be taken by the current head of the investment bank Stuart Gulliver. The bank insisted that it had been planning changes at the top since earlier this year as it desperately tried to paint a picture of orderly succession. Geoghegan was gracious to the boardroom colleagues replacing him. &quot;Douglas and Stuart will be an awesome team and the company is in excellent hands,&quot; he said in the early hours of the morning in Singapore where he had been attending a conference. The decision to resign had been his, he said, and had not been prompted by a row over whether non-executive director John Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs banker, should be named as chairman. &quot;I passionately believe you shouldn&apos;t stay as chief executive for too long, five or six years,&quot; he said. He will have held the position for five years next May. &quot;I came to a very quick solution \u2026 that it was time to hand over to the next generation,&quot; Geoghegan said. He was never offered the chairman&apos;s role. He will leave at the end of March with \u00a31.42m in cash and will be considered for a bonus \u2013 for 2009 he received \u00a34m which he pledged to give to charity. He also owns 925,896 shares, worth just over \u00a36m at tonight&apos;s share price and could have more than 1m shares released to him through a performance-related scheme. Their exact number and value is not yet known \u2013 but if they were released in total tonight they would be valued at more than \u00a36.5m. He could get nothing. He left the company pension scheme in 2006, when the company reported he had accumulated a pot of \u00a313m. The boardroom upheaval is unprecedented and has infuriated the Liberal Democrats, who criticised Barclays when it promoted its investment banking head, Bob Diamond, to chief executive this month. Gulliver is another &quot;casino banker&quot; and was HSBC&apos;s highest-paid employee last year, earning \u00a310m. He will now receive a pay cut, with a \u00a31.25m salary and potential to receive up to four times that in bonuses. He has tried to defend bonuses in the past, likening the situation to needing to pay Hollywood stars. The Lib Dems are concerned that by appointing investment bankers to the top job, the industry is not taking seriously their concerns about reducing risk. Despite HSBC&apos;s insistence that nothing untoward had taken place in the boardroom, banks rarely replace two such crucial posts at the same time for fear of prompting concerns about instability. Even during the financial crisis, banking groups tried to avoid such upheaval. Sir Simon Robertson, the senior non-executive director and former Goldman Sachs banker who led the selection process at HSBC, is to be named as deputy chairman to try to counterbalance the strong executives on the board. He said that the leaks suggesting that there had been a row in the boardroom were &quot;appalling&quot;. He said: &quot;I don&apos;t think it reflects well upon any of us&quot;. The bank said Flint&apos;s elevation to chairman had been discussed with shareholders and that he would leave his non-executive position at BP next year. He will be based in London while Gulliver, who today was in Hong Kong, will relocate there from London to take on the role of chief executive. The new finance director will be Iain Mackay, who was recently appointed as chief financial officer of HSBC&apos;s Asia Pacific region."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/26/hsbc-michael-geoghegan-dinner-surprise", "sentences": ["If Geoghegan felt any bitterness as he participated in a series of conference calls from Singapore on Friday where he had been addressing banking supervisors, he was hiding it well."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-25T23:07:07Z", "title": "Surprise on the menu for HSBC's chief executive Michael Geoghegan", "tags": ["Michael Geoghegan", "Banking", "HSBC", "Business"], "article": "The 13th is unlucky for some. And so it turned out for Michael Geoghegan. Summoned to dinner in the luxurious and graceful Goring hotel in the shadow of Buckingham Palace, the HSBC chief executive&apos;s 37-year globe-trotting career was about to come to a close. His companion in the David Linley-designed dining room that Monday evening \u2013 13 September \u2013 was another well-heeled banker. Sir Simon Robertson, a multimillionaire former Goldman Sachs partner, City grandee and most senior independent director on the HSBC board, needed to find a successor to Stephen Green, who was stepping down early as chairman, to join the coalition government. Robertson \u2013 a super-smooth Old Etonian who was knighted in this year&apos;s birthday honours \u2013 was in a bit more of a hurry than he had expected to be. Back in March, he thought he had until the bank&apos;s 2011 annual meeting to find a successor for Green. But the chairman&apos;s decision to accept the post of trade minister left had Robertson with just a couple of weeks to resolve the situation. One thing was clear as Robertson travelled to the Goring \u2013 the bank was not going to appoint the chief executive as its next chairman. Geoghegan, who had joined HSBC at 19, might have believed the role was rightfully his, because that had been the tradition at the bank for most of the previous 150\u00a0years. Robertson resolved to tell Geoghegan straight, over a bottle of fine wine, that his chosen candidate was Douglas Flint, the bank&apos;s finance director \u2013 and Geoghegan&apos;s subordinate. Geoghegan therefore had to decide whether he wanted to remain as chief executive to chairman Flint. It did not take him long to decide against. The conversation at the Goring was meant to remain private until Wednesday, when an official announcement would be scheduled. But a series of leaks last week, claiming Geoghegan had threatened to resign if he was not given the top job, caused shockwaves across the City and sparked furious denials by the bank. On Friday the bank convened an emergency board meeting, linking its 18 board members in Asia, Europe and the US by telephone. They rubberstamped Robertson&apos;s plan \u2013 installing Flint as chairman and replacing Geoghegan as chief executive with the ambitious but admired investment banker Stuart Gulliver \u2013 and the official announcement was released just minutes before the regulatory news services closed on Friday. Flint will take over from Green on 3 December, while Gulliver will replace Geoghegan on New Year&apos;s Day. Geoghegan will not officially retire until March 2011 and will then be paid \u00a3200,000 as a consultant for an extra three months. Recalling the dinner that ended his career at the &quot;world&apos;s local bank&quot;, Geoghegan said: &quot;I never really went out of my way to be chairman. You have to be asked, and the reality is I wasn&apos;t asked.&quot; Geoghegan said that after the conversation with Robertson he came to a &quot;very quick decision&quot; that it was &quot;time to hand over to the next generation&quot;. He told the bank the very next day, 14\u00a0September, that he intended to quit. This, he reckons, proves that he did not have a toddler-style temper tantrum by threatening to resign, potentially holding the board to ransom. The City, which loves a good conspiracy theory, was this weekend still enthralled by the HSBC saga. Robertson, meanwhile, is trying to kill the image of a bank famed for its stability and clean succession-planning being rocked by internecine warfare. &quot;It has been diabolical the way leaks have undermined certain individuals and what we&apos;re trying to do,&quot; he said. Others considered for the chairman role included John Thornton, a former Goldman colleague and existing HSBC non-executive, along with international candidates. If Geoghegan felt any bitterness as he participated in a series of conference calls from Singapore on Friday where he had been addressing banking supervisors, he was hiding it well. He described the pairing of Flint and Gulliver as an &quot;awesome combination&quot; and said: &quot;Let&apos;s see the next team get on with it.&quot; Geoghegan added that he&apos;d had a &quot;career that exceeded all my expectations&quot;. It has just not ended as smoothly as he would have hoped."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/26/open-letter-to-the-new-labour-leader", "sentences": ["Don&apos;t be afraid to back winners, whatever neo-liberal textbooks say (conveniently forgetting China, Singapore and the US): support manufacturing, invest in British-built wind farms, in home insulation and carbon capture."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-26T19:30:30Z", "title": "An open letter to the new leader of the Labour party", "tags": ["Labour party leadership"], "article": "Congratulations on your hard-fought victory. Before setting out on a new path, however, you need to lay out your own verdict on Labour&apos;s 13 years in power. As an adviser and as a minister, you were an architect of the policies that we chronicle in our new book. Our audit offers a reminder of what Labour did well, and where it failed. As well as crunching the numbers, we look at what you did through the eyes of people on the ground, citizens in all walks of life. To them, the charivari of Westminster politics didn&apos;t much matter. The people we talked to in Gorton, Middlesbrough, Birmingham or Brighton don&apos;t despise politics; they are often passionately interested because they see its results around them, good and bad. All that Blair/Brown stuff and the rows over big organisational &quot;reform&quot; wasted energy, ignoring the day-to-day details for patients, parents, pupils and citizens at street level. Start change at the bottom, resist pulling on big levers. You are not fated to repeat Blair and Brown&apos;s mistakes, nor to hare off in opposite directions to avoid them. Sifting through Labour&apos;s record of successes and failures, here are some lessons we drew: Do learn from their intimidation by a mainly hostile media that blew them off course. Earn respect by refusing to kowtow to Rupert Murdoch. Nor can the Daily Mail be neutralised: shudder to recall Brown&apos;s pathetic attempts, even inviting Paul Dacre to the funeral of his infant daughter. Hatch a plan: restore pre-Thatcher media rules restricting multiple ownership and disallow non-British taxpayers. Do be collegiate. Blair and Brown let the egotism of leadership marginalise their cabinets. Do head a government of all the talents \u2013 add some friendly GOATS of the Ara Darzi, Paddy Ashdown, Paul Myners variety, never Digby Jones-style enemies. Embrace the Liberal Democrats and plan to share future power. Do be brave, at least sometimes: governments are also judged on policies they enact when public opinion is out of kilter with the facts. Do cut the braggadocio. Blair and Brown forever promised the greatest, the best, the first, world-class and world-beating. Modest under-claiming might reap more gratitude. Do tell a clear story. Your spin doctors will urge you to use euphemisms for redistribution and poverty, but recall how Brown&apos;s secretive tax credits arrived without recipients appreciating where they came from; Labour got no credit. Do be honest about tax, the subscription for living in a civilised society. Income tax is fairest and least unpopular. Do remember what ministers are for. They do politics, not management \u2013 for which they have neither training nor aptitude. Don&apos;t be a neophiliac like Blair, chasing headlines with fidgety new ideas. Build on much solid Labour success, now being dismantled before our eyes. Don&apos;t do structure, especially in health and education. What matters is the experience of the child at every desk and the patient in every ward. What worked was more and better teachers, nurses, doctors and, yes, managers too. Never lose professionals&apos; hearts and minds, for they control public trust. Don&apos;t promise instant remedies, marching thugs to cashpoints when the best policies are very long-term \u2013 think Sure Start. Don&apos;t panic on crime. Don&apos;t respond to every passing horror with a hundred new Criminal Justice Acts. Don&apos;t overflow prisons with the non-violent. Understand the public need for tough punishment but know your only measure of success is reduced re-offending. Don&apos;t spoil your digestion with a prawn cocktail offensive in the City. You need them \u2013 the UK economy depends on finance. But they need you. Strike a better balance. Don&apos;t be afraid to back winners, whatever neo-liberal textbooks say (conveniently forgetting China, Singapore and the US): support manufacturing, invest in British-built wind farms, in home insulation and carbon capture. Don&apos;t allow another housing bubble. If prices take off again, impose a land value tax and use the proceeds to kick-start building private and social homes, an engine for growth. Do reform voting so elections no longer rely on winning a handful of middle Englanders in marginals. Make every vote count. Reform the Lords. Don&apos;t take millionaire money. Be warned by the Bernie Ecclestone contamination and bring in state funding of parties. Do renew all the best Labour did for children, with children&apos;s centres, childcare, breakfast and after-school clubs, Every Child Matters, nurseries \u2013 all at risk from cuts. Don&apos;t do God. Respect faith groups equally with others, but no new faith schools, and make existing ones obey a fair admissions code. Don&apos;t go to war without wholehearted national support backed by solid international law. Don&apos;t claim an impossible ethical foreign policy, when arms manufacture supplies so many jobs. Downsize British ambition; no more expensive punching above our weight. Don&apos;t agonise over Britishness: It will look after itself. Do celebrate the BBC, free museums and arts that cost a fraction of their national value. Do remember, when it&apos;s all over, you will judge your own success by how much fairer you made Britain. That is relentlessly hard work. Finally, be assured this is not the essentially conservative-minded country Blair and Brown feared. Look back with regret at how a golden decade of secure power and a full treasury was often squandered. If there was a time for boldness, courage and imagination, it was then. Even after the crash, Labour had a chance to redefine national purpose and remedy growing inequality. Why were its ambitions so constrained? Look hard at the record. You have the chance to do so much more. Good luck.

Tonight they must have been tempted to throw on the fatted calf to mark the Spaniard&apos;s return to the very centre of this year&apos;s mesmerising Formula One championship. Alonso&apos;s 25th victory was his fourth of the season but, more significantly, it was his third in five races; the Scuderia&apos;s mid-season malaise is well and truly over. But in the annual nocturnal grand prix Lewis Hamilton&apos;s attempt to win a second title was plunged into a Stygian gloom from which it will not emerge unless there is a sharp improvement in his fortunes. For the third time in four races the McLaren driver did not finish and with only four races to go this is no time to run out of momentum. Mark Webber made contact with Hamilton&apos;s left rear wheel and put the Briton out of the race. The incident happened at the Raffles Boulevard. Raffles was supposed to be a gentleman thief but this was a cruel piece of larceny. Jenson Button did manage fourth place but, as he lost more ground to Alonso and Webber, his feelings were mixed. It was a devastating occasion for McLaren because, apart from Hamilton&apos;s accident, it provided more evidence that they cannot match the pace of Red Bull and Ferrari and even a team renowned for their engineering resources will surely struggle to close the gap in time. With Sebastian Vettel coming second and Webber third, it was clearly a good night for Red Bull. In terms of the championship as a whole little has changed, although the five aces in this exotic deck have been subtly shuffled. Those five drivers are now separated by 25 points \u2013 it was 24 before the race. Alonso is nine points behind the leader, Webber, and he is followed by Hamilton, Vettel and Button. Alonso led from start to finish and, although overtaking is difficult here, it was still a tour de force piece of driving in a street race that lasted two hours and was particularly punishing on brakes. In the final laps he also had to hold off a charge from Vettel. Even the emergence of the safety car as early as the third lap did not disguise the fact that the first half of the race was mundane, certainly by the riveting standards of this compelling season. Then, under the flaring floodlights and in the humidity which is strong enough to persuade one that it is raining even when it is not, the noisy squabble warmed up. The unlikely catalyst for this change was Kamui Kobayashi, who first nudged Michael Schumacher into a wall and then, on the 32nd lap, produced an example of Japanese hara-kiri when he drove his Sauber into Anderson Bridge. The HRT belonging to Bruno Senna then ploughed into Kobayashi and the safety car made a second appearance to tighten up the parade. Webber came under pressure from Hamilton once the race restarted. At turn seven of the 36th lap the British driver made his move and had his nose ahead of the Australian but then was clipped by his rival just as he was about to complete the manoeuvre. The stewards immediately launched an investigation but it was dismissed as a racing incident. The race really hotted up on the penultimate lap when Heikki Kovalainen&apos;s Lotus burst into flames. One of the memories of the evening will be of the driver grabbing an extinguisher and putting out the flames himself. But no one could put out the beaming Alonso after the race. He said: &quot;I really love this track and, for whatever reason, it suits my driving style very well. Both years in Renault we weren&apos;t in Q3 in most of the championship but then we arrived in Singapore and were quickest. This is still a very special circuit for myself. &quot;We are very confident after a star performance here. This win means a lot to stay in the fight for the championship. We know there are four races to go. It seems we can be competitive in any track.&quot; He was flanked by the Red Bull pair, who looked equally pleased with their night&apos;s work. Webber, who had gambled by going into the pits early, said: &quot;My tyres were completely finished at the end \u2013 after 58 laps there was not much left of them.&quot; Vettel said: &quot;It can change very quickly. Look at Fernando. People have written him off twice in this championship but he is back now. The most important thing is consistency.&quot; He added, strangely: &quot;We are Red Bull and in a unique position and we are horny \u2013 can you say that in English?&quot; He just had."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/27/lewis-hamilton-singapore-grand-prix", "sentences": ["The McLaren driver, who was forced out of the Singapore grand prix after a collision with Mark Webber just after halfway and now trails the Australian by 20 points, looked dejected when asked about his championship chances."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-26T23:06:48Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton admits Formula One title hopes are in tatters", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Fernando Alonso", "Ferrari", "Mark Webber", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton admitted last night that he may have blown his chances of a second Formula One world championship after he failed to finish for the third time in four races.

Another bad weekend in the next race in Japan \u2013 and the fast Suzuka track could almost have been made to measure for the more powerful Red Bulls \u2013 will realistically end the team&apos;s interest in the title race. In recent weeks experts have been predicting a two-horse race between McLaren and Red Bull. At the moment, however, not only Red Bull but Ferrari have the edge on Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. Button today played the part of said knight when he said: &quot;There is no reason not to be positive. This was always going to be a difficult race for us. We were never going to be quick around here [Singapore] compared to the Red Bulls. In Hungary they were crazy quick.&quot; Button, who basically held his position in the five-man title race by coming fourth on Sunday, while Hamilton failed to finish for the third time in four races, was less specific when asked where McLaren needed to finish in the remaining four races. &quot;I don&apos;t know, I haven&apos;t done the calculations yet. But we have got to have a car that is very quick and we have got to be putting it on the front row. &quot;Mark Webber did not have a great race in Singapore but he was still able to get more points than us because of the pit-stop strategy and they were quicker than us basically. Fernando Alonso is quick, he has got a good advantage at the moment. We have got to get on the front row and that is what we have got to do in Japan. Korea is after Japan and none of us know what that is going to be like. Hopefully the race will go ahead,&quot; he said, referring to a FIA track inspection there next month. Button will be back to work in the team&apos;s simulator tomorrow. &quot;We have got a lot to go through for Suzuka,&quot; the reigning world champion said. &quot;We had upgrades at Singapore but we have also got a lot for Suzuka \u2013 some things that we couldn&apos;t use in Singapore for reliability reasons. Hopefully we will be able to use something similar for Suzuka, plus another big upgrade, so I am happy that we will be a lot more competitive in Japan.&quot; However, if Formula One represents the heavyweight division of motor sport, McLaren have looked too much like a cruiserweight in too many races this season. They have often been outpowered by Red Bull, and Ferrari&apos;s Fernando Alonso, who has the advantage of a rear gunner in Felipe Massa, is suddenly putting together the performances that everyone knew he was capable of. It is only because McLaren are probably the most resilient of all teams that no one can write them off. Ferrari&apos;s team principal, Stefano Domenicali, said today: &quot;This is the crucial moment of the season. We need to stay very cool and look forward to arriving in Japan with the perfect package in terms of car, in terms of preparation of the drivers, and also for the team because if you make a mistake you pay a lot.&quot; His Red Bull counterpart, Christian Horner, believes the title will not be decided until the final race in Abu Dhabi on 14\u00a0November. &quot;I think it is almost inevitable with the way the season has swung backwards and forwards that this will go right down to the wire in Abu Dhabi. I sincerely hope it doesn&apos;t and I sincerely hope it is one of our guys who ties it up before that. But the likelihood is that, with the quality of drivers and teams involved, it will go down to the wire.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/29/uk-us-fall-forbes-best-countries-business", "sentences": ["The other countries featuring in the top 10 are Canada (fourth), Singapore (fifth), Sweden (seventh) and Norway (eighth)."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-29T08:23:49Z", "title": "UK and US fall in Forbes's best countries for business ranking", "tags": ["Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "Denmark is still the best country in the world to do business, according to a Forbes report, but the US has dropped from second to ninth place, while Hong Kong has gone the other way. The UK has fallen from sixth to tenth place, replaced by Ireland, in Forbes&apos;s fifth annual ranking of the Best Countries for Business. The report noted that after Britain enjoyed the longest period of expansion on record \u2013 during which time growth outpaced most of western Europe \u2013 the global financial crisis hit the economy particularly hard in 2008, due to the importance of its financial sector. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business services, account, by far, for the largest proportion of GDP while industry continues to decline in importance. A high tax burden and a poor showing on trade and monetary freedom compared to many other developed nations were blamed for the drop in the US&apos;s ranking. Another major issue is that the business climate for entrepreneurs and investors in the world&apos;s largest economy, which is teetering on the edge of a double-dip recession, has fallen behind other countries. The 35% federal corporate tax rate is the highest of any OECD country, according to the Tax Foundation. One bright spot for America is that it still ranks first when it comes to innovation. By contrast, Hong Kong scored in the top three for taxes, investor protection and both trade and monetary freedom. Its economy has bounced back more quickly than others after it forged closer ties to China through tourism, trade and finance. The Hong Kong stock exchange is the place Chinese companies turn to when they want to list abroad. Despite its debt problems, Ireland moved up to sixth place from 14th thanks to a low tax burden and red tape. Indeed, Ireland has become a haven for British companies keen to cut their tax bills. Dublin&apos;s 12.5% corporation tax rate has attracted pharmaceutical firm Shire, engineering business Charter, Sir Martin Sorrell&apos;s advertising group WPP and the investment firm Henderson. New Zealand also improved its ranking, from fifth to third, after a series of free-market reforms. It came first for corruption (lack thereof), investor protection and red tape for starting a business. New Zealand also boasts the lowest ratio of public debt to GDP of any of the top 10 countries at 22%. Denmark has grabbed the top spot for the third year in a row. Denmark scored in the top five among all countries in four of the 11 categories considered as part of the ranking, including property rights, technology, corruption and personal freedom.

Leading researchers, including an Oxford professor of physics and a stem cell researcher seeking a cure for the commonest form of blindness, say they are poised to quit Britain. Meanwhile the heads of several prestigious universities warn that proposed government cuts to Britain&apos;s science budget threaten &quot;an insidious grinding down of the UK research community&quot;. This comes against a background in which universities say they are already struggling to attract the best candidates to important research and teaching posts, and warnings that this month&apos;s spending review could, according to some estimates, take as much as 25% out of Britain&apos;s total spending on scientific research. The Guardian has spoken to researchers in fields ranging from cancer and human fertility to nuclear physics, and found that many are preparing to emigrate. Professor Brian Foster, a particle physicist at Oxford, said he was likely to shift most of his research to Germany, having been offered a professorship at Hamburg University which comes with \u00a34.3m to spend on research. Dr Carlos Gias, a stem cell researcher at University College London, has decided to move either to Singapore or the US. Gias, whose research is focused on a form of blindness called age-related macular degeneration, said: &quot;I have seen people from this department leaving to Singapore, and they have been trying to find jobs in Britain and they couldn&apos;t. It&apos;s not been just one or two [but] several of them, and [in Singapore] \u2026 they don&apos;t have any problems of funding.&quot; Professor Don Nutbeam, vice-chancellor of Southampton University, said fears of cuts to the science budget and greater investment in countries such as Singapore, France and Germany would exacerbate the problem. He said that he expected a steady loss of researchers and believed that Britain&apos;s world ranking in research could be undone within five years. &quot;There will be an insidious grinding down of the UK research community if the sorts of cuts being talked about are enacted,&quot; he said. Even the most prestigious universities are concerned. Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, who will become the vice-chancellor of Cambridge tomorrow, said that while his university was relatively insulated by its status, he shared fears that Britain&apos;s international competitors were accelerating while Britain hit the brake. &quot;Young researchers will always look to see where there is the greatest opportunity to fund the science,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re not talking about salary levels. For many researchers it is about the infrastructure, the facilities, the capacity to grow their groups, and anything which undermines that is going to make it more difficult for institutions to recruit high-level people.&quot; Even at Cambridge, the best candidates for posts in neuroscience and aeronautics have been lured elsewhere because of generous start-up funding. &quot;Our competitors have resources to make available six-figure start-up packages for relatively junior staff; we can only do that, and at a stretch, for professorial staff,&quot; a Cambridge spokesman said. Major science funders have outlined areas of research that could be shut down if significant cuts materialise. The Medical Research Council is considering a withdrawal from cancer research to save \u00a3105m. The Science and Technology Facilities Council fears cuts could force it to mothball major laboratories such as the \u00a3145m ISIS neutron source in Oxfordshire. Britain&apos;s involvement in other international facilities, such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, is also threatened. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council will close down studentships to manage a minor reduction in funding and will rescind up to \u00a3135m of grants already awarded if cuts are deeper. Nick Wright, pro-vice chancellor for research at Newcastle University, said his institution was already having recruitment problems. &quot;I&apos;ve got recent direct experience sitting as the chair of a professorial recruitment panel and candidates from North America asking us whether UK research funding was going to be cut and what the prognosis was for the future,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to tell the truth and it&apos;s clear that disappoints them. I&apos;m talking about a candidate from a Canadian university working in medical research, where [funding] was one of the clinchers.&quot; Additional reporting by Ian Sample and Alok Jha"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/01/commonwealth-games-2010", "sentences": ["The full system and installation teams only arrived in India recently, officials said, because much of the equipment needed had been in use at the Youth Olympics in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-09-30T23:10:21Z", "title": "Commonwealth Games 2010: Arrival of electronic-timing equipment delayed", "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2010", "Sport", "International Olympic Committee", "Usain Bolt", "Jessica Ennis-Hill", "Commonwealth Games", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The crisis-hit Commonwealth Games faced new trouble yesterday even as the Queen&apos;s baton ended its 11\u2011month journey from Buckingham Palace and arrived in Delhi. According to news reports in Indian newspapers, crucial timing equipment has yet to be installed in venues. The Times of India reported that international technicians who are to fit the systems in time to be tested before competition starts in earnest on Monday were being denied access to venues because of problems with accreditation. The full system and installation teams only arrived in India recently, officials said, because much of the equipment needed had been in use at the Youth Olympics in Singapore. Cutting down rental costs was also a factor, the newspaper said. Caroline Searle, a spokeswoman for the England team, said she was unaware of the problem but &quot;the important thing was it was all working when it was needed&quot;. &quot;We are all really looking forward to the sports starting,&quot; Searle said. Almost 350 English athletes and officials have now arrived in India, with 200 more on the way. Last-minute efforts are still under way to finish preparations at the \u00a3150m athletes&apos; village in Delhi. Problems with flats destined for participants in the Games \u2013 described as &quot;unfit for human habitation&quot; by international officials \u2013 caused many teams to threaten to boycott the event. Searle, however, said the England team had &quot;no complaints&quot; about the accommodation. &quot;The food is really good. We are getting out to training. There are no major headaches at all,&quot; she said. Most venues now appear fully ready but for last\u2011minute work to clear rubbish or finish painting. In India, the Commonwealth Games remain controversial. Protesters took to the streets of the capital yesterday for a second straight day of demonstrations, demanding a boycott of the entire event. A coalition of more than 20 groups calling itself the &quot;Anti-Commonwealth Games Front&quot; marched holding placards reading &quot;boycott the poverty games&quot; and &quot;we want schools, not stadiums&quot;. Earlier in the week Indian activists, upset with what they claimed were racist remarks by the Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive, Mike Hooper, had burned an effigy of the New Zealander and shouted slogans. Carrying placards that said &quot;Racist Hooper Go Back&quot;, they claimed that Hooper had reportedly made remarks blaming the Indian population for poor preparation that included incomplete venues and unlivable conditions at the athletes&apos; village when some delegations began arriving last week. Hooper has denied making any offensive remarks. Heartened by apparent recent progress and despite the ongoing problems, dramatic cost overruns, allegations of corruption and the long delays in building venues, the organising committee chairman, Suresh Kalmadi, said he had not lost hope of bringing the Olympics to India. &quot;The biggest legacy [of the Commonwealth Games] is [the] Olympics,&quot; said Kalmadi, who heads the Indian Olympic Association. &quot;Cricket is the most popular sport in our country but it is played by just 10 countries. Olympics has all sports. We have to ensure that Olympics come up. This is our opportunity and CWG will help.&quot; The International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, is due to visit some Games sites today and will remain in Delhi for Sunday&apos;s opening ceremonies, when Prince Charles will represent the Queen and officially open the event, which runs until 14\u00a0October. A dispute over protocol with Indian officials who wanted the Indian president, Pratibha Patil, to take precedence has now been resolved. Meanwhile, Australia has lost two more members of its squad, with the reigning discus gold medallist Scott Martin forced to pull out due to a chest injury. The 26-year-old 100m hurdler Hayley Butler also withdrew to recover from stress fractures in both feet. The women&apos;s discus world champion Dani Samuels was among three Australians who withdrew last week citing concerns over security and health. She joined a long list of competitors who will not be present at the Games. Neither Usain Bolt, the world and Olympic 100m and 200m champion, nor Asafa Powell will be in Delhi. Other notable absentees include the South African 800m world champion Caster Semenya and the English world heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/01/us-style-bursaries-needed-uk-universities", "sentences": ["A number of British universities have established offshoots abroad; Imperial College became the latest to join the trend when it recently announced plans for a new medical school in Singapore, to be run jointly with a local institution."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-01T17:43:55Z", "title": "US-style bursaries needed for poorer students, says Cambridge head", "tags": ["University of Cambridge", "Tuition fees", "UK news"], "article": "Cambridge should move towards a US-style system of lavish bursaries so that students from the poorest homes are not deterred from studying there by fear of debt, the university&apos;s new vice-chancellor has said. Sir Leszek Borysiewicz&apos;s remarks in an interview with the Guardian come ahead of a review of tuition fees that is expected to recommend that universities should be allowed to raise fees to as much as \u00a37,000 a year. Cambridge has an existing bursary system, which assisted nearly 3,000 students in the last academic year, but the new vice-chancellor is keen to extend this safety net. A survey published earlier this year found that students at English universities had an average debt of just over \u00a35,000 per year of study. Borysiewicz, who became Cambridge&apos;s 345th vice-chancellor today, said: &quot;What I&apos;m really after at the end of the day is that nobody should be precluded from coming to Cambridge either because of concerns about family income streams or future indebtedness. That&apos;s the position I&apos;d like to achieve over a period of time.&quot; He added: &quot;We are different [from the US] because we do not necessarily have the endowments available to us of some of the major American universities, particularly the Ivy League universities, that can actually make up the gap. What we have to aspire to is to build up that endowment so that we can get as close as possible to that system. &quot;In between that we have to ensure that those who are most likely to be most adversely affected are the ones who have good access to what&apos;s available at Cambridge.&quot; The Ivy League charges high fees but couples that with generous bursaries, which fully cover the costs of less well-off students. The Russell Group of highly competitive British universities is keen for institutions here to be allowed to set their own fees, raising the prospect of creating a US-style elite. Bright children from the poorest homes are currently seven times less likely to go to a top university than their richer peers, according to the Office for Fair Access (Offa), an education watchdog. The disparity has worsened since the 1990s. Lord Browne, who is heading an inquiry into university finance, is expected to recommend that universities should be allowed to raise tuition fees, currently capped at \u00a33,290 a year, to between \u00a36,000 and \u00a37,000. Changes to fees and the way degrees are financed could be introduced as early as September 2011. Borysiewic, 59, who accompanied David Cameron on a trip to India in July, also said he wanted to build on Cambridge&apos;s existing overseas research links by expanding its collaboration with Indian universities. Stressing that he was speaking in a personal capacity about a notion that had not yet been debated within the university, he floated the prospect of establishing a joint venture with an Indian university. A number of British universities have established offshoots abroad; Imperial College became the latest to join the trend when it recently announced plans for a new medical school in Singapore, to be run jointly with a local institution. While he was &quot;not ruling out&quot; establishing a free-standing offshoot of Cambridge overseas, he favoured a joint venture. &quot;Cambridge University has a very strong brand and presence internationally. It is widely recognised wherever you go. My preference is always to work internationally with institutions that are equally strong rather than establishing offshoots. I think it is about partnership working. &quot;I was fortunate enough to be with the prime minister&apos;s delegation to India recently [and was] absolutely fascinated by what&apos;s capable to be delivered. The countries [in Asia] have huge strength in academic areas but also in academic opportunity as well; there are things that we can do jointly with institutions in India that we couldn&apos;t do alone in the UK. It&apos;s a marriage of strengths to be able to get to an end goal faster.&quot; The government is keen for British universities to expand into India, regarded as the biggest untapped market for exporting British higher education. Universities minister David Willetts told the Guardian: &quot;Developing closer educational links with India is a priority. I want to see British students being given the opportunity to go and study at Indian universities, and for it to count as part of their overall degree.&quot; There are currently 40,000 Indian students coming to study in the UK, compared with 500 British students going to India. &quot;There is potential to balance this out so that British students can gain experience of learning in a foreign country, something which employers greatly value,&quot; Willetts said. The new vice-chancellor, who began his career as a medical researcher and spent six months working in state hospitals in Gambia, also expressed an interest in building partnerships with developing countries to conduct research. &quot;There are new academic opportunities around the science around developing countries. That really can be taken advantage of. That&apos;s something I&apos;m looking for, not actually financial advantage but broadening the horizons of staff here in Cambridge.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/02/different-sky-meira-chand-review", "sentences": ["Her eighth novel is a panoramic page-turner set in colonial Singapore.", "Like JG Farrell&apos;s The Singapore Grip, A Different Sky leads up to the Japanese invasion described by Churchill as the &quot;largest capitulation in British history&quot;.", "Though the tycoon&apos;s generation looks back to China, Mei Lan&apos;s mother is English-educated Straits Chinese, and the often thwarted lovers gradually affirm roots in Singapore.", "For Krishna, Singapore is a &quot;transient place; it has no ancient culture; it is nobody&apos;s homeland.", "Enriched by oral histories, it stays true to the perspective of its prologue, which evokes those who voyaged over the China sea and the Indian ocean to make the &quot;pinprick&quot; of Singapore island their home."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-01T23:05:39Z", "title": "A Different Sky by Meira Chand | Book review", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "Meira Chand has for 30 years turned an outsider&apos;s acute eye on the societies in which she has lived in Asia, mainly Japan and India.

Yet the focus is less on the delusions of a faltering empire than on the turmoil of the brashly emergent city-state. Stretching from Chinatown riots in 1927 to pro-independence rallies during the Malayan emergency in the mid-1950s, the main thread is a tenacious, forbidden passion between a Eurasian boy and a Chinese girl. Howard Burns and Mei Lan cross paths as children when their bus is caught up in the first rioting sparked by Chinese communists. Howard&apos;s widowed mother Rose \u2013 born in Malacca of a &quot;confusing line of swarthy intermarriage&quot; stemming from Portuguese, Dutch, British and Irish men and Malay, Indian, Chinese and Ceylonese women \u2013 runs a boarding house for Englishmen on tours of duty, and combines Anglophilia with a love of local saltfish pickle. Across the storm canal is the villa of Mei Lan&apos;s tycoon grandfather, once a tin mine coolie, and his various wives. Though the tycoon&apos;s generation looks back to China, Mei Lan&apos;s mother is English-educated Straits Chinese, and the often thwarted lovers gradually affirm roots in Singapore. According to one lodger, the Eurasians, English-speaking Christians, &quot;push our pens for us&quot;. As Howard sees it, the men who followed Stamford Raffles had bred a hybrid &quot;race of mimic men trained to serve the new colony&quot;. Smiling at a blonde woman, Rose &quot;in reply received a cool stare of query&quot;. Howard chafes at such condescension towards &quot;locals&quot;, and neither he nor his sister Cynthia heed their mother&apos;s advice to &quot;keep to their own&quot;. When Cynthia&apos;s hazel eyes catch those of Wilfred Patterson, a newly arrived reporter on the Straits Times, an old hand warns him: &quot;A man&apos;s career is finished if he takes a dusky-skinned wife . . . you&apos;ll be cut dead by everyone who matters.&quot; As this stratified society faces wartime upheaval, intersecting characters signal shifting political affiliations. The upwardly mobile Raj Sherma, a recent arrival from India, ignores the boycott of Japanese goods following the invasion of Manchuria, and profits from the war. His friend Krishna openly backs the Japanese-allied Indian independence fighter Subhas Chandra Bose. But Howard signs up to fight the Japanese in the mangrove swamps before the ignominious surrender. When his mother&apos;s boarding house is requisitioned, he takes refuge with the communist guerrillas in the jungle, while Mei Lan, now a nurse, is brutally interrogated amid the atrocities of occupation. The novel traces the impact of the war on a region-wide ferment for freedom \u2013 including women&apos;s. As one of Howard&apos;s colleagues says: &quot;The British think they&apos;re returning to the old order of things. [But] if the Japanese could get the British out, then so can we.&quot; When Wilfred returns as a PoW from building the Thai-Burma railway, he is set upon by Malay nationalists. Meanwhile, in the rising lawyer Lee Kuan Yew, Howard discerns an &quot;impatience and intolerance in the shrewd chiselled face&quot;. There are subtle echoes between the characters&apos; need to forget in order to heal, and that of a nation built largely of diasporic peoples. For Krishna, Singapore is a &quot;transient place; it has no ancient culture; it is nobody&apos;s homeland. People come to make money, and then return home.&quot; Yet the opportunistic Raj comes to realise the limitations of an overriding &quot;determination to prosper&quot; . The epic sweep can be vertiginous \u2013 Mei Lan moves from tycoon&apos;s daughter and torture victim to Oxford-trained lawyer championing women&apos;s rights \u2013 with some overly neat plot devices. Yet this meticulously researched book is alive with engrossing detail, whether on the odour of Chinatown, the privations of a guerrilla camp or the appalling rituals of foot binding. Enriched by oral histories, it stays true to the perspective of its prologue, which evokes those who voyaged over the China sea and the Indian ocean to make the &quot;pinprick&quot; of Singapore island their home."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/03/diageo-roseisle-distillery-opens", "sentences": ["Sales in Spain and Singapore were down 5% and 9% respectively."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-03T19:38:56Z", "title": "Diageo opens the first major new whisky distillery for a generation", "tags": ["Diageo", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Scotland", "UK news", "Whisky", "Food & drink"], "article": "As visitors to Scotland&apos;s whisky trail wend their way amid the rugged beauty of the Highlands, they are more used to glimpsing the turrets of baronial mansions than outcrops of sleek modernism.

The new distillery is a symbol of optimism for the industry after the uncertainty of the global economic downturn. The scotch industry had been riding high when the financial crisis hit and the subsequent collapse in demand in 2009 ricocheted through important markets like South Korea, where sales contracted by almost 25%. Sales in Spain and Singapore were down 5% and 9% respectively. There was also evidence of drinkers trading down to cheaper spirits \u2013 such as hard-up Russians returning to vodka. David Gates, global category director for whiskies at Diageo, says emerging markets are leading the recovery: &quot;The places we&apos;re seeing demand pick up quickest are Asia, Latin America and parts of eastern Europe. Southern Europe is more concerning because Spain and Greece, which are big scotch markets, remain in very difficult economic situations.&quot; Whisky sales in 2009 see-sawed, with the weak first half followed by a strong rebound, an effect that resulted in a fourth year of record exports, up 3% at \u00a33.1bn. Gates says that while the financial crisis was a rollercoaster ride it has not been a permanent setback for the industry. &quot;The bounce back was much bigger and quicker than everyone thought,&quot; he says. &quot;If we look at our sales predictions from three years ago we are back where we expected to be. The economic crisis caused us to take a deep breath and consider whether it would affect long term projections but within a year we were back feeling comfortable again.&quot; Headache The vagaries of global demand give drinks companies like Diageo a headache as often at the darkest hour they have to predict the level of demand for blends such as Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B and Bells a decade ahead, when the current crisis will be just another page in economic history. Hence the investment in Roseisle. &quot;We know the growth in scotch is going to be strong,&quot; Gates says. The wrong decision cannot be easily corrected \u2013 at the moment Diageo&apos;s Lagavulin is in short supply so its marketers have had to switch focus to other malts such as Caol Ila instead. Legally it takes three years for the &quot;new make&quot; to even earn the name whisky and London will be hosting the Olympics before the first dram from Roseisle&apos;s stills makes the grade. At full pelt, Roseisle will produce 10m litres of spirits a year. Before it opened Diageo&apos;s largest malt distillery was Dufftown which produces 6m litres. Test production began last year but all 14 stills are now operational. It is Diageo&apos;s 28th malt distillery and a leading piece in the jigsaw of a \u00a3600m restructuring that proved controversial, The expansion at Roseisle, where Diageo is trying to make production carbon neutral with features such as a \u00a314m biomass plant, is set against the planned closure of its packaging plant in Kilmarnock. The renaissance of Scotland&apos;s whisky industry has had little to do with Scottish consumption. Drinks groups have concentrated on the emerging middle-class in countries such as Brazil, where sales shot up 44% last year. In Mexico whisky sales were up 25% as locals defected from tequila. Even in the US where Buchanan&apos;s is the fastest growing whisky brand, this is down to its popularity with the Hispanic community. Although a very profitable market, UK sales were lacklustre at the last count when compared with global scotch sales growth of 5%, but Gates says &quot;bollocks to that&quot; and is determined to rekindle interest. &quot;We have had a lost generation who opted out because they didn&apos;t want to drink their father&apos;s drink but there are early signs that scotch could be cool again. Against a backdrop of potentially devastating public sector job cuts in Scotland, likened by one MSP to the closure of a Ravenscraig steelworks every two weeks, Diageo is not the only company investing in the industry. David Williamson, public affairs manager at the Scottish Whisky Association, says five smaller new distilleries other than Roseisle, have been built since 2005. The projects include Kilchoman on Islay and William Grant&apos;s Ailsa Bay at Girvan. Distilling capacity has also been increased at The Glenlivet, which is owned by Chivas Brothers, and The Macallan, part of the Edrington Group. Investment There has also been substantial investment in bottling and warehousing \u2013 John Dewar&apos;s owner Bacardi has built a new warehousing facility at Poneil in the Douglas Valley. &quot;We are aware of plans for seven new distilleries which are at different stages of development,&quot; said Williamson. He said in recent weeks planning permission had been granted for new distilleries at Annandale and Falkirk. Diageo chief executive Paul Walsh has hinted at the possible need for another distillery in three to four years but the company said no planning applications were currently being progressed. Roseisle has been built to support Diageo&apos;s blended whiskies but has not ruled out bottling the whisky as a single malt. &quot;I don&apos;t really know what it will taste like yet,&quot; admits Diageo master blender Douglas Murray as he noses the &quot;new make&quot;. &quot;It reminds me of the smell you get when you walk on a lawn after it&apos;s been raining. The character will depend on the marriage of the wood (of the casks it is aged in) and the distillery but I know it will be good.&quot;\ufffd \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2010.

Breathtakingly patrician, the Frenchman was said to have both Napoleon and the Marquis de Sade in his family tree. By contrast, the father of 49-year-old Thomas Campbell, the Englishman who was his surprise successor, processed and traded plastics near Cambridge for a living. If De Montebello was taken to grandly monarchical statements (&quot;I\u00a0am the Met, the Met is me&quot; \u2013 a pun on Louis XIV&apos;s &quot;l&apos;\u00e9tat, c&apos;est moi&quot;), then Campbell is quite different. The director of arguably the most important museum in the world, he&apos;s softly spoken, slightly stiff at times, and just occasionally testy. &quot;Is this really relevant?&quot; he asks, when I benignly enquire whether he has siblings. When De Montebello announced his retirement, there was an immediate fever of speculation about who would take up his mantle. Campbell&apos;s was not among the names mentioned. He had been at the Met since 1995, working his way up the ranks to curator, specialising in Renaissance European tapestries: &quot;An amazing art form that had received so little attention from art historians, even though historically they had been so important.&quot; The appointment process evolved &quot;over a period of months. I&apos;m not sure it was brutal. It gave me plenty of time to think about what I might bring to the role.&quot; The trustees even met his wife \u2013 a fact that slightly shocks me. &quot;Yes, there was a dinner at which trustees met my wife: the role is partly a social role. But the fact that they wanted to meet her I don&apos;t think implies they were bringing any prejudices. They just wanted to meet her.&quot; Despite the surprise that met the announcement of his appointment, he was widely regarded as a sound choice for his impeccable scholarship and inside-out knowledge of the museum, even if he lacked the flash personal style of his predecessor. I ask him if he misses his tapestries. &quot;I do indeed,&quot; he says wistfully. &quot;I was about to start writing a book before the appointment. Now the days go by in a blur of meetings. I start at 8am and nearly every night there are receptions and dinners until late.&quot; His family (he and his wife have two children) have moved from their house outside the city to an apartment opposite the museum, on Fifth Avenue. Campbell speaks steadily, picking his words carefully. This is far from the waterfall of charismatic enthusiasm that marks any encounter with Campbell&apos;s nearest equivalent in Britain: Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum. Nonetheless, when Campbell \u2013 who has been in the post since early 2009 \u2013 is furnished with a coffee, he warms up, delivering a passionate advocacy of the direct encounter with objects that a visit to a museum provides. When I ask what he wants a visitor to get out of the Met, he says: &quot;If each person can find just one thing that&apos;s new to them and makes them want to come back, and makes them curious . . . In an age of instant media and visual overload, there is something profoundly nourishing to the human soul when you come face-to-face with an object, whether it is the product of a lifetime of craftsmanship or something more ephemeral; whether you are looking at it decades or centuries after its creation. That experience helps you understand who you are.&quot; This is particularly true, he says, of the experience a visitor can have at an &quot;encyclopaedic&quot; museum, showing works of art and objects from all cultures \u2013 the big three in the world being the Met, the Louvre and the British Museum, though he impishly remarks: &quot;The BM isn&apos;t a real encylopaedic museum.&quot; (By this he means the national collection of Old Masters is housed in the National\u00a0Gallery.) In fact, there are other instructive differences between the two institutions, highlighted when MacGregor declined to become a candidate for the Met directorship after De Montebello. At the time, he cited his continued desire to work in an institution that plays a broad role in British civil society. He said: &quot;The Met is not a public museum - whereas the British Museum is a public institution and the public museums of London have always been free to everyone.&quot; Culture as soft diplomacy This goes much further than the admissions policy. The British Museum has free entry, with a donations box placed discreetly near the entrance; the Metropolitan has an admissions desk administering a pay-what-you-wish policy, with a suggested adult price of $20 (\u00a312.60). The British Museum receives the bulk of its funds through the public purse; by contrast, the Met exists, and always has done, through the bounty of super-rich New York philanthropists. Governed by a group of extremely wealthy people, it inevitably (or so champions of the British system would argue) reflects a narrower set of concerns than a public\u00a0institution. Campbell believes, however, that the Met&apos;s support base is so widely spread among so many donors that no single voice could affect its mission. He adds, though, that this &quot;can be a problem for smaller institutions heavily dependent on one or two donors, whose personalities can play\u00a0a\u00a0big part in the direction of those\u00a0institutions&quot;. The Met, he expands, &quot;was founded as part of an idealistic vision of creating a place of learning for the arts, and that vision has been sustained by countless numbers of philanthropically minded Americans, primarily New Yorkers. That civic engagement remains an important and defining part of what we do.&quot; There is another difference: at times, the British Museum can seem to be almost an extension of British diplomacy \u2013 especially at moments when cultural alliances are formed with nations with whom we enjoy otherwise precarious relationships, such as Iran. &quot;In recent years, there has been a move to use culture as a means of soft diplomacy in Britain,&quot; says Campbell. &quot;Neil MacGregor and Mark Jones [director of the V&amp;A] have taken on a role as cultural ambassadors. In America, we are not subject to the political agenda of any administration. Our international relationships have always developed, and continue to develop, organically from the scholarly imperatives of our disciplines.&quot; Ouch. Nonetheless, Campbell is clear that while each system has its &quot;swings and roundabouts&quot;, there is no chance of Britain&apos;s arts institutions being able to adopt a US-style philanthropic model of funding, as culture secretary Jeremy Hunt has stated he would like them to do. &quot;The American model comes out of a long tradition,&quot; he says, &quot;and critically, is supported by the tax system: as a donor you can claim a large percentage of your gift, dollar for dollar, back against tax.&quot; (In the UK system, the donor receives less of a tax benefit.) He adds: &quot;It would be deeply naive to assume you could simply transfer the American model to Europe.&quot; Cuts and the markets&apos; collapse Campbell was born in Singapore and brought up in Houghton, a village in Cambridgeshire. One of three siblings, he inherited, he says, &quot;a modest artistic ability&quot; from his mother. He studied English at Oxford, and thought he wanted to direct plays for a living, but ended up taking an art history course at Christie&apos;s and then studying at the Courtauld Institute in London. In his mid-20s, he fell in love with tapestries. He is still close to a friend he met during those years, Simon Thurley, now chief executive of English Heritage. After the Courtauld, he undertook a project \u2013 funded by a commercial art dealer, since he could not get funding from an institution \u2013 to create a database of historic tapestries, which he worked on for seven years before being offered a job at the Met. One of the problems he faces is the museum&apos;s steep drop in income following the collapse of the markets in late 2008; income from the museum&apos;s endowment was badly hit. Staff numbers have been reduced from 2,600 to 2,200, by a combination of means including early retirement packages and &quot;natural wastage&quot;. A couple of exhibitions have been delayed, but, he says, none cancelled. Another fundamental task is to tackle &quot;the seismic shift&quot; towards digital media. He acknowledges that the Met has some catching up to do online. &quot;As the largest encyclopaedic museum in the world, we face a major challenge. We can&apos;t be as agile as smaller museums. My goal is that we should have a rich engagement online that caters to a general and scholarly audience and that can provide a seamless experience for people, whether they are up the road or on the other side of the world.&quot; The goal is to &quot;engage people with the objects themselves&quot;. Campbell has come into a difficult job at a difficult time. &quot;It is physically and mentally demanding,&quot; he says. &quot;I am changing gear all the time. I am exhausted by the end of each week.&quot; On the other hand, he does get to run the most spectacular museum in the world. As he says: &quot;What&apos;s to complain about?&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 4 October 2010. The original said in the UK system, a charitable donor does not receive tax benefit.

Both initiatives, which will be cross-promoted by print advertising, are intended to encourage people to view a series of online shorts telling real life stories of Aviva customers. This is a marked departure for the brand formerly known as Norwich Union. With high-profile ads, including a series of Paul Whitehouse commercials and a celebrity-packed rebranding campaign featuring Bruce Willis and Ringo Starr that cost a reported \u00a310m, Aviva was one of the UK&apos;s biggest TV advertisers last year. The new initiative has more to do with building loyalty than saving costs, explains Aviva&apos;s chief marketing officer, Amanda Mackenzie. &quot;In the current climate people are looking for all financial services to change,&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s a clear need to build trust. We believe we can do this by demonstrating our customers&apos; interests are at the heart of our business. On this occasion, social media offers the best way of doing just that.&quot; That said, Aviva, like any financial institution these days, is hedging its bets.

The satellite operator has dropped 18.5p to 650p following reports that US hedge fund Harbinger wanted to sell 10% of its 28% stake in the business. The suggestion was Harbinger would place the shares to raise cash to help develop a next generation telecoms network in the US. Investors have previously anticipated that Harbinger would make a full bid for Inmarsat at some point, once regulatory clearances had been gained. This speculation has supported Inmarsat shares for a while, and any suggestion Harbinger is a seller not a buyer puts them under pressure. Overall the FTSE 100 has dipped 27.04 points to 5565.86, with commodity companies among the main losers as oil and metal prices dip back from recent gains. Cairn Energy is 10.1p lower at 447p while BP - boosted last week by disposal hopes - has slipped 6.3p to 434.2p. There were reports that TNK-BP, the Russian joint venture half owned by BP, had offered to buy some of the company&apos;s assets in Vietnam and Venezuela. Among the miners Xstrata has fallen 17.5p to \u00a312.24, not helped by speculation that Singapore firm Sin-Tang Developments was planning a counter-bid to Xstrata&apos;s $416m offer for Australia&apos;s Sphere Minerals. Investors are also wary of the prospect of more quantitative easing from the US Federal Reserve, which has helped push gilts and bunds higher. Joel Kruger, currency strategist at Daily FX, said:  While most markets have been benefitting from the fallout in the US on the back of the prospects for another round of quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve, UK markets have relatively underperformed, with many feeling that the Bank of England will head in a similar direction to the Fed. The very possibility of quantitative easing in the UK has prevented the pound from joining in broader currency gains against the US dollar, with UK equities also failing to break higher and locked in some sideways trade.  Elsewhere Premier Foods has jumped 1.79p to 18p as investors had their first chance to react to the weekend&apos;s news that the company has received approaches for its Quorn business. The company is under pressure to make disposals to help cut its \u00a31.6bn debt, and analysts believe Quorn could be worth up to \u00a3250m. Martin Deboo at Investec said:  We think that this would be a good deal, assuming that it can be done on the right terms, which would materially de-leverage Premier&apos;s balance sheet. Given the rock bottom share price, we expect the speculation alone to be good for the shares this morning.

National Grid did it and saw its shares climb 12.5p to 553.5p, and so did debt-laden directories group Yell. In both cases investors felt the new men could help solve some of the troubles afflicting both companies. National Grid appointed Andrew Bonfield, former finance director at Cadbury until the Kraft takeover, to take over from Steve Lucas in November. Analysts said Bonfield&apos;s US experience - he also held the finance role at Bristol-Myers - would be useful given National Grid&apos;s current problems in the country, which include poor operational performances and an investigation by regulators into the way it handled expenses. The news came as energy regulator Ofgem unveiled a new price control regime to help pay for Britain&apos;s ageing infrastructure. Meanwhile Yell rose 1.03p to 15.5p as it said Tony Bates, formerly chief operating officer of telecoms group Colt and finance director of EMI Recorded Music, would join the company in November and become chief financial officer towards the end of that month. Yell, which is struggling against online competitors as well as its huge borrowings, said that Bates was instrumental in turning Colt from a cash burning to cash generative business, with no debts and with steadily increasing earnings. Investors were obviously hoping he could pull off the same trick at Yell. Overall though, with the Ryder Cup providing a distraction for traders, there was little enthusiasm for sharebuying, and the FTSE 100 ended 36.93 points lower at 5555.97. Continued worries about the troubled economies of Ireland, Greece and Portugal outweighed a bigger than expected rise in US pending home sales in August. US factory orders came in slightly worse than forecast, and analysts still expect the Federal Reserve to sanction further quantitative easing to support the US economy. News of stricter capital rules for Swiss banks did not help sentiment either. Later this week the US third quarter reporting season begins with Alcoa, while the widely followed non-farm payroll numbers are due on Friday. In the UK, Thursday will see the Bank of England&apos;s latest comments following its monthly rate setting meeting. Some traders suggested the market was also unsettled by George Osborne&apos;s speech at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, reinforcing the message of belt-tightening and cost cutting. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:  The London market was not enamoured by what the Chancellor had to say to his party conference and the more he talks about austerity, which the majority of the population believe is required to sort out our country&apos;s financial problems, the more likely it is that the markets will struggle. Whilst we voted to take the medicine now, when it actually comes to swallowing the pill we realise just how much pain there is to get through before the antidote works.  It would seem that investors continue to remain cautious during this month of October, as is often the case with the slight fear that history might repeat itself.   Miners were among the leading fallers as metal prices came off their best levels. Kazakhmys closed 38p lower at \u00a314.23 while Xstrata lost 32.5p to \u00a312.09, not helped by speculation that Singapore firm Sin-Tang Developments was planning a counter-bid to Xstrata&apos;s $416m offer for Australia&apos;s Sphere Minerals. But Wolseley rose 19p to \u00a316.01 as Credit Suisse began coverage of the building materials group with an outperform rating and a \u00a318.55 price target. Autonomy was steady at \u00a318.44 despite a Panmure Gordon buy recommendation after recent comments from chief executive Mike Lynch in a radio interview that the company - best known for its business software - wanted to move into the retail market. Panmure&apos;s George O&apos;Connor said:  In an interview with Gavin Evans, 28 September, on BBC World Service Autonomy, Lynch revealed .....&apos;We have a new technology that we will be selling to consumers&apos;. Lynch did not say exactly how Autonomy would enter the retail business. In our view, it is likely to be sooner rather than later.  Autonomy&apos;s customers are button-down large companies, banks and government. The promised move to the consumer market is not fraught with challenges \u2013 it is just fraught, yet, with it Autonomy addresses one of the key seismic shifts in IT \u2013 the consumerisation (or appleisation) of IT. Consumer technologies are percolating up to the business world, but in addition to the offer, route to market, and support structure the economics of &apos;consumer&apos; are new to Autonomy. What is Autonomy&apos;s game plan likely to be? In addition to developing a new product, we feel that it will swivel its Promote [marketing solutions] product from selling to business to selling to consumers, and functionally help consumers to make better e-commerce decisions.  If it was any other company we would raise a red flag but, in its big steps over the past decade, Autonomy has not put a foot wrong. Hence, we retain our buy.  Satellite group Inmarsat fell 13.5p to 655p but recovered from its worst levels. US hedge fund Harbinger, which owns around 28% of the business and had been widely expected to bid for the rest, confirmed weekend reports that it was considering all options regarding its stake but said no decision had been reached. The reports said Harbinger wanted to sell at least part of the shareholding to help fund the construction of a new telecoms network in the US. Premier Foods added 1.69p to 17.9p after its confirmation it had received offers for its non-meat Quorn business. But Clive Black at Shore Capital kept his sell recommendation on the company:  The rational for the disposal of Quorn and any other of the multitude of Premier brands is reasonably clear; debt and massive pension liabilities. Covering those burdens will be no mean feat and we continue to harbour doubts as to whether or not Premier&apos;s equity value is positive. If a disposal route does not reduce the millstone&apos;s around the company&apos;s corporate neck then we may yet see a deep discounted equity issue to bolster the balance sheet, perhaps with further senior management change. With such a context, we retain our long standing sell stance on Premier Foods equity. We await trading news from the company but we harbour considerable doubts about upgrades, indeed the increase in wheat prices causes us concern as to whether or not Hovis in particular can achieve full cost recovery from the retail trade.   Lower down the market Rockhopper Exploration, currently searching for oil in the Falklands, dropped 18.5p to 441.5p following speculation of a $150m-$200m cash call to fund more wells. David Farrell at Evolution Securities said:  Our current assumption is that Rockhopper drills four further wells next year (two appraisal, two exploration) which would be consistent with the lower end of the $150-$200m rights issue that Rockhopper is reported to be planning. The shares of North Falkland based companies have had an exceptional run recently and with Rockhopper up 50% in the last month (and a result from the Rachel well due by early November) we would expect a rights issue sooner rather than later.   Meanwhile Faroe Petroleum fell 0.5p to 199.5p despite industry talk that the UK government had given the go ahead to the Chevron operated Lagavulin exploration well in the West of Shetlands area, where Faroe has 10% interest. Deltex Medical added 4.5p to 17.75p after a positive endorsement for its CardioQ-ODM monitoring system from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Finally, Focus Solutions jumped 22p to 76p following news of its biggest contract with to date, a \u00a310m deal to supply its software to a leading global bank. The agreement could be worth another \u00a310m over the next five years, and will help the bank meet the regulatory requirements of the Financial Services Authority&apos;s Retail Distribution Review."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/oct/05/commonwealth-games-2010-delhi-5-october", "sentences": ["Malaysia and Singapore have two.", "Malaysia and Singapore have two.", "12.18pm: After a rush of events, here is the latest medals table: Total medals:18 - Australia9 - England8 - India Golds:8 - Australia2 - England, India, Malaysia, Singapore  12.16pm: Especially for Claire Balding, here are the words to Jerusalem:  And did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England&apos;s mountains green?And was the holy Lamb of GodOn England&apos;s pleasant pastures seen?And did the Countenance DivineShine forth upon our clouded hills?And was Jerusalem builded hereAmong those dark Satanic mills?"], "publicationDate": "2010-10-05T08:17:55Z", "title": "Commonwealth Games 2010 blog: 5 October \u2013 as it happened | Steve Busfield", "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2010", "Sport", "Commonwealth Games"], "article": "      5.24pm: The main points of the day:  \u2022 A surge of medals in the pool and on the bicycle track see Australia well clear in the medals table.

Meanwhile, this tweet from BBC reporter James Pearce: &quot;I&apos;m afraid many will be shocked by TV pictures on 6 o&apos;clock news of state of athletics track&quot;      Anil Kumar of India (L) throws Hassene Fkiri of Australia (R) shortly before the Aussie was disqualified and then stripped of his silver medal Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images    4.33pm: Australia have one less medal because wrestler Hassene Fkiri has been stripped of his 96kg Greco-Roman wrestling silver for making an obscene gesture to officials. The Tunisian-born Fkiri was disqualified midway through his medal bout with Anil Kumar and was so furious with the decision he refused to shake hands with the Indian or the referee. Despite the disqualification, he would still have won the medal, but then gave a one-finger salute to the officials. Fkiri wrestled for Tunisia at the 2000 Sydney Games. NDTV quotes Australian coach Kuldi Bassi as saying: &quot;He&apos;s a very nice person normally. He&apos;s very good, win or lose. He wasn&apos;t unhappy at all (before the fight) -- he was happy to be representing his country. The Indian (Kumar) upset him a bit and was pulling his neck. I told him that was what was going to happen and I think he just lost control. It&apos;s very sad and it&apos;s bad for the country.&quot;           4.25pm: Thanks to Penny and Greg for covering, Steve back in the chair....  4.15pm: Over on the squash courts Canada&apos;s Shawn Delierre was seriously grumbling on the way to a 3-1 defeat to England&apos;s James Willstropp, calling for lets at every opportunity and regularly barging into Willstropp in order to gain an advantage. The Englishman, who is seeded at No2 at the Games, was expected to win and is staying on to bash the ball against the wall in frustration. Either that or he&apos;ll have to have a session of handbags with Delierre in the locker rooms.  3.56pm: Harding completes his 5-1 victory. It could have been a far greater score, with some of the Welshman&apos;s better shots not being recorded bny the judges.  3.49pm: Harding is 5-1 up now. He&apos;s landed some seriously powerful left hooks and uppercuts against Ahmed and I&apos;m surprised the Ghanaian is still standing. Earlier on in the day England&apos;s Anthony Anthony Ogogo made a great start.  Anthony Ogogo made short work of Andrew Kometa of the Kiribati Islands with a second round stoppage to make it two out of two for England&apos;s boxers on the opening day of competition. After edging two points clear in the first round Ogogo opened up in the second, chopping a right to force Kometa to take a standing count then pouring in with right hands until the referee waved the contest off.Ogogo said: &quot;The first one&apos;s always going to be nerve-racking but everyone gets nervous, from Ricky Hatton to Lennox Lewis. It was a massive occasion for me and I tried to keep a level head.&quot;This is my big chance. I&apos;ve been dreaming, sleeping, eating and drinking the Commonwealth Games. I want to become known as a boxing superstar rather for any of the other stuff I&apos;ve done.&quot;Northern Ireland middleweight Eamonn O&apos;Kane scored a comfortable 5-0 points win over Sri Lanka&apos;s Ranil Jayathilkage.        3.45pm: Hello, Gregg Roughley here. I&apos;m covering for Steve Busfield while he&apos;s otherwise engaged. Over in the boxing arena Kieran Harding of Wales has got off to a very good start against his Ghanaian opponent Habib Ahmed in the 75kg category. He&apos;s taken a two-point lead after an aggressive start to the first round and has now forced a second-round eight-count after a flurry of powerful combinations.  3.33pm: News from the wires on the bomb scare in Delhi earlier, which was, it turns out, a hoax.   An anonymous call to Delhi police claiming that a bomb had been placed inside the Commonwealth Games athletes&apos; village proved to be a hoax. Delhi police detained a boy who allegedly made the call to the police control room at around 2.30pm local time (10.00BST). The call prompted a security check at the residential complex, which hosts about 7,000 athletes. Dog squads and bomb disposal teams surveyed the area, which has 14 blocks, 34 towers and 1,168 air-conditioned apartments, a senior police official told the Press Trust of India. The office said a two-hour long check yielded nothing and the call was declared a hoax. Following the call, bomb disposal teams and dog squads conducted precautionary searches at the main press centre in Pragati Maidan and other venues. &quot;The boy was arrested after our technical surveillance team tracked his mobile number. He wanted to get some of his friends into trouble and so made the call,&quot; the official said.    3.24pm: A tight, and very humid, match in the women&apos;s hockey ends South Africa 2-1 Scotland. Scotland really needed a point from that to boost their chances of progressing from Group A, but South Africa survived second-half pressure from the noisily supported Scots, who made a few tired challenges, although their keeper made a great toe-punt stop in the last minute to keep the score down. Scotland sit fourth in the group and realistically need to beat Australia to qualify. It reminds me of when I was standing on the sidelines watching a hockey game on the astroturf before my football training started. There really is no pain like a hockey ball hitting your ankle bone at full speed.  3.08pm: Here are the thoughts of Laura Edwards, silver medallist in the gymnastics.   &quot;It&apos;s amazing, I can&apos;t believe it. We just wanted to try our best we could and see where we came.&quot;  Charlotte Lindsley added:   &quot;I&apos;ve never been on a podium before - it&apos;s a new experience in my first major championships. It&apos;s really good.&quot;  Becky Wing was named in the England team but was unable to compete due to sickness, with Lindsley stepped up to perform the floor routine instead. Today&apos;s team event doubled as qualifying for tomorrow&apos;s all-around final, and Thursday and Friday&apos;s individual apparatus finals. Imogen Cairns has qualified for the all-around final in third place behind Australia&apos;s Lauren Mitchell and Emily Little, while Jocelyn Hunt progressed in fourth. Edwards was seventh, so makes the all-around final, but Lindsley misses out despite coming 11th as only three gymnasts from each nation can progress.  2.53pm: It may not quite offer the thrills of an England v Wales rugby showdown but there&apos;s an intense contest going on in the Yamuna sports complex between Daniel Reed of England and Stephen Jenkins of Wales in the table tennis. The poor umpire keeps getting splashed with sweat. Jenkins blows on the ball \u2013 is that allowed? \u2013 but sends his return long, and Reed wins the contest 3-2. &quot;The fire of the Welsh dragon extinguished.&quot; Thank you for that, BBC commentator. This was the men&apos;s team event, so they beat Wales 3-0, putting them top of Group 3. On route to the quarters ...       2.43pm: Penny here as Steve takes a break. Another medal for England! This time a silver in the women&apos;s team gymnastics. No Beth Tweddle but Charlotte Lindsley, Jocelyn Hunt, Imogen Cairns and Laura Edwards were beaten to the gold medal by Australia (who else?), who totalled 163.700 points across the apparatus \u2013 vault, asymmetric bars, floor and beam. England collected 158.200 points and Canada took bronze with 154.750.      Gold    2.20pm: And India has claimed its fourth gold medal of the day, with Sanjay beating South Africa&apos;s Brian Richard Addinall in the final of the 74kg Greco-Roman style. It&apos;s always good news for an event when the host nation does well, raising the profile, stirring excitement, bringing bigger crowds etc etc  2.07pm: With the athletics due to start tomorrow, the BBC is reporting on last-minute repairs being made to the track and that the in-field has only been half-laid with grass. Former Olympic champion Jonathan Edwards says:   This is a culture where things are got ready at the last minute but there are very real concerns. There is a feeling that there are a lot of people working here but no real sense of urgency. They&apos;re relaying part of the track which I think was damaged during the opening ceremony. I&apos;ve seen a number of athletes come in and I think they&apos;re in shock. For a top athlete coming into a stadium this is not what you expect. It&apos;s beyond anything I imagined. Hopefully it will be ready to go tomorrow for the first session.   2.04pm: England beat Wales 4-1 in the women&apos;s hockey, with Crista Cullen scoring a hat-trick.  1.57pm: India have claimed a third gold, with Ravinder Kumar winning the Greco-Roman 60kg event beating Terence Bosson of England 2-0, 5-0       1.27pm: So, here are the highlights so far today: \u2022 Australia now have 8 gold medals - and 19 in total - to lead the medals table.  \u2022 Host nation India claimed its first two golds, in the shooting. \u2022 England claimed it&apos;s first two goals, in the swimming pool. \u2022 But was then engulfed in debate over whether Jerusalem is right to be played as the national anthem. Have your say in our poll. \u2022 Scotland also win first gold, to join Canada, South Africa and Nigeria on the one gold mark. Malaysia and Singapore have two. \u2022 India beat Australia by one wicket, with Laxman guiding them home....ok, so that wasn&apos;t actually at the Commonwealth Games, but it was very exciting and just have a look at Googletrends I&apos;m just going to grab a bite to eat and then I will try to catch up on some of the other events that have been going on today.             1.20pm: Here is a singalong version of Flower of Scotland so you can, er, singalong to Robbie Renwick collecting his gold medal. The Scottish athletes themselves chose Flower of Scotland as their anthem by quite a weighty margin, beating Scotland the Brave, 211-15. Scotland the Brave had been used at every Games since 1958.  1.14pm: We have a poll: What should the English national anthem be?  1.03pm: In the interests of balance, Lynne from Melbourne emails again: &quot;To be fair to Australian TV coverage, they just showed Renwick&apos;s excellent win AND they interviewed him. Looking forward to hearing the Scottish anthem - really hope it&apos;s something by the Proclaimers.&quot;      And, as Spandau Ballet would sing: Gold!    12.55pm: Renwick of Scotland wins Gold.Monk and Fraser-Holmes of Australia come second and third.  12.54pm: Halfway and Carry of Scotland and Davenport of England are in front, but it&apos;s very tight.  12.52pm: Men&apos;s 200m freestyle final: Aussies won&apos;t get a 1-2-3 I can confidently say because there are only two Aussies in this race, plus two English, two Scots, a South African and a Canadian.  12.51pm: The organisers are &quot;working on&quot; the problem of empty seats, apparently.  12.44pm: Wading into the English national anthem debate, another Brit in Oz, Bev in Sydney, emails to say: &quot;I&apos;m English too and Fran looked as confused as I felt when they played that really long version of Jerusalem.&quot;  12.41pm: One more final in the pool yet to come: the Men&apos;s 200m Freestyle.  12.18pm: After a rush of events, here is the latest medals table: Total medals:18 - Australia9 - England8 - India Golds:8 - Australia2 - England, India, Malaysia, Singapore  12.16pm: Especially for Claire Balding, here are the words to Jerusalem:  And did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England&apos;s mountains green?And was the holy Lamb of GodOn England&apos;s pleasant pastures seen?And did the Countenance DivineShine forth upon our clouded hills?And was Jerusalem builded hereAmong those dark Satanic mills? Bring me my bow of burning gold:Bring me my arrows of desire:Bring me my spear: O clouds, unfold!Bring me my chariot of fire!I will not cease from mental fight,Nor shall my sword sleep in my handTill we have built JerusalemIn England&apos;s green and pleasant land.   12.13pm: It&apos;s the Para Sport 50m S9 Freestyle Women Finals Final. And South African Natalie Du Toit claims gold. Annabelle Williams claims silver and Stephanie Millward of England the bronze. Du Toit is normally a distance swimmer, so claiming the 50m is even more impressive.  12.12pm: I have an email from Lynne in Australia: &quot;I&apos;m a Brit watching the games on TV in Melbourne whilst reading your blog to find out what really happens, as only events where the Aussies win get any coverage. After the shock of England beating them in two consecutive events, they were totally bemused by the playing of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;. After shuffling their papers and consulting their ear pieces, they announced that the anthem playing was called &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, and the atheltes had chosen it from the soundtrack of &quot;Chariots of Fire.&quot; Australian TV - always funny, not always intentionally.&quot;             12.06pm: The version of Jerusalem playing at the Games was recorded by The Grimethorpe Colliery Band who became famous for providing the music in Yorkshire miners&apos; movie &quot;Brassed Off&quot;. I have the soundtrack album to that film: it&apos;s great.  11.59am: Fran Halsall, whose gold it was, says she would have preferred Land of Hope and Glory. I seem to remember that Team England had a vote on its website asking which song should be sung as the anthem. Indeed, found it, here is the result of the poll.  11.55am: Some shooting results, as per below-the-line requests: Pairs 25m Pistol Women: Gold India, Silver Australia, Bronze EnglandPairs 10m Air Rifle Men: Gold India, Silver England, Bronze Bangladesh  11.53am: Andy Bull, who seems to have conquered his technical glitches, is now both posting below the line and has written some more of his experiences: &quot;Chaos aside, the Commonwealth Games can still be a wonderful experience - For all the flaws, Delhi has made an enormous effort and the positives of being here are beginning to shine through.&quot;  11.49am: Claire Balding on the BBC says that they should be playing Land of Hope and Glory for England&apos;s golds because she knows the words. Personally, I know the words to Jerusalem better. What do you think?             11.42am: We&apos;re about to hear Jerusalem get its first podium outing. Jerusalem is the official English anthem at these games. Recreate the scene yourself by clicking on the Youtube clip above.  11.42am: Pickett gold, Leisel Jones of Australia picks up silver and Kate Heywood of England gets bronze  11.39am: And the winner is Pickett of Australia.  11.37am: And now it&apos;s the women&apos;s 50m breaststroke final. Again there are three Australians. And Andy Bull is updating below the line too....      Gold    11.35am: And another gold to England. Liam Tancock with a fast start wins relatively comfortably for such a short race. Australia again get silver and bronze.  11.33am: Now it&apos;s the men&apos;s 50m backstroke final. Featuring three Aussies, two Kiwis, and one each from England, Wales and Canada.  11.30am: So, England&apos;s first gold in the women&apos;s 50m butterfly, claimed by a distance of 0.03 seconds and a new British record. Australians Guehrer and Seebohm come second and third.      Gold    11.30am: Fran Halsall of England claims gold!  11.28am: First of a series of swimming finals, the women&apos;s 50m butterfly, featuring three Aussies, two English, two Canadian and one Welsh swimmer. The Australians have the central lanes and will be hoping for a 1-2-3.       11.26am: For the Scots out there, @sportscotland tweets:&quot;want a round up of yesterday&apos;s #cwg results from @team_scotland #tsdelhi? http://ow.ly/2OAXE&quot;  11.03am: Australia have just claimed the third (and final) gold medal of the day on the cycling track. Jack Bobridge held off New Zealander Jesse Sergeant to win the 4000m individual pursuit. So, all three cycling golds today for Australia. Most of Britain&apos;s best cyclists, however, are elsewhere.      The official weRengland twitter feed even tweets: &quot;No cycling medals this time as Aussies rule http://bit.ly/buXq7a #delhi2010 #CWG&quot;  10.58am: Five swimming finals coming up very shortly...  10.49am: Australia are back in the medals, picking up two early golds on the opening day of track cycling.  Anna Meares set a new Games record to defend her 500m time trial title in a 1-2 for Australia, with Kaarle McCulloch winning silver. Wales&apos; Becky James won bronze. Then Scott Sunderland added another Aussie gold, breaking Sir Chris Hoy&apos;s Commonwealth record in the men&apos;s 1000m time trial. Mohd Rizal Tisin of Malaysia was second and New Zealand&apos;s Eddie Dawkins claimed his country&apos;s first medal in third place. NineMSN quotes Meares&apos;s planning for London 2012: &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve reached my peak - I&apos;m only 27 currently and for a female track cyclist, you&apos;re looking at your late 20s, early 30s to get your peak performance. With another two years under my belt, I&apos;m quite confident - especially with rides like today - those little improvements are going to still happen.&quot; Meares is eyeing three gold medals in Delhi. She and McCulloch will be partners in the team sprint.  10.45am: Commonwealth Games organisers have ordered an inspection of all food at the athletes village after Australians fell ill after eating there, reports the Sydney Morning Herald, which adds:   Swimmers Ryan Napoleon and Rob Hurley, and swim coach Matt Brown, suffered a classic case of Delhi Belly on Sunday night after eating a meat bolognese pasta at the village dining hall.  &quot;Spaghetti bolognese&quot;. Is that really the food that creates a &quot;classic case of Delhi Belly&quot;?  10.31am: Back to Delhi, but keeping with the India v Australia theme: these two countries are now joint top of the medals table, with seven each. Australia has more golds (4-2). And I suspect that they will ratchet up a bunch more when the swimming finals resume shortly.      V.V.S Laxman guides India to a one wicket victory in Mohali. Picture: DIBYANGSHU SARKAR/AFP/Getty Images    10.14am: Given that most of you below the line want to talk about the cricket, here&apos;s a picture of VVS Laxman guiding India to victory over Australia, here&apos;s a story (which will be further updated), and here is the scorecard.      Gunning for gold: India's Abhinav Bindra prepares to shoot in the 10m air rifle pairs. Photograph: Manish Swarup/AP    10.03am: Not only have the Indian shootists claimed two golds, the 10m air rifle pair also broke their own Games record, set four years ago. The Times of India reports their impressive looking scores (if anyone would care to explain how this system works, please do so below):  World record holder Gagan...shot a spectecular sequence of 99, 100, 100, 99, 100, 100 to total a grand 598, while Beijing Olympic gold medalist, Bindra&apos;s series read 100, 98 ,99, 100, 99, 99 for a total of 595 in the first shooting event of the Games.    9.58am: Exciting news from Andy Bull in Delhi today: he&apos;s managed to smuggle his cigarettes in today. (Yesterday you may remember they were confiscated by security, leaving a man in severe nicotine withdrawal). Instead the overenthusiastic security men tried to confiscate his dictaphone with the phrase &quot;recording devices are not allowed, sir&quot;. Commonsense prevailed. Throughout the tournament we will bring you Andy&apos;s regular complaints.  9.34am: Maybe it&apos;s not going to be Australia&apos;s year. Maybe, just maybe it&apos;s going to be India&apos;s. At Mohali the Indian cricketers snuck home by one wicket and with a dubious umpiring decision at the last, mainly due to some great batting by Tendulkar and Laxman. And here in Delhi India has claimed it first and second gold medals of its home tournament. After Abhinav Bindra and Gagan Narang bagged gold for the men&apos;s 10m air rifle pair&apos;s event, Anisa Syyed and Rahi Sarnobat won second gold medal for India in 25m standard pistol pairs event.  9.27am: There will be a host of swimming finals, starting with the 50m women&apos;s butterfly, due to start at 4pm in India. Which by my reckoning is 11.30am BST. I think. At least according to this timezone map.      How much more of this will we see today? Australians celebrate gold at the first day of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. Photograph: REUTERS/Tim Wimborne      9.06am: Welcome to day two of the sporting action at the 2010 Commonwealth Games.  Action today includes a series of swimming finals, cycling, shooting and gymnastics. There&apos;s been much talk about the size of the crowds - small to negligible - and what could be done about it. There are suggestions of free tickets being given to children. But sport watching in India is a complicated business. Today has just seen the conclusion of an absolutely fascinating contest between the two best cricket teams in the world, watched by a very small crowd. If you want to catch up on day one&apos;s action, there was the liveblog and here is a gallery. And here is the schedule of today&apos;s events. Please share your thoughts and links below or email steve.busfield@guardian.co.uk or on Twitter."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/oct/05/kuala-lumpur-restaurants-top-10", "sentences": ["If this were Singapore, the old place would have been demolished years ago, but KL somehow preserves these quirky anomalies."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-05T14:26:00Z", "title": "Best budget eats in Kuala Lumpur", "tags": ["Kuala Lumpur holidays", "Malaysia holidays", "Asia", "Travel", "Food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Street food", "Restaurants", "City breaks", "Chinese food and drink"], "article": "When it comes to eating out, no city in Asia can compare to Kuala Lumpur for the variety of cuisine on offer, the quality of the products and the affordable prices. Malaysian food reflects the ethnic mix of the local population, spanning traditional Malay cooking, a dozen different Chinese regional cuisines, and Indian dishes that range from spicy south Indian vegetarian curries to rich Sikh dishes from the Punjab. Malaysians are serious foodies - just check out local blogs like feedmelah.com, friedchillies.com, awhiffoflemongrass.com and babeinthecitykl.blogspot.com - and although Malays don&apos;t eat pork, Indians refuse beef and some Chinese are strict vegetarians, food seems to unite people here. It is almost impossible to not eat well in KL, but here are 10 of the best places to track down. 1. Nasi Kandar Pelita     Twin Towers, Zon, Kuala Lumpur Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    Ever since the Twin Towers opened in 1998 (at the time as the world&apos;s tallest building), they have become the unofficial town centre - the Golden Triangle - surrounded by luxury hotels, gourmet restaurants and top-end shopping malls. But there are still some great, cheap places to eat around here, too. Nasi Kandar Pelita is one of the success stories of the Malaysian food industry, a one-shop family-business that now has over 50 outlets. Nasi Kandar is Indian Muslim cooking, where a large serving of rice is accompanied by dozens of different fiery curries. A hearty lunch here will cost \u00a33. But follow directions down a nearby backstreet for the Zon Hotel and there is an even better discovery, the outdoor Zon Food Court, which isn&apos;t in any guide book. This is traditional Malay cooking at its best - &quot;nasi campur&quot;, a choice of dishes laid out as a buffet that is utterly irresistible. Begin with a handful of raw vegetables to dip in homemade sambal sauce, don&apos;t miss the tangy beef rendang, curried cuttlefish, grilled and fried fish, and strange vegetables like bitter gourd and pucuk paku, a fern leaf that comes straight from the Malaysian jungle. \u2022 149 Jalan Ampang, +60 (0)3 2162 5532, pelita.com.my 2. Hakka Restaurant     Hakka Restaurant, Kuala Lumpur Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    Hakka cuisine from south-east China may not be as famous as Sichuan, Cantonese or Beijing food, but it is a firm favourite with Malaysians for its simple rustic dishes, strong on flavour rather than sauces and chilli. Nowhere is Hakka food better presented than at this vast open-air restaurant (which can serve a staggering 1,000 diners a night) in the sghadow of the Twin Towers. The restaurant has been open for 54 years and offers an extensive menu, including sizzling tofu with fermented beans, &quot;kangkong belacan&quot; (morning glory greens saut\u00e9ed in spicy shrimp paste), delicate potato leaves in oyster sauce, herbal chicken slow-cooked in a clay pot, and the amazing &quot;double cooked&quot; pork knuckle. Dishes start at around \u00a32 each. \u2022 90 Jalan Raja Chulan, +60 (0)3 2143 1907 3. Precious     Precious Restauarnt, Kuala Lumpur Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    Some of the most interesting dishes you will find in Malaysia come from Nyonya cuisine, an original form of fusion that dates back centuries to the cosmopolitan ports of Malacca and Penang where intermarriage between Chinese and Malays created a unique way of cooking. Nyonya food takes a great deal of preparation, so this is not something you find being hawked at street stalls. Book a table at Precious, a sumptuous restaurant on the first floor of KL&apos;s landmark Central Market building. In an ornate dining room filled with Oriental antiques, sample complex dishes like sour &quot;asam laksa&quot; soup, &quot;otak-otak&quot; (fish cake, chilli and galangal\u00a0steamed in banana leaf), &quot;acar awak&quot; (pickled vegetables smothered in crushed peanuts), and &quot;udang lemak&quot; (prawns cooked in a delicious rich coconut sauc). The place is not as expensive as it looks, and dinner should not be more than \u00a310. \u2022 1st Floor, Central Market, 10 Jalan Hang Kasturi, +60 (0)3 2273 7372 4. Coliseum Cafe     Coliseum Cafe, Kuala Lumpur Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    The Coliseum is no gourmet heaven, but every visitor to KL should come here for a meal or at least a drink at the bar, because walking through its saloon swing doors is like taking a step straight into a scene from a Somerset Maugham story. If this were Singapore, the old place would have been demolished years ago, but KL somehow preserves these quirky anomalies. Shuffling between the restaurant tables is a wizened Chinese waiter, dressed in what, many years ago, must have been an impeccably starched white uniform. This is Captain Ho, 89 years old and still serving Mrs Beeton favourites like Ox Tail or Mulligatawny soup, Welsh Rarebit, and the Coliseum special, Sizzling Steak, which sizzles so much on the hot plate that diners are obliged to endure a ritual of hiding behind a large white bib. Around \u00a310 a head and well worth it. \u2022 98-100 Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, +60 (0)3 2692 6270 5. Saravanaa Bhavan     Saravanaa Restauarant, Kula Lumpur Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    Take a quick cab ride out of the city centre to Bangsar, a formerly sleepy suburb that has been transformed over the past decade into a lively nightspot, with scores of bars, restaurants and clubs tightly grouped around a few streets. While hip locales like the Vineria (G-133, Bangsar Shopping Centre, 285 Jalan Maarof), La Bodega (16 Jalan Telawi 2, Bangsar) and Alexis Bistro (29 Jalan Telawi 3, Bangsar) offer everything from pasta and pizza to tapas and coq au vin, Bangsar has a great selection of Indian restaurants, too, many specialising in very hot south Indian vegetarian food, often traditionally served on a banana leaf and eaten with your fingers. Saravanaa looks rather smart, with white-jacketed waiters piling curry after curry around a mound of rice placed in the middle of the freshly-washed leaf. They will provide fork and spoon if you ask, but it really tastes better without. And don&apos;t eat too fast, as the waiters never stop coming round replenishing the curries. Be sure to order &quot;the tarik&quot;, milky tea that is theatrically poured from great heights to &quot;air&quot; it. The banana leaf meal costs \u00a31.50 \u2022 52 Jalan Maarof, Bangsar, +60 (0)3 2287 1208 6. Restoran Han Kee Bak Kut Teh     Jalan Sultan, Kuala Lumpur Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    Jalan Sultan is at the heart of KL&apos;s bustling Chinatown, just at the bottom of the chaotic Petaling street market. This is\u00a0street food paradise with both pavements packed with hawkers cooking over blazing woks, cauldrons bubbling away, and hungry diners sitting on metal stools ordering different dishes from each stall. Although you can eat at lunchtime, things begin to get serious when the sun goes down and the place is packed till the early morning. Each stall has its own speciality - delicate &quot;popiah&quot; spring rolls, claypot chicken with sticky rice, barbecued honey-glazed pork, sweet and sour &quot;rojak&quot; vegetables, tender Hainanese chicken rice, wonton noodle soup. Han Kee is almost a proper restaurant and has a bigger menu than most, but people come here especially for the &quot;bak kut teh&quot;, an amazing herbal broth served with small plates of pork ribs and intestines, crispy tofu,\u00a0and a pot of scalding-hot tea, all for \u00a32 \u2022 42 Jalan Sultan 7. Soo Kee&apos;s Son Restaurant     Soo Kee's Son Restaurant, Hokkien black mee Photograph: John Brunton    Locals still refer to Medan Imbi by its English name, Imbi Square, and this is another favourite night-time rendezvous for Malaysian foodies. One family has long dominated the Imbi food stalls, Soo Kee, who opened up back in the 1950s and whose 13 children have all gone on to be cooks and restaurant owners. The father&apos;s original stall is now run by a daughter, but the best food is served across the road by his son, Stanley, who slaves away for 10 hours a day. The cuisine here is all about noodles, and there are three key dishes to try. A plate of &quot;sang har mee&quot;, giant freshwater prawns on a bed of crispy mee noodles is not cheap for KL standards at about \u00a35, but is well worth the expense. Cantonese-style &quot;yee mee&quot; comes in a much creamier, eggy sauce, with a mix of spinach, squid and pork liver, while Hokkien black mee is made with a fat yellow noodle, wok-fried in squid ink with crunch pork crackling, prawns and pork, and must be eaten with two accompaniements - vinegary pickled green chilly and tons of finely chopped raw garlic. \u2022 29B Medan Imbi, +60 (0)3 2142 7752 8. Taman Paramount night market     Taman Paramount Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    Although KL-ites appear addicted to mall shopping, there is still a lot of nostalgia for the traditional &quot;pasar malam&quot; night market. Shopping and eating always go together here, and after families have got the week&apos;s groceries, it is time to choose a hawker stall for the evening&apos;s dinner. Every neighbourhood has a night market at least once a week, and a big favourite is to head out on a Sunday evening to Taman Paramount in the suburb of Petaling Jaya. In between the fresh fish, vegetables and exotic fruits, it is worth tracking down the famous Fatman Steamboat, a van converted into diner with 50 or 60 tasty tidbits, priced at 10-20p each, that you quickly\u00a0plunge into boiling water then dip in lethal chilli sauce. \u2022 Jalan 20/14, Paramount Gardens, Petaling Jaya 9. W.A.W. Restaurant\u00a0     Jalan Alor restaurant, Kuala Lumpur Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    Jalan Alor is at the heart of KL&apos;s backbacking budget hotels quarter, but the food stalls were thriving here long before the tourists arrived. Again, choice is limited during the day, and all the best hawkers start preparing their food from late afternoon and are open from 6pm until 4am. This is one of the best places in town to splash out on seafood, as even a plate of chilli crabs or huge succulent prawns steamed in Chinese wine won&apos;t set you back more than \u00a33-\u00a34. At the beginning of the street, stop off for satay or a portion of durian fruit, but save your appetite for\u00a0W.A.W. right at the end - definitely the most popular restaurant with locals. They are famous for crispy chicken wings, &quot;ikan bakar&quot;, stingray grilled in banana leaf, chilli &quot;lala&quot; clams, and fish such as\u00a0pomfret steamed with ginger or grouper cooked Teochew-style with smokey pork and tart preserved plums.\u00a0 \u2022 1-9 Jalan Alor, +60 (0)3 2144 2463 10. Pavilion Food Court     Pavillion cafe, Kuala Lumpur Photograph: John Brunton for the Guardian    Although there is none of the buzz that comes with getting outside in the sweltering 30\u00b0C tropical heat and discovering genuine street food at a hawker stall, there are dozens of futuristic shopping malls in KL with vast food courts where you can choose from 40-50 different restaurants. Here you eat in air-conditioned comfort and enjoy the same street favourites like &quot;char kuey teow&quot; fried noodles, &quot;curry laksa&quot; soup, &quot;roti canai&quot; Indian bread dunked in a spicy fish curry, delicate dim sum and eveyone&apos;s breakfast favourite,\u00a0 &quot;nasi lemak&quot; rice, steamed in coconut milk with crispy &quot;ikan bilis&quot; anchovies, curried egg, cucumber and peanuts.\u00a0 The newest, biggest, glitziest mall to open is The Pavilion, with its high-end boutiques such as Hermes and Rolex. But console yourself: a plate of Penang fried prawn noodles only costs \u00a31.50 at Thye Hong counter in the basement food court. Other food courts worth checking are Suria KLCC, by the Twin Towers, and the top floor of Sungei Wang, the River of Money mall. \u2022 168 Jalan Bukit Bintang, pavilion-kl.com \u2022\u00a0All photographs by John Brunton"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/oct/06/commonwealth-games-2010-delhi-october-6", "sentences": ["Malaysia and Singapore have two."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-06T09:38:20Z", "title": "Commonwealth Games 2010 live blog: 6 October | Anna Kessel", "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2010", "Sport", "Commonwealth Games"], "article": " Reasons to tune in tomorrow: Athletics 100m finals - Montell Douglas and Katherine Endacott hope to perform in the women&apos;s event, while Mark Lewis Francis battles the Jamaicans in the men&apos;s. In the pool...Rebecca Adlington goes for gold in the 800m free final, while England&apos;s Jenna Randall and Olivia Allinson in the Synchro go in the duet free routine. Gymnastics... More medals are likely to come for the home nations in the finals of the men&apos;s individual floor, pommel horse and rings events, as well as the women&apos;s individual vault and uneven bars. In shooting... Stevan Walton and Steven Scott go for more gold in the men&apos;s double trap singles, having won gold in the men&apos;s double trap pairs today.  So....with the action over for another day, many thanks for joining me today with all of your comments and emails. I look forward to more debates on Batman masks, moths and whether Arsene Wenger only got his job because of a name similarity with his employers tomorrow on Day 4 of Delhi 2010. In the meantime here&apos;s a quick round up of today&apos;s highlights: \u2022 Yesterday&apos;s English gold medal winner in the pool, Fran Halsall, added a bronze in the 100m freestyle to her haul but complained of an upset stomach and was ready to throw up as soon as she finished the race. And there was a different kind of upset in the 100m backstroke as Australia&apos;s Emily Seebohm set a new Commonwealth Games record to take gold and ahead of England&apos;s World and European Champion Gemma Spofforth. Canada&apos;s Julia Wilkinson took bronze.  \u2022 Myroslav Dykun won England&apos;s first Commonwealth gold in the Greco-Roman wrestling since Noel Loban in 1986. The 27-year-old former Ukrainian, who moved to the UK seven years ago has two national championship titles to his name. There was also gold for England at the shooting range with Steven Scott and Stevan Walton in the men&apos;s double trap.  \u2022 There were two major firsts in the pool as both India and Kenya won their first ever swimming medals! Kenya won gold, Jason Dunford finishing first in the 50m butterfly, while Prasanta Karmaker finished third for the host nation in the S9 50m freestyle. Australian Matthew Cowdrey won gold setting a new world record.  \u2022 England&apos;s 16 year old weightlifter, Zoe Smith, took bronze in the women&apos;s 58kg, a fantastic feat for the London schoolgirl who lifted 188kg. India&apos;s Renu Yumnam Bala\u00a0took gold lifting 197kg, Australia&apos;s Seen Lee won the silver medal lifting 192kg.  \u2022 There was success for England&apos;s gymnasts \u2013 even without the big guns, currently preparing for the World Champs - with an all-England one-two in the men&apos;s individual all-around competition. Luke Folwell scored 85.550 to take gold and teammate Reiss Beckford won silver with an overall 85.450. Australia&apos;s Josh Jeffris won bronze scoring 84.750. \u2022 In athletics a scintillating final lap got the blue ribbon event of the Games off to a great start as Uganda&apos;s Moses Kipsiro battled with Elliott Kipchoge of Kenya in the men&apos;s 5,000m. England&apos;s Chris Thompson put in a brave performance, but faded in the last lap to finish in fifth place.  \u2022 Medal table update: A quick glance at the medal table shows that Australia are still in the lead \u2013 by a mile \u2013 with a total 46 medals. India remain second with 21, while England are in third place also with 21 (but less gold medals than India&apos;s tally).  4.34pm: Argh I said I wouldn&apos;t moan, but it is really annoying watching the gymnastics and the seats all look empty! Australia&apos;s Lauren Mitchell even did a floor routine to indian sounding music (instead of the usual dross, great choice). Australia have won a top 3 in the women&apos;s all around by the way.  4.24pm: A pic of Batman should appear soon....meanwhile we&apos;re back on gymnastics highlights here....England&apos;s women in action.  4.13pm: Deabte on BBC over McKenzie&apos;s Batman mask - is it genius and entertaining? Or is it holding back his performance? Michael Johnson says, &quot;C&apos;mon, seriously? It&apos;s ridiculous.&quot; [in that amazing deep voice of his!] Denise Lewis concurs, &quot;It&apos;s ridiculous.&quot; What do you think?  4.07pm: ps great quote from England&apos;s Chris Thompson (he&apos;s a regular quote a minute, brilliant!) talking about the final lap of the men&apos;s 5,000m final.   &quot;I ran 58, they ran 53 which means I have to find five seconds in the next year, and I bloody will do it.&quot;   4.03pm: Round 2, heat 3 of the men&apos;s 100m and the Nigerian - Oghoghene - has stormed that in 10.13 seconds. The Jamaican junior who made such an impression at the Jamaican schools champs - Ramone McKenzie aka &apos;Batman&apos; because of the mask he likes to wear in competition - almost got left behind, just sneaking into third place to qualify.  4.00pm: Sean Ingle waves. And waves. Oh dear I am glued to these earphones. Eventually I realise and he tells me MLF has told BBC5live, &quot;put your money on me&quot; for a medal! Well, that was perhaps before he saw Oshane Bailey of Jamaica, the 21 year old who beat Michael Frater in the Jamaica championships this year, run a very easy 10.12seconds in his heat. Ladies, gents, we may have a contest on tomorrow....  3.54pm: MLF talks to the BBC: &quot;The hardest thing for me after the Europeans was staying focused. Because after winning silver there that was like being on cloud nine...I&apos;m just over the moon with how things are going...but even I don&apos;t know what I can achieve here.&quot;  3.50pm: Easy win for the Birmingham born star. MLF wins his heat in 10.20 seconds, he will be back out there tomorrow with the aim of getting a medal - should he make the final.  3.49pm: MLF (England&apos;s Mark Lewis Francis, not to be confused with furniture shops or compressed woodchip board) settling into the 100m blocks....  3.47pm: Brilliant! Chris Thompson is attributing his fifth place finish to &quot;an erect elephant&apos;s nose&quot; a gift that he kept by his bedside. (Actually it&apos;s a raised elephant&apos;s nose, but that naughty Thommo loves an innuendo as anyone who remembers his press conference at the Europeans can testify to....)  3.40pm: Wow that was all the way to the line! Great finish to the 5,000m. Moses Kipsiro of Uganda managed to shrug off the challenge and hang onto his lead, crossing the line in 13minutes 31.25seconds, Elliott Kipchoge of Kenya came second. England&apos;s Thompson was fifth. Had Mo Farah been there he surely would have had a great chance to take gold (his pb is 12:57.94).  3.39pm: Thompson struggling to hold onto Birmingham of Australia, the only non African, in that front group of 5. It&apos;s a real race on now with Kipseiro the Ugandabn and Kipchoge the Kenyan battling it with 200m to go!  3.38pm: Less than 3 laps to go in the 5,000m final but Chris Thompson is hanging in there, running on the shoulder in 4th place behind the Kenyans.  3.26pm: And now for the men&apos;s 5,000m final. Had Mo Farah been here would he have medalled...? Find out in about 13 minutes. (In the meantime Chris Thompson, Mo&apos;s mate who won European silver in the 10,000m, is in the mix)  3.24pm: Pbbbb! Love Ian Kernott on the dad jokes, re Arsene managing Arsenal cos of his name. &quot;It might have swung it in the end, it is very apt, to replace Brucie Rioch and all the good work he had done, you never know.&quot;  3.20pm: Msg from Gary Naylor, &quot;Does anyone know what the stadium will be used for after the Games finishes? Apart from Twenty20 cricket, it&apos;s surely redundant.&quot; Well, not if they win the 2020 Olympic bid Gary....  3.14pm: England&apos;s 400m runner, Vicky Barr, has described the track as &quot;obviously not perfect&quot;, but I imagine Charles van Commenee gave them all a stern talking to about just how much they will be allowed to moan to the media about anything that&apos;s not quite right....  3.08pm: Ian from Newton Abbot has emailed in with a football analogy for the CGW.... &quot;Maybe dub it the carling cup of athletics and get Arsene Wenger as patron, and do you think he became Arsenal manager due to his name also?&quot;Um no, I don&apos;t think that Ian. Was that a serious question?  2.58pm: From Gary Naylor, &quot;Can&apos;t get rid of the Commonwealth Games - that would leave only the extremely important CHOGM (Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting) for junketing! PS anyone know how many BBC staff are in Delhi?&quot; Pbbb love the last question....well there were over half a dozen pundits on the sofas just now so multiply that by 50 and you&apos;ll probably get an approximate figure for the number of producers, fixers and cameramen.  2.56pm: I have to say it is a bit surreal....being athletics correspondent and watching international athletics with so few recognisable names. Heats for the women&apos;s 400m have started - and with Christine Ohuruogu absent to defend her title it&apos;s hit home yet again how many absentees there are. How much does it matter? Is it an amazing opportunity for young talent to come through? Or does it make it dull for spectators?  2.50pm: It&apos;s great to see Montell Douglas racing again. The British 100m record holder just qualified through the first heat, coming back from horrendous injuries. Mad hair though - what is with the blonde extensions?! Bless her, she was literally wiping the bugs off her face (as mentioned by Andy Bull) after that finish line.  2.44pm: Debate on the Delhi belly..... the BBC were saying noone should be eating curry, but instead should stick to more habitual foods. Is this nonsense? Andy Bull has emailed in to concur with my own sneaking suspicion: &quot;I don&apos;t think it is the curry to blame, it tends to be the bad versions of western food that cause problems. A couple of Australian swimmers were struck down after eating bad spag bolognese in the athletes village...&quot; It&apos;s always bad spag boll, ennit? Bet that comes up lovely.  2.42pm: Several people have asked: should we get rid of the CWG altogether? Maybe that should be tomorrow&apos;s poll. But my question to you is: are you guys saying that because this one is a bit of a shambles? Or because you generally think the CWG are pretty pointless?  2.36pm: Gary Naylor has emailed in with an inside tip on the wrestling. Unfortunately, one that is completely irrelevant to this particular competition. Thanks Gazza. &quot;I had a conversation about wrestling recently on the way to Baku airport. The inside track is that the Chechens are unbeatable. Not much chance of Chechnya joining the Commonwealth though, is there?&quot; Who else knows ANYTHING about it?  2.34pm: Also, for more details on 16 year old Zoe Smith&apos;s weightlifting bronze medal for England see here  2.27pm: In the men&apos;s 4x200m freestyle Scotland have won a SILVER medal!  2.26pm: Message from our man in Delhi, Mr Andy Bull (he doesn&apos;t take any), reporting from the main stadium: &quot;The crowd at the JLN Stadium right now is small. Very small. Perhaps an eighth of its 60,000 capacity at a guess. But then, this is a distinctly underwhelming night of athletics. The only finals are the men&apos;s 5,000m and the women&apos;s para-sport shot put, and I can&apos;t imagine many people would pay all that much to watch those. It is also stupidly humid and the air is full of bugs. Mainly moths. They keep crashing into my computer screen.&quot;  2.24pm: Apologies for delay in updating, we&apos;ve had a technical hitch this end, and before anyone asks it did not include channel changing (that bit went very smoothly, thanks)  2.23pm: FYI our poll is still open as to which English anthem the athletes should be singing if anyone else wants to vote. Land of Hope and Glory is currently in the lead, with 6per cent more votes than Jerusalem. Personally they both make me retch, conjuring up images of Last Night at the Proms and all that nauseating flag waving. Winning a medal for your country is one thing, waving flags about for no apparent reason is quite another.  1.58pm: Wow all this channel changing is making me dizzy! Back to BBC1 in 15 mins for anyone who&apos;s confused.  1.47pm: Australia take gold in the women&apos;s 4x200m freestyle - by a mile - with New Zealand in second, and England in third. Scotland have broken a 22 year old national record to finish fifth. (That may sound pedantic of me to include, but you know say someone&apos;s gonna wanna know about that)  1.43pm: grierson re crowd....actually that&apos;s a photo from yesterday I believe....it looks as though attendances have gone up today and I&apos;ll be interested to see what it looks like in the athletics stadium later.      Gold    1.41pm: JuanFivesix - yeah well dispiriting! And I&apos;m not even competing. But then there is all the Liverpool shenanigans going on. Still, the last time I did a blog like this was from the Bird&apos;s Nest at the Beijing Olympics, and we got hundreds of comments. I&apos;ll try not to take it personally.  12.52pm: Hey Fedup2day, are you always? Or is it just today? (sorry, couldnt&apos; resist) Interesting criticisms...could you expand on: &quot;they are rubbish!&quot; I would be interested to know what the real story is behind some of these bizarre mess ups. I heard Jonathan Edwards on radio this morning telling us it&apos;s a &quot;cultural thing&quot; to be organisationally last minute. Is that really a credible explanation? How does he know?  12.46pm: Fantastic reception for India&apos;s first ever medal in the pool, Prasanta Karmaker, who lost his hand in a road accident, receiving his bronze on the podium. Simon Miller of England grinning on his international debut, after being presented with silver.  12.41pm: It&apos;s another first ever as Kenya take their FIRST ever medal in the pool!  12.28pm: Men&apos;s S9 50m freestyle Matt Cowdry of Australia has taken gold with a new world record, England take silver and India&apos;s Prasanta Karmarker has won a bronze - their first ever medal in the pool! The crowd absolutely loved that...look forward to bolstered attendance figures tomorrow after that one I should think.  12.16pm: Nearly spat out my tea when Sharon Davies said, &quot;you&apos;re smoking at the moment aren&apos;t you?&quot; to little Jemma Lowe. &quot;Yes&quot; she chirped. Needless to say, my understanding of it was taken quite out of context. She&apos;s just been doing well in the pool. Meanwhile poor Fran is about to have her medal presented, but she&apos;s looking so peaky I think she&apos;d rather go and have a lie down.  12.11pm: Fran&apos;s not well, says she couldn&apos;t even stand up after her swim, so she&apos;s done well to get another medal here (bronze). Apparently she was nearly sick after the swim. Sharon Davies tried to interview her, and thought she was about to cry. Nuh-uh, &quot;I just don&apos;t want to be sick on you Sharon,&quot; she said. Love that!  12.07pm: Ooh dear has the commentary on your BBC feed been slowed down to satanic record messages slowness too? I couldn&apos;t possibly tell you what they&apos;re saying at this point.  12.01pm: Just been advised that England&apos;s weightlifter Zoe Smith has just won bronze. Our man in Delhi, Andy Bull, has been watching and will update us all very soon. Zoe&apos;s just 16 so it&apos;s quite some feat.  12.00pm: Is that a poem you&apos;ve posted there young Selby?  11.48am: Clare Balding is asking the questions that matter.....do tattoos get messed up by chlorine? Mark Foster recommends putting vaseline on to protect them, and not going in chlorine for the first week of getting one. Glad we cleared that up!  11.39am: Chris Bristow has emailed in to ask, &quot;What is happening with the Archery? I&apos;ve not seen a single news item about it.&quot; It&apos;s in the final session right now Chris, with England vs Northern Ireland in the men&apos;s compound team going head to head in the quarterfinals...England lead 232 to 224. Not an archery expert myself I hope that means more to you than it does to me...  11.37am: Oh dear Fran Halsall just couldn&apos;t quite hang on as she struggled in the 100m freestyle to finish in third place, well off her personal best. Still we&apos;re not sniffing at a bronze. Once again Australia has yet more medals in the pool, taking gold and silver.  11.32am: England&apos;s James Goddard has broken the Commonwealth Games record with a stunning swim in the 200m backstroke to take GOLD. Australia took silver and bronze.      Gold    11.27am: And it stays that way.....so England take GOLD and SILVER, while Australia takes bronze in the men&apos;s all-round individual gymnastics final.      Gold    11.22am: apologies - there&apos;s two rotations to go! NB Luke Folwell is from the Paul Hall stable of fame - the amazingly dedicated miracle worker who coached Louis Smith and Daniel Keatings to world championship medals.      Gold    11.20am: It&apos;s England v Australia in the men&apos;s gymnastics with the top 6 positions dominated by two countries after the first two rotations. Luke Folwell of England took the lead from his team mate Reiss Beckford, Australia&apos;s Joshua Jefferis is in third place.  11.07am: Meanwhile we&apos;re off to one of my personal fave sports, the artistic gymnastics. Some of the bigger names such as Beth Tweddle and Louis Smith are missing as they prepare for the World Championships in Rotterdam that begins next week. But the young&apos;uns, potential gymnasts of the future are here....  11.05am: Word just in...Glen Johnson is using rosetta stone (of manzana roja fame, yeah yeah you&apos;ve seen the adverts) to learn spanish and get on better with his team mates. Love that the PR company thought that today would be a good day to announce that while all the Liverpool stuff is going on. Well, it worked for me...  ...  11.02am: Quick update on the medal table: Australia are top (naturlich) with 25 medals, then India with 16, and England in third place with 16.  10.54am: There&apos;s a silver medal for Scotland in the team sprint as Jenny Davis and Charline Joiner pull off a result in the velodrome. Poor old Charline wasn&apos;t even well last night, but she&apos;s all smiles this morning.  10.51am: Well, look at that, the higher placed finisher in the final sprint was Mark Christian from the Isle of Man and they WILL take a bronze. How many top cyclists come from that tiny place? Amazing. So that&apos;s gold to Cameron Meyer of Australia, George Atkins of England takes silver.  10.48am: The final of the men&apos;s point race in the velodrome is underway with Isle of Man versus Wales for the bronze medal....looks like England have tied up the silver already and Australia - yep you guessed it - they&apos;re heading for another gold.  10.38am: Wow, first post a nd we&apos;re already off with a moan! Let&apos;s hope this doesn&apos;t set the tone for the day as complaints of bats in the velodrome, moths in the sandpit, and officials still working on the track are coming in. But the beeb tell us that so long as officials remember to &quot;clear up the debris&quot; from the works, the athletics should be unaffected.  10.31am: Hello and welcome to day 3 of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. \u2022 As athletics action gets underway let&apos;s hope that sporting endeavours are not obscured by excessive moaning about unfinished tracks...the 100m heats begin today, and there is a 5,000m men&apos;s final later.  \u2022 Artistic gymnastics (not the one with ribbons, the other one. Yes, I know it&apos;s confusing) is all go in the men and women&apos;s all-around individual finals today.  \u2022 Look forward to more medal action in the pool, with Fran Halsall hoping to have another go at singing the (correct) anthem should she finish well in the 100m freestyle.  \u2022 And finals in shooting, weightlifting, wrestling. Here is the full schedule of today&apos;s events. In case you missed out, here are the highlights from what happened yesterday... \u2022 England claimed first two golds - in the pool - and then sang the wrong anthem on top of the podium. Is singing Jerusalem instead of Land of Hope and Glory a good or bad idea? \u2022 Australia won yet more medals in the pool and on the cycling track, to top the medal table.  \u2022 Host nation India had a good day, claiming two golds in the shooting and three in the wrestling. \u2022 Scandal of the day: wrestler Hassene Fkiri of Australia stripped of his silver for giving officials the birdie after he was disqualified. (He wouldn&apos;t have lost the medal for just the disqualification). \u2022 Scotland won its first gold, to join Canada, South Africa and Nigeria on the one gold mark. Malaysia and Singapore have two. \u2022 Just 600,000 of the 1.5m available tickets have been sold, organisers admitted. Free tickets may be given to schoolchildren and those on the poverty line.

Pearson crossed the line in 11.28secs, but was disqualified for a false start following an appeal by England.

Just seen Sally Pearson leaving stadium in tears...&quot;  5.27pm: Word in from our man on the ground, Andy Bull, sounds like England&apos;s appeal against Sally Pearson&apos;s 100m gold medal is being upheld.

Major stories from today: \u2022 Rebecca Adlington won gold in the 800m freestyle\u2022 Another first for India as Ashish Kumar won Commonwealth bronze in the gymnastics on the floor. Meanwhile it was a great day for England&apos;s gymnasts as Imogen Cairns took gold on the vault, Max Whitlock won silver on the pommels, and Reiss Beckford took silver on the floor. \u2022 Mark Lewis-Francis won silver in the 100m, despite the controversy of his blocks slipping backwards at the start. \u2022 Protests galore in the women&apos;s 100m, as first England and then Nigeria dispute the Australian Sally Pearson&apos;s gold medal after a false start. \u2022 And yet more controversy as &quot;Delhi belly&quot; dominates the headlines, swimmers complain of a suspected virus problem in the pool and the authorities are forced to investigate.\u2022 Danielle Brown, Nicky Hunt and Nichola Simpson today became the first English archers for 28 years to win a Commonwealth Games gold medal.  4.26pm: Now the Nigerian camp have launched a protest against Sally Pearson&apos;s 100m gold medal....watch this space  4.16pm: So....the Australian took gold, with Max Whitlock taking silver on the pommels. He&apos;s barely a slip of a lad, just 17, will be well proud.  4.11pm: As you know England&apos;s men have a great record in the pommels in recent years - Louis Smith making history taking Olympic bronze in Beijing two years ago. Folwell&apos;s in second place at the moment. Here comes England&apos;s Max Whitlock, another teenager....  4.10pm: Getting a replay of the men&apos;s pommels (gymnastics) Prasanth Sellathurai of Australia put in an amazing performance....now it&apos;s Luke Folwell of England  4.07pm: Update on England&apos;s 100m women&apos;s protest: Pearson, as we know, did start ahead of the gun (which she later admitted), promptly covering her face with her hands, but it was Turner who came out of the blocks first and therefore disqualified. England protested, but their action has been overruled and Australia keep the gold medal.  4.05pm: England&apos;s men have defeated India in the archery to take the gold medal, 231 to 229points. Very solid performance in the opening two rounds - dropping just one point. India&apos;s men take silver, after the women&apos;s team took bronze this morning. [Indiafan this is news - right? Or have you had another premonition...]  3.57pm: Ooops and there is a strong display of my hockey knowledge....sorry! The match finsihed 1-1 about 16 hours ago. That was just a replay.  3.44pm: And England have fought back to level the scores, 1-1  3.39pm: Oh dear the hockey&apos;s on....why didn&apos;t I save my hockey anecdote for this moment? I always bunked off hockey at school. Canada are beating England 1-0 (men&apos;s), in case anyone wanted to know...  3.25pm: In the women&apos;s T37 100m there are more medals for the home nations, Jenny McLoughlin of Wales took silver, and England took bronze.  3.23pm: Update on the women&apos;s 100m England have launched a protest - I don&apos;t know about you but I really can&apos;t see that getting anywhere.  3.18pm: Meanwhile in the women&apos;s hammer there are two medals for the home nation girls....Carys Parry of Wales takes silver and Englands&apos; Zoe Derham has bronze. Sultana Frizell of Canada takes the gold.  3.15pm: Still, let&apos;s not get carried away about MLF. The top 10 fastest commonwealth sprinters this year are not here. He&apos;s doing good, but against the real competition 10.20 - even 10.12 - is nowhere smart.  3.12pm: It&apos;s so bad that even MJ (Michael Johnson) is giving MLF credit. Jeez. Apparently there should be some kind of pin that keeps the blocks in place.  3.09pm: SCANDAL! MLF&apos;s blocks slipped as he set off, just saw the slow mo....here&apos;s the quote:   &quot;I want to say one thing, I would have won that if you watch the replay my block slipped that&apos;s why i was so far behind. i had to run deep within me. just goes to show there&apos;s a lot there. thats my second silver medal of the season but it&apos;s just that disappointment of what could have been...&quot;   3.07pm: Pearson was the first Australian woman to win the 100m since 1974...and she only decided to compete two weeks ago. Bog off to the protesters I say, nobody likes sour grapes.  3.04pm: Here are the times: 10.12 for Jamaica, 10.20 for MLF, and 10.24 for the Trini boy Aaron Armstrong who just beat his teammate on the line.  3.02pm: MLF has some serious kick, at the halfway mark he was at the back of the field, but as he crossed the line he knew he&apos;d done it, whooping into the air. The bronze looks like it&apos;s still being decided.  3.01pm: Jamaiuca take the gold!!!! Lerone Clarke, great performance. And again MLF is s-l-o-w out of the blocks, but somehow pulls it back for a silver medal - his second this year - for the boy we were told to give up on. Not bad, kiddo.  2.59pm: OK and we&apos;re getting ready for the mne&apos;s 100m final now. MLF&apos;s looking psyched. Or pumped. Or whatever it is these kids say. Oshane Bailey is not here, sadly, as a tweaked muscle keeps him out.  2.55pm: Sally Pearson 11.28seconds...not the fastest time in the world, but this is from a woman who is better known for her 100m hurdles race - a field in which she is truly world class, and in which she will go for another gold later in the Games. Let her have the gold and stop moaning girls!  2.52pm: Endacott came fourth, but she and Turner are kicking off about the false start. &quot;It wasn&apos;t Laura&apos;s false start, I know that.&quot; Pearson also false started, but she did so after Turner. There&apos;s a protest going on as Endacott - rather uncharitably - grasses her up to the TV camera. Endacott tells us Pearson confessed her false start to the Plymouth born athlete. (Of course Endacott would benefit from a bronze if Pearson was disqualified.)      Gold    2.50pm: Turner&apos;s insisted in running in the final even though she&apos;s been disqualified. The official tried to get rid of her but she gave him a piece of her mind.....it doesn&apos;t matter anyway because Pearson of Australia has won it - the first Australian in years to win!  2.47pm: Pearson thought it was her but it was Laura Turner! And she ain&apos;t happy. She&apos;s talking about whistling in the crowd - I think - but the officials have shown her the red card and she&apos;s got to walk.  2.46pm: Women&apos;s 100m final about to start. Laura Turner and Catherine Endacott of England both in there. Sally Pearson of Austyralia probably starting as favourite. The Nigerian also looks good. OH! It&apos;s a false start....  2.39pm: England&apos;s Imoigen Cairns has performed a great vault in the gymnastics there...watch for the medals...  2.34pm: Gets a lovely height and pace but Beckford&apos;s difficulty is way down on the others and takes the SILVER. Thomas Pichler of Australia takes gold, with India taking BRONZE!  2.31pm: What a necklace too! Must have been jangling all over the place with all them twists and tucks. His coach is thumping his fist. Love it! In second place now, that error touching out cost him. Reiss Beckford of England next....  2.30pm: Ashish Kumar of India stepping up, 19 years old, and what a welcome from the crowd! Brilliant! Two and a half twist double tuck front - perfect! Oh....just a wobble and touched out of the square...we&apos;ll see.  2.27pm: Meanwhile in the gymnastics, the men&apos;s floor final is coming up....  2.21pm: draw for the men&apos;s 100m final has been revealed....MLF is in the outside lane. Not great. But he did win silver from lane 8 in Barcelona. Also news is that Bailey of Jamaica is out with a hamstring problem - what a shame, he was the most exciting competitor in the field in my mind.  2.15pm: One advantage of the beeb constantly changing channels is that they play the theme tune all over again...which I love!!! Can anyone tell me what tune it is? Really good!  2.09pm: Scotland&apos;s Lee McConnell is safely through to the 400m women&apos;s final, she went out hard through the first 300m in the semi and then relaxed in the final straight to finish in second place.  2.02pm: Okyere is (hopefully) through in third, but it was Montsho - predictably - who impressed as she strolled through to the final in 50.80 seconds. Okyere&apos;s run a personal best (52.89) and hopes to go through as one of the fastest losers.  2.00pm: First semi final of the women&apos;s 400m coming up. This is where I should be talking about Christine Ohuruogu, but I&apos;m afraid she&apos;s not here so it&apos;s less recognisable names such as England&apos;s Nadine Okyere. Amantle Montsho of Botswana is the biggest name I can see in this field...  1.57pm: Laura Turner hasa her tongue out and she is through to the women&apos;s 100m final. She, Endacott and MLF are all from Linford Christie&apos;s coaching camp so he&apos;ll be a happy bunny.  1.51pm: Little grin from Becky Adlington up on the podium getting her medal, she&apos;s not singing along. Is that because NOONE KNOWS THE DAMN WORDS to Jerusalem? Sorry for shouting. But they don&apos;t, do they?  1.48pm: Both races won in 10.14seconds. That&apos;s a day out at the seaside for Usain Bolt, but there is some good competition - within that time bracket - among the athletes in this field so we should be on for a reasonably competitive final later.  1.45pm: well he came from behind, but my goodness did MLF shift a gear to get across that line. A terrible start coming out of the blocks, with less than 10m to go he&apos;s overtaken Oshane Bailey - who&apos;s now being stretchered off with cramp - and finished as third fastest qualifier.  1.40pm: semi final of men&apos;s 100m coming up....MLF what you got?  1.39pm: Here comes the second semi final of the women&apos;s 100m....only 2 can go through. Can Montell do it? No! Way down on the field. Apparently the &quot;big Nigerian&quot; won it. I am really not up for that trend of reference.           1.38pm: First semi final of the men&apos;s 100m just happened, and Lerone Clarke for Jamaica is looking the business.      Rebecca Adlington is congratulated after the 800 metre freestyle final in Delhi 2010. Picture: FRANCOIS XAVIER MARIT/AFP/Getty Images Photograph: Francois Xavier Marit/AFP/Getty Images    1.37pm: Becky Adlington looks as though she&apos;s taken that gold medal totally within her stride. Amazing girl!  &quot;I just thought get out there in front no point holding back. On the back 400 I saw Wendy edging close to me but I thought there&apos;s no way she&apos;s going to catch me.&quot;   And there wasn&apos;t.      Gold    1.32pm: Gold for Becky Adlington. Trott of RSA second and Gorman third.  1.31pm: Trott looking much stronger than Adlington with 100m to go.  1.30pm: Trott starting to move on Adlington with 200m to go.  1.27pm: Adlington clearly wanting to stamp her authority on this. She&apos;s leading by about 8m at the half-way point, with Trott in second place and Gorman third, although the gap between them is not growing any more.  1.24pm: Adlington leading after 100m...  1.23pm: Back to the swimming pool, for the 800m women&apos;s final. Rebecca Adlington of England won two Olympic golds as a 19-year-old and is the World Record holder at this event. She came seventh in the recent European championships. Gorman of Australia is also in the world&apos;s top three and Trott of SA was the fastest qualifier.  1.19pm: Myers of Jamaica and Endacott of England through to the final.  1.18pm: And another faulty start for the women&apos;s 100m semi final as the crowd makes a huge amount of noise supporting an Indian athlete in the decathlon. So, third attempt.  1.14pm: Over to the athletics: Women&apos;s 100m semi finals...first two through to the final later today (2.45pm BST). And it&apos;s a false start.  1.09pm: Not sure about this: After the 2012 Olympic Games the park will be renamed, after the Queen. The 500-acre site will become the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, mayor Boris Johnson said today. But what will Spurs or West Ham call the footy ground?  1.04pm: Le Clos, who has already won a gold in the 200m butterfly, woms Gold, despite a late surge by Roebuck of England for silver. Schoeman held onto third.  1.03pm: Breaststroke leg and Le Clos is still leading, another South African, Schoeman, second....and onto the final leg...  1.01pm: ...onto the backstroke leg and Le Clos is still leading at the end. Breaststroke next and this could be the stroke that changes the field positions...  1.00pm: Men&apos;s 400m individual medley starts and Le Clos of SA and Johns of Canada leading after the butterfly leg....  12.55pm: Gold to Natalie Du Toit of SA (Paralympic gold medallist on ten occasions), silver to Millward of England and bronze to Cole of Australia.  12.52pm: 100m Freestyle S9 Women final coming up. A variety of starting positions for the swimmers, depending upon their disability. Du Toit of South Africa presumably the favourite.  12.49pm: Intrigued by the NRU entry in the medals table, I&apos;ve been doing a bit of research. Yukio Peter&apos;s gold medal in the 77kg division weightlifting in Delhi is just the latest in a long line of #CWG golds in the sport for the small Pacific island. Must make them strong and tough down there.  12.43pm: Updated medals table: Gold27 - Australia12 - India8 - England5 - Canada3 - Malaysia, South Africa2 - Singapore, Nigeria1 - Scotland, Kenya, Uganda, Nauru Total58 - Australia33 - England28 - India16 - Canada  12.28pm: As Andy Bull says below the line, the action will be coming thick and fast over the next few hours. Unlike Andy, Anna and I won&apos;t be trekking across the city in a rickshaw in the hope of seeing it all. Coming up in the pool the 100m Freestyle S9 Women Finals Final, the 400m Individual Medley Men Finals Final and the 800m Freestyle Women Finals Final, featuring Rebecca Adlington. And then in the athletics stadium the men&apos;s and women&apos;s 100m finals, the women&apos;s hammer final, the men&apos;s shot put, the 100m men T46 final and the 100m women T37 final.  12.23pm: Canada&apos;s Brent Hayden has won gold in the men&apos;s 100m freestyle swimming, with silver to England&apos;s Simon Burnett and Aussie Eamon Sullivan taking bronze.           12.13pm: Anna off for lunch, Steve back in...  11.50am: Random hockey fact sent in by my friend Zarah: &quot;England keeper James Fair once set fire to his goalkeeper shorts..when he left them to dry on the radiator!&quot;  11.48am: Only a kid and yet Tom Daley has managed to take a very mature approach to all the moans about illness. Read Andy Bull&apos;s report here.... Will be interesting to see if he changes his mind down the line....  11.40am: Um, if anyone is not bored of Delhi belly yet (I&apos;m ducking right now, cyber shoes coming my way) here is a video of Mike Fennell talking about the problem...  11.30am: Australia&apos;s Alicia Coutts has just stormed away with the victory in the 100m butterfly. England&apos;s Ellen Gandy takes the silver, Jemma Lowe of Wales takes the bronze. More medals for the home nations. Fran Halsall would have been competing here had she not been ill, unfortunately she had to withdraw.  11.28am: Indiafan thanks for putting up the link to the racial slur incident. I think that&apos;s really important to mention actually because it shows the mentality of some of the people reporting on these games.  11.21am: BBC1 talking about the Indian competitor in synchro who learned all of her moves from youtube - self taught - because there are no synchro coaches in India. Amazing story!  11.20am: Canada take gold in the synchro, but England have the SILVER, Australia with bronze. Becky Adlington coming up in about 10mins.....  11.17am: Ollivia Allison and Jenna Randall looked absolutely perfect there, I&apos;m not sure they could have executed that routine any better...but the scores from the judges won&apos;t take them into the 90&apos;s....will they have to settle for the silver? Here come the Canadians....  11.15am: England&apos;s Jenna Randall has won Commonwealth silver for the second time in the individual synchro, Lauren Smith of Scotland took bronze. Canada took gold. Now it&apos;s the turn of England&apos;s duet....these are the girls that taught me!  11.11am: I know you lot are going to think this sport is rubbish and all about make up...but I tried it as a challenge for the now defunct OSM magazine, and I tell you it was soooo. Hard. Theye do a lot of work in the gym just to get the strength to be able to make those movements, and make them look so easy and controlled. OH! And this is a sport that is properly competitive at the CWG as Canada and Australia are amazing at it.  11.09am: Oh yeah baby....it&apos;s the synchro!  11.06am: BBC showing a morning press conference with Mike Fennel, where he made the condoms comment. The rumour is that it&apos;s the warm up pool that is causing the virus problems. Not sure how they&apos;ve worked this out. Interestingly the competition pool has been deemed too cold - which can only be a good thing in in preventing the spread of germs. ps can anyone confirm re chlorine vs bromide in the pool?  11.04am: Latest moan, no.3,408. Pigeon droppings in the pool. Personally I am really loving long jumper Chris Tomlinson&apos;s attitude that lots of athletes are being a bunch of prima donnas in not turning up to the Games for health and safety reasons. Brrrrap!  11.03am: Steve Busfield has just sent me a link to the condoms story. There are some interesting stats in the last par about how many condoms the athletes have got through at previous games...      Crowds at the S. P. Mukherjee Aquatics Complex at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi October 7, 2010.  Picture: REUTERS/Tim Wimborne Photograph: Tim Wimborne/REUTERS     Picture for Indiafan of the crowds at the pool. Sorry for delay!  10.46am: Oh! Some lovely pics for you. Click here.   10.43am: A note from Andy Bull (who is not sightseeing in Agra, in case anyone wondered, but IS stuck writing about diseases, poor love)   &quot;8% of england&apos;s entire team have had or do have delhi belly, lots of worries about whether it is the water in the pool that is making people sick, tests being done this morning.&quot;   10.35am: Great individual battle in the velodrome between Australia&apos;s Anna Meares and Wales&apos; Becky James. Meares won out so it&apos;s another gold medal to them and a SILVER for WALES.  10.27am: Interesting point on international reporting being so negative about these Games...however just had a look on Times of India website and one of the lead stories is about gold medallist Renu Bala Chanu being &quot;insulted&quot; after she was left to take a rickshaw back to the athletes village. Are the Indian media just as critical of the organisational problems at the Games? Discuss.  10.24am: ....but you have to wonder, what is responsible about trying to flush a condom down a toilet? I&apos;d say that&apos;s about a half point in the reponsibility stakes. Oh! And just so you know, those team pursuit cyclists are just getting their medals now. Lovely.  10.22am: Picking up on Indiafan&apos;s mention of condoms blocking the toilets in the athletes village. CWG chief Mike Fennel was reported to have said,   &quot;If that is happening, it shows there is use of condoms and I think that is a very positive story, that athletes are being responsible. This issue was controversial some years back but not now. Promoting safe sex is a responsible thing to do.&quot;    10.16am: Indiafan I thought we were friends? [sad face] Anyway, again for the record, if you can point out what has come from the BBC website I&apos;ll be impressed because I haven&apos;t taken anything from there (or anywhere else for that matter)!  10.13am: Morning Rice123, what side of bed did you get out of? Blimey. Any other requests? Btw definitely no piracy going on here, all of the below posts are entirely of my own creation. Thank you. (Would like to post you a link to the medals table on the official Games website but worried you&apos;re going to accuse me of plagiarism...?!)  10.10am: Yes! Just googled &quot;toilet museum, Delhi&quot; and it&apos;s TRUE! There is even an article on the evolution of toilets: The paper presented by Dr. Bindeswar Pathak, Ph.D., D.Litt., Founder, Sulabh Movement at International Symposium on Public Toilets held in Hong Kong on May 25-27, 1995. Is someone pulling my chain?  10.09am: Just received an email from a friend and fellow journo out in Delhi...apparently there is a &quot;museum of toilets in delhi in the media guidebook of what to visit!!!!&quot; Is this really true? I&apos;ve got to google it immediately.  10.04am: Reminds me of the time a good friend of mine was doing a match report at a championship club and one of the hacks approached her to complain about the cakes. Obviously mistaking her for a tea lady. With a laptop.  10.01am: Just on a diversion....not that I don&apos;t l.o.v.e track cycling...but has anyone seen that new Harry Enfield sketch with the female sports reporters? Cracked up watching that yesterday. &quot;Where&apos;s the bloke, love?&quot; &quot;Yeah, where&apos;s the bloke love?&quot; &quot;Go get the bloke love. And two teas.&quot;  9.57am: Morning Indiafan, how are you? It&apos;s funny you should say about blaming the heat....I do believe I read about the England hockey team doing just that... Anyway what is your theory as to why all these people are being sick? (and how can people get sick in chlorinated water? If it fades your tattoos surely it kills all germs??!)  9.50am: &quot;They&apos;ve sent out a warning to the rest of the world...&quot; say the BBC. Watch out GB 2012 team, this lot are after your medals. Now track cycling fans, what do you think? How good are the Aussies? Will Britain&apos;s cycling team be subject to a much bigger challenge in 2 years&apos; time? [ps are the BBC allowed to call people Kiwi&apos;s?]  9.48am: The Aussies lapped the NZ&apos;s and it was all over. Applause from people in green and yellow wigs (bat protection).  9.46am: Oh! NZ have lost a man! And the Aussies have pulled away....after being so close for the opening kilometre, NZ are now officially all over the place  9.46am: There&apos;s a tenth of a second in it....Australia only just in the lead, nobody can afford to make a mistake... 9.45am:The men&apos;s 4,000m team pursuit final is off in the velodrome - Australia v New Zealand, that&apos;s a juicy line up! Big up to Northern Ireland though who have won a bronze medal....how will they be received back home? &quot;Oh we&apos;ll be legends...&quot; Love. It.           9.47am: Steve off, Anna on...  9.24am: The current standings in the medal table: Golds22 - Australia11 - India5 - England, South Africa3 - Malaysia2 - Canada1 - Scotland, Nigeria, Singapore Total medals48 - Australia26 - India, England11 - Malaysia, New Zealand And here&apos;s the full schedule for today.      Gold    9.20am: England&apos;s archers Nicky Hunt, Danielle Brown and Nichola Simpson have become the first English archers to win gold at a Commonwealth Games for 28 years. They won the women&apos;s team compound event, beating Canada 232-229 in the final.  9.04am: Plenty of action to come today: \u2022 Athletics 100m finals: Montell Douglas and Katherine Endacott hope to perform in the women&apos;s event, while Mark Lewis Francis battles the Jamaicans in the men&apos;s. \u2022\u00a0In the pool: Rebecca Adlington goes for gold in the 800m free final, while England&apos;s Jenna Randall and Olivia Allinson in the Synchro go in the duet free routine. \u2022\u00a0Gymnastics: More medals are likely to come for the home nations in the finals of the men&apos;s individual floor, pommel horse and rings events, as well as the women&apos;s individual vault and uneven bars. \u2022\u00a0In shooting: Stevan Walton and Steven Scott go for more gold in the men&apos;s double trap singles, having won gold in the men&apos;s double trap pairs today.  9.03am: Good morning and welcome to Day 4 of the sporting action at the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games. Up to 15 swimmers in the England and Australian swimming teams have a stomach virus and the water at the aquatic centre has been cited as a potential cause. The Games Federation president, Mike Fennell, said officials would investigate and conduct tests on both the main pool and the warmup pool at the Dr SP Makherjee aquatic complex.

In his fierce public onslaught against Hicks and the Texan&apos;s fellow 50% Liverpool owner, George Gillett, on Tuesday, Broughton said that by resisting, the pair had &quot;flagrantly abused&quot; undertakings they had given him and the Royal Bank of Scotland not to oppose a reasonable sale. Broughton said they had abused the club&apos;s constitution, its articles of association, by seeking to sack the managing director, Christian Purslow, and commercial director, Ian Ayre, and replace them with Hicks&apos;s son and his assistant, to give Hicks a majority on the board. Liverpool&apos;s articles of association say only Broughton, as the chairman, has the right to appoint or remove directors. Broughton has been advised of his legal rights at every step by Liverpool&apos;s solicitors Slaughter &amp; May, one of the City of London&apos;s most highly rated law firms, and he took advice from them yesterday. On that basis he rejected Hicks&apos;s attempted boardroom coup. Broughton, Purslow and Ayre approved the sale, then the chairman launched his public attack on Hicks and Gillett. He is &quot;confident&quot; a high court judge will rule in the board&apos;s favour when the case is heard next week, although he added: &quot;You can never be 100% confident when you go to court.&quot; Hicks&apos;s spokesman in New York today set out the arguments which will form the basis of the Texan&apos;s legal defence. Of the undertakings, which Broughton says were given to him and to RBS, that Hicks and Gillett would not oppose a reasonable sale, the spokesman said: &quot;There were no such undertakings given to Broughton.&quot; He did not respond to a question about whether Hicks, as Broughton says, had given the undertaking to RBS. The spokesman claimed Hicks did have the right to sack and appoint directors: &quot;The board has been legally reconstituted,&quot; he said of Hicks&apos;s attempt, &quot;and the new board does not approve of this proposed transaction.&quot; Broughton is relying on the articles of association, which give the chairman the power to appoint and dismiss all directors apart from Gillett and Hicks themselves. The key clause is paragraph 81a of the 30-page document, which says: &quot;Each director appointed to the office of chairman of the board of directors of the company may appoint any person as a director of the company and may remove any director (other than George N Gillett Jnr and/or Thomas O Hicks). Any appointment or removal shall be made in writing and signed by the then current chairman.&quot; Hicks&apos;s spokesman did not respond to requests to explain Hicks&apos;s claim that the Texan did have the right nevertheless to reconstitute the board, and whether he is contesting that the club&apos;s own articles of association are valid. Broughton insisted, as a condition of accepting his appointment in June, that he be granted this power so that he could maintain a majority on the board over Hicks and Gillett. The articles of association were changed, introducing this right for the chairman, on 28 May, with the close involvement of RBS, which had agreed to refinance its \u00a3237m loans to Hicks and Gillett. By law, changes to companies&apos; articles of association require the approval of 75% of the shareholders. So they needed to have been approved by Hicks and Gillett themselves. Asked whether Hicks was arguing he never saw the articles, or approved the changes, and does not recognise them as having been legally introduced, the spokesman declined to comment. A source close to the board said Broughton remains &quot;confident&quot; that the power contained in the articles of association will be upheld, and that, according to the undertaking with RBS, Hicks has no right to resist the sale, because it is reasonable. Broughton, Purslow and Ayre have agreed the deal by which NESV will repay to RBS the \u00a3200m Hicks and Gillett borrowed to buy the club, then loaded on to the club to service the debt. However, NESV will give the pair nothing for their shares, and Hicks and Gillett will lose the \u00a3144m they have loaned to the parent company, Kop Holdings. Broughton justifies that deal as reasonable because after months of Liverpool, one of the world&apos;s most famous football clubs, being publicly up for sale, this offer, and another from a Singapore businessman the board decided was not as good, were the only ones presented. &quot;You needed to be on another planet not to know [the club] was for sale,&quot; Broughton said. &quot;We have had inquiries as a result of that, we have made inquiries ourselves, but not until this week have we had a formal written proposal. We ended up with two, there weren&apos;t any others \u2013 so by definition that is the market price.&quot; That is what Hicks is desperately fighting, although he will mount his battle on any of the details. He bought Liverpool with Gillett in 2007 believing that the growth, particularly, of Premier League television rights deals would increase the club&apos;s value and make him a fortune. He points in frustration to the $822m (\u00a3518m) valuation placed on Liverpool by Forbes, the US business magazine, placing the club sixth in its 2010 &quot;soccer team valuations&quot;. However, after a search for a buyer which Broughton must persuade the judge was as exhaustive as could be, NESV&apos;s is the best offer that could be found: to repay the useless debt with which Hicks and Gillett saddled the club and send them away, as Broughton put it, &quot;humiliated&quot;. Despite Liverpool&apos;s glorious heritage, no big pay day arrived, for a club burdened with debt, a struggling squad, appalled supporters and a stadium still to be developed.

With only four races left, starting with Sunday&apos;s Japanese grand prix, in the thrilling 2010 season the McLaren driver sees no need to change his approach despite recent setbacks. &quot;As drivers you are always on the ragged edge,&quot; said Hamilton, who lies third in the standings, only 20 points behind the leader, Mark Webber. &quot;We are always trying to gain position while staying safe. Some of us are more aggressive than others in those positions. Some people do a lot less overtaking than others. You just try to keep out of trouble. It is not easy. Racing is racing and there are racing incidents every now and then, so that is to be expected.&quot; At the Italian grand prix Hamilton made an error of judgment on the opening lap and hit Felipe Massa&apos;s Ferrari, which put the Briton out of the race, but in Singapore two weeks ago he came off worse in a collision with Webber&apos;s Red Bull when many observers felt he should have given the Australian more room as they were both racing for the title. &quot;Of course, you want to race sensibly and avoid incidents and I think that&apos;s what we all try to do, but when you&apos;re racing wheel-to-wheel at those high speeds, it&apos;s very easy to have incidents,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;I could go and drive around, not overtake anyone, stay in position. That&apos;s easy enough, but it&apos;s not me so that definitely won&apos;t be happening.&quot; It is expected that Hamilton will need to do some overtaking on Sunday in what is forecast to be a wet race on one of the more challenging tracks on the calendar. Suzuka is expected to suit the slippery aerodynamic qualities of the Red Bulls of Webber and Sebastian Vettel and the fast-improving Ferrari of Fernando Alonso, who has won the past two races, claiming the maximum of 25 points each time. Hamilton is relishing the challenge. &quot;It&apos;s a special circuit, it&apos;s amazing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s one of those raw, old-school circuits that doesn&apos;t have all the run-offs tarmacked. Some of them are gravel and you don&apos;t get the most run-off area. Some of the corners you put your wheel over the white line, touch the grass and you&apos;re off. It&apos;s the way it should be. It&apos;s a challenge. You get some circuits where you go over the white line and there&apos;s tarmac and you correct the car and bring it back on. This is a much less forgiving circuit so it&apos;s much more exciting and much more of a challenge.&quot; The challenge now is to eat in to Webber&apos;s lead and that means finishing ahead of the Australian on Sunday is of paramount importance and will start to undo the damage the last two grands prix have done to his campaign. &quot;All I can do is try to recover and try to apply myself in the most productive way towards my team and towards myself and towards the racing,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;My plan, of course, is not to arrive at weekends and see how hard my team works and let them down and let my family down, or let my friends down or let myself down. So I&apos;m doing as much as I can. I hope that this weekend is a stronger weekend. I feel good about it.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/oct/08/commonwealth-games-2010-delhi-8-october", "sentences": ["Two Kenyans a long way ahead, taking the bell...  3.38pm: Here&apos;s the latest medals table: Golds46 - Australia20 - India18 - England14 - Canada6 - South Africa5 - Nigeria4 - Malaysia2 - Singapore, Kenya1 - New Zealand, Scotland, Jamaica, Nauru, Botswana, Uganda Total97 - Australia69 - England45 - India36 - Canada  3.32pm: Following the shenanigans at the archery field, with claims that the crowd were &quot;too noisy&quot; during the closing stages of a very close India v England women&apos;s curve final, there is a counter claim that somone wearing England colours abused the Indian coach."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-08T08:25:37Z", "title": "Commonwealth Games 2010 live blog: 8 October | Steve Busfield", "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2010", "Sport", "Commonwealth Games"], "article": "      5.30pm: Time to round-up the day&apos;s action: \u2022 A big pile of medals for Australia: they now have 11 cycling track golds plus lots more in the swimming pool.  \u2022 England&apos;s Rebecca Adlington claimed her second gold in the pool, as did James Goddard and Liam Tancock.

Thank you for reading, commenting, debating, sharing links. There will be a Guardian Commonwealth Games Live blog throughout the weekend.  4.52pm: Especially for Indiafan, I came across this Twitpic of the CG swimming arena. It&apos;s not from today, but it is packed. Credit to Steve Parry on Twitter.  4.25pm: Luke Folwell has underlined his standing as one of England&apos;s best male gymnasts at the Games by adding gold and silver to his medal haul. The 23-year-old from Huntingdon won gold in the vault and then silver in the parallel bars at the IG Sports Complex. Folwell now has five medals having already won gold in the all-around individual and silvers in the rings and the team event. Imogen Cairns has won gold in the floor event.  4.00pm: Requests for some tennis scores. Good news for the locals:Men&apos;s Singles Semi-final: Somdev Devvarman (Ind) bt Matt Ebden (Aus) 6-3 6-1 Women&apos;s Singles Semi-final: Sania Mirza (Ind) bt Olivia Rogowska (Aus) 1-6 6-4 6-4  3.52pm: Grace Momanyi of Kenya takes gold in the women&apos;s 10000m. And for the first time ever an Indian woman, Kavita Raut, wins a medal on the track at the Commonwealth Games. There is a huge roar in the stadium.  3.50pm: And here&apos;s the end of the women&apos;s 10,000m final. 800m to go and the Indians look as if they may be about to get a medal (bronze by the looks of it) in front of a really big crowd in the Nehru stadium. Two Kenyans a long way ahead, taking the bell...  3.38pm: Here&apos;s the latest medals table: Golds46 - Australia20 - India18 - England14 - Canada6 - South Africa5 - Nigeria4 - Malaysia2 - Singapore, Kenya1 - New Zealand, Scotland, Jamaica, Nauru, Botswana, Uganda Total97 - Australia69 - England45 - India36 - Canada  3.32pm: Following the shenanigans at the archery field, with claims that the crowd were &quot;too noisy&quot; during the closing stages of a very close India v England women&apos;s curve final, there is a counter claim that somone wearing England colours abused the Indian coach. It is claimed that an English official told the Indian coach to &quot;fuck off&quot;. (Well, i&apos;m interpreting &quot;f*** ***&quot;). There appears to have been no official complaint and no identification of who this might have been.  3.19pm: Which gives me time to look at some other sports. There were requests below-the-line for squash coverage. Not least because this is a very serious event for the squash fraternity, because this is not an Olympic sport. Well, England&apos;s hopes of a bronze in the women&apos;s singles were dashed by an Achilles injury to Alison Waters. Waters was forced to pull out of the match against Australian Kasey Brown who took the bronze by default. But better luck for England in the 3rd/4th place play-off for men, with Peter Barker beating Mohd Azlan Iskandar of Malaysia, 11-5 11-4 11-2. England will get a 1-2-3 in the men&apos;s squash, because the final will be between Nick Matthew of England and James Willstrop of England. And in the women&apos;s final, Jenny Duncalf of England will play Nicol David of Malaysia.  3.12pm: Extraordinarily the BBC has decided not to show the women&apos;s 10000m live, only via the red button or on the web. But I don&apos;t have access to a red button and the BBC&apos;s live web feed seems overloaded (presumably because lots of people do want to watch this event, which is always a good one). If I manage to gain access, I&apos;ll let you know how it goes...  2.58pm: Just one more final to come: the women&apos;s 10000m.      Gold    2.51pm: Gold in the decathlon goes to Canada&apos;s Jamie Adjetey-Nelson, Brent Newdick of New Zealand took silver and the bronze medal-winning Englander is...Martin Brockman, pipping Kevin Sempers.  2.45pm: There&apos;s some spectacularly one-eyed commentary on the BBC going on during this last event of the Decathlon. They are only discussing which Englishman (out of three) is going to claim the bronze, with no discussion whatsoever of first and second places (which are admittedly already pretty-much decided).  2.36pm: It&apos;s the final event of the Decathlon...the 1500m, which is rarely sparkling in and of itself, but boy do these chaps deseve respect. I saw Dean Macey competing in this event in Athens, it was a titanic effort which sadly only led to fourth place.  2.31pm: er, change of result, Canada have been disqualified from 400m freestyle relay....England have been given the silver and New Zealand the bronze      Gold    2.30pm: Surprise, surprise...Australia win the women&apos;s 400 freestyle relay, Canada get silver and England bronze.  2.24pm: The last event in the pool: the 4 x 100m Women&apos;s Freestyle Relay. Anyone want to bet against the Australians?      Gold    2.21pm: Nancy Langat of Kenya takes gold, Nikki Hamblin of NZ gets silver and Twell gets bronze.  2.19pm: ...it&apos;s a slow pace and they are bunched up in one big pack as they come up to the bell...Steph Twell of Scotland in the lead with three Kenyans on her shoulder  2.17pm: Back to the athletics for the women&apos;s 1500m final...      Gold    2.08pm: James Goddard wins his second gold of the Games. He adds the 200m individual medley to his 200m backstroke.  2.05pm: Back to the pool for the 200m individual medley for men final...      Gold    1.56pm: Amantle Montsho sets a new CG 400m record and wins Botswana&apos;s first ever gold at the Games. Wins by a good distance.  1.53pm: Back to the athletics, for the women&apos;s 400m final. Lee McConnell of Scotland is the only Home Nation representative. Amantle Montsho of Botswana the favourite...      Gold    1.51pm: Eddington wins yet another gold for Australia in the 50m backstroke.  1.51pm: 50m backstroke for women final...  1.47pm: Here&apos;s a gallery of some beautiful images of today&apos;s action.  1.36pm: Ben Austin of Australia wins 100m Freestyle S8, swimming that in a fraction over 60 seconds...with one arm. Sean Fraser of Scotland gets silver.  1.33pm: So, back in the pool for the para 100m Freestyle S8 Men Final             1.26pm: There&apos;s a bit more of this going on now, with Tancock and Adlington winning their second golds each in the pool, and then Turner on the track.  1.22pm: England has 1-2-3 in the 110m hurdles, Turner gold, Will Sharman silver and Lawrence Clarke bronze. Turner recently claimed gold at the European championships.      Loving those nails, Rebecca. Picture: Tim Wimborne/Reuters    1.16pm: Becky Adlington wins another gold, Palmer of Australia silver and Carlin of Wales gets bronze. So Adlington has the 400m and 800m freestyle golds.  1.14pm: Becky Adlington leading at the halfway stage...  1.14pm: Back to the pool for the women&apos;s 400m freestyle final.      Gold    1.13pm: Andy Turner of England wins the 110m hurdles.  1.10pm: Quickly across to the Jarwaharial Nehru Stadium for the 110m Hurdles Men&apos;s Final...  12.57pm: Tancock had already won gold in the 50m backstroke. Bell of NZ and Delaney of Australia come 2nd and 3rd.      Gold    12.55pm: Liam Tancock of England breaks up the run of Aussie gold, winning the 100m men&apos;s backstroke  12.54pm: 100m men&apos;s backstroke final coming up...       12.52pm: Australian journalist Tony Harper tweets: &quot;#cwg #rsa Roland Schoeman describes crowd member as acting like a monkey, after noise affects swim starts. expect &apos;out of context&apos; excuse&quot;      Gold    12.42pm: Yet another Aussie gold with Liesel Jones winning the women&apos;s 100m breaststroke. Samantha Marshall of Australia gets silver and an Aussie 1-2-3 only stopped by Kate Haywood of England claiming bronze.  12.39pm: Women&apos;s 100m Breaststroke final coming up  12.37pm: Tomorrow Amir Khan&apos;s brother Haroon will be fighting in the boxing ring. Except he will be boxing for Pakistan against England. He will fight European bronze medallist Andrew Selby, who has in effect got the spot Khan wanted in the GB squad. Khan Jnr said: &quot;It&apos;s getting closer to the medal stages now. I just need to beat Selby, which will be tough and hopefully I can get one of the medals. My job is to prove that the ABA are wrong and I&apos;m confident I can do that. I&apos;ve showed my skills. Proving the ABA wrong would be a big thing for me, and others.&quot;  12.25pm: Second 50m men&apos;s freestyle semi final features another false start, but this one due to someone shouting out while they were taking the marks...  12.22pm: If you aren&apos;t interested in the swimming, here is a sadly fascinating piece about the workers who built the stadia: &quot;WE, WHO BUILT YOUR GAMES&quot; (thanks to grandexemplar on twitter)  12.19pm: As if we didn&apos;t have enough finals going on, we&apos;ve currently got the semi finals of the men&apos;s 50m freestyle. Ashley Callus of Australia won the first s-f by some distance...probably due to an improbably large false-start for which he has been disqualified. He looks very cross with himself.  12.11pm: They&apos;re playing Advance Australia Fair again, this time for 15-year-old Yolane Kukla, winner of the women&apos;s 50m freestyle      Gold    12.01pm: Gold for Megan Nay of Australia in the women&apos;s 200m Backstroke. Heartache for Lizzie Simmonds of Yorkshire and England who was leading for 195 of the 200 metres. Nay swam the second fastest time in the world this year.  11.59am: 200m Backstroke Women Final next...             11.55am: So that you can properly share the Commonwealth Games 2010 experience, here&apos;s a tune that we are hearing quite a lot of....  11.47am: Andy Bull says:   Aussie Geoff Huegill, who just won gold and broke the CG record in the 100m fly, has an interesting and inspiring back story. He was a champion at the age of 21, winning two golds at the 1998 CGs, but quit swimming after Athens &apos;04. He let himself go, drank a lot, ate too much and his weight shot up to 140kg. Two years ago he decided to get fit again and aimed to make his comeback here. So an awful lot of hard work has gone into that gold he has just won.  You can read more here in the Sydney Morning Herald.      Gold    11.40am: van der Burgh of South Africa wins the men&apos;s 50m Breaststroke with the fastest time in the world this year  11.38am: 50m Breaststroke Men Final next...  11.37am: On the Pearson disqualification, Commonwealth Games Federation President Michael Fennell has admitted: &quot;It was a major communication blunder.&quot; He added: &quot;We received complaints how the athletes were held up before the medal ceremony... treatment of the athletes are unsatisfactory and we have alerted all the other sports as well to ensure that a similar incident does not occur. The athletes were waiting and didn&apos;t know there was a protest.&quot;      Gold    11.35am: Kukla of Australia wins gold from Halsall of England in silver and Palmer of NZ in bronze in the 50m Freestyle for women  11.34am: Now it&apos;s the 50m Freestyle Women Final...  11.31am: Briefly back to the noisy crowd at the archery. The sport&apos;s world governing body FITA, said in a statement:   This is a matter of fair play for all the athletes who have worked so hard to come to these Games. Specifically we ask the public to be quiet when the archers draw their bow up until the arrow has been shot. If necessary, FITA will take appropriate measures to ensure a safe and fair field of play. We ask for fair play.       Gold    11.30am: Men&apos;s 100m butterfly final: Gold to Huegill of Australia - 12 years after his first Commonwealth Games gold      Gold    11.27am: Before the swimming, Hurrah for New Zealand - it&apos;s first gold of the Games, for Alison Shanks in the cycling 3000m individual pursuit. TVNZ reports:   An exhausted Alison Shanks brought a heady mix of relief and joy to New Zealand after powering to a Commonwealth Games track cycling gold medal tonight.  After three days of collecting minor medals behind the Australian juggernaut, the track cycling team at last had something to celebrate in unadulterated style after Shanks unveiled a stunning ride in the 3000m individual pursuit.  The Dunedin rider dominated qualifying and produced a lung-busting effort in the final to head off arch-rival Wendy Houvenaghel of Northern Ireland.        11 swimming golds up for grabs. Photograph: Tim Wimborne/Reuters    11.21am: OK, swimming gold rush coming up...  11.00am: Andy Bull points out the front page of today&apos;s Hindustan Times which reports that they found 3,000 Games tickets in the possesion of a Kabaadiwala, or junk merchant, who had been given them by Games officials to sell as scrap paper.  It&apos;s a question every sports-loving Indian wants an answer to. Where are the Commonwealth Games tickets? Why are hardly any available, even as athletes at some venues perform in front of nearly empty stands? On Thursday, HT found at least 3,000 answers \u2014 from a kabaadiwala (junk dealer), who was casually walking out of a stadium with stacks of tickets in his sack. The tickets, priced between R250 and R1,000, were, however, all marked &apos;complimentary&apos;. There were some tickets for the evening&apos;s prime-time India vs Australia hockey game (which India later lost), for important athletic events and wrestling matches at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, all between the dates October 5 and 7. They had all been given away to the kabaadiwala to sell as waste paper. Organising Committee (OC) sources said thousands more such tickets were lying at its office (HT has photos of them). Earlier in the day, when HT visited the Karni Singh Shooting Range, with a seating capacity of 4,000, there weren&apos;t even 250 spectators watching the events. The managers of the nearby Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd stall, which houses the nearest centralised ticket counter, said all tickets (priced R250) had been sold out for the entire duration of the competition.   10.45am: Just to stir the Aussie v Pom sentiments a little more from the women&apos;s 100m final last night, a top Australian ahtletics official has accused the English of &quot;payback&quot;. Athletics Victoria chief executive Nick Honey told Melbourne radio station 3AW the decision went back to a successful Australian appeal against England&apos;s women&apos;s 4x400m success four years ago.   It goes back, I think, to the last Commonwealth Games. With the (2006) 4x400m relay for the girls and the Australians, we informed the officials and got the English girls disqualified, so it might be a bit of payback.  Honey then admits of Pearson&apos;s disqualification:   From the letter of the law I think it was probably fair.  So, maybe the appeal had nothing to do with &quot;payback&quot; and everything to do with &quot;the rules&quot;. Still, Australia have a big pile of other medals to cheer them up. The veledrome has just heard the Australian national anthem for the 11th time out of 13 events. Daniel Ellis, Jason Niblett and Scott Sunderland have just won men&apos;s team sprint gold beating New Zealand into silver. The bulk of England and Scotland&apos;s best cycylists though are not at the Games because they were competing in the European Championships.  10.40am: So, after all the complaints about the crowds being too small, now the crowds are (allegedly) too noisy. There is kerfuffle about the English women&apos;s archers losing out after a poor late set of arrows, which some have linked to the crowd whistling and cheering. Thankfully, English athlete Alison Williamson put it into perspective (quoted by the Press Association):   We&apos;re used to an archery crowd. If you go to a golf match you don&apos;t start clapping and cheering when someone&apos;s about to putt, and it&apos;s just lack of awareness of what is etiquette. But you have to deal with it. It&apos;s part of the competition and on Sunday when we have the individual event I&apos;m sure the home crowd will be vocal so we are just going to have to adapt to it.  Surely it is also about different cultures, as well as different sports. English football fans happily boo when the opposition is taking a penalty for instance. Indian crowds, when there are crowds, are known for their noise. England had been 102-99 up at the halfway stage, but eventually lost 207-206 to India in the women&apos;s team recurve event. Amy Oliver could only hit a six on the penultimate arrow, followed by an eight from Williamson.  10.25am: Andy Bull in Delhi picks the highlights from the swimming:  Fran Halsall v Yolane Kukla in the 50m free, Tancock is going again in the 100m back,Becky Adlington and Jo Jackson v Jazz Carlin and Kylie Palmer in the race of the night, the 400m freeAnd gemma spofforth is going in both the 200m and the 50m back finals   9.56am: Australian track cyclist Shane Perkins has withdrawn from the Games team sprint event after making rude gestures at officials. Perkins, who had been a medal favourite, was disqualified in his keirin heat on Wednesday for dangerous riding. He claimed seventh in a ride-off but then aimed a two-fingered salute at officials. Another Aussie competitor, wrestler Hassene Fkiri, had already been disqualified for making offensive gestures at officials. Perkins&apos; disqualification has The Australian worrying: &quot;Bad sportsmanship will be seen as a national trait.&quot;  Hassene Fkiri lost both the contest and his cool. He gave the bird to the judges and then refused to shake hands with the gold medallist. Rightly, he was disqualified from the tournament and deprived of his silver medal. Australian team boss Steve Moneghetti chose not to put him on the first plane home. Rather, Fkiri will remain in the village and has been set some sort of coaching punishment on his return at the end of the Games. That is a weak response by Australian management. Fkiri is 36 and an Olympian. He abused the most important principle that drives sport of any sort. He is a bad loser, prepared to offend both opponent and judge. Sport does not have much to boast about if it is not played in a manner that reflects respect for the dignity and grace inherent in competition. They are the two qualities that lift sport above the banality of chasing a football, running 100 metres, hurling a javelin or hitting a ball with a stick. Without dignity in victory or defeat, without the grace to win or lose with honour, sport is without a soul. It is meaningless. Shane Perkins has offended in exactly the same manner as Fkiri. Angry with a judging decision that doomed his chances of gold, he twice rudely gestured towards officials. Given that he had to have been on high alert because of Fkiri&apos;s actions, Perkins should have been taken straight to the airport. If sport has losers they are not the Trinidad and Tobago hockey team or the Indian netballers, they are Australians Fkiri and Perkins. Indians do not think much of Australian sportsmanship because they feel their nation&apos;s cricketers have been trampled upon by Australia when our Test team ruled the world. They are so suspicious of our motives they refused to accept John Howard as a candidate for the top position in world cricket. Cricket is a Commonwealth sport and has previously been played for Commonwealth Games gold. Surely a collection of countries that doubts our sportsmanship in cricket will now no doubt agree that it is a contagious quality, infecting wrestling and cycling and probably every other game we play. The only way to prove otherwise is to appropriately and with speed punish those who breach the very spirit of competition. That the Commonwealth Games managers have not done that with Fkiri and Perkins suggests that the crass sportsmanship of a wrestler and a cyclist was a national characteristic and not a personal aberration.       Australia's Sally Pearson reacts after the Women's 100m final. Picture: AP Photo/Anja Niedringhaus     9.56am: Meanwhile there are still reverberations following Australia&apos;s Sally Pearson&apos;s disqualification after winning the women&apos;s 100m final in the track stadium. To recap that series of events: Pearson was first across the line in 11.28 seconds but eventually had her medal taken away hours later, elevating Nigeria&apos;s Osayemi Oludamola (11.32) into first and Natasha Mayers of St Vincent and The Grenadines (11.37) into second. England&apos;s Kathryn Endacott was promoted to third, with the medal ceremony due to take place later Friday. While the electronic timing system showed Laura Turner of England as the first athlete to have jumped the gun at the start of the race, Pearson&apos;s reaction time of 0.071 meant technically, she had also false-started. England protested. Turner had run the race despite the false start.  The Sydney Morning Herald carries a story saying: &quot;Pearson decision tough but fair.&quot; But The Australian carries a (satirical?) piece arguing: &quot;What did we do to deserve the protest against Sally Pearson.&quot;  9.50am: Before we head into the slew of swimming finals, just to catch up on a couple of other stories. New Zealand TV commentator Paul Henry has been suspended after he twisted the surname of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit. New Zealand prime minister John Key today said Henry&apos;s &quot;poorly designed humour has ended up embarrassing New Zealand. For that I am regretful.&quot; To recap a story (which was much discussed below the line yesterday): Despite being told the minister&apos;s name is pronounced &quot;Dixit,&quot; Henry said: &quot;The dip sh*t woman. God, what&apos;s her name? Dick Sh*t. Is it Dick Sh*t ... it looks like &apos;Dick Sh*t. It&apos;s so appropriate, because she&apos;s Indian, so she&apos;d be dick-in-sh*t wouldn&apos;t she, do you know what I mean? Walking along the street ... it&apos;s just so funny.&quot;  9.28am: There are eleven swimming finals today, which should keep us pretty busy. Rebecca Adlington, who won the 800m gold last night, will be looking for another in the 400m freestyle final, while there are three English women in the 200m backstroke final, including European champion Lizzie Simmonds. The Australians will no doubt be looking for another batch of medals, yesterday Alicia Coutts claimed her third gold in the women&apos;s 100m butterfly, to become the seventh Aussie woman to win three individual gold medals at a Commonwealth Games.  9.17am: Good morning, or good afternoon if you are in Delhi or, indeed, anywhere in the world where it is now the p.m., and welcome to day five of the action at the Delhi Commonwealth Games. There&apos;s a packed programme of events today, including athletics, swimming and cycyling. We will also be looking at the reverberations from the controversial finish to the women&apos;s 100m final last night.

Fourteenth-place finishes are not where world championships are won from and that result had left him fifth in the standings, 47 points off the pace. Yet Alonso felt a sense of optimism, and not simply because Spain were playing in the World Cup final that evening. &quot;After Silverstone,&quot; Alonso said here after being asked when he felt he could fight for the title. &quot;We had made some improvements to the car and it felt good. Before that we had some up and downs, but the car was feeling OK, although not at the level of Red Bull Racing. After Silverstone, knowing it was a difficult weekend for us with the characteristics of the circuit being very good for Red Bull, we were still quite competitive there. With that car I had much more confidence in fighting for the title than before. So after Silverstone I was more optimistic.&quot; A fortnight later in Germany Alonso won for the first time since the season&apos;s opening race in Bahrain. The victory at Hockenheim was not without controversy as it was gifted to Alonso after Felipe Massa was clumsily ordered to cede the lead to his team-mate in a blatant breach of the rule banning team orders. The result, however, put the Spaniard right back in the championship reckoning with enough races left to fight for the title. Having also won the last two grands prix, in Italy and Singapore, Alonso lies second, 11 points behind Mark Webber, in the five-way scrap to be crowned the 2010 world champion, with four races to come. To many in the gated community of the Formula One paddock the 29-year-old Spaniard is now favourite to add a third world title to his collection. Does he agree? &quot;I think if you see the last two races, yes, because you arrive in a good moment,&quot; he said. &quot;It seems that you need to keep the momentum now for more races, but we saw this year that people that win two races, or have two or three podiums in a row, then they have some bad results and then they come back good. No one had consistently six or seven races in a good level for different reasons, so we expect there will be difficult moments for us. &quot;What we need to do is be prepared for those moments, not panicking, and score as many points as possible at every race. We know sometimes it will be a podium, sometimes maybe a fifth position \u2013 it is in those moments when we need to be united and not panic.&quot; Of the protagonists Alonso is the only one with the full weight of his team behind him. Despite some mid-season signs to the contrary, most notably at Silverstone, Red Bull are splitting their effort evenly between Webber and Sebastian Vettel, as are McLaren with Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. On the other side of the Ferrari garage from Alonso sits the slighted Massa and the pressure is now on the Brazilian to produce the goods in support of his team\u2011mate. &quot;I have waited for Felipe with great perseverance in the last four races,&quot; said Ferrari&apos;s president, Luca di Montezemolo, this week. &quot;I want a strong Massa who will shave points off the rivals. In Singapore he had some bad luck, but he is in good condition to win. Those who race for Ferrari don&apos;t race for themselves, but for the Ferrari team colours. One who wants to race for himself will have to face his team.&quot; Di Montezemolo continued: &quot;The decision to focus on Alonso has been proven to be right. He is extremely strong and very close to the team, and has been able to blend in well from day one. It has been a strange season. We won the first race, then we had some problems with the development of the car. The victories at Monza and Singapore have rekindled hope.&quot; The decision to promote Alonso ahead of Massa at Hockenheim cost Ferrari a $100,000 (\u00a363,000) fine and an appearance in front of the World Motor Sport Council, as well as the seeming alienation of the Brazilian a year to the day after his life-threatening accident at the 2009 Hungarian grand prix meeting. Massa has received assurances that from the start of next season he will once again be treated as Alonso&apos;s equal; until then he must act as the double world champion&apos;s wing man, however reluctantly. All the teams in title contention are in a constant battle to improve their cars but Ferrari seem to have got the pace of their development just right and now appear to have the strongest all-around package, though on the evidence of today&apos;s running here at Suzuka they will struggle to match the pace of the Red Bulls on Sunday having been almost a second off the pace in practice and finishing in fourth and fifth. The team principal, Stefano Domenicali, has admitted that Ferrari got distracted in focusing too much attention on their F-duct system, but they ran an improved version in Turkey and since then the upgrades have come on stream at a steady rate; the exhaust-blown diffuser appearing in Valencia and a new floor at the last race in Singapore. The team promise that there is more to come. &quot;The hard part is still ahead of us,&quot; Alonso said in a call to arms for his team. &quot;Now it starts getting serious. We will have to experience some pain, and it is time for everyone to give their all without taking a single backward step.&quot; He will hope that Massa gets the message."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/08/commonwealth-games-2010-will-sharman", "sentences": ["Andrew Baggaley beat Subhajit Saha 3-0 to edge England ahead before the 20-year-old Drinkhall wrapped up the win by beating Achanta 3-1 to set up a final meeting with Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-08T17:36:39Z", "title": "Commonwealth Games: Will Sharman checks out of hospital to take silver", "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2010", "Athletics", "Swimming", "Sport", "Commonwealth Games"], "article": "British medals came as thick and fast as the monsoon rains today. While it feels wrong to single out one from the bunch, Will Sharman deserves special mention. Sharman took silver in the 110\u00a0metres hurdles. He was part of an English clean-sweep in the event, behind Andy Turner and ahead of Lawrence Clarke. Sharman had hauled himself out of hospital to get to the start line. He came down with severe stomach troubles yesterday and spent the night before the final fighting attacks of vomiting and diarrhoea. After Friday morning&apos;s heats he was sent to hospital and put on a drip. &quot;I was close to tears this morning,&quot; Sharman said. &quot;The only reason why I ran the final was because my mum flew over here to watch me. It has been quite an ordeal. At the holding camp in Qatar I think I picked up a virus but it came into full effect yesterday. It was touch and go whether I raced or not.&quot; Clarke was also crocked, having torn a flexor muscle in his hip during his warm-up before the final. The three medallists looked a weary and wounded bunch as they stood on the podium to receive their medals. Just like the English swimmers, Sharman has learned a lot about what he is capable of by competing in Delhi. Across town at the Aquatics Complex the England team had their best night yet, winning 10 medals across the evening&apos;s 11 finals. And the consensus across the team was that the tough conditions they have faced here have only made them stronger. Liam Tancock, Rebecca Adlington and James Goddard all won their second gold medals of the Games. &quot;We just have to get on with it,&quot; said Adlington after winning the 400m freestyle. &quot;I&apos;ve come here to do a job. That was to swim and win medals, and I have medalled in every race.&quot; For a time it looked as though there could be an English 1-2-3 here, too, but Jo Jackson and the 17-year-old Anne Bochmann were edged out in the final 50 metres. Still, Wales&apos;s Jazz Carlin took the bronze, meaning that competition for spots on the Great Britain 400m freestyle team at London 2012 is going to be very fierce indeed. Adlington has won gold on successive nights. Coupled with her stomach troubles, the punishing swimming schedule has made this a tough meet. &quot;It was really hard after the 800m final last night,&quot; she said, &quot;By the time I had done a blood test and a urine test, I didn&apos;t manage to get a rub so I was really, really aching this morning, I just had to put that aside and forget about it. I had to be mentally tough. I&apos;ve got a two-week break so it doesn&apos;t matter how much I hurt now or how much I hurt tomorrow, it doesn&apos;t matter.&quot; Tancock agreed. He is in the form of his life, and has now added the 100m backstroke title to the 50m version he won on Tuesday. &quot;I think there&apos;s loads of things here that could be excuses, that could stop you from performing at your best. If you let it affect you, it is going to.&quot; Goddard&apos;s was perhaps the most impressive, and unexpected, performance. He won the men&apos;s 200m individual medley in a new Games record of 1min 58.10sec. It was predictable enough that he would lead after the backstroke leg, seeing as he won the 200m title earlier this week, but his advantage grew even more during the breaststroke. &quot;I want to get better yet,&quot; he said. &quot;1.58 is not good enough, I need 1.54 if I am going to beat the Americans.&quot; His team-mate Joe Roebuck took one of six English silvers on the day. One of them came from another disqualification, though it was not nearly so controversial a decision as the one that cost Australia&apos;s Sally Pearson her 100m sprint title in the previous night&apos;s athletics. The women&apos;s 4x100m freestyle relay team benefited from an infringement by the Canadian foursome, which bumped the English girls up from bronze. Gemma Spofforth was just as disappointed with her silver in the 100m back as she had been with her silver in the 50m. She was another swimmer with a busy schedule: earlier in the night she had finished fifth in the 200m backstroke. Elizabeth Simmonds took the silver in that race. She had also been suffering with sickness, but refused to use that as an excuse. &quot;We&apos;ve been presented with a hell of a lot of things here in Delhi that we are not used to dealing with,&quot; she said. &quot;It is something that everyone has had to deal with. I think that if you win the preparation process you win the race, that&apos;s the fact of the matter out here.&quot; Antony James was second in the 100m butterfly, while Fran Halsall, who has suffered more than most of the swimmers this week, took silver in the 50m freestyle. Paul Drinkhall, meanwhile, staged a stirring fightback to steer England to victory over India and a place in today&apos;s table tennis team final. Liam Pitchford lost the opening game 3-0 to Kamal Sharath Achanta and Drinkhall found himself 5-0 and 10-6 down in the decisive game against Anthony Arputharaj. But despite a home crowd baying for a victory Drinkhall held his nerve to pull off a 12-10 win. Andrew Baggaley beat Subhajit Saha 3-0 to edge England ahead before the 20-year-old Drinkhall wrapped up the win by beating Achanta 3-1 to set up a final meeting with Singapore."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/09/change-your-life-worries", "sentences": ["But in a just-published study, Xiuping Li and her colleagues at Singapore&apos;s National University put this aggravating metaphor to a literal test."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-08T23:02:22Z", "title": "This column will change your life: Sealing off worries", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style"], "article": "&apos;Closure&quot; is one of those words of purest psychologese \u2013\u00a0unadulterated therapy-speak \u2013\u00a0that renders certain people extremely annoyed. Tell a friend, especially a British one, that you&apos;re seeking closure from some romantic tribulation, and you&apos;re liable to find him or her seeking swift closure to the conversation. (It hardly helps that a &quot;reformed pimp and hustler&quot; calling himself Big Boom has written a self-help book entitled If You Want\u00a0Closure In Your Relationship, Start With Your Legs.) But in a just-published study, Xiuping Li and her colleagues at Singapore&apos;s National University put this aggravating metaphor to a literal test. By physically closing off some representation of their troubles, could people achieve emotional closure, too? This is an old notion, surfacing in the idea of the &quot;worry jar&quot;, designed to hold scraps of paper detailing one&apos;s worries, thus putting them out of mind, but it suffers from unhelpful new agey associations. &quot;A God Jar is anything you wish it to be, in which you can put your wishes, dreams, problems, prayers,&quot; sighs Julia Cameron, dreamily detailing a related technique in her book on creativity, The Vein Of Gold. &quot;You may want to think of it as a spiritual mailbox.&quot; Indeed you may. What Li et al did, by contrast, was to ask subjects to write down a decision they regretted, then\u00a0seal it in an ordinary envelope. A\u00a0control group did the writing, but not the sealing; afterwards, the envelope-sealers felt far less negative about the regret. (The\u00a0experiment thus isolated the &quot;sealing-off&quot; effect, distinct from the proven benefits of writing.) Follow-up studies established that the mood boost didn&apos;t come from sealing any old words, nor\u00a0from doing other things with written-down worries. It worked, too,\u00a0with disturbing news clippings, causing their details to fade from memory. &quot;An\u00a0effective way to relieve distress,&quot; Li says, in undreamy language, &quot;may\u00a0be for the distressed person to\u00a0seal an object related to his or her emotions in a package.&quot; Precisely what&apos;s happening is unclear. Li implies it&apos;s that the worries have been put, metaphorically, &quot;out of reach&quot;. I&apos;d suggest it&apos;s that they&apos;re being metaphorically &quot;kept safe&quot;, for future reference, since part of worry&apos;s relentless force seems to come from the fear of forgetting the subject of the worry. That&apos;s surely why making lists feels uplifting even before you&apos;ve started the tasks concerned. What matters, though, is that the metaphorical force of the &quot;sealing off&quot; seemed to cause a\u00a0measurable effect on mood. Metaphors permeate our emotional lives so deeply that &quot;permeate&quot; might be the wrong word; from one perspective, they&apos;re what those lives consist of, and bad ones land us in trouble. &quot;The work of psychotherapy,&quot; notes the psychologist Noam Shpancer, &quot;often involves an attempt to replace faulty metaphors.&quot; Or as Freud put it, with what sounds rather like false modesty: &quot;Not I, but the poet discovered the unconscious.&quot; We tend to divide self-help and happiness techniques into &quot;scientifically proven&quot; ones versus dodgy folk wisdom and superstition. But studies such as Li&apos;s show that the distinction, where emotions are concerned, is tenuous at best, because metaphors, from worry jars to religious rituals of burning or cleansing, exert real force. To call this the placebo effect risks sidelining it absurdly. Rather \u2013 to deploy a couple more metaphors \u2013 it\u00a0may be the foundation stone, the\u00a0bottom line, of our psyches. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com twitter.com/oliverburkeman \u2022 This article was edited on 11 October 2010.

Guernsey have beaten the favourites Malaysia in bowls! To catch up on the day&apos;s big talking points read this round-up.  4.51pm: Things are winding down now here for the day as coverage of the day&apos;s remaining events is sketchy to say the least. We&apos;ll have a roundup of the day&apos;s main talking points up on the site shortly.  4.41pm: Halftime in the men&apos;s hockey - Scotland are 2-0 down against India. Two early goals look to have done for Scotland&apos;s hopes. Better news in the bowls, however, where Scotland are tied 3-3 with Canada. In the boxing ring England&apos;s Obed Mbwakongo is about to touch gloves with India&apos;s Dinesh Kumar. No Indian fighter had apparently lost this week.  4.35pm: Back to the final of the men&apos;s doubles. Having dragged themselves back in to the game Ross Hutchins and Ken Skupski have already been broken by Australia&apos;s Peter Luczak and Paul Hanley in the third set.  4.29pm: Paul Drinkhall is carrying his sensational form from the semi-final into today&apos;s table tennis final - England are 2-1 down against Singapore but Drinkhall is leading the decisive fourth match. Snarling in table tennis, we&apos;ve seen it all now.  4.24pm: British heptahlete gold medallist has been talking very movingly about her father. Hazel, who set a personal best, and secured victory with a fantastic performance in the 800m finale: &quot;I said I would bring a medal home and I am over the moon. My dad passed away in 2008 but I pictured him on the finish line of the 800m and it gave me a second wind.&quot; Back in the tennis Ross Hutchins and Ken Skupski of England are 5-3 up in the second set against Australia&apos;s Peter Luczak and Paul Hanley in the final of the men&apos;s doubles.  4.16pm: Reaction coming in from Australia&apos;s Anastasia Rodionova defeat of Sania Mirza in women&apos;s singles final. Mirza, as you might expect, was broken, but unpick this from the Russian-born Rodionova: &quot;I have been trying really hard and now I feel I am a real Australian after winning a Commonwealth Games medal.&quot;  4.09pm: In the final of the men&apos;s doubles, Ross Hutchins and Ken Skupski of England lost the first set to Australia&apos;s Peter Luczak and Paul Hanley 6-4. Hutchins and Skupski have responded though, they&apos;re currently 3-2 up in the second set.  4.04pm: Coming up shortly, England&apos;s men are taking on Singapore in the men&apos;s table tennis final. Paul Drinkhall&apos;s amazing comeback to seal victory for England against India in front of a noisy home crowd (as Drinkhall wryly put it, &quot;the atmosphere was a little bit unusual for table tennis&quot;) was one of the unexpected highlights of the games so far. Can the boy from Boro help the team snatch gold, we wonder.  3:55pm: The host nation has suffered an unexpected upset in the tennis - Sania Mirza lost the women&apos;s singles final to Australia&apos;s Anastasia Rodionova 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (3). Reflecting the incredible pressure of public interest, the match opened with five straight breaks of serve.        And with that, still basking in the reflected glory of Louise Hazel and Grace Clements, Gregg heads off. That was a fantastic achievement by Britain&apos;s women in the heptathlon and a fitting way to bring today&apos;s track and field events to a close.  3.35pm: More great news for England as Grace Clements has done enough to win bronze too. Woo! Hazel wasn&apos;t expected to win a medal before the Games so this is evidence of her maturing ability in the event. She has set a lifetime best total of 6156 which would probably be enough for her to qualify for the world championships next year. She&apos;s only going to get better too. Jessica Ennis&apos;s career took off after winning Commonwealth bronze, so this gold can do wonders for Hazel.      Gold    3.32pm: Gold! Louise Hazel finishes well within the nine-second gap required to become the Commonwealth Games champion. England has a great tradition in this event and now Kelly Sotherton and Jessica Ennis have another genuine contender in world athletics to join them. She&apos;s in tears ...  3.31pm: Hazel will have to give it some legs now as Zilinka starts to pull away ...  3.30pm: Zilinka assumes second place with Hazel back in fifth. There&apos;s a small gap already after one lap.  3.29pm: Bang! They&apos;re off ...  3.24pm: It&apos;s the 800m, the final event in the women&apos;s heptathlon, and England&apos;s Louise Hazel has a brilliant chance of winning gold for England. She is currently first on 5337 points ahead of Canada&apos;s Hazel Jessica Zilinka, who was ranked one coming into the event. That means she can afford to finsih nine seconds behind and still win. However, Zilinka can run eight seconds faster than Hazel. I&apos;m genuinely excited. you should be too ...  3.21pm: My colleague Tom Lutz reckons that the pit doesn&apos;t look long enough. It hadn&apos;t occured to me but, as the gold-medal winner Lapierre makes his final jump, it does look like he&apos;s in grave danger of grazing his knees on his way out of the pit at the far end.  3.19pm: That looks pretty good. It&apos;s definitely over 8m but comes in at 8.16m. That&apos;s silver for Rutherford. He looks well chuffed.  3.18pm: Here he goes. Huff puff huff puff huf puff huff puff ... and jump!  3.17pm: Foster reckons Rutherford has got one last jump in him. I got excited for a moment until Foster revealed that he thinks his big jump will perhaps come next year.  3.16pm: Oh! Greg Rutherford is going to have one last attempt to win gold at long jump after all.  3.12pm: It doesn&apos;t look like Rutherford will jump again in the long jump. His coach has just had a heated conversation with him and appeared to be telling him to pull out. He has a stringy piece of what looks like electrical tape on his thigh so perhaps he&apos;s got some kind of injury there. Can&apos;t imagine how that tape helps, unless he&apos;s an android or one of those human looking things from Blade Runner and his wiring&apos;s exposed.  3.07pm: Brendan Foster ought to choose his words more carefully: &quot;He crouches and explodes.&quot;  3.03pm: Greg Rutherford only has one jump remaining to claim long-jump gold after falling short of 8m in his fifth attempt. there&apos;s not enough rythmic clappping going on for my liking in any of the field events. The long-jump leader Fabrice Lapierre of Autralia chews his gold chain manically before producing a similarly disappointing jump. But he&apos;s currently in the lead so won&apos;t care.  3.01pm: Joe Thomas of Wales has just timed his run to perfection in the second men&apos;s 800m semi-final. He was back in sixth and caught up in a bit of a scrum before breaking clear and sprinting through from 60m back to finish third and qualify. He&apos;ll be hoping to do something similar in tomorrow&apos;s final.  2.56pm: The English aren&apos;t as good at jumping high as they used to be. Tom Parsons and Samson Oni both fail to clear 2.26m and go out. It&apos;s a pity for Oni because when he cleared 2.23m he looked to have done so by about 8cm. He&apos;ll be gutted at having spent all of his coins so early.  2.52pm: England 800m runner Darren Sinclair finished fourth in the men&apos;s semi-finals and will have to wait and see if he makes the final by way of being the fastest qualifier. Brendan Foster (not Fraser as I just wrote ... he was in George of the Jungle!) seems pretty certain that he will and he&apos;s knows about these things.  2.49pm: There&apos;s been good and bad news for England in the men&apos;s long jump. Chris Tomlinson, who was carried off on a stretcher after qualifying yesterday due to a heel injury, bravely had a go in the final but fouled three times and was disqualified. But Greg Rutherford has excelled himself and jumped 8.22m to hold the silver-medal place as it stands. He&apos;&apos;s 8cm off the leader (a long-legged Aussie with a lucky gold chain whose name eludes me at the moment) and has two jumps remaining.  2.46pm: Michael Johnson&apos;s giving it out to Conrad Williams now. Saying he was &quot;all over the place&quot; and not focused in the men&apos;s 400m final. It seems a bit unfair \u2013 like CP Scott appraising my efforts in this live blog.  2.44pm: There&apos;s been a silver medal for Scotland&apos;s Peter Kirkbride in men&apos;s weightlifting. The Kilmarnock weightlifter was competing in the 94kg class and lifted 144kg in the snatch and 189kg in the clean and jerk for a combined score of 333. A jubilant Kirkbride said: &quot;I am ecstatic. It&apos;s a good result, not just for me, but for everyone that&apos;s supported me. I really have something to be proud of. It&apos;s amazing. I gave it my all.&quot;  2.40pm: England&apos;s Conrad Williams says he&apos;s proud of his performance and needs to get to grips with running in &quot;pesky lane eight&quot; if he&apos;s going to challenge for medals.  2.38pm: It&apos;&apos;s not often Kenya produces good sprinters but in a photo finish Mark Mutai just pips Shaun Rowe to gold. He&apos;s elated. Andd that&apos;s two gold medals for Kenya in the space of 10 minutes.  2.37pm: Williams fades fast in the straight and finishes in a disappointing sixth.  2.37pm: Williams is second going into the straight ...  2.37pm: Williams runs a hard first 100m ...  2.36pm: It&apos;s the 400m men&apos;s final with Conrad Williams in lane eight hoping for a medal. He&apos;s coached by Linford Christie and has that arrogant air abbout him which should bode well.  2.33pm: A chuffed Guernseyite writes: &quot;Hey!! Thanks for mentioning Guernsey. We have great team of athletes on our little rock, look at Heather Watson&apos;s tennis results, Tom Druce made the 400m semis \u2013 watch out for the 4x400m men&apos;s relay team, lawn bowls are holding their own and our male swimmers did us proud. Also Guernsey have just represented England at the men&apos;s Uefa regions football comp in Croatia where they drew with Croatia, beat Wales before succumbing to Turkey, off subject I know but just to reinforce we are a sports mad island!!!&quot; Thanks to Dawn Thomas for that. Is there some magical elixir in the water over there? Can you send me some?  2.29pm: The battle for gold is between Jerogii and Chaywa of Kenya. Chaywa leaps the last hurdle without touching it and just beats Jerogi to gold. Singh finishes fifth after a fantastic sprint finish from England&apos;s Clitheroe to finish fourth.  2.26pm: It&apos;s going to be a Kenyan 1-2 but Singh is doing her best to claw back the 40 metres or so between her and the third-placed Kenyan.  2.25pm: The three Kenyan athletes are dominating the race but the crowd are raucous with Sujit Singh in fourth place just off them. England&apos;s Clitheroe and Tina brown are fourth and fifth and look out of it.  2.23pm: The steeplechase is a curious event. It seems like a drunken afterthought, with random hurdles dotted about the track which look more suited to horses than humans.  2.19pm: There is the biggest crowd (estimated at 40,000) that the Games has so far seen in the stadium tonight and a great atmosphere to go with it. Many of them are gearing up to cheer on the three Indian athletes competing in the 300m final of the steeplechase. Helen Clitheroe is the best hope for England but, having competed in the 1500m final yesterday, she might be a wee bit too stiff to give it her all.  2.12pm: Two more fantastic performances in the 200m heats: first Christian Malcolm of Wales runs 20.93sec to win his heat and then the powerful youngster Leon Baptiste runs 20.68sec while easing down the straight. He&apos;s looking the most likely to challenge in tomorrow&apos;s final and can get better given that he&apos;s still only 25 years old.  2.05pm: England&apos;s Marlon Devonish has just cruised to victory in the second heat of the men&apos;s 200m. He eases off at least 30m from the line and should be a contender for a medal tomorrow afternoon. &quot;I feel better today. I didn&apos;t want to do anything silly and I&apos;m happy with that,&quot; he says.  1.59pm: That&apos;s the swimming done and dusted at the Commonwealth Games. The top three in the overall medals table ended up looking like this:1) Australia 542) England 343) South Africa 16  1.57pm: Guernsey finished a creditable eighth, in case you&apos;re wondering ...  1.55pm: Men&apos;s 4x100m Medley Relay: Simon Burnett puts in a blistering final leg in the freestyle for England and misses out by a fingernail&apos;s length on the silver medal. 1) Australia 2) South Africa 3) England  1.52pm: Australia immediately burst back into the lead after a wonderful handover. Dan Sliwinski appears to be the weaker member of the England team and falls back to third after the breastroke.  1.52pm: Liam Tancock gets England off to a fantastic start, taking the lead by about a second and a half after his backstroke leg ...  1.49pm: It&apos;s the final of the men&apos;s 4x100m Medley Relay now, where England, Scotland and Guernsey, yes Guernsey, are in action. Australia and Canada are favourites \u2013 no offence Guernsey. I&apos;m surprised they&apos;ve found four swimmers to compete ...  1.44pm: Coming up on the track this evening Chris Tomlinson will be, erm, leaping into action for England in the final of the men&apos;s long jump.  1.39pm: The veteran English athlete Joice Maduaka (she&apos;s 37!) wins her 200m heat in a time of 23.74sec. She seemed completely relaxed as she gracefully made her way down the straight.  1.36pm: Women&apos;s 4x100m Medley Relay final: Australia claim gold, Fran Halsall comes in the silver-medal position for England and Canada pip Wales to third. Wales smash the national record, finishing fourth.  1.35pm: England are in second going into the last 100m freestyle. Wales are still in the hunt for bronze. Australia are well out in front.  1.33pm: It&apos;s the Women&apos;s 4x100m Medley Relay in the pool now with England hoping for a medal. Gemma Spofforth doesn&apos;t get off to the most blistering start and leaves England in second after the backstroke.  1.27pm: Evening has descended upon New Delhi and we&apos;re out of the pool and on to the track for a moment. In the second heat of the women&apos;s 200m both Lee McConnel of Scotland and Laura Turner of England are through. Turner finishes fourth and gets dog&apos;s abuse from 200m and 400m legend Michael Johnson, who reckons she should have been running much quicker than 23.99sec. Incidentally, why is Johnson so prominent on British TV? I like his punditry but does he do the same on American athletics coverage too? Can anyone in the US tell me? Or did he do something to offend the US media and that&apos;s why he&apos;s always in Britain? Hmmm. Questions, questions ...  1.21pm: It seems everybody is unhappy with the quality of the water in the pool in Delhi. The British Swimming national performance director, Michael Scott, has confirmed that he&apos;s asked for an official explanation. Scott believes it could be the result of backwash in the filtration system. &apos;Backwash&apos; is a grim sounding word. I hope it has nothing to do with this.  1.15pm: Flower of Scotland belts out in the swimming arena as Hannah Miley receives gold for her stunning performance earlier in the Women&apos;s 400m Individual Medley. Apparently her average training week involves swimming 80,000m per week. that&apos;s ridiculous. Surely that means she spends more time in water than on land. Perhaps she&apos;s part fish?  1.12pm: If you&apos;ve got nothing better to do you can email at gregg.roughley@guardian.co.uk and tell me if swimmers are born broad-shouldered with narrow waists and thus become good at swimming because they&apos;re the right shape for it. Or whether swimming sculpts your body that way? Or just keep me company. It&apos;s lonely here.  1.07pm: Daniel Fogg pips South Africa&apos;s Mark Randall to the bronze medal with a storming finish over the last 50 metres. That was a gutsy swim from the 23-year-old from Loughborough. He really turned it on over the last four lengths.Men&apos;s 1500m freestyle final results:1) Ryan Cochrane (Canada)2) Heerden Herman (South Africa)3) Daniel Fogg (England)  1.04pm: Right. We&apos;re back in the pool at Delhi where I can finally let you know that Ryan Cochrane of Canada looks likely to win gold in the 1500m men&apos;s freestyle. England are in the hunt for a bronze medal. Daniel Fogg is currently fourth and closing in on the third-placed swimmer, Mark Randall.  1.02pm: Oh. BBC coverage has gone off and we&apos;ve been dished up the lunchtime delights of Animal Hospital with Ben Fogel. Apparently, Fogel says they&apos;ve &quot;got to keep the Ostrich away from the eggs.&quot; I&apos;ve no idea why, either. Let me try and switch channels and rescue this farce ...       12.56pm: Hello, Gregg Roughley here. Scott&apos;s gone to find some food. We&apos;re good at Guardian Towers when it comes to making sure people eat when they are hungry. Anyway, I see there&apos;s some swimming taking place at the moment. I&apos;ll tell you which final it is when they mention it. I&apos;ve been watching all of four seconds and already the commentators have slated the water for being &quot;murky&quot;. They&apos;ve obviously never gone swimming in the Hampstead Heath ponds on a baltic November Wednesday ...  12.49pm: As a former devotees of the gaming wonder that was Jahangir Khan&apos;s World Championship Squash, we&apos;ve been glad of the opportunity that the Commonwealth Games offers to give the sport some much needed coverage. So far today in the men&apos;s England bt Cayman Islands 2-0, Norfolk Island bt Zambia 2-1, Australia bt Botswana 2-0, Malta bt Norfolk Island 2-0, Scotland bt Malawi 2-0 and India bt Uganda 2-1.  12.40pm: Benoit Huot of Canada wins the 100m Freestyle para S10 in a new championship record of 53.7, with England&apos;s Rob Welbourn grabbing the bronze.  12.28pm: Back in the pool, Scotland&apos;s Hannah Miley keeps Australia&apos;s Samantha Hamill at bay to take the women&apos;s 400m individual medley. England&apos;s Keri-Anne Payne wins bronze. Miley won in four minutes 38.83 seconds, a new Games record. Victory means the 21-year-old Scot added the Commonwealth title to the European crown she took in August.      Gold     12.25pm: England&apos;s Anita North has won a gold medal and Scotland&apos;s Shona Marshall the silver medal in shooting&apos;s women&apos;s singles trap at the Commonwealth Games.  12:18pm: Liverpool&apos;s Duncan &apos;&apos;It was a little bit unusual for table tennis has followed the dead-eyed lead of Nicky Hunt by winning the individual compound archery gold.  12.16pm: Australia&apos;s Brenton Rickard won the men&apos;s 200m breaststroke from Scotland&apos;s Michael Jamieson  12.13pm: Just reading about the security preparations for the cycling road race tomorrow (which will feature Tour de France star Mark Cavendish). As the telegenic race circles round landmarks such as the Presidential Palace, steel barricades, snipers and helicopters are all being deployed to prevent a reoccurance of the shootings that injured two tourists last month. Cavendish is the hot favourite (as Christopher Whorrall put it, &quot;Cycling is a game of poker, but with Cavendish you almost have a guarantee&quot;) but the tight nature of the laps may even things up. Cavendish himself seems to be feeling the pressure. You don&apos;t need to be a Edward Lutyens fan to see that this promises to be a great event.  11.48am: Canada, Australia and South Africa have already put their towels down in the first of today&apos;s nine swimming finals. Canada&apos;s Brent Hayden took gold in the 50m freestyle, while Australia&apos;s Jessica Schipper took gold for Australia in the 200m butterfly (England&apos;s Ellen Gandy took bronze).  West Country starlet Stephanie Millward took silver behind the South African phenomenon that is Natalie du Toit in the 100m butterfly para S9. Du Toit has now taken three golds in what is her first Commonwealth games.  11.41am: The Haroon Khan story is a tale that refuses to be counted out. Back in the summer, the guardian&apos;s boxing expert Kevin Mitchell explained that Khan&apos;s non-selection reflected the incredible strength of bantamweight boxing in Britain.  According to Mitchell: &quot;The authoritative Boxing News amateur rankings have Khan, who went out in the early rounds of the ABA Championships this year, at No10 in the 54kg category, so he&apos;s got some work to do... As my source put it, if he shows &quot;significant progress in the next few months&quot; he will be in contention for funding in 2011. Khan says he&apos;s happy to box for Pakistan in Delhi \u2013 but he still wants to emulate Amir by boxing for Britain in the Olympics. That&apos;s having a bit each way, but there&apos;s one way to impress (boxing chief) McCracken: don&apos;t lose.&quot;  11.33am: Scotland&apos;s Jonathan Hammond took silver in the men&apos;s 50m rifle 3-position singles to finish second behind India&apos;s Gagan Narang, who claimed his fourth gold medal of the Games with a score of 1262.2. England&apos;s James Huckle took the bronze medal with 1254.9.  11.31am: Some interesting and altogether less concillatory quotes coming in from Haroon Khan, following his tense victory over Wales&apos; Andrew Selby, a victory which ensures him a bronze medal. Khan told AP: &quot;This is what I wanted to do - get a medal and beat a lad from the Great Britain podium squad. I&apos;ve done that and proved them wrong. It [beating a Briton] is more important than the medal.&quot; Khan, of course, is boxing for Pakistan after being over looked by the England side.      Gold    11.21am: A belated congratulations to Leeds Met university student Jo Jackson, who much much earlier today (around 4am GMT) won the 20K walking race in a time of one hour 34 minutes and 22 seconds.  11.18am: One highlight of the afternoon will be Sania Mirza&apos;s appearance in the women&apos;s tennis final. The Indian star, you might remember, caused a celebrity geo-political apocalypse of sorts when she announced her engagement to Pakistani cricket Shoaib Malik back in April. Setting less pulses alight was the India versus Malwai netball match which, according to India&apos;s Mail Today, was watched by a grand total of seven people.  11.14am: Earlier this morning there was success for England&apos;s hockey teams - England&apos;s men beat New Zealand 5-3 in the group stages, while goals from Nicola White, Alex Danson and Georgina Twigg booked England&apos;s women a semi-final spot by beating Malaysia 3-0.  11.08am: Haroon Khan says he holds no grudge against English boxing or English boxers, just England&apos;s selectors. He had this to say after his victory over Andrew Selby: &quot;I came to prove myself. All I wanted was the medal and now I&apos;ve got that so I&apos;m delighted. I don&apos;t have a problem with the England boxers... it&apos;s just the selectors.&quot; Just before that Northern Ireland&apos;s Paddy Barnes became the first boxer from the home nations to secure a medal after beating Australia&apos;s Andrew Moloney 4-2.  11.00am: In altogether more contentious archery news, the English team have denied swearing at an Indian offifial after the England team lost to India in the women&apos;s recurve final on Friday. Andy Bull has the details.  Andy Bull, Rice123, is one of two guardian scribes currently at the Commonwealth Games.      Gold     10.45am: Gold for British archery star Nicky Hunt in the women&apos;s individual compound, who fell only four points short of a perfect total after hitting 12 perfect 10s from 15 arrows to claim her second gold medal of the games. &quot;Two gold medals is more than I could ever have hoped for,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;m sure it will sink in over the next few days but at the moment it just doesn&apos;t feel real.&quot;  10.39am: Haroon Khan goes in to the last four of the flyweight contest after a tight bout finished 3-3. Great scenes! And ample justification of Haroon&apos;s desicion to represent Pakistan. Brother Amir is going to be a happy chappy.  10: 28am: Going into the third and final round, Haroon Khan, fighting for Pakistan after being overlooked by the England side, was tied at 2-2. European bronze medallist Andrew Selby of Wales is the favourite, but Bolton&apos;s Khan has a point to prove...  10.08am: You can catch up with all yesterday&apos;s action and debate here. What stood out for us was England&apos;s 1-2-3 in the 110m hurdles. Impressive in its own right, outstanding when you think that silver medlalist Will Sharman, who had been suffering with diahorrea and vomiting, had checked himself out of hospital to compete in the race. According to Rebecca Adlington, who claimed her second gold in the pool yesterday, the Games has become all about triumph over adversity. And despite reports of collapsing scoreboards, potentially poisonous pools, condom-blocked lavatories, swimmers down with Delhi belly, transport chaos and lecherous security staff, now the games have finally hit their stride, popular opinion is finally turning in their favour, says Jason Burke.  9.49am: Morning and welcome to day six of the action at the Delhi Commonwealth Games. We&apos;re looking forward to seeing Pakistan&apos;s Haroon Khan, brother of Amir, fighting Wales&apos; Andrew Selby for the flyweight bronze but there are highlights aplenty, such as: nine athletics finals - including Chris Tomlinson and Greg Rutherford going head-to-head in the men&apos;s long jump final; the finals of the tennis; and England versus Singapore in the men&apos;s team table-tennis final.  The full schdule of events can handily be found here.

At the slightest hint of rain they are deployed with all haste, whether cycling, jogging or even standing under cover. Everyone carries a brolly, from a businessman on the daily commute to the black-clad, hair-gelled, teenage rebel. Today at Suzuka the umbrellas were out in force, with full waterproof clothing in support. The rain just would not stop, turning one of the world&apos;s great race tracks into a network of rivers and lakes as the fans in the stands waited for the qualifying session that would determine the starting order for tomorrow morning&apos;s Japanese Grand Prix. The wait was in vain. With every passing deadline it became less likely that the cars would venture out and sadly for a crowd that would be a good race-day turn-out at some circuits, the day&apos;s entertainment amounted only two laps in the morning practice session that troubled the timekeepers. The cagouled and brollied masses waved good-naturedly at every camera that pointed their way and in the garages the drivers did the same, with Sebastian Vettel adding in a few swimming strokes for giggles. A toy boat drifted past on the river that ran the length of the pit lane, as McLaren faced up to the need to replace Lewis Hamilton&apos;s gearbox, meaning a five-place grid penalty for the Englishman. This is not the first time that Suzuka has had its schedule disrupted by the weather. In 2004 Typhoon Ma-on went by close enough to the island of Honshu to wash out qualifying on the Saturday, and on that occasion the grid was decided on the morning of the race as it will be tomorrow. There was no typhoon today, just sheer weight of water, enough to make driving a Formula One car with only a few centimetres of ground clearance out of the question. Six years ago Michael Schumacher had sown up the championship by the time the F1 circus descended on Suzuka, in his last season of dominance in Formula One. Going into tomorrow morning&apos;s race there were still five drivers battling for the championship and today&apos;s washout was another twist in a season that came to the boil early and simply will not simmer down. After two races of Fernando Alonso and Ferrari dominance, Red Bull were right back at the sharp end here, with Vettel looking as controlled as he was fast. The young German lies fourth in the standings, 21 points behind team-mate Mark Webber at the top of the pile. Back in March, as the season spluttered into life with a deceptively dud race in Bahrain, it was Vettel who was many pundits&apos; favourite to take the title. A mechanical glitch restricted him to fourth in the opener and then he failed to finish in Australia, but a win and two podiums in the next four races confirmed the view that his time had come. Not only was he fast but he was the smiling face of the sport, media-friendly and with a sense of humour that is out of step with much of the paddock. Then came Turkey. The crash with his team-mate Webber as they duelled for the lead in Istanbul changed the perception of Vettel. The accident was clearly his fault, but the way Red Bull tried to point the finger at Webber, an opponent Vettel underestimated, made the 23-year-old appear like a spoiled child. Then he started to behave like one. His win in Valencia was soon forgotten in the front-wing row and lacklustre race at Silverstone, his error behind the pace car in Hungary that led to a drive-through penalty and his harpooning of Jenson Button&apos;s McLaren at Spa. F1&apos;s once bright young thing was living up to his new image. Something changed at Monza as the hot and bothered Vettel of the summer felt the cool of autumn. Early in the Italian Grand Prix he sensed his car, Randy Mandy as he calls his Red Bull, labouring. He was on the radio to his engineer immediately, the panic apparent to all listening in. But what he thought was an engine problem was in fact a sticking brake. Once rectified, he drove sublimely to finish fourth and ahead of Webber, who he had earlier let by on a track where his team were expected to struggle. A fortnight ago, under the lights in Singapore, he put Alonso under pressure all the way to the flag. Vettel won the Japanese Grand Prix here last year and on the evidence of practice, it will take something special to have bettered him in tomorrow morning&apos;s race. It is the inaugural Korean Grand Prix in two weeks, but Red Bull cars won in both Brazil and Abu Dhabi in 2009 and look perfectly equipped to do so again. Webber may be leading the way going into the final chapters of 2010, but if Vettel can keep the Australian back in second place until the chequered flag falls at Yas Marina next month he will be champion, just as many expected."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/10/lewis-hamilton-japanese-grand-prix", "sentences": ["There was little he could do about the gearbox failure in Hungary, but an ill\u2011judged passing manoeuvre on the opening lap at Monza and then not leaving Mark Webber&apos;s Red Bull enough room in Singapore as he looked to make up a place were errors he could ill afford.", "He should never have been there having qualified as the third fastest, but he had to start from eighth on the grid after being docked five places for replacing his gearbox, damaged in the collision in\u00a0Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-10T17:42:55Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton suffers another setback in the Japanese grand prix", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "The image was striking. An hour before the start of the Japanese grand prix the 24 drivers were led to a priceless array of classic sports cars in order to be paraded around the Suzuka circuit. There were Rolls-Royces and Mercedes, Ferraris, Alfa Romeos and Jaguars but, as the cavalcade set off, perched in the back of a three\u2011wheeled Messerschmitt was the unmistakable figure of Lewis Hamilton. It was one of those weekends when nothing quite worked out the way it should for the 2008 world champion, and now any hopes that this season will bring a second title must be as likely as one of Japan&apos;s Shinkansen trains ever running late. In mid-summer Hamilton put together a four-race run of two wins and two second places to lead the championship but in the six grands prix since the British round at Silverstone on 11\u00a0July he has stood on the podium just once, the top step at Spa. In a five-way title fight results like that do not a champion make, and Hamilton must now\u00a0be ruing the errors and ill fortune\u00a0that have blighted the second half of his season. There was little he could do about the gearbox failure in Hungary, but an ill\u2011judged passing manoeuvre on the opening lap at Monza and then not leaving Mark Webber&apos;s Red Bull enough room in Singapore as he looked to make up a place were errors he could ill afford. Stuffing his McLaren into the barrier only 45 minutes into practice here on Friday was another black mark on what will be an interesting report card come the season&apos;s end. Today Hamilton found himself stymied behind his team-mate, Jenson Button, despite running on soft tyres and clearly having more speed. He should never have been there having qualified as the third fastest, but he had to start from eighth on the grid after being docked five places for replacing his gearbox, damaged in the collision in\u00a0Singapore. Once he had pitted on lap 23 and his car\u00a0was in clean air he was the quickest man on the track, but he was defenceless against Button when, on lap 44, his soft\u2011tyred team-mate, now with a low fuel load, drove straight past him and into fourth place. It did not help that Hamilton&apos;s new gearbox refused to engage third as the race wore on. The icing on this cake of woe for Hamilton is that he was also suffering from an ear infection. There are three races left, starting with the inaugural Korean grand prix in a fortnight&apos;s time, and none of the circuits left \u2013 Brazil and Abu Dhabi wrap up the season \u2013 look like McLaren-friendly tracks. To be fair, few have been bar Montreal. It has been Hamilton&apos;s phenomenal talent and sheer will along with Button&apos;s guile and craft that have kept the Woking team in the hunt. The 2010 McLaren-Mercedes is a good car but it is no Red Bull, and it has not been developed as progressively as the Ferrari that Fernando Alonso has made such good use of in recent races. There is no doubt that Hamilton has made the car look better than it really is. His drive in Australia was mesmerising before he got clattered by an over-excited Webber, and it was the Englishman&apos;s dogged pursuit of Sebastien Vettel and Webber in Turkey that was the catalyst for the Red Bulls to crash into each other. It might yet be that Hamilton can rescue his season and race with the No1 on the front of his car next year, but after yesterday it is long odds against. The never-say-die attitude and the racer&apos;s instinct have not been enough, and on occasion have even been the Englishman&apos;s own worst enemies. Hamilton will have learned a lot from having the error-free Button on the other side of the garage this season and will no doubt put it to good use in 2011. But for the remainder of this season he will continue to go flat out \u2013 that is the man&apos;s forte. It is also his foible."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/11/commonwealth-games-2010-delhi-11-october", "sentences": ["12.11pm: Coming up this afternoon:      Haroon Khan (left) fights for Pakistan v India shortly Photograph: Saurabh Das/AP    Boxing - including Amir Khan&apos;s little brother Haroon, fighting for Pakistan versus India&apos;s Suranjoy Mayengbam at around 1pm BST) Athletics - 200m Women&apos;s Final (1.20pm), 3000m Steeplechase Men Final (2.30pm), 800m Women&apos;s Final (3.15pm), 10000m Men Final (4.25pm) Plus more rugby sevens, squash, diving, lawn bowls...  12.06pm: Time to update the medals table: Golds61 - Australia29 - India26 - England22 - Canada11 - South Africa8 - Nigeria6- Malaysia, Kenya5 - Singapore Total137 - Australia105 - England75 - India59 - Canada31 - South Africa26 - Nigeria23 - New Zealand20 - Malaysia  11.53am: Merchandising appears to be just as much as a fiasco as some of the ticketing arrangements."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-11T08:09:27Z", "title": "Commonwealth Games 2010 live blog: 11 October | Steve Busfield", "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2010", "Sport", "Commonwealth Games"], "article": "      5.20pm: Time to recap another fascinating day at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games: \u2022 India won its first ever women&apos;s athletics gold, with Krishna Poonia in the discus.

Thank you for reading and commenting. Our liveblog will return tomorrow.  4.59pm: Some quotes from Anthony Ogogo, who was once on Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack, and today controversially beat Vijender Singh (aka &quot;India&apos;s David Beckham&quot;):  I found his Achilles heel. I&apos;ve beaten him. I can&apos;t believe it. I&apos;m very happy. I thrive on the pressure. Boxing is one of the most pressure sports. I thrive in that environment. No disrepect to the Indian crowd. They&apos;ve shown nothing but hospitality to us. I wasn&apos;t taking the mickey. I blew a kiss because I wanted to thank them.   4.55pm: Kipsiro holds them off to claim gold. Making it a double gold, having won the 5000m. Salel almost caught Kipsiro, but it was Uganda 1 and Kenya 2-3-4.  4.54pm: One lap to go and Kipsiro pushes ahead, stretching the Kenyans....  4.51pm: Four laps to go, still three Kenyans and Kipsiro of Uganda a long way ahead...  4.46pm: Credit to Chris Thompson, who took silver at the recent European championships behind Mo Farah, who is gradually picking off the athletes who couldn&apos;t keep up with the leaders. Mbishei of Kenya is still leading the front pack of four.  4.42pm: So, the leading pack in the 10,000m is down to four: Titus Mbishei of Kenya, Joseph Birech of Kenya, Daniel Salel of Kenya and Moses Kipsiro of Uganda.  4.38pm: Approaching the halfway point of the 10,000m final and the field has become exceptionally spread out. There&apos;s a leading pack of about eight, including all the Kenyan runners, followed by England&apos;s Chris Thompson on his own, about 40m back, and then a further 40m back, another pack.

With this I think we wiped out everything bad that was happening before the Games and came out united.&quot; Silver medallist Kaur added: &quot;The crowd inspired me to the medal.&quot;             3.37pm: The Indian women&apos;s dicus throwers have just collected their medals - you can share their anthem here, while also thinking about India&apos;s other sporting stars who are currently giving Australia a hard time. For posterity&apos;s sake, here is that final result in the women&apos;s discus: 1. Krishna Poonia, India, 61.51 metres2. Harwant Kaur, India, 60.16m3. Seema Antil, India, 58.46m  3.26pm: I suspect the row over Ogogo&apos;s defeat of India&apos;s Vijender in the 75kg semi final will rumble on (particularly below the line here). As NDTV reports:  Vijender was leading 3-0 in the last round against his English opponent Antoni Ogogo, but the latter was awarded four penalty points for two fouls that the Indian boxer committed.  Vijender&apos;s first foul was in holding his opponent and the second was in pushing his head down. Vijender&apos;s coach said the Indian Boxing Federation had lodged an appeal saying Ogogo too committed a foul but was not penalized.   3.19pm: Crowd goes very quiet. Tintu Luka tried her best, ran from the front, Langat, 1500m Olympic champion, just too good for her, although she faded too, and only just held off Nikki Hamblin of New Zealand, who took silver. Diane Cummins of Canada took bronze. Luka ends up with nothing.  3.18pm: Tintu Luka fades desperately in the home straight, Lagat holds on to win.  3.17pm: Langat is on Tintu Luka&apos;s shoulder, and she overtakes with 250m to go....  3.16pm: Tintu Luka sets off like a rocket, four metres clear after first 300m. Can she hold on?  3.13pm: India&apos;s Tintu Luka about to run in the women&apos;s 800m final. The crowd will be massively behind her, but Nancy Langat of Kenya is favourite. India has never won a women&apos;s track gold at the Commonwealth Games. It&apos;s men won gold in 1958, through Milkha Singh in the 400m.  3.10pm: New Zealand have beaten South Africa 1-0 in the second women&apos;s hockey semi-final, setting up a Trans-Tasman clash in the final.  3.06pm: Two men&apos;s 1500m semi finals are being run.

Maybe Andy Bull in the stadium can let us know what the Indian crowd thinks of that...  2.17pm: Coming up shortly, India&apos;s Tintu Luka will be bidding to become the country&apos;s first female track CWG gold medallist in the 800m final....       2.10pm: England beating Australia may turn out to be a good result for the Aussies...am hearing reports on Twitter that Kenya have beaten Samoa 12-10, meaning that England will have to play the Samoans, and if they win that they may have to play New Zealand in the semis.... Will check for confirmation of that result and the line up for the quarter finals tomorrow.  2.07pm: IN the boxing ring, middleweigh semi-final between England&apos;s Anthony Ogogo against India&apos;s Vijender Singh has just started. Low-scoring bout, 1-0 to Singh after one-and-a-half rounds.  2.05pm: Back to the athletics stadium in Delhi, and the finalists for the 4x400m have been decided: England, Kenya, Botswana and India from the first semi final and Bahamas, Australia, Wales and Jamaica from the second.  1.49pm: Elsewhere, UK Athletics has pledged its support to West Ham&apos;s bid for the 2012 Olympics Stadium. West Ham have committed to supporting the continuation of athletics at the venue and in the area.  1.45pm: England 21-19 Australia, as Aussies miss last second conversion, leaving the Aussies likely to meet Samoa in the quarter final (Samoa v Kenya table-topping decider soon).  1.41pm: England 21-14 Australia. 1 min to go  1.39pm: Turner scores 70m try, 14-14. 2 mins to go  1.38pm: Australia 14-7 England, four minutes to go...  1.36pm: England 7-7 Australia, early in the second half.  1.30pm: Across at the rugby sevens, Australia have just broken the deadlock, seconds after England had a player sinbinned.

An outpouring of emotion after being disqualified from the 100m a few days ago. And she fell in the 2006 CWG hurdles final.  1.03pm: Going to be jumping around the stadia over the next few hours. Here&apos;s the women&apos;s 100m hurdles final, with Sally Pearson&apos;s chance to get over her 100m heartache....  1.01pm: And it finishes 21-5 to SA in the rugby  12.55pm: Nigerian sprinter Osayemi Oludamola is to remain provisionally suspended and won&apos;t know until Wednesday morning to discover her fate, the Commonwealth Games Federation has announced.  A Commonwealth Games Federation statement read: &quot;The provisional hearing ruled that the provisional suspension of the athlete will continue until the result of the B sample is received. That B sample result is expected within 48 hours from the time of the request; so further details are not expected until Wednesday morning (Delhi time). The Federation Court will give its final deliberation on the matter of Ms Oludamola upon receipt of the B sample test result.&quot; To put this into context, Federation president Mike Fennell said this is the only positive test thus far out of 950 tests.  12.51pm: SA 21-5 Wales at half-time.  12.43pm: Some one-sided games in the rugby sevens:  Group A: Canada 47 Guyana 0 Group B: Tonga 38 India 5 Group C: Samoa 61 Malaysia 0, Kenya 17 Papua New Guinea 12 Group D: England 55 Uganda 0, Australia 42 Sri Lanka 5  And now it&apos;s Wales v South Africa, which should be a good game, not least because the winners will (probably) avoid New Zealand in the next round (unless the All Blacks lose to Scotland).       12.21pm: So far today: \u2022 Oludamola Osayomi, the women&apos;s 100m champion from Nigeria, has failed a drugs test. Her B sample will be tested later this afternoon before a verdict is reached on whether or not she will be stripped of her medal, but she has been provisionally suspended. If Osayomi is disqualified Saint Vincent and Grenadines&apos; Natasah Mayers will take the gold. The original race winner, Australia&apos;s Sally Pearson, was disqualified after a false start, although she was about to collect her medal when the decision was made. \u2022 Australia&apos;s Pearson has a chance at redemption in the women&apos;s 100m hurdles final today. \u2022 Australia beat England 1-0 in the women&apos;s hockey semi-final, following which the English coach attacked the midday scheduling of the match.

We have an email from Sean Ingle&apos;s brother who happens to be in Delhi:  We went to the main stadium to see the Athletics on Thursday night, and whilst there we hoped to buy some souvenirs. We found our seats about 30 min before the start so went for a wander around the stadium without any luck. A volunteer assured us there was a store and gave us directions. After a further two failed efforts to locate the store by ourselves, a volunteer escorted us. Next to a food outlet was a small tarpaulin tent about the size of a garden shed which was closed - although you could see through the gap and it was totally empty. The volunteer appeared surprised and gave us directions to what we were told was the main CWG store near to Connaught Place (the equivalent of Piccadilly Circus). We went there the following day to find it was the offices for the CWG authority. When we tried to enter through the security (airport level) we were refused and directed to the reception to the side of the building. We managed to convince them to let us enter.  We went back through the security gates to find a small store about the size of a family lounge. It contained a number of sealed boxes, with a member of staff trying to fill the largely empty shelves. The only other people there appeared to be competitors and officials. The quality of the produce was appalling - what appeared to be cheap &apos;knock off&apos; T-shirts, some shot glasses, pens and key rings - none of which was priced. Also bizarrely there was a large stock of bottles of aloe vera bottles (not CWG branded in any way). There were no mugs, no mascot themed toys, no pins. When we came to pay, there was one man hand writing receipts, and working out the price using a calculator. There was no till at all! Given the cost of the games and the size of the population of India it seemed criminal that such a commercial opportunity was being lost.    11.40am: Good to hear from Andy Bull that the boxing stadium is packed today. The athletics stadium has had big crowds through the weekend. But we continue to hear stories of how difficult it is to get into events despite many empty seats. The official in charge of ticket sales was sacked yesterday. The Economic Times reports:  A top official of the organising committee (OC) of the ongoing Commonwealth Games was relieved of his ticketing responsibilities hours after he suggested to the top management that the practice of issuing &apos;complimentary&apos; tickets be stopped, a person familiar with the development said. Sanjiv Mittal, a joint director general of the OC, wrote in an email on 7 October, three days after the games began and when ticketing was just about emerging as an area of concern, that the practice of distributing complimentary tickets be discontinued as &quot;buying spectators&quot; are having to &quot;return without tickets&quot;. The same evening, OC chairman Suresh Kalmadi issued orders to the effect that Mittal should focus entirely on catering, the other functional area under him, and ticketing would now be handled by a junior officer, director Monica Jolly. Strangely, even as ticketing has emerged as the weakest link in OC&apos;s operations, with complaints of tickets ending up with paper recyclers and being sold in the black market, the committee has not appointed a senior officer to iron out the issues. The defining riddle of this Games has been the simultaneous existence of &quot;Sold Out&quot; boards at the box office outside stadia, and empty rows of seats inside. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell has ordered a probe into the ticketing fiasco.  &quot;In view of above, it may be suggested that we do not distribute unsold tickets as &apos;Complimentary&apos; for any of the sports except Athletics where significant stock is not yet sold in the light of the huge capacity of the JLN Stadium. Hence, it may be proposed that we do not get these tickets printed except for Athletics... It may not be out of context to mention here that we have been experiencing near empty stadia for some of the sports events in spite of having distributed a large number of tickets for the same,&quot; Mittal wrote in the 7 October email to Kalmadi, CEO Jarnail Singh and others.  ...The absence of tickets at the box office for the paying spectator is the ultimate insult to the country&apos;s citizens, who have been mute witnesses as tens of thousands of crores of tax payer&apos;s money has gone into the organization of the mega event. After enduring reports of pervasive corruption, shoddy construction and international ridicule, the ordinary sports lover is still unable to watch his favourite stars in action because the organizers are obliging the powers that be in Delhi&apos;s endless corridors of power. Those who get the complimentary passes do not show up anyway, leading to empty arenas.    11.19am: The lawn bowls men&apos;s pairs final will be England v South Africa in the final of the men&apos;s pairs. South Africa beat Scotland and England beat Malaysia in the semi finals.  10.57am: I should explain that the final of the women&apos;s 200 metres at the Commonwealth Games will be held at about 1.20pm today. It was due to be held yesterday but was postponed until today after the Cypriot team appealed against the disqualification of Elana Artymata from the semis. Artymata had the fastest time of the semi-finals (23.15 seconds) but was disqualified for running out of her lane.  10.50am: More from Andy Bull in the boxing ring:   Northern Ireland&apos;s Patrick Gallagher won his fight against Dilbag Singh in the welterweight semi. Just. He was 5-1 up with 90 seconds or so to go in the third, when Dilbag went berserk and started swinging wild and loose. He pulled back to 5-4 (you can imagine what the crowd were like at this point) with 20 seconds to go. Gallagher was reduced to running around the ring to get away from this flailing, whirling boxer who was constantly coming after him.  Final line ups decided this morning are:Light fly - Paddy Barnes (N Ire) v Jafet Uutoni (Nam).Light - Tom Stalker (Eng) v Josh Taylor (Sco)Welter - Callum Smith (Eng) v Patrick Gallagher (N Ire)  10.43am: England hockey coach Danny Kerry has let rip over the scheduling of the Ashes semi final in the midday heat, with temperatures reaching 40C. The s-f is followed in the cooler evening by the seventh/eighth-place play-off. Unfortunately some may feel that Kerry&apos;s argument sound a little like sour grapes after losing the semi final, but here is what he said:   The scheduling is just nonsense. If someone can play the logic to me behind that then please do. We&apos;ve not played in a single evening game. It&apos;s very, very difficult to play meaningful hockey here. This is one of the few times our sport&apos;s on TV and players are struggling to run - this is not a good advert.  They&apos;ve done this sport a disservice. In good organisations you have real consultation - you ask players, you ask coaches and then everyone feels like they&apos;re in the same sport. Here we just have administrators who just enjoy coming on the jollies.   10.30am: Some rugby sevens results: New Zealand 52 Guyana 0, Scotland 19 Canada 17. And squash: Men&apos;s Doubles round of 16: Scotland bt India 2-0, Australia bt Pakistan 2-0, New Zealand bt Zambia 2-0  And below the line Andy Bull has added some boxing semi final details. Here are some more s-f results: Light Fly 46-49kg Jafet Uutoni (Nam) bt Muhammad Waseem (Pak) won by PTS 10-1 Paddy Barnes (NIrl) bt Amandeep Singh (Ind) won by PTS 5-0  Bantam 56kg Manju Wanniarachchi (Sri) bt Tirafalo Seoko (Bot) won by RSC R2 0:48 Sean McGoldrick (Wal) bt Louis Julie (Mri) won by PTS 2-1  10.18am: The New Zealand television host who sparked a diplomatic row when he ridiculed the name of Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of the Indian capital, has quit. TVNZ came under heavy criticism after its Breakfast show host Paul Henry mispronounced Dikshit, despite being told by the lead anchor that it is pronounced &quot;Dixit&quot;.  India summoned New Zealand&apos;s high commissioner last week to formally protest against what it said were &quot;racial remarks&quot; involving Dikshit who was asked last month to take charge of the floundering Commonwealth Games preparations.  NZ PM John Key said today that Henry had resigned after several hundred complaints to the broadcaster regarding his Dikshit comments and questioning whether the nation&apos;s Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand, who is of Indian descent, was &quot;even a New Zealander.&quot;  Henry, 50, who was suspended from the TV station on October 5, said in a statement:   I have apologised twice, and have meant every word. I again apologise to all those who were genuinely hurt by what I said. However, it is clear that things have now reached a point where my actions will have to speak louder than my words. I am astonished and dismayed that my comments have created a diplomatic incident. My style is conversational and of course unscripted. I walk the finest of lines and accept that I have inadvertently crossed it from time to time. But I recognise the realities of the situation. I do not want to continue to be used as a lightning rod for racial disharmony in this country. Likewise, I certainly do not want to have my elderly mother staked out at her nursing home by tabloid media, as has happened this weekend.   10.16am: Games Federation chief Mike Fennell on 100m gold medallist Oludamola&apos;s positive test for methylhexaneamine: &quot;Any positive test is to be regretted because we are all striving for a clean Games.&quot;  10.02am: Scotland&apos;s Kay Copland and Jen McIntosh have won a shooting gold medal in the women&apos;s 50m rfile prone pairs.  10.00am: In an Ashes clash, Australia&apos;s women beat England&apos;s women 1-0 in the semi final of the hockey, with Aussie captain Madonna Blyth scoring the decisive goal early in the second half at Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium.  9.49am: Andy Bull reports from the boxing arena in Delhi:   I&apos;ve based myself at the boxing this afternoon, partly because it has the best food, but mainly because there are an even more mouthwatering bunch of fights taking place. All of them are semi-finals. England has five guys fighting here today, plus the one who got away, Haroon Khan. The capacity here is only 2,500, but the atmosphere is incredible. Honestly, I&apos;ve never known anything quite like the noise in here when an Indian is fighting.  I&apos;m watching a brilliant flyweight bout at the minute between England&apos;s Tom Stalker and India&apos;s Jai Bhagwai. It sounds like there are 25,000 people in here.  Coming up are England&apos;s Callum Smith against Carl Hield in the welterweight, then Bradley Saunders against Louis Colin in the light welterweight. And, much later this afternoon, Simon Valilly against Awusone Yekeni in the heavyweight.  No doubt about what the crowds are here for though - Haroon Khan v Suranjoy Mayengbam (Pakistan v India) in the flyweight (around 1pm BST) and then England&apos;s Anthony Agogo v Vijender Singh in the middleweight (around 1.30pm BST). Suranjoy and Vijender are two of the biggest stars at these Games. The roof is going to come off this place. As it is now - furious boos ring out as England&apos;s Stalker wins 10-5. Great fight. He was leading 6-5 after the second round, but pulled away in the third.  I&apos;ve just popped down to talk to Stalker. He is one proud scouser right now.    9.25am: In case you haven&apos;t already seen it, this is an astonishingly popular gallery of the &quot;Expressions of exertion in the men&apos;s 1m springboard preliminary&quot;.  9.15am: And there&apos;s lots of Rugby 7s today, although sadly no Fiji, as the Pacific island is currently suspended from the Commonwealth. New Zealand will probably win gold anyway, as they have every time since the event was added to the Games in 1998.      The finish of the controversial women's 100m final in Delhi. Picture: WILLIAM WEST/AFP/Getty Images Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images    8.54am: Good morning and welcome to day eight of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. Although not on the day 8 schedule, the women&apos;s 100m is still making the headlines: Oludamola Osayomi, the sprint champion from Nigeria, has tested positive for a banned stimulant, methylhexaneamine. Her B sample will be tested later this afternoon before a verdict is reached on whether or not she will be stripped of her medal, but she has been provisionally suspended. If Osayomi is disqualified, England&apos;s Katherine Endacott will be awarded the silver medal, and Saint Vincent and Grenadines&apos; Natasah Mayers will take the gold. If Osayomi does lose her medal, she will be the second athlete to have been declared the gold medallist before later being stripped of the title. The original winner, Australia&apos;s Sally Pearson, was disqualified after the English team protested that she should not have been allowed to run in the final because she had false started in a previous attempt to start the race. Pearson&apos;s disqualification was only broken to her as she was walking out to the podium to collect her medal. As our man in the stadium, Andy Bull, says:   The women&apos;s 100m final in Delhi is fast becoming one of the most ignominious races in athletics history.  Beyond that ongoing saga, today also features plenty of new athletics, including the women&apos;s 200m sprint, the men&apos;s 10,000m and 3,000m steeplechase, and the heats of the relays. Elsewhere in Delhi there will be diving, shooting, weightlifting and boxing, including Haroon Khan&apos;s latest bout for Pakistan.

The Red Bull driver scored his first win only last year, when he triumphed in the German grand prix, and his second victory, in Brazil, was overshadowed by being the race where Jenson Button finally wrapped up the world championship. In 2010, though, the Australian has sprayed champagne from the top of the podium four times and leads the standings by 14 points with three races left. He was not expected to give his team-mate Sebastian Vettel a run for his money but the man who tweets under the name AussieGrit was underestimated not only by the young German in the other Red Bull but by a good chunk of the Formula One family too. Not any more. He has driven beautifully. Monaco and Silverstone spring to mind. He has been an uncompromising racer, not giving Vettel or Lewis Hamilton an inch in Turkey and Singapore respectively. Most importantly, he has largely avoided the bouts of brain fade that can wreck a season \u2013 his on-track hooning in Melbourne when racing Hamilton being the only exception. But there is a feeling that for Webber it is now or never, that a chance of a tilt at the title may never come again. He is certainly driving as if that is the case and that has been his strength. Of his title rivals three (Button, Hamilton and Fernando Alonso) have been world champion. The other (Vettel) is touted as being a multi-title winner by the time he hangs up his flameproof. After a decade in Formula One Webber was considered a good pro, a team man, fast enough to do a proper job but not a champion in the making. That is why Webber is the sentimental favourite the length of the pit lane. Not only has he come up the hard way; he was not expected to do much when he got there. Webber has also had a battle within his own team beyond racing the precocious Vettel. He was never a part of Red Bull&apos;s young driver programme, which is overseen by Dr Helmut Marko. The former Le Mans winner and F1 driver has been developing driver talent since his career behind the wheel was cut short by a stone piercing his visor during the 1972 French grand prix and blinding him in one eye. The Austrian is a strong influence in the Austrian-owned team and Vettel is his baby, his work in progress. One well-connected paddock insider suggested that, should Webber win the title when they tot up the points in Abu Dhabi, he might climb out of his car, tell Marko where to stick it, walk away from F1 and go and race V8 Supercars back home in Australia. It would be a shame if that were to happen because the sport needs more drivers like Webber: honest, open, funny and, most importantly, fast. He leads by 14 points after Japan and his team say they are giving each driver a fair hand but the gap is narrowing. Can Webber hold on? The last three races will be fascinating."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/11/liverpool-hearing-takeover-high-court", "sentences": ["Peter Lim, a Singapore billionaire, matched NESV&apos;s \u00a3300m offer and also agreed to clear the \u00a3200m acquisition debt sitting on the club&apos;s balance sheet and which has provoked anger from fans.", "The suggestion from Lim, who recently donated S$10m (\u00a34.8m) to the Singapore Olympic Foundation, that he would be prepared to buy the club out of administration, may yet prove significant."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-11T15:42:00Z", "title": "Liverpool off to high court as RBS obtains Tom Hicks injunction", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Business", "Football", "Sport", "Tom Hicks", "Fenway Sports Group", "Business", "Injunctions"], "article": "The fate of Liverpool will be decided in room 16 of the high court from tomorrow, when the Royal Bank of Scotland seeks to force through the sale of the club to the owners of the Boston Red Sox in the face of opposition from the current owners. With the club&apos;s future set to turn on Mr\u00a0Justice Floyd&apos;s interpretation of agreements that RBS insists were signed by Tom Hicks and George Gillett, the picture was further complicated yesterday by the public emergence of the rival bid to that of New England Sports Ventures, whose offer was accepted last week. Peter Lim, a Singapore billionaire, matched NESV&apos;s \u00a3300m offer and also agreed to clear the \u00a3200m acquisition debt sitting on the club&apos;s balance sheet and which has provoked anger from fans. The former stockbroker turned investor, who has stakes in a fashion retailer and a chain of clinics and owns a chain of Manchester United-branded cafes in the Far East, claims to be prepared to return to the table if the NESV deal falls through or Liverpool go into administration. &quot;Peter has written a letter to the Liverpool board ... he is prepared to make an improved offer,&quot; his spokeswoman said. NESV, however, would point to the fact it emerged as the winner in a competitive process and the binding agreement it has signed with the independent chairman Martin Broughton and the Liverpool board. Although Lim&apos;s intervention will be immaterial if RBS wins the case, which could take several days to resolve, it may prove problematic for RBS and Liverpool if it aids the argument of Hicks and Gillett, that they could have achieved a higher price for the club they still own. RBS, which is owed the majority of the \u00a3237m loans that fall due on Friday, will tomorrow argue that undertakings signed by Hicks and Gillett as a condition of a refinancing round in April give the chairman Martin Broughton the sole right to appoint or remove directors from the board. Liverpool, meanwhile, are also seeking a definitive court judgment to confirm that the directors have the right to sell the club. If RBS succeeds in upholding the agreements, which it believes are legally watertight, it would give Broughton the authority to push through the sale to NESV. In an attempt to block the \u00a3300m deal, Hicks last week attempted to remove the commercial director Ian Ayre and chief executive Christian Purslow from the board and replace them with Mack Hicks, his son, and Lori Kay McCutcheon. It emerged todaythat RBS was granted an interim injunction on Friday, preventing Hicks or Gillett from making any fresh moves to replace Broughton or any of the other directors. &quot;Among other things, that interim injunction prevents Mr Hicks or Mr Gillett taking any steps to remove or replace Mr Broughton from his position as chairman of the board of the Kop companies or from taking any other steps to appoint or remove any directors from the board of the Kop companies,&quot; RBS said in a statement. &quot;The proceedings represent the continuation of Friday&apos;s proceedings and relates to breach of contract only. These proceedings do not represent steps by RBS to enforce its security or to appoint an administrator.&quot; The case is the seventh due to be heard by Justice Floyd tomorrow. RBS will not seek to go down the administration route, which would be likely to result in a nine-point penalty from the Premier League, if the case or any subsequent appeal goes beyond 15 October. Only if Hicks wins would that be an option. NESV, concerned at the re-emergence of administration as an option after 10 weeks of negotiations, has indicated it would walk away from the deal or seek a significant reduction in the price if that happens. It has also emerged that RBS could have placed the club into administration at any point since the refinancing in April, since the shareholders have technically been in breach of their loan agreements since then. The suggestion from Lim, who recently donated S$10m (\u00a34.8m) to the Singapore Olympic Foundation, that he would be prepared to buy the club out of administration, may yet prove significant. NESV is increasingly unsettled by the suggestion from RBS that administration remained an option and a concurrent indication from the Premier League that the club would be docked nine points if that happens."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/12/liverpool-board-high-court", "sentences": ["An already murky picture was further obscured last night with the re-emergence on the scene of the rival bidder that the club referred to last week, named for the first time as the Singapore billionaire Peter Lim."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-11T23:06:02Z", "title": "Pitch battle over Liverpool ownership moves to court 16", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Football", "Business", "Sport", "Business"], "article": "Mr Justice Floyd has presided over a number of high-profile court cases in his time. But it is unlikely that a patent dispute over the copyright to Henry Hoover, a royalties decision in favour of the session violinist who played on the Bluebells hit Young at Heart or a spat over the name of a Stella McCartney perfume will generate nearly as much heat as that seventh on the cause list for court 16 tomorrow. The nub of the argument remains the same as when the battle for control of Liverpool exploded into the open last week. Floyd, a contract and intellectual property law specialist, will be called on to decide whether Tom Hicks and George Gillett, Liverpool&apos;s co-owners, broke a contractual agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland when they last week attempted sack the club&apos;s commercial director, Ian Ayre, and chief executive, Christian Purslow. As Martin Broughton, the independent director brought in by RBS as part of its refinancing agreement with Hicks and Gillett in April, has repeatedly argued in countless interviews since, he believes that RBS had a binding agreement with Hicks and Gillett that gave him sole reponsibility over the board and prevented them interfering in the sale process. Neil Matthews, a corporate partner with Eversheds, said it was &quot;unusual&quot; to have such detailed undertakings written into a refinancing agreement. &quot;The undertakings given to the board are very unusual,&quot; he said. &quot;The introduction of an independent chairman is not unusual, but it would be rare for shareholders to forego their ability to sack a board.&quot; It seems clear that Broughton must be sure of his ground. Much will depend on the wording of the clauses and the judge&apos;s interpretation of the competing aspects of company and contract law. &quot;Company law is very clear in that it does give shareholders the power to remove directors. But the question is then whether it puts them in breach of contract,&quot; said Matthews. Today&apos;s case is being brought by RBS, with the club&apos;s independent chairman and directors also expected to seek a declamatory judgment in a separate parallel process that they hope will confirm they have the right to sell the club. The bank is bringing the case because the signed legal undertakings were with RBS rather than the club. As such, the case will boil down to whether the disputed agreements exist and are legally binding. Further legal argument is expected to follow over whether, under company law, Hicks and Gillett did have the right to dissolve and reconstitute the board and whether that action can be subsequently undone. &quot;The essential point to the case will be the wording of the agreements relied upon by the parties and the bank in particular,&quot; said Richard Curtin, special counsel at Faegre &amp; Benson LLP. &quot;I will be surprised if RBS got their paperwork wrong. I would also comment that they are likely to have explored every possibility in preparation for the dispute at court and whatever ramifications could follow. &quot;Mr Justice Floyd will not be swayed by any emotion and he will deal with the case as you would expect of a high court judge. It is not entirely certain that the case will ultimately be heard by him as it could be passed to another judge in the Chancery Division.&quot; That is a lawyer&apos;s way of saying that this could run and run beyond Sunday&apos;s Merseyside derby. RBS insiders indicated yesterday that should the case, and any likely appeal, go beyond the 15 October deadline when their \u00a3237m financing agreement expires it would be highly unlikely to force the club into administration. An already murky picture was further obscured last night with the re-emergence on the scene of the rival bidder that the club referred to last week, named for the first time as the Singapore billionaire Peter Lim. The presence of another bidder had already riled New England Sports Ventures and its board became further unsettled over the weekend by suggestions that the club could go into administration and be hit with a nine-point penalty. But like Broughton, the rest of the board, the now hated shareholders, the hedge fund company in the US that is believed to have control of Gillett&apos;s stake in the holding company and hundreds of thousands of Liverpool fans, its fate now rests in the hands of Justice Floyd."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/12/universities-rely-on-international-staff", "sentences": ["As well as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the developing university systems in Singapore, China and India are competing with us for academic talent."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-12T07:10:19Z", "title": "Universities rely on international staff and students", "tags": ["Lecturers", "Higher education", "Education", "University funding", "Students", "International students", "Immigration and asylum", "UK news"], "article": "The government&apos;s policy objective of reducing net migration to &quot;the tens of thousands&quot; by the end of the current parliament could cause major problems for UK universities. It would also irreversibly damage the reputation of the UK overseas. Our universities are the largest volume users of the immigration system, bringing in thousands of international staff, students and visitors every year \u2013 a fact often lost on policy-makers and commentators. Over 10% of all our academic staff are non-EU nationals, and many are working in key subject areas such as science, technology and engineering. These highly skilled staff make up a core element of our workforce, and without them we would have to cut the provision of courses in areas of vital importance to the UK. This would affect the opportunities for UK students wanting to study those subjects. And it&apos;s not possible to substitute these academics for UK nationals: we simply are not producing enough graduates in these areas. Unless we are able to bring in world-leading researchers, the extraordinary international quality of UK research will plummet. World-class research requires world-class people, and we simply can&apos;t adopt a fortress Britain attitude. In the university world, our competitors are watching and will be ready to attract international staff and students deterred by negative perceptions of the UK visa system. As well as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the developing university systems in Singapore, China and India are competing with us for academic talent. They are not limiting their ability to recruit the top international staff. The business secretary, Vince Cable, recognised this when he acknowledged that the government&apos;s proposals could limit businesses and universities&apos; ability to attract &quot;the brightest and the best&quot; staff. The problem is that it doesn&apos;t appear that the Home Office is listening to the business department. There is then the issue of international students, who add such richness to our campuses and allow our UK students to experience a global culture that is likely to be essential for their future as graduates in a global world. And that is quite apart from the substantial income \u2013 over \u00a35bn \u2013 that international students bring to the UK economy each year. The cap on non-EU economic employees has already caused major difficulties for universities as interim limits were imposed in the middle of staff recruitment for the new academic year. There is also a particular difficulty with the current points-based system of immigration which rewards salary, not expertise. This means that some of the best international researchers, who score extraordinarily highly on academic qualifications but poorly on salary (researchers tend not to be well paid) fail to gain enough points to pass the test.This debate has raised questions about whether the UK is indeed &quot;open for business&quot;. Changes to our immigration system do not go unnoticed overseas. The government&apos;s policy to limit migration featured prominently during David Cameron&apos;s visit to India earlier this year. As the Prime Minister himself has acknowledged, our strategic relationship with India, China and many other countries is critically important to this country&apos;s future. But this relationship depends not only on the flow of goods and political goodwill but also on the mobility of people to and from the UK. Of course universities acknowledge the need for a robust immigration system. But it should be proportionate and workable, and must not be imposed at the expense of our universities, our international reputation and our economic growth. \u2022 Nicola Dandridge is chief executive of Universities UK, the vice-chancellors&apos; umbrella organisation"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/oct/12/liverpool-fc-rbs-hicks-gillett-john-w-henry", "sentences": ["MeritonThe group name for a bid from Singapore-based businessman Peter Lim.", "In 2007 Forbes said he was the 7th richest man in Singapore.", "1.07pm: And the court has broken for lunch....  1.05pm: H&amp;G&apos;s representative in court: &quot;Meriton believe their bid is the &apos;preferred&apos; one of the board and is &apos;superior&apos; to that of NESV.&quot; Sachin Nakrani, adds: &quot;Meriton is a separate bid to Mill Financial, possibly, though unclear, the Singapore businessman, Petrer Lim.&quot;  12.59pm: H&amp;G&apos;s representative in court: &quot;Claims Meriton wrote letter to Hicks and Gillett on Friday evening asking &apos;what was going on&apos; regarding their takeover bid.&quot;  12.57pm: From court: &quot;Owners have no idea what happened after 4.30pm on 5 October, according to their rep, and were not kept informed by the board thereafter.&quot;  12.56pm: Back to court, H&amp;G&apos;s representatives: &quot;Claims there was no meeting of the Kop Holdings board to discuss NESV deal and this should have happened.", "Sporting Intelligence website is carrying a statement from the Singapore businessman, saying that \u00a3360m has been offered - \u00a3320m in cash for the club and its liabilities plus \u00a340m to buy players.", "Singapore billionaire Peter Lim matched New England Sports Venture&apos;s \u00a3300m offer and also agreed to clear the \u00a3200m acquisition debt sitting on the club&apos;s balance sheet."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-12T08:33:30Z", "title": "Liverpool FC sale: High court hearing live coverage | Steve Busfield", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Sport", "John W Henry", "Football", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Business", "Business"], "article": "      6.12pm: Thank you for reading, commenting, emailing and tweeting today. We will return with another live blog tomorrow morning for the Judge&apos;s, er, judgement. Meanwhile, here is a recap of the day&apos;s events.  5.36pm: Time to catch up with a few emails and tweets before I head off to Wembley... Matthew Fraier emails: &quot;Just wanted to give you some parallels to my favorite baseball team, the Texas Rangers, which were previously owned by Hicks. He bought the team in 1998, and had success with the current group of players by making the playoffs in 1998 and 1999. Then, through bad management decisions including paying $272million for Alex Rodriguez, the team finished last in their conference four 4 years in a row. Under his ownership, the team only had 3 winning records out of 11 seasons in charge. His team went up for auction this year and wouldn&apos;t you know it, they are in the playoffs again.&quot; Daniel Kennett has forwarded a link to this piece - &quot;What changed overnight to see Reds board attend court?&quot; - on anfieldroad.com about the court case and why it escalated to such a large hearing. Thank you for the host of emails about the ownership and finances of Mill Financials. We will investigate these further.  5.22pm: My colleague Sachin Nakrani down at the High Court says that there have been supporters outside the High Court chanting and an enormous media scrum. He says courtroom 16 has been packed all day, so busy that many journalists have been lining the walls. There were a few noticeable Liverpool supporters and at one stage the room was so full that some people were standing outside the main door leaning in to listen. The BBC&apos;s Dan Roan tweeted this picture of the scene outside the High Court.  5.15pm: As John Riordan has just emailed: &quot;If judge says it would be a &quot;little ambitious&quot; for the case to be settled by Friday - why is there to be a judgement at 10.30am tomorrow?&quot; Perhaps the Judge has taken on board the RBS/board view that the decision must be made immediately? Although there is no guarantee that there will be a definitive judgement at 10.30am tomorrow (Wednesday)      Mr Justice Floyd Picture: Gary Lee/UPPA    4.48pm: JUDGEMENT ON THE CASE IS TO BE GIVEN AT 10.30AM TOMORROW (WEDNESDAY) MORNING, says the Mr Justice Floyd  4.34pm: Our reporter on the spot, Sachin Nakrani summarises from court:  RBS says owners have contradicted rules of sales agreement by trying to oust two members of the board and there should be a mandatory injunction imposed by the court to make sure the board is reinstated. G&amp;H admit they have breached sales agreement but say they only did it because the board excluded them from the sales agreement and refused to take into account stronger alternative bids to NESV. As a result, they dispute the injunction claim. The Board disputes the claim that the owners were excluded from the sales agreement and says that instead the owners simply refused to take part. It also insists the NESV bid was the strongest on the table after a thorough process to find a buyer for the club.  4.30pm: While we wait for the next update from court, what does it mean if the court doesn&apos;t make its decision today, or indeed, this week (as seems distinctly possible given Mr Justice Floyd&apos;s recent comment)? Reuters says this:  If the Oct. 15 deadline for a refinancing of Liverpool&apos;s debt is missed, lawyers believe RBS could take control of the club and conduct the sale itself. That could result in the holding company of the five-times European champions briefly being put into administration, which would result in the points deduction under Premier League rules.   But, as several have pointed out in emails, putting the club into administration and a resultant points deduction would damage the sale value of the club. RBS in a tricky position.  4.27pm: RBS QC: &quot;RBS is a lender that deserves to be repaid \u00a3200m on Friday. It is wrong of Hicks and Gillett to try and delay that process.&quot;  4.25pm: QC for RBS says bank has been willing to wave &quot;tens of millions of pounds in fees&quot; to see a sale go through. Also dismisses G&amp;H claim that there is no actual 15 October deadline with the Bank as part of their &quot;game&quot;.  4.04pm: JUDGE SAYS IT WOULD BE A &quot;LITTLE AMBITIOUS&quot; FOR THE CASE TO BE SETTLED BY FRIDAY. (In reply to Broughton&apos;s QC saying board would desperately like a verdict by then).  3.52pm: Broughton&apos;s QC says: 130 parties were approached by the board in regards to takeover. &quot;It was a thorough and well thought through process&quot;.  He adds that the Meriton offer only came in once they seen the bid by NESV. Meriton&apos;s original bid was &quot;significantly less&quot; than NESV. He also says that Mill Financial wanted exclusivity, which was prohibited under the rules of the RBS agreement.  3.48pm: Back to court: Lord Grabiner on the &quot;home team&quot; claim: He says it was the name of the conference line used by the board to listen to bids via telephone during meetings. Bidders had their own line and it was to make sure thaty they couldn&apos;t accidentally hear each other.  3.43pm: While we wait for another court update, I&apos;m being asked why Lord Grabiner is being allowed to speak for the board of the football club, given that this case is RBS v H&amp;G. The short answer is that I don&apos;t know for certain and I will ask my colleagues when they come out of court. The slightly longer answer is that I suspect that the judge has decided that he cannot possibly rule on this without the input of the subject at the heart of the case. Whether this is a good sign for RBS/H&amp;G/Liverpool is another of those million dollar questions... Also, I am receiving a lot of emails and tweets from America. Thanks for those. There is clearly much interest among Red Sox fans/H&amp;G doubters/Liverpudlians abroad/Scouse supporters etc etc. Thank you for all your messages. I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m having trouble responding to them all. Anyway, enough from me, you want to know what is going on in court....  3.28pm: Lord Grabiner says correspondence between board and owner prove that H&amp;G knew of the meeting on 5 October and instead they simply refused to turn up and not, as their QC says, that they were excluded from it by the &quot;sub-committee&quot;. Lord Grabiner describes the owners as &quot;slippery&quot; because they wanted a one week adjournment to that meeting knowing full well that NESV&apos;s deadline for their offer to expired on 5 October. Also, G&amp;H had a lawyer, Bruce Toth, listening to that meeting via telephone as an observer, destroying their argument that they were excluded from that crucial meeting.  3.08pm: In Hicks&apos;s letter/witness statement to the court he writes that during telephone meeting the board had at the start of last week (the one which broke down at adjournment), Hicks Jr was involved. Lord Grabiner questions why this happened as &quot;Hicks Minor&quot; is not on the board.  3.01pm: Lord Grabiner QC for the Liverpool board: If H&amp;G have accepted they must sell the club and simply want it done in the right way (as they QC said they have) then why are they not merely claiming for damages instead of trying to hold on to a &quot;unique asset&quot; (ie Liverpool FC).  2.57pm: Lord Grabiner QC is now speaking on behalf of the Liverpool board. He tells the court the two alternative offers for the club are &quot;besides the mark&quot; as it is the role of the board to find a buyer, so if they decide to go for NESV then so be it.  2.46pm: From court: G&amp;H QC, Paul Girolami, dismisses Friday&apos;s deadline and says that instead the owners and RBS are &quot;locked into an agreement&quot; until 1 November.  2.38pm: Much discussion about Mill Financial: my understanding is that, via its lawyers, Mill Financial approached Liverpool recently but were told &quot;the club had already been sold&quot;. It has been suggested (by Tom Stewart via email) that &quot;Mill Financial is owned by US Billionaire Dwight Schar, Chairman of NVR and Co-Owner of the NFL Washington Redskins&quot;. Checking that out...  2.32pm: From Sachin Nakranioutside court: Hicks claims that the sub-committee became so ingrained that the directors started to refer to it as the &quot;home team&quot; in emails between themselves. One of which was accidentally sent to the owners at start of last week. Hicks claims that he only breached sales agreement by trying to oust two board members because the sub committee was a breach of the sales agreement in itself.  2.23pm: Hicks has written a letter to the court: He says that he and Gillett feel they &quot;had become excluded from the sales process by the board&quot;.  2.18pm: From the court: H&amp;G argue: &quot;Resolution of the sub-committee is invalid because the English directors were in breach of the sales contract with RBS.&quot;  2.15pm: Back to the High Court: G&amp;H claim the board meeting last Tuesday broke down when they US owners refused to continue &quot;after a conversation with the chairman during the adjournment&quot;. They claim that the remaining three directors, Broughton, Purslow and Ayre formed a &apos;sub committee&apos; which then considered the bids and after discussions with RBS decided to go with NESV.  2.05pm: While we wait for this afternoon&apos;s updates from my colleagues down at court, who are the three bidders that H&amp;G say should be considered: NESVLawrence Donegan wrote this profile: &quot;John W Henry: Soya bean trader who transformed a team of has-beens.&quot; (The Boston Red Sox). MeritonThe group name for a bid from Singapore-based businessman Peter Lim. Lim owns a string of Manchester United-themed bars in Asia called Reds cafes. In 2007 Forbes said he was the 7th richest man in Singapore. Mill FinancialA US hedge fund which now owns 50% of George Gillett&apos;s stake after he defaulted on a \u00a375m loan which had been given to refinance the club in 2008.  1.59pm: They&apos;re about to return from lunch. There will be more evidence, I think, and then we will find out whether the judge intends to make a decision today or whether it will be further delayed.      Owen Gibson via Twitter:  \u2022\u00a0Key points as I see them: Hicks admits breaching contract but accuses Broughton and board of ignoring higher offers. \u2022 Hicks and Gillett breached contract with RBS. Their QC attempting to secure full hearing by throwing up other issues.  1.57pm: Paul Girolami QC, who is representing H&amp;G, said his clients &quot;were not trying to throw a spanner in the works&quot; of the proposed sale deal. He argued there had been other offers for the club which potentially were better than the one from NESV. Opposing an immediate injunction, he said all the issues involved needed more time to determine and &quot;should not be rushed into&quot;.  Girolami&apos;s conclusion: &quot;What has happened is that the English directors have gone forward with the NESV bid without properly considering alternatives when those alternatives at least appear to give better prospects.&quot;  1.55pm: Email from Gerald Krasner, Partner at insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor and former Chairman of Leeds United FC (before selling to Ken Bates in 2005), offering his thoughts on Liverpool:   This is uncharted territory as Liverpool is a big club constituted in such an opaque way that it&apos;s going to be very hard to unravel. At the moment the situation is precariously poised with everyone looking round the table waiting for someone to blink. However, the devil is in the detail on this one as far as ownership is concerned and, with armies of lawyers on both sides, I think there is still a little way to go before Liverpool fans can concentrate on their team&apos;s struggles on the pitch rather than off it.   1.45pm: I&apos;ve just had a quick chat with Owen Gibson, grabbing some lunch down at court, he says the essence of the court case this morning: RBS: it is an open and shut case, that Broughton is empowered to make the decision. H&amp;G were wrong to try to sack the board members. Hicks and Gillett: there are three rival offers on the table - NESV, Meriton (Lim) and Mill Financial - and the board should compare these rival offers. A decision should not be rushed because all these offers should be considered.  1.10pm: Over lunch we will try to analyse what has been argued this morning. And clear up who is actually bidding for Liverpool Football Club. Contrary to earlier impressions, it would seem that Meriton and Mill Financial are not the same bidder. It is believed that Peter Lim and Meriton are, in fact, the same bidder. I have amended earlier copy to reflect this. Mill Financial are understood to still be involved, but it is unclear in what capacity.  1.08pm: The hearing will resume at 2pm.  1.07pm: And the court has broken for lunch....  1.05pm: H&amp;G&apos;s representative in court: &quot;Meriton believe their bid is the &apos;preferred&apos; one of the board and is &apos;superior&apos; to that of NESV.&quot; Sachin Nakrani, adds: &quot;Meriton is a separate bid to Mill Financial, possibly, though unclear, the Singapore businessman, Petrer Lim.&quot;  12.59pm: H&amp;G&apos;s representative in court: &quot;Claims Meriton wrote letter to Hicks and Gillett on Friday evening asking &apos;what was going on&apos; regarding their takeover bid.&quot;  12.57pm: From court: &quot;Owners have no idea what happened after 4.30pm on 5 October, according to their rep, and were not kept informed by the board thereafter.&quot;  12.56pm: Back to court, H&amp;G&apos;s representatives: &quot;Claims there was no meeting of the Kop Holdings board to discuss NESV deal and this should have happened. &apos;This was a matter for the Kop Holdings board and the entire board.&apos; (ie it should have included Hicks and Gillett) Claims that this in itself is a breach of the sales agreement &quot;       12.53pm: A tweet: &quot;Mr Justice Floyd likes to think about his decisions over lunch, so don&apos;t expect #LFCTRIAL judgment before 2pm.&quot; We shall soon find out...  12.42pm: Meriton&apos;s offer is believed to include repaying all debts and putting \u00a3100m towards the new stadium. Meriton were meant to meet Broughton last Thursday to discuss a possible takeover but it was cancelled. Hicks and Gillett&apos;s representative wants to know why this meeting was cancelled. Meriton remains interested in buying Liverpool.  12.40pm: H&amp;G&apos;s represenatitives: &quot;This is not about the owners trying to force Liverpool into administration or another form of insolvency. Claims RBS themselves could force sale through. This dispute then is about maintaining terms of the sale agreement: mainly that all alternative offers are properly considered by the board before an offer is accepted.&quot;  12.36pm: Our reporter, Sachin Nakrani, who is stepping outside of court to file updates: H&amp;G&apos;s representatives say: &quot;English directors have rushed forward a sale when alternative offers are in existence. Mentions Meriton. Says they were preferred bidders on morning of 5 October. But by the end of the day the board had instead chosen NESV. &apos;The Meriton offer remains on the table.&apos;&quot; We will endeavour to find out more about Meriton. This may be another name for the Lim offer.  12.34pm: Back to court: &quot;Representative for Hicks and Gillett claims case against them paints &apos;misleading picture of the issues&apos;. This case is not about, he says, the owners trying to maintain their ownership of the club. They accept reality that their ownership will shortly come to an end. It&apos;s also not about owners trying to put spanner in the works regarding a sale. The owners accept that some sort of sale will have to occur. They are not intent on stopping sale to NESV. The owners&apos; issue is that the board did not properly enter into the NESV agreement in that the directors did not properly consider alternative offers and so it is they who are in breach of the terms of the sale agreement with RBS.&quot;  12.29pm: The Spirit of Shankly have a gallery which would like to make clear: &quot;Tom &amp; George - Not Welcome Anywhere.&quot;      Liverpool fans outside the high court. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters    12.16pm: Waiting for more updates from inside the court, meanwhile outside the court Liverpool&apos;s fans are having their say. We think the &quot;Not Welcome Here&quot; in the banner is referring to Anfield rather than the High Court in London. Email from JA Barnes asks: &quot;What must Sabermetrics fan John W. Henry be thinking about Liverpool fans being so clearly opposed to statistics?&quot; John W Henry&apos;s fortune was created on the back of much statistical analysis of the futures markets.  12.06pm: Despite his new offer, Lim&apos;s chances of buying Liverpool are slim. Lim is only likely to gain control of Liverpool if Hicks loses in court and RBS put the club into administration or NESV choose to pull out. NESV&apos;s agreement with the LFC board is legally binding, so a higher bid cannot be accepted. Lim might also try to offer Hicks the funds needed to pay off the debt and take control surreptitiously, although this would seem like a very risky strategy. Lim, by the way, is a Manchester United fan and owns a string of Manchester United themed bars, the Reds cafes, in Asia.  11.55am: Back to court: &quot;RBS reveals that it is clause C3 of the sale agreement with the bank that Hicks and Gillett signed in April 2010 that they have breached in regards to trying to change the board.&quot; RBS are represented by Richard Snowden QC.  11.48am: Meanwhile Peter Lim has lodged an increased offer for Liverpool FC. Sporting Intelligence website is carrying a statement from the Singapore businessman, saying that \u00a3360m has been offered - \u00a3320m in cash for the club and its liabilities plus \u00a340m to buy players. The statement says:  The proposal represents a total investment of \u00a3360m. The offer values the Club at \u00a3320m. A further \u00a340m will be made available to purchase new players.Like the previous offer tabled by Mr Lim, the new offer is entirely in cash and will remove the entire acquisition debt of \u00a3200m taken on by the existing owners that has cast uncertainty over the Club&apos;s future.The new offer also includes a cash investment of \u00a3120m. Of this:\u00a340m cash is to be allotted specifically to fund player purchases during the upcoming transfer window as the immediate priority is to ensure that the squad is strengthened for the remainder of the season.The balance of \u00a380m will pay off all the Club&apos;s bank debt, the fees and interest accruing on the bank debt, and provide additional working capital for the Club.  The offer trumps the \u00a3300m offered by New England Sports Ventures - which was accepted last week by Liverpool&apos;s chairman, Martin Broughton.  11.38am: Hicks and Gillett representative admits to breach of contract but feels there is no urge for board to be reconstituted before Friday. RBS dismisses this as &apos;absurd&apos; given the company needs to repay \u00a3200m to the bank by Friday.  11.33am: RBS appeal to judge to &apos;restore a clearly constituted and functioning board&apos; today. &apos;It cannot wait and it would be wrong for Mr Hicks and Gillett to profit from their tactics.&apos; No word of Gillett or Hicks putting in an appearance at court.  11.25am: BREAKING, from our reporter Sachin Nakrani: &quot;Case started. RBS accuse Hicks and Gillett of trying to &apos;profit from the confusion their actions have caused&apos;.&quot;  11.07am: So, when they get to court, and presuming that the case goes ahead, what will be decided and what will then happen? This is Paul Kelso&apos;s take on the situation:  Today&apos;s RBS action is the first step in a two-stage process that Broughton hopes will allow him to complete the sale to NESV. At the heart of the issue is whether he and his fellow non-owner directors have the right to agree to sell the club despite the objections of their majority shareholders. Hicks and Gillett attempted to block the sale last week by sacking Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre. Broughton rejected the Americans&apos; intervention and continued to make an agreement with NESV, arguing that the co-owners were in breach of legally binding undertakings they gave to RBS as a condition of the extension of their financing agreement with the bank in April. At that time, according to Broughton and RBS, the Americans agreed that the chairman had the power to appoint the board and that they would not stand in the way of any reasonable sale. The strength of those undertakings will be tested today by RBS, which, as the recipient of the undertakings, has to bring the case. RBS was granted an interim injunction last Friday preventing Hicks and Gillett from changing the structure of the club board, and will seek to make that permanent by arguing that the Americans were in breach of contract when they sacked Ayre and Purslow.In a separate, as-yet-unscheduled hearing Broughton, the Liverpool chairman, is expected to seek a &quot;declaratory judgment&quot; approving the sale, though this may not be necessary if RBS wins its action. Legal experts said that the case would rest on the relative strength of the contractual assurances given to RBS, set against Hicks and Gillett&apos;s rights as shareholders, secured under section 168 of the Companies Act, to constitute the board. &quot;If the High Court upholds the validity of the RBS undertakings then it is likely to grant an injunction preventing Hicks and Gillett from using their powers to remove directors from the boards of the relevant companies. Ayre and Purslow would then be reappointed to the boards and would be free to approve the sale,&quot; said Ian Lynam, a partner specialising in the sports industry at Charles Russell LLP.   10.59am: What do we know about the man who will be making the key decisions, Mr Justice Floyd? Mr Justice Floyd, or Christopher David Floyd as he was at birth in 1951, was educated at Westminster and Trinity College Cambridge, has three children and lists his interests in Debrett&apos;s People of Today as &quot;cycling, walking, tennis, watching cricket, Austin Sevens&quot;. The last of those being a type of car. No mention of football. Nor which cricket team he supports. Owen Gibson says Mr Justice Floyd:   ...has presided over a number of high-profile court cases in his time. But it is unlikely that a patent dispute over the copyright to Henry Hoover, a royalties decision in favour of the session violinist who played on the Bluebells hit Young at Heart or a spat over the name of a Stella McCartney perfume will generate nearly as much heat as that seventh on the cause list for court 16.   10.47am: Reacting to the scheduling revelation that &quot;Royal Bank of Scotland PLC v Hicks &amp; ors&quot;, Richard Smith emails: &quot;So we&apos;re third on court today are we? This is like waiting for Andy Murray to come out at Wimbledon, there&apos;s a familiar feeling of excitement and expectation mixed with the dread of the inevitable disappointment that will surely follow.&quot;  10.45am: The other cases listed for court 16 today: APPLICATIONSException VAR Ltd v GoffDrummond v DrummondSuperyachts.com Ltd v BodingtonWilkinson v NorthLloyds TSB v Williams Gee Yeung LawSlutsker v Haron InvestmentsRoyal Bank of Scotland PLC v Hicks &amp; ors      The chief executive of Liverpool FC, Christian Purslow, arrives at the high court. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters    10.31am: The word is that the Liverpool case will be the third to be heard in court 16 this morning. So, of course, when it actually happens is dependent upon how long the preceding cases take. Will find out what those cases are.  Some of the major players in the case (as opposed to players from the pitch) are down at the court hearings: Christian Purslow and Martin Broughton are down there, reports my colleague Sachin Nakrani.       10.10am: Boston Red Sox owner John W Henry, who isn&apos;t directly involved in this court case, but whose move for the club is dependent upon the result, has also been on Twitter: &quot;Hello LFC supporters!&quot;&quot;It would be inappropriate and presumptuous at this time to respond to questions. In the interim, we&apos;re all rooting for the same thing.&quot; Although, as Owen Gibson replies: @John_W_Henry takes to Twitter - &quot;we&apos;re all rooting for the same thing&quot;, he says. Unless your name is T Hicks that is. #LFC       10.06am: Our sports news correspondent Owen Gibson is down at the high court and sends over these colourful tweets: &quot;RBS v Hicks won&apos;t be the only grudge match here today. Jordan and Peter are two doors down. #LFC&quot; &quot;The coach of fans apparently on way from L&apos;pool could be disappointed. 27 press and 3 fans allowed in and the public gallery is full. #LFC&quot;      Liverpool gallery Photograph: Composite image    10.01am: Meanwhile, here&apos;s a great gallery of how Guardian readers view Liverpool&apos;s woes. Hard as it is to pick out one, my favourite is the Liver Bird alongside Marilyn, Elvis and Jimmy Dean. Or maybe its &quot;Hicks and Gillett make one last ditch attempt to repay their loans&quot;.  10.00am: There&apos;s talk of Liverpool fans donning cowboy gear and getting on down to the High Court today to voice their feelings. So we&apos;ll keep a look out for funny outfits.            9.59am: As so many of you enjoyed it during last week&apos;s live blog, here is an open video from Liverpool&apos;s celebrity supporters to Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Many of you were particularly impressed by Echo and the Bunnymen&apos;s Mac McCulloch&apos;s sense of perspective (2 mins 10 secs).  9.30am: The fate of Liverpool Football Club is set to be decided in room 16 of the high court today, when the Royal Bank of Scotland seeks to force through the sale of the club to John W Henry and his co-owners of the Boston Red Sox. The club&apos;s future is set to turn on Mr Justice Floyd&apos;s interpretation of agreements that RBS insists were signed by the owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Floyd, a contract and intellectual property law specialist, will be called on to decide whether Hicks and Gillett broke a contractual agreement with RBS when they attempted to sack the club&apos;s commercial director, Ian Ayre, and chief executive, Christian Purslow. Martin Broughton, the independent director brought in by RBS as part of its refinancing agreement with Hicks and Gillett, believes that RBS had a binding agreement that gave him sole reponsibility over the board and prevented them interfering in the sale process. The situation was further complicated yesterday the BBC&apos;s Robert Peston revealed a rival bid to that of New England Sports Ventures, whose offer was accepted last week. Singapore billionaire Peter Lim matched New England Sports Venture&apos;s \u00a3300m offer and also agreed to clear the \u00a3200m acquisition debt sitting on the club&apos;s balance sheet. The case may come as early as 10.30am in the High Court, but may come much later in the day, depending upon other business.

Sean Wroe leads the Australians home, with England&apos;s Robert Tobin holding on for the bronze and Kenya, despite a couple of horrendous changeovers, taking silver.  3.33pm: Australia lead by a couple of yards from England as the anchors take the baton. Kenya in touching distance in third, with Botswana and Bahamas not far away.  3.32pm: Bahamas take it up at the second change, England third, Wales fifth.  3.31pm: Wales lead after the first 400m! Excellent leg from Williams (Rhys).  3.30pm: So the last event of the athletics programme gets underway. Williams (Conrad) takes the first leg for England, Williams (Rhys) the first leg for Wales.  3.27pm: The men&apos;s 4x400m is imminent. It&apos;s a wide open race, with Kenya slight favourites. England (Williams, Leavey, Yates and Tobin) and Wales (Williams, Thomas, Gowell and Warburton) will both fancy their chances of a medal. Australia and the Bahamas could also be in the mix.  3.25pm: &quot;Any news on the triple jump final?&quot; asks Katie Allen. Indeed there is, it got somewhat lost in the hockey-based excitement. It was won by Nigeria&apos;s Tosin Oke, who leapt 17.16m in his only legal jump. The wonderfully named Lucien Hugo Mamba Schlick was 2cm behind with his final jump of the competition, while India&apos;s Renjith Maheswary took bronze with a jump of 17.07m. England&apos;s Nathan Douglas was fourth after a jumpof 16.96m. Larry Achike was seventh with 16.59m.  3.20pm: Here&apos;s the Press Association&apos;s take on that dramatic hockey semi-final:  England&apos;s men&apos;s Commonwealth Games gold medal dreams were dashed on a night of drama at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium as the hosts blazed back from two goals down to win on penalties. Bharat Chetri dived full-length to his left to save Glenn Kirkham&apos;s penalty shot and India&apos;s win, 5-4 from the spot after a thrilling 3-3 draw, sent them to the final and England into a bronze medal play-off. India swept home all five of their shots from the spot which meant there was no way back for shattered England after Kirkham&apos;s effort was saved. As India celebrated wildly, some England players slumped to the turf in tears.    3.13pm: Controversy as a tight line-call helps Ouseph to 20-18 and match point \u2026 and he takes it! The crowd not happy, and nor is Parupalli, but he&apos;ll have to settle for a shot at the bronze.  3.10pm: And the action just keeps on coming \u2013\u00a0it&apos;s semi-final time in the men&apos;s badminton, where England&apos;s Rajiv Ouseph is facing Kashyap Parupalli of India for a place in the gold medal match against Malaysia&apos;s Chong Wei Lee. It&apos;s currently one set all and 16-15 to Parupalli.  3.05pm: So Manjeet Kaur, Sini Jose, Ashwini Chidananda Akkunji and Mandeep Kaur produce an astonishing run for the hosts. How will their lives change after this? A superb anchor leg from Nadine Okyere held off Sally Pearson of Australia to give England the third place on the podium, with Nigeria well clear in second.  3.02pm: India take gold! Nigeria silver! England bronze! The stadium goes bezerk, almost as loud as those in the hockey stadium.  3.01pm: India lead as the anchor runners take the baton.  3.00pm: Away from that excitement, the women&apos;s 4x400m is underway. Nigeria lead, England and India closing in.  2.55pm: England to take first: ENGLAND SCORE! England 1-0 IndiaINDIA SCORE! England 1-1 IndiaENGLAND SCORE! England 2-1 IndiaINDIA SCORE! England 2-2 IndiaENGLAND MISS! England 2-2 India (Kirkham&apos;s effort saved!)INDIA SCORE! England 2-3 IndiaENGLAND SCORE! England 3-3 IndiaINDIA SCORE! England 3-4 IndiaENGLAND SCORE! England 4-4 IndiaINDIA SCORE! England 4-5 India It&apos;s all over! India reach the final! England will play for bronze.  2.50pm: In a way this bodes well for England \u2013 James Fair has been nothing short of sensational in the latter stages. And we&apos;ve got an England shoot-out, being described by the brilliant Barry Davies. When was the last time that happened?  2.48pm: HOOONNNKKKK! The hooter sounds \u2013 this is going to penalty strokes.  2.46pm: Inside the final minute now, England attempting to run down the clock.  2.44pm: Having typed that, England come as close as they have throughout extra-time, Jackson diverting an effort just wide.  2.43pm: Superb save from Fair to deny the hosts! If anyone is going to win this in normal time, it&apos;s not going to be England.  2.42pm: So the second half gets underway in the hockey with Gurbaj Singh taking a break after suffering an injury. Six minutes to go before the dreaded penalty shoot out.  2.40pm: It&apos;s a Kenyan one-two-three, with Twell fourth. Cheruiyot takes the gold after holding off Kibet.  2.40pm: Ding, ding, ding! The bell sounds and Cheruiyot, Chenonge and Kibet have pulled away, with Twell desperately trying to hold on.  2.38pm: \u2026 smacked wide by Sandeep Singh! Two laps to go in the 5,000m and the lead group is down to the three Kenyans, Twell and Australia&apos;s Wellings.  2.37pm: India have a penalty corner! Dangerous play, I think \u2026  2.35pm: England&apos;s Kate Dennison&apos;s participating in the pole vault is over after three failures, while on the track the peloton is down to seven runners.  2.34pm: Three minutes to go until half-time in extra-time and it&apos;s the sort of cagey affair that prompted football to ditch the Golden Goal rule.  2.33pm: The three Kenyans all over the front in the 5,000m, dictating the pace, though Scotland&apos;s Steph Twell is in contention.  2.32pm: So two seven and a half minutes halves are scheduled for extra time in the hockey, but it could obviously end any second. India appeal for a penalty corner \u2013\u00a0denied by the officials.  2.28pm: Over at the athletics stadium, the women&apos;s 5,000m final is underway. Paula Radcliffe holds the Games record for the event at 14min 31.42sec \u2013\u00a0Kenya&apos;s Vivian Cheruiyot, the fastest in the field by some distance on paper, could break it if she runs close to her best.  2.27pm: While we&apos;re waiting for extra-time, you might enjoy a butchers at this here gallery of today&apos;s action.  2.25pm: Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! Full-time and it&apos;s 3-3. We now head to Golden Goal extra-time.  2.23pm: Inside the final minute now and England almost shoot themselves in the foot after failing to put the ball into whatever the hockey equivalent of Row Z is. As the stadiums are a little smaller in general, it&apos;ll be something like Row S, I suppose.  2.22pm: &quot;Your photo suggests Tom Daley sees his medal as a solo effort as his poor partner can hardly get a corner of the flag to drap around himself,&quot; emails Ian Copestake. &quot;I don&apos;t know, teenage diving sensations these days.&quot;  2.21pm: India denied by two excellent saves from James Fair, and some last-ditch defending. Three minutes to go.  2.20pm: There&apos;s a fantastic atmosphere at the Dhyan Chand National Stadium as India press forward. Barry Davies at his breathless best in the commentary box. Football&apos;s loss is hockey&apos;s gain.  2.17pm: Less than eight minutes to go, and it&apos;s all India, England on the ropes \u2026  2.15pm: In the hockey semi-final it&apos;s all kicking off. India have clawed their way back to 3-3 after an almighty scramble in the England area.  2.13pm: Afternoon all, John Ashdown here, taking the leather reins from Tom Lutz. They seem to be a little clammy for some reason.  2.08pm: India then win a penalty corner as Englan panic in defence. This could be crucial with time running out. The ball comes to Sandeep Singh but he blazes over.  2.06pm: 17 minutes to go in the hockey and England nearly go 4-1 up as India dawdle in their own half and lose the ball. But the shot is saved.  2.01pm: It&apos;s gold and silver for Kenya in the 1500m. Kiplagat, the world No1, sprinted home after finding himself in a tricky-ish position with 200m to go.  1.58pm: GOAL!! England 3-1 India (Mantell). England have a penalty corner in the hockey. They work it across the area and Mantell smacks the ball home.  1.56pm: The men&apos;s 1500m has started. The Kenyans are working together running in a bunch. As if they need the help.  1.54pm: And England are 2-1 up in the hockey. I missed it because of the 4x100m. Basically every time England win a relay gold, England&apos;s hockey team score. If they had any sense they&apos;d push for the 4x400m to be run in five minutes.  1.46pm: Oooh, England nearly drop the baton on the first change and are far behind on the final leg but Mark Lewis-Francis \u2013 who has a bit of previous in the relay \u2013 runs a superb 100m to hunt down Jamaica to claim gold. Jamaica are second and India third. England&apos;s women sprinters are still hanging round the track and are there at the finish to greet them.  1.44pm: It&apos;s the men&apos;s 4x100m now, England line up as one of the favourites. India are in this one too. They broke the medal the other day and if they go at it again they have a chance of a medal.  1.38pm: Ghana get the nod by 0.01sec over India. So it finishes: 1. England 44.19sec2. Ghana 45.24sec3. India 45.25sec England looked in control throughout and all they needed to do was not drop the baton which they did with some ease. India looked safe for silver until Ghana&apos;s anchorwoman chased them down.  In that excitement, I missed a goal in the hockey. It&apos;s now England 1-1 India at half-time. Ashley Jackson got the goal from a penalty corner.  1.35pm: Nigeria fall early but England have a clear by the final change and they surge home, great baton changes for once. India have got a medal too. It will be a photo finish. Jamaica were disqualifed.  1.34pm: The women&apos;s 4x100m is about to start in the athletics. England face stiff competition from the reigning champions, Jamaica. India are also in it, so expect a decent noise. Not that you can hear it on a computer. Just pretend.  1.30pm: Four minutes to the break in the hockey and India have stifled England&apos;s attempted comeback. Both sides look like they&apos;re content to meander towards a few drinks.  1.27pm: The stadium is starting to fill up as people trickle in after work and the atmosphere is building. India have decent pressure but don&apos;t create anything.  1.23pm: Wilson fires a pass in and Simon Mantell deflects the ball wide. They&apos;ve looked dangerous since falling behind.  1.20pm: England nearly hit back. Simon Mantell hits a cross shot and the ball flies across goal. A despairing England stick just misses prodding the ball home.  1.19pm: GOAL! England 0-1 India. England manage to save the first shot from the penalty corner but Sarvan is there to follow up and poke the ball home.  1.18pm: Penalty corner to India. The crowd go wild. I think it might get very noisy indeed if India score.  1.12pm: Over in the high court, Hicks and Gillett have come out punching. They&apos;re edging it over the Republic of Liverpool at the moment by all accounts. John W Henry may well miss out on a medal.  1.08pm: Tom Daley gets a documentary devoted to him tonight. Where&apos;s Brick&apos;s documentary? We want Brick! It&apos;s still England 0-0 India in the hockey.  1.06pm: Gold medalists Tom Daley and Max Brick are being interviewed on the BBC. Daley looks like a boy band member, Brick has the 1,000 yard stare of a drummer in a garage band.  1.02pm: The athletics this afternoon includes the relays and the 1,500m finals.  12.59pm: Even with a smattering of empty seats the atmosphere in the hockey stadium is electric. Well maybe not electric but at least a nasty bit of static of a wooly jumper.  12.59pm: Woo hoo! Johnson, Jackson and Lewis are now on the BBC sofa. The heavyweights have arrived. Goodbye under-12s underwater wrestling. Hello athletics.  12.56pm: The teams are out for England v India in the hockey, the world&apos;s No1 sport for rugby lads who weren&apos;t quite good enough to get into the first or second XV.  12.52pm: Drinkhall has lost his quarter-final 4-2. Bad news for people scratching round for stories. The men&apos;s hockey between England and India starts in three minutes or so.  12.48pm: You&apos;ll want some red-hot table tennis quarter-final action, won&apos;t you? Paul Drinkhall is 3-2 and 7-3 down in the sixth game.  12.41pm: The game is New Zealand&apos;s. There&apos;s a huge sweeping run and Baker is up in support and strolls in to score. It ends New Zealand 24-17 Australia. Gold for New Zealand, silver for Australia.  12.39pm: What a chance for Australia. Phipps finds space and lays it off for Gill who knocks on who would have had an easy run in.  12.38pm: New Zealand are up for the first time in a while. Souness batters thorugh the Aussie defence and lays it off for Forbes who rumbles over the line. New Zealand 19-17 Australia. Two minutes to go.  12.36pm: Paul Drinkhall has made it 2-2 in the table tennis. He was 2-0 down.  12.35pm: Or maybe not. It&apos;s now Australia 17-14 New Zealand.  12.34pm: It looks like Australia will get the gold in the sevens: they&apos;re now 17-7 up. Oddly they have looked better since New Zealand got back to seven men. Still seven minutes to go though.  12.31pm: In the 1m springboard, Canada&apos;s Jennifer Abel wins gold.  12.28pm: Paul Drinkhall has pulled a game back in the table tennis and trails 2-1.  12.28pm: Messam has come back on after his yellow card. Oddly it doesn&apos;t help and Australia actually score again as they chase down a long kick to score. Australia 10-7 New Zealand at half-time.  12.25pm:... And they take it. They use the extra space and Turner has enough time to flop over. The conversion is missed though and it&apos;s New Zealand 7-5 Australia.  12.24pm: New Zealand are down to six men after a nasty high tackle. This is Australia&apos;s chance...  12.23pm: New Zealand look in complete control here, the opening 30 seconds are so aside. Baker breaks well for New Zealand and only a wonderful tackle stops another All Black try.  12.19pm: New Zeland sweep down the field. A nice pass from Forbes leaves a simple jog in for the opening try, New Zealand 7-0 Australia.  12.15pm: Paul Drinkhall is now 2-0 down in his table tennis quarter-final. New Zealand are tackled behind their own line and Australia get a scrum a few yards out...  12.15pm: Paul Drinkhall has lost the first game of his quarter-final. In sevens, it&apos;s the gold medal match between New Zealand v Australia. No novelty kitchen items up for grabs here: just gold and silver medals.  12.13pm: Andy Bull has approximately 70,000 words to write today. He&apos;s been for a spot of breakfast with Seb Coe and his lordship reckons India aren&apos;t ready to host the Olympics just yet. Here&apos;s an extract from the story:  Lord Coe has said that India should wait a while before it thinks about bidding to host a future Olympic Games. Asked if India was ready to host the Olympics, Coe joked: &quot;Is anybody?&quot; before adding: &quot;I am sure they will want to look at that, but I&apos;m not sure that it should be quite yet.&quot; There had been strong suggestions that Delhi would bid for the 2020 Olympics, though that has yet to be officially confirmed.  The full story can be read here.  12.08pm: And it is. South Africa win 17-14. England couldn&apos;t retain possession even though they looked the better team. South Africa win bronze, England get the food processor. I thinm Gollings gets to keep it.  12.07pm: Gollings jinks free but his pass is dropped. That could be it.  12.07pm: England have one more chance to score...  12.05pm: South Africa press once again and force their way over the line \u2013 just. It&apos;s England 14-17 South Africa with 50 seconds to play.  12.03pm: A very important phase of play: South Africa have a scrum near the England line, England regain possession but South Africa win it back and score a breakaway try. Oddly they don&apos;t put the ball under the posts even though there&apos;s plenty of time to do so. They convert anyway and it&apos;s England 14-12 South Africa.  12.01pm: More excellent work from Turner. South Africa&apos;s Dozzell chips through but Turner beats him for pace and manages to clear the danger.  11.59am: The teams have just two minutes to regain their breath \u2013 is there a sport at the Commonwealth Games that looks more knackering than sevens? It&apos;s basically sprinting and fighting non-stop for 14 minutes.  11.56am: Danny Caprice sidesteps the entire South Africa team and then a few of his own team \u2013 he&apos;s that tricky \u2013 to put England 14-5 up at half-time.  11.54am: Turner is looking nicely fired up for England in the sevens. England are nearly over the line again but it&apos;s knocked on a yard or so from the line and South Africa are still in it.  11.53am: Matt Turner barrels through a couple of (bad) South Africa tackles to make it England 7-5 South Africa after the conversion.  11.50am: Meanwhile, there&apos;s an actual medal up for grabs in the sevens. South Africa have just scored and are 5-0 up against England. The winners get a bronze, the losers get a food processor.  11.49am: And Jamaica complete an amazing comeback in the netball to win 534-57 in the final two minutes! Or maybe New Zealand win 59-43. You decide.  11.46am: Looks like it will be Australia v New Zealand in the netball final: the Kiwis are 57-42 up witha 2min 21sec to play ... make that 2min 18sec.  11.39am: It ends Samoa 34-0 Scotland. Samoa get a nice plate. Scotland get nothing not even a bowl.  11.35am: It&apos;s New Zealand 49-37 Jamaica as the seconds tick down in the netball semi-final. The problem with netball is you just want someone to launch a three-pointer now and again. Or do a 720 spin slamdunk. It never happens though. It will never happen.  11.29am: Samoa 17-0 Scotland at half-time. Bad Scotland. It&apos;s New Zealand 46-36 Jamaica going into the final quarter in the netball.  11.26am: It&apos;s Samoa 15-0 Scotland. The Scots will need to find something other than a fancy silver plate to dine off tonight. Mybe just a nice normal plate.  11.24am: Samoa are 5-0 up against Scotland. Watch Scotland go into damage limitation mode now. Just watch them. Jamaica have pulled it back to 39-34 in the netball, their coach looks slightly cheerier.  11.22am: &quot;There&apos;s no rowing in the Commonwealth Games because a Commonwealth Games usually clashes with World champs or a World cup regatta,&quot; says Markus Buhmann. No now we know.  11.20am: Samoa are about to take on Scotland in the sevens plate final. No doubt Scotland will come out in a 5-2-0 formation for this tricky game. The plate final is basically a fifth and sixth place play-off. New Zealand are 39-29 up in the netball with 8 minutes of the semi-final left. The Jamaica coach does not look happy, she the Alex Ferguson of the netball world.  11.14am: Papua New Guinea have won the bowl at the Sevens, beating Canada. I&apos;m not sure if &quot;bowl&quot; appears on the medals table. &quot;Bowls&quot; definitely does though.  11.12am: Does anyone know why there&apos;s no rowing in the Commonwealth Games? It&apos;s mainly performed by posh people with strong jaws and good teeth and the Commonwealth was their idea in the first place \u2013 surely it should be a shoo-in.  11.05am: Morning. I was called in at the last moment to do this gig so apologies for any errors. I genuinely thought this Commonwealth Games thing had ended last week when Linford Christie beat Tony Jarrett in the final of the 400m hurdles. At half-time in the netball it&apos;s New Zealand 32-25 Jamaica.  10.59am: Right, that&apos;s all from my tantalisingly short spell. Tom Lutz will be taking the reins for the first part of the afternoon at least.  10.56am: Strange what events like the Commonwealth Games do to the sport lover \u2013\u00a0just found myself muttering &apos;You can&apos;t afford to miss those&apos; as Jamaica botch a shot in the netball semi-finals. The netball has, a couple of very one-sided affairs apart, been something of a revelation for me \u2013\u00a0far more fast-paced, physical and athletic than I remember. Still not convinced about anything that involves shooting at a target or the word &apos;synchronised&apos;, though \u2026  10.50am: England&apos;s netballers&apos; hopes of gold have ended at the hands of Australia after a nailbiting 51-45 semi-final. In the other semi-final, currently being played, it&apos;s New Zealand v Jamaica, which stands at 24-20 in the middle of the second period.  10.42am: Australia will face New Zealand for the rugby sevens gold this evening \u2013\u00a0a fairly comfortable victory for the Wallabies against South Africa in the end.  10.38am: One bit of news from the shooting I neglected to mention earlier: India have guaranteed their best ever Commonwealth Games gold medal haul after Annu Raj Singh and Heena Sidhu won the women&apos;s 10m air pistol pair. That&apos;s India&apos;s 31st gold of the Games, eclipsing their tally of 30 from Manchester in 2002.  10.34am: Half-time in the second sevens semi-final. The Springboks scored first, but Australia have bounced back, Liam Gill flopping over for a try on the whistle (and appearing to hurt himself in the process), to lead 10-7 at the break.  10.30am: Earlier on there was British success at the shooting range, where Scotland&apos;s Jen McIntosh took gold in the women&apos;s singles 50m rifle prone competition with a Games record score of 597-42x (I&apos;m not even going to pretend to know what those numbers mean). Johanne Brekke took the bronze medal for Wales with 593-33x. England&apos;s Mike Babb and Richard Wilson took the silver in the men&apos;s 50m prone pairs and Mick Gault and Iqbal Ubhi claimed a bronze in the men&apos;s 25m standard fire pistol pairs.  10.23am: All over in the sevens semi-final and a breathless second half sees New Zealand beat England 33-12.  10.21am: England are also suffering at the hands of their antipodean friends at the bowls rink, where Natalie Melmore trails Kelsey Cottrell in the women&apos;s singles.  10.17am: The points are really flowing now down at Delhi University. England have scored what always seemed likely to be a consolation try, a feeling confirmed by Raikabula&apos;s immediate reply at the other end. Now 26-7 with just over two minutes left.  10.16am: And it looks like England are heading into that bronze medal match. The All Blacks have raced into a 19-0 lead with five minutes to go.  10.14am: Australia are taking on South Africa in the other semi-final (kicking off at the conclusion of England v NZ). The final takes place at around 12.30pm this afternoon, with the bronze medal match around midday.  10.11am: England are currently taking on New Zealand in the rugby sevens semi-finals (it&apos;s a thrilling 0-0 after the first peroid). In the stadium later on, there&apos;s the relay events, Andrew Baddeley hoping for a medal in the 1500m, Nathan Douglas doing likewise in the triple jump, and a potential one-two-three for Kenya in the women&apos;s 5,000m.  10.05am: There&apos;s been more trouble on the track for Nigeria, where Samuel Okon, the Nigerian hurdler who finished sixth in the 110 metres hurdles final, has failed a drugs test. Okon is the second Nigerian athlete to test positive for the stimulant in Delhi, with the women&apos;s 100m winner, Osayemi Oludamola, revealed to have failed a test yesterday.  10am: Good morning and welcome to day nine of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. This morning&apos;s big news for England fans comes from the diving pool, where Tom Daley and Max Brick took gold in the 10m synchro event. Here&apos;s our man in the Dr SP Mukherjee Aquatics Complex, Andy Bull:  They led the competition from the second round right through to the finish, and eventually beat the Australian pair of Olympic singles champion Matt Mitcham and Ethan Warren by more than 15 points. With only four pairs competing, the field was so small that it took Daley and Brick only 20 minutes to win their medals. But such is the excitement about Daley&apos;s presence here that it took the pair another hour just to get through all their media engagements after the event.

Under usual FIA guidelines tracks must be approved 90 days before the race takes place. But the sport&apos;s governing body agreed to relent in this case, even though excuses from local organisers \u2013 such as the bad weather \u2013 were less than convincing. The Yeongam circuit will now host one of the most crucial races this season. With three rounds left there are five possible winners of this year&apos;s world championship, though McLaren&apos;s British pairing of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button are now outsiders behind the Red Bulls of Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso&apos;s Ferrari. The circuit still looks like a building site, with cranes pecking away everywhere. But after some intense scrutiny it has been passed fit for action. The chances of the race being abandoned were being seriously discussed as recently as the Singapore grand prix at the end of last month, when the Formula One commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, expressed doubts. &quot;It&apos;s not good. It should have been inspected six weeks ago,&quot; he said. It is unusual for Ecclestone to convey such a strong message but it has clearly been heeded. Charlie Whiting, the FIA&apos;s technical delegate, has completed a two-day inspection, with the final layer of asphalt his primary concern. And afterwards he described facilities as &quot;satisfactory&quot;. The track has been designed by Hermann Tilke, the man behind the new circuits in Malaysia, China, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. Yung Cho-chung, the promoter of the race in Korea, said today: &quot;We are delighted that all works are now finished to the complete satisfaction of the FIA, and we join the whole of Korea in welcoming the Formula One fraternity to the Korea International Circuit for the first time. &quot;The KIC has been constructed to the highest standards, and will become the epicentre of motor sport in the country. We believe the Korean grand prix will be the catalyst to ignite enormous interest in the sport across the nation.&quot; However, the worries will not go away until the track has been properly tested on Thursday and Friday next week. This could be a recurring problem in the years ahead. Next year, for the first time, there will be a race in Delhi, venue of the current and ill-starred Commonwealth Games. And the possibility of staging races in other countries, including the USA, South Africa and Russia, have also been discussed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2010/oct/12/tom-hicks-george-gillett-liverpool-rbs", "sentences": ["The bids from Peter Lim, the Singapore businessman who owns a chain of Manchester United cafes in south-east Asia, and Mill Financial, the hedge fund which has apparently repossessed Gillett&apos;s shares because he defaulted on a loan, might offer more money to the club, Hicks and Gillett say, not to them."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-12T20:00:30Z", "title": "Tom Hicks and George Gillett play injured parties in Liverpool saga", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Football", "Sport", "Tom Hicks"], "article": "At the end of the day, as they say in football, or of QCs in the wood-panelled courts of The Strand picking over a football club&apos;s guts: what have we learned? Well, that poor Tom Hicks and George Gillett have been much misunderstood. They are not, their barrister, Paul Girolami QC, insisted, &quot;trying to throw a spanner in the works&quot; of Liverpool&apos;s sale to New England Sports Ventures. That is the deal agreed by the board, chaired by Martin Broughton, last Tuesday, which might finally pay off the \u00a3200m Hicks and Gillett borrowed from Royal Bank of Scotland to buy the club in the first place, then loaded on the club to repay.Hicks and Gillett may be holding it up with all the legal armoury corporate sluggers can pay for but, they say, it is all for the good of the club. The bids from Peter Lim, the Singapore businessman who owns a chain of Manchester United cafes in south-east Asia, and Mill Financial, the hedge fund which has apparently repossessed Gillett&apos;s shares because he defaulted on a loan, might offer more money to the club, Hicks and Gillett say, not to them. They do not want to stay in control or resist a sale of the club, Girolami said, but they believe the &quot;English directors&quot; \u2013 Broughton, the managing director, Christian Purslow, and the commercial director, Ian Ayre \u2013 ganged up on them. Hicks and Gillett&apos;s barrister said the &quot;English directors&quot; formed &quot;a sub\u2011committee&quot;, calling it the &quot;home team&quot;, and excluded the Americans from the decision\u2011making. Hicks and Gillett are arguing that the &quot;English directors&quot; then decided on NESV, the owners of the Boston Red Sox, turning down the chance to wring a higher offer from Lim. &quot;The English directors have gone forward with the NESV bid without properly considering alternatives when those alternatives at least appear to give better prospects,&quot; Girolami said. He never quite explained why the English directors, one of whom, Purslow, is a confirmed Liverpool fan, would do that. But it was a selfless argument; the better prospects appear to be only for the club. Lim&apos;s statement, released with cute timing yesterday, held out a populist \u00a340m to invest in players and \u00a3280m to pay off all the club&apos;s debts but nothing for Hicks and Gillett. Likewise Mill was apparently prepared to throw a morsel to what it perhaps imagines to be a still impressionable Liverpool crowd \u2013 \u00a3100m to &quot;start&quot; a new stadium \u2013 but no pay-off was mentioned, still, for Hicks and Gillett. However, Mill arrived too late, the board had done its deal with NESV, which it will complete, if the owners drop their opposition or are defeated in court. Hicks and Gillett did admit they were in breach of their contract with Royal Bank of Scotland, agreed in April when they refinanced their original loan, that Broughton would have the sole right to appoint and remove directors. So when, just before last Tuesday&apos;s board meeting, they purported to sack Purslow and Ayre by fax and replace them with Hicks&apos;s son Mack and Mack&apos;s assistant, they admit they breached their agreement. They argued it was only because the English directors had been excluding them from discussions and not considering the other potential offers, which would have been better for the club. If that was Hicks&apos;s and Gillett&apos;s motivation and concern, not thrashing around to salvage some money for themselves, as we have been assuming, their actions last Tuesday seem a little odd. Why not tell RBS that NESV&apos;s offer was too low? Why not go ahead with the board meeting, have a civilised discussion, and tell Broughton firmly he should be shaking a little more out of Lim or getting something to &quot;start&quot; the new stadium? Then take legal action, if the directors did not comply. Why, instead, attempt to ambush the meeting, by sacking two directors without prior notice and in acknowledged breach of their contract with RBS, and manufacture a majority on the board with a move so crude and amateurish-looking as installing Hicks&apos;s son? That question was not asked or answered yesterday but Liverpool&apos;s QC&apos;s account was true to what Broughton emphasised during his landmark public onslaught against Hicks and Gillett last week. The club was properly marketed, he said. Liverpool FC was on very public sale for months, as was reported globally. Lord Grabiner QC said the board had spoken to 130 parties by last Tuesday, the deadline it set because it was only 10 days before RBS could call its loans in and put Hicks&apos;s and Gillett&apos;s holding company into administration with the loss of nine points. Lim&apos;s and NESV&apos;s were the only two on the table and although Lim is &quot;credible&quot;, the board decided NESV&apos;s bid was marginally better, because it was evidently keen, was meeting some of the \u00a340m fees RBS had piled up and has a solid track record of running the Red Sox. &quot;It was a thorough and well thought-through process,&quot; Grabiner said, rejecting the accusation from Hicks and Gillett, still unexplained, that the &quot;English directors&quot; did not want the best bid for Liverpool. Beyond all this painful detail, dredged for five and a half hours before the word &quot;football&quot; was mentioned, was what we learned more broadly. Three and a half years since Hicks and Gillett strode into Anfield pledging to take a great, decently-run club to the very top, Liverpool are where Portsmouth, Crystal Palace, Notts County, Southend, Cardiff, Sheffield Wednesday, Plymouth, Stockport, Rochdale and Accrington have been recently: in the high court, pleading for survival, during English football&apos;s greatest boom. Liverpool are different from all those who faced winding-up petitions: the club was nowhere near crisis when Hicks and Gillett rode in. The previous season Liverpool finished third in the league and won the FA Cup, then the team Hicks and Gillett inherited reached the 2007 Champions League final. That made the Americans feel that owning an English Premier League club was going to be a whole lot of fun. They promised a spade in the park for the new stadium and not to make their borrowings the club&apos;s responsibility, pledges they broke. They promised theirs was &quot;a multi-generational commitment&quot;, their families involved for decades. And they financed that commitment with \u00a3185m from RBS \u2013 repayable in 12 months. Yesterday the bones of what they have reduced Liverpool to were picked over in court, the pair protesting their right to breach another undertaking. Tomorrow it will all begin again, this case, to decide whether Broughton and the &quot;English directors&quot; have the right to restore Liverpool close to where they would have been, had Hicks and Gillett never walked into Anfield with their short-term loan, planning to make money for themselves, while promising the earth."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/oct/13/liverpool-sale-high-court-verdict-live", "sentences": ["12.36am: Ok, so here&apos;s a brief summary of today&apos;s events: \u2022 This morning a high court ruled against Tom Hicks and George Gillett&apos;s attempt to block the sale of Liverpool FC by RBS to NESV.\u2022 The judge told Hicks and Gillett it would be inappropriate to appeal against his decision.\u2022 Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayres attempted to press home the NESV deal.\u2022 At the same time Singapore businessman Peter Lim maintained his interest in purchasing the club.\u2022 A board meeting to ratify the sale of Liverpool to NESV was held at Slaughter and May&apos;s offices in London at 8pm.", "I wonder if anyone can shed any light on what the terms of their agreement with LFC and RBS say?&quot;  8.32pm: Louise Martin of Radio City in Liverpool has sent me this message on Twitter: &quot;We&apos;re getting the thumbs up from fans (literally on Facebook) on the latest Henry news.&quot;  8.26pm: Although Henry is at the meeting, earlier Martin Broughton admitted that he needed to take legal advice to determine whether he is obliged to accept the higher offer for Liverpool from the Singapore businessman Peter Lim.", "\u2022 However Singapore businessman Peter Lim is still pursuing his rival bid for Liverpool.", "The offers, from NESV, owners of the Boston Red Sox, and the Singapore businessman Peter Lim, both proposed repaying RBS that debt, since refinanced for a series of further short periods, now up to \u00a3200m.", "\u2022 But Singapore businessman Peter Lim is still pursuing his rival bid for Liverpool.", "2.04pm: Singapore billionaire Peter Lim, who yesterday put in a \u00a3320m bid for Liverpool FC, says today:   I welcome the decision of the Court.", "The bids from Peter Lim, the Singapore businessman who owns a chain of Manchester United cafes in south-east Asia, and Mill Financial, the hedge fund which has apparently repossessed Gillett&apos;s shares because he defaulted on a loan, might offer more money to the club, Hicks and Gillett say, not to them."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-13T07:35:31Z", "title": "Liverpool FC sale: High court hearing verdict - as it happened | Steve Busfield and Jacob Steinberg", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Football", "Sport", "John W Henry", "Business", "Business", "Royal Bank of Scotland"], "article": " 1.02am: Would you look at the time? This blog was published at 8.34am yesterday morning. I think we&apos;ll call it a day here. Thanks for reading and thanks for all of your emails, comments and tweets. Steve Busfield will be back to guide you through the latest news on this story from around 9am this morning. Night.  Right, here&apos;s Owen Gibson&apos;s piece on the front page of today&apos;s paper.  Tom Hicks and George Gillett last night tried to derail Liverpool&apos;s sale to the owners of the Boston Red Sox by obtaining a temporary injunction in a Dallas court, claiming $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) in damages and calling it an &quot;epic swindle&quot;. The club immediately responded by vowing to overturn the &quot;unwarranted and damaging&quot; order as talks with New England Joint Ventures continued into the early hours after yesterday&apos;s resounding victory in the high court. As Liverpool&apos;s reconstituted board met with NESV, on the verge of a deal to buy the club for \u00a3300m and bring the tenure of Hicks and Gillett to a close, the duo launched a desperate bid to reopen the sale process. The restraining order appears to prevent a sale taking place before the hearing on 25 October. Now the boards of Kop Football and Kop Holdings accept they must fight to have it removed in order to proceed with the sale to NESV. A statement on the Liverpool website read: &quot;The independent directors consider the restraining order to be unwarranted and damaging and will move as swiftly as possible to seek to have it removed.&quot; The news of the restraining order came in a statement posted on the website of the American law firm Fish &amp; Richardson. The Texas District State Court petition accuses the chairman, Martin Broughton, appointed by the creditors Royal Bank of Scotland in April to oversee the sale of the club, and his fellow directors of acting as &quot;pawns&quot; of RBS to perpetrate an &quot;epic swindle&quot; in selling the club to NESV for less than half its supposed market value and ignoring several higher offers.   12.50am: &quot;I understand that you must be getting a million emails right about now, and have information pouring from everywhere, but can you answer this?&quot; asks Jack Vickers. &quot;What is the likely outcome of all this? In plain English? What is most likely to happen?&quot; In plain English? I have no real idea. My gut feeling, though, is that NESV will end up owning Liverpool.  12.45am: This from the Dallas Observer Blog, containing quotes from Hicks and Gillett&apos;s lawyer:  I just spoke with Stodghill, who says his office is being &quot;innundated with angry e-mails from Liverpool fans.&quot; I asked him: How does a Dallas court have jurisdiction over proceedings initiated in the U.K. He says: Royal Bank of Scotland is registered to do business in the state of Texas; and, of course, New England Sports Ventures is U.S. based. Also being sued is Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton. And, says Stodghill, &quot;We allege in the lawsuit he committed some of his tortuous acts in Texas in meetings with Mr. Hicks, so we&apos;re suing him in part based on conduct here that did harm to Texas residents.&quot; Hicks and Gillett&apos;s \u00a3237 million debt to RBS is due Friday. So, then, what happens between now and then, as the TRO hearing is set for October 25? Says Stodghill, what happens in the next two days &quot;remains to be seen.&quot; As in: &quot;There could be an additional fight at the courthouse over the TRO -- that could potentially happen. There could be discussions with the board to evaluate the higher offers. The one offer they&apos;re refusing to evaluate is \u00a3100 million over NESV&apos;s. And there could be discussions with RBS.&quot;   12.45am: Owen Gibson has also been tweeting about the TRO: &quot;why #LFC may take TRO seriously: US biz interests-contempt risk; hicks met broughton there; kop investments based in dallas; er, that&apos;s it.&quot; Elsewhere the highly informative Tariq Panja tweets: &quot;RBS in tight spot. Argued in court for a quick judgment bcos debt needs to be repaid on Fri. But this TRO won&apos;t be lifted then. What to do?&quot;  12.40am: The Liverpool board meeting has now ended. Is this square one?  12.38am: Owen Gibson has emailed me regarding the confusing issue over the 25 October hearing. &quot;My sense is that Liverpool can apply to the judge to have it thrown out before then but this will buy Hicks and Gillett at least a couple more days - crucially, it will probably take them past RBS&apos;s deadline of October 15 and through the weekend.&quot; Hopefully that clears it up for everybody.  12.36am: Ok, so here&apos;s a brief summary of today&apos;s events: \u2022 This morning a high court ruled against Tom Hicks and George Gillett&apos;s attempt to block the sale of Liverpool FC by RBS to NESV.\u2022 The judge told Hicks and Gillett it would be inappropriate to appeal against his decision.\u2022 Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayres attempted to press home the NESV deal.\u2022 At the same time Singapore businessman Peter Lim maintained his interest in purchasing the club.\u2022 A board meeting to ratify the sale of Liverpool to NESV was held at Slaughter and May&apos;s offices in London at 8pm. Just before the meeting NESV&apos;s John W Henry turned up out of the blue at the meeting, supposedly indicating the deal was a mere formality.\u2022 Then we waited a bit.\u2022 And then a Texas court granted Tom Hicks and George Gillett&apos;s appeal for an injunction to be placed on the sale of Liverpool FC to NESV.\u2022 The pair also revealed they are claiming damages of $1.6bn against the three Liverpool board members, RBS and NESV.\u2022 Liverpool later released a statement calling the TRO &quot;unwarranted&quot; and &quot;damaging&quot;, and intend to get it removed as quickly as possible. They still hope to conclude the deal with NESV.  12.25am: Apologies, I&apos;ve just been hydrating. A few of you are emailing in about the 25th October deadline (11.55pm). I&apos;m a little unsure about this. It remains a little unclear. I doubt that 25th October hearing date will remain.  12am: Here&apos;s that TRO again.  11.55pm: David Goldstone emails in to point out that everything is on hold until 25 October as this is the hearing date in the Texas court.  11.50pm:  It also appears that the Facebook page of Judge Jordan, who granted the restraining order, has been taken down. Can&apos;t think why. I&apos;ve also been told that the phone line to the Texas court is unavailable.  11.48pm: It seems that NESV and RBS are respecting the TRO in order to protect their investments in the US.  11.40pm: An interesting email from a law student. &quot;The Texas judge who issued the injunction has not made an decision on the merits of the case. The injunction just halts everything until there is a hearing. The grounds for granting an emergency TRO are that the actions will create irreparable harm that cannot be adequately compensated for through monetary damages. I suspect that once Judge Jordan actually has a hearing on the issue, he will dismiss it and remove the injunction. The Texas courts probably do have jurisdiction, but they will be hesitant to take it when it will put them in conflict with English courts that are better able to adjudicate the issue. Hopefully, this has only temporarily delayed the sale and Liverpool will avoid administration, but H&amp;G have probably bought themselves a couple more days.&quot;  11.35pm: Friday, of course, is the deadline for Hicks and Gillett to refinance their loans with RBS. If this drags on, there&apos;s every chance they could still be in charge on Friday, and technically RBS would be able to call in the loan, thus placing Liverpool in administration, meaning they would be deducted nine points by the Premier League. This appears unlikely as it would scupper the sale to NESV, but it&apos;s something else to factor into the equation. It does seem that this is simply a delaying tactic by Hicks and Gillett.  11.29pm: Here is the statement from Liverpool&apos;s official site.  Following the successful conclusion of High Court proceedings today, the Boards of Directors of Kop Football and Kop Holdings met tonight and resolved to complete the sale of Liverpool FC to New England Sports Ventures. Regretably, Thomas Hicks and George Gillett have tonight obtained a Temporary Restraining Order from a Texas District Court against the independent directors, Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and NESV to prevent the transaction being completed. The independent directors consider the restraining order to be unwarranted and damaging and will move as swiftly as possible to seek to have it removed. A further statement will be made in due course.   11.25pm: In the next 30 minutes we should get an article on the latest developments from Owen Gibson up on the site.  11.23pm: It goes without saying that Liverpool still intend to complete the sale to NESV, although of course they need to get rid of the TRO first.  11.22pm: &quot;I hope this whole saga with LFC will help other fans of leveraged clubs reflect on the potential damage this can do to our game and the clubs burdened with it,&quot; writes Keith Chesworth. &quot;As a Liverpool fan I am of course delighted to hopefully see the last of these two Americans. No club should have to go through this. There should be a process or system in place to warn of, and action, to prevent such things from escalating to such levels. Manchester Utd are a big hit waiting to happen and although we have a fierce rivalry I would not want them to go through this as we have done. It is wrecking.LFC and Man UTD are to football what the ashes are to cricket.lose them and you have lost the soul in football.&quot;  11.15pm: Liverpool&apos;s board of directors have called this latest move by Hicks and Gillett &quot;unwarranted&quot; and &quot; damaging&quot;. They will move as quickly as possible to get the TRO removed.  11.03pm: At around 9.20pm we were expecting to hear an announcement that the sale of Liverpool had been agreed. This is a quite astonishing turn of events. The sheer front of the pair is simply astounding.  10.55pm: Here is a concise round-up of recent events.  10.48pm: More on the jurisdiction issue. &quot;If Royal Bank of Scotland does business dealings in Texas, courts there would certainly have personal jurisdiction over the bank,&quot; writes Daniel Stauss.  Elsewhere in the Telegraph Paul Kelso claims that &quot;The jurisdiction of the Texas order in the UK was not immediately clear, but sources said the impact of the action could be to put RBS, which has considerable US interests, Broughton, through his role as BA chairman, and NESV in contempt of a US Court.&quot;  10.44pm: To boil this down, no one really knows what&apos;s going on. Our man on the ground, Owen Gibson, will hopefully have more information on this latest piece of chicanery very soon.  10.40pm:  I&apos;ve had the documents regarding the restraining order in my inbox for a while but I haven&apos;t been able to make them visible on this blog yet. Luckily Jason Cuthbert has emailed me this link, and if you scroll down the page, you can read the TRO in all its glory.  10.37pm: We await to hear from legal experts precisely what authority a court in Texas has over the sale of Liverpool. Brass necks doesn&apos;t really begin to cover this, does it?  10.33pm: Let&apos;s see what you have to say about this latest development. &quot;Texan courts don&apos;t even have jurisdiction over happenings in other states,&quot; says Jonathan Kaszynski. &quot;This injunction is a vindictive act, hoping to cause the board and supporters of Liverpool Football Club as much trouble as possible. This has no chance in hell of seeing the light of day in court.&quot; &quot;I am currently warming down from a rather intense tennis match,&quot; says Phil Wainwright. &quot;I declare the Liverpool sale valid. I take it the court I&apos;m playing on has as much jurisdiction as the Texan one?&quot; &quot;Can&apos;t the Premier League revoke H&amp;G&apos;s status as &apos;fit and proper persons&apos;?&quot; asks K. Phillip Harrison. &quot;I realise I risk being named in a Texan lawsuit for suggesting this (but I am ready to counter-sue in the district court of Matale, Sri Lanka where I have Friends).&quot; And lastly, here&apos;s David Penfold. &quot;I looked at the photo and thought those Liverpool chaps have got one rubbish bodyguard.&quot;  10.30pm: So to sum up the latest developments: \u2022 A Texas court has issued an injunction against the sale of Liverpool football club to NESV.\u2022 Hicks and Gillett have called the attempted sale an &quot;epic swindle&quot;. =\u2022 There are claims the attempted sale to NESV was well below the market value of Liverpool.\u2022 Hicks and Gillett are claiming $1.6bn in damages against the three Liverpool board members, NESV and RBS. \u2022 The pair have accused RBS of a &quot;grand conspiracy&quot;. \u2022 Hicks has claimed he received a letter of interest from a third potential purchaser represented by FBR Capital Markets on 4 October 2010 offering to purchase Liverpool FC for \u00a3375 to \u00a3400m. \u2022 It is claimed another offer was also made in the \u00a3350m-400m range in August and that Martin Broughton never responded to this offer.  10.15pm: Owen Gibson has passed on the following report about the latest classy move by Hicks &amp; Gillett. It&apos;s a long read, but it&apos;s worth it.  The owners of Liverpool Football Club today reported that a Texas State District Court has granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the Board of Liverpool Football Club (LFC) from executing a sale of the Club to New England Sports Ventures (NESV). The court set a hearing date of October 25, 2010. The TRO request, signed by Judge Jim Jordan of the 160th District Court in Dallas, was part of a lawsuit filed today by the owners of LFC against Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow, Ian Ayre, NESV and Philip Nash. The lawsuit also seeks temporary and permanent injunctions, and damages totaling approximately $1.6 billion (over \u00a31 billion).  The suit lays out the defendants&apos; &quot;epic swindle&quot; in which they conspired to devise and execute a scheme to sell LFC to NESV at a price they know to be hundreds of millions of dollars below true market value (and well below Forbes magazine&apos;s recent independent $822 million valuation of the club) - and below multiple expressions of interest and offers to buy either the club in its entirety or make minority investments (including Meriton and Mill Financial). It describes how the defendants excluded the owners from meetings, discussions and communications regarding the potential sale to NESV and interfered with efforts by the owners to obtain financing for Liverpool FC.  The Club&apos;s owners are represented by attorneys from the international law firm of Fish &amp; Richardson. The following are some of the key points in the complaint, which details the roles of RBS and the other defendants, and also describes previously undisclosed offers to purchase LFC: &quot;The Director Defendants were acting merely as pawns of RBS, wholly abdicating the fiduciary responsibilities that they owed in the sale.&quot;  &quot;RBS has been complicit in this scheme with the Director Defendants. For example, in letters from RBS to potential investors obtained just within the past few days, RBS has informed investors that it will approve of a deal only if there is &quot;no economic return to equity&quot; for Messrs. Hicks and Gillett. In furtherance of this grand conspiracy, on information and belief, RBS has improperly used its influence as the club&apos;s creditor and as a worldwide banking leader to prevent any transaction that would permit Messrs. Hicks and Gillett to recover any of their initial investment in the club, much less share in the substantial appreciation in the value of Liverpool FC that their investments have created.&quot; &quot;On or about October 4, 2010, Mr. Hicks received a letter of interest from a third potential purchaser represented by FBR Capital Markets (&quot;FBR&quot;), offering to purchase Liverpool FC for \u00a3375 to \u00a3400 million ($595 to $635 million). The letter informed Mr. Hicks that the potential purchaser would not need financing, possessed the funds to close the transaction, and intended to build a new stadium for Liverpool FC.&quot; &quot;Additionally, the Plaintiffs learned just days ago about another potential investor that made a similar offer in the \u00a3350 to \u00a3400 million range that was communicated to Defendant Broughton and another unnamed co-conspirator in late August. According to this investor, Mr. Broughton never responded to the offer. Moreover, when the purported sale to NESV was announced, this investor again contacted Mr. Broughton and informed him that the offer, which significantly exceeded the NESV offer, was still on the table. Again, Mr. Broughton brushed this offer aside without further discussion.&quot;   10.09pm: Forty minutes ago we were expecting an announcement on the ownership of the club. This is just incredible. Our man on the scene, Owen Gibson, is trying to find out more.  10.06pm: The big question that everyone is asking right now is precisely what jurisdiction does this Texas court have over the sale of the club?  10pm:  Further to this story about a Texas court issuing an injunction on the sale of the club, Owen Gibson writes that Hicks and Gillett are claiming $1.6bn in damages.  9.58pm: Are Hicks and Gillett making life difficult? Are they ever. News reaches us that a Texas court has issued a restraining order on the sale of the club, calling it an &quot;epic swindle&quot;.  9.55pm: &quot;Are Hicks and Gillett making it difficult?&quot; asks Alex McGibbon. &quot;Well duh!&quot; In a way, I kind of admire their sheer gumption. Talk about not taking a hint.  9.52pm: Below the line, scall writes: &quot;Surely this statement is wrong &quot;this has still been a remarkably depressing week for English football&quot; as i think it is a first step in getting football back to where it should be.&quot; I essentially agree with you, but I still find it depressing that it really has come to this, that this is what&apos;s required to sort out a football club.  9.50pm: Hmmm. This is going very slowly. After it seemed an announcement was imminent, the board meeting is still going on. What&apos;s the hold up? Are Hicks and Gillett making it difficult?  9.40pm: &quot;Actually i&apos;m rather glad the future wasn&apos;t decided on the pitch,&quot; parps Dai Smout.  9.38pm: Dan Roan on Twitter: &quot;Liverpool&apos;s communications advisor Craig Breheny has arrived at board meeting - suggests statement now imminent.&quot;  9.26pm: Regardless of Hicks and Gillett losing their case, this has still been a remarkably depressing week for English football. A club&apos;s future played out in the courts rather than on the pitch.  9.21pm: The feeling is that an announcement is imminent. Cars have turned up outside the Slaughter and May offices and the engines have been left running, a sign that the participants in the board meeting are about to emerge.  9.14pm: Apologies, I&apos;ve just been off doing some odd jobs for the newspaper. I did say that might happen. But nothing&apos;s actually happening at the moment - the board meeting is still ongoing and there&apos;s no indication of when it will finish. To repeat, however, the big news from the evening so far, Liverpool&apos;s prospective John W Henry unexpectedly turned up to the meeting, and his attempted takeover is widely expected to go ahead tonight. For now, we play the waiting game.  8.56pm: The Guardian&apos;s sports news correspondent Owen Gibson, on the ball as usual, has emailed to clear up the presence of Keith Edelman at the meeting: &quot;Keith Edelman has been involved in the process as an advisor to RBS for some time - he will be at the board meeting in that capacity.&quot; So there we go.  8.52pm: So, where next for Hicks and Gillett? The wonders of Photoshop, eh?  8.46pm: Here&apos;s Dan Roan on Twitter: &quot;All we need now is for Messrs Hicks, Gillett and Lim to turn up at Slaugher &amp; May&apos;s offices - it could get nasty.&quot;      John W Henry is at the Liverpool board meeting tonight. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters    8.37pm: As John W Henry strode into the building, Sky Sports News reporter Bryan Swanson asked him how confident he was about the takeover. &quot;Pretty confident,&quot; replied Henry. &quot;And how do you feel about owning Liverpool?&quot; Swanson pressed. Thumbs up from Henry.  8.35pm:  &quot;I&apos;m a corporate lawyer, and I should start off by saying that I haven&apos;t seen any of the documents in this legal battle,&quot; writes Sam Kessler. &quot;From what I&apos;ve seen in the press, my instinct is that Gillett and Hicks would only have a claim against the Liverpool board to the extent they have acted outside of their powers, or if they have breached the terms of a contract to which G&amp;H were a party, or if they have not acted in the best interests of the company for the benefit of its shareholders (and - significantly here - bearing in mind the company&apos;s creditors, given that the company is on the verge of an administration if G&amp;H don&apos;t pay off their RBS loan by Friday). Judging from the decision today by Mr Justice Floyd, it looks like the first and third possibilities are non-starters. I wonder if anyone can shed any light on what the terms of their agreement with LFC and RBS say?&quot;  8.32pm: Louise Martin of Radio City in Liverpool has sent me this message on Twitter: &quot;We&apos;re getting the thumbs up from fans (literally on Facebook) on the latest Henry news.&quot;  8.26pm: Although Henry is at the meeting, earlier Martin Broughton admitted that he needed to take legal advice to determine whether he is obliged to accept the higher offer for Liverpool from the Singapore businessman Peter Lim. There have been so many twists and turns in this story over the last week or so that it would take a brave man to categorically predict how this one is going to end up.  8.20pm: Sky Sports News are now repeatedly showing footage of John W Henry walking into the meeting.  8.15pm: There are reports on the Liverpool Echo&apos;s Neil Jones on Twitter that the former Arsenal director, Keith Edelman, has also turned up at the meeting. Edelman had a big hand in the development of Arsenal&apos;s Emirates Stadium and, of course, Liverpool are in dire need of a new stadium.  8.11pm: The football world is still turning on its axis despite the Liverpool developments. &quot;Eyes peeled on that front door,&quot; says Sky Sports News Man. &quot;Now then, Arsenal&apos;s Aaron Ramsey is back in training...&quot;  8.08pm: The fact that John W Henry is at the Liverpool board meeting tonight surely indicates his mooted takeover will go ahead.  8.04pm: Ben Smith of The Times tweets: &quot;So @John_W_Henry turns up at tonight&apos;s #LFC board meeting ... will Peter Lim be next to arrive?&quot;  8.02pm: John W Henry was not expected to be at this board meeting, so this is a highly significant development on a highly significant day.  8pm: BREAKING NEWS - NESV&apos;s John W Henry has arrived at the Liverpool board meeting at Slaughter and May offices. That binding agreement they have must be pretty binding.  7.57pm: Reporters and news cameras are waiting outside the offices where the board meeting is being held in London.  7.50pm: Not long now until the highly anticipated board meeting. The &quot;reconstituted&quot; Liverpool board, meeting here in London will be: \u2022...ratifying the decision to sell Liverpool FC to John W Henry and New England Sports Ventures for \u00a3300m. \u2022 NESV says it has a &quot;binding agreement in place&quot; to buy the football club. \u2022 However Singapore businessman Peter Lim is still pursuing his rival bid for Liverpool. He urged the board to &quot;not simply ratify a sale to NESV&quot; after he unveiled a \u00a3320m offer yesterday. More when we know more.  7.36pm: Jon Saraceno of USA Today has been on Sky Sports News, and he says the concern for sports fans in the US will be whether John W Henry&apos;s use of funds at Liverpool will have implications for the Boston Red Sox. However, Saraceno said, Henry is a shrewd businessman and there should be no prospect of that happening.  7.33pm: Here&apos;s David Conn&apos;s blog about Martin Broughton&apos;s role in this saga.  Throughout the grim course since the 1990s of English football clubs being bought by &quot;owners&quot; for personal enrichment, contrary to the game&apos;s time-honoured tradition that directors should be &quot;custodians&quot;, none have been served with the wallop meted out today to Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Beaming on the steps of the high court, Liverpool&apos;s chairman, Martin Broughton, declaring himself &quot;delighted&quot;, said: &quot;Justice has been done.&quot; He repeated what he has said for a week, that the club&apos;s American owners committed &quot;flagrant abuses of undertakings&quot; when they tried to sack Christian Purslow, Liverpool&apos;s managing director, and Ian Ayre, the commercial director, and oppose the board&apos;s agreed sale to New England Sports Ventures. Broughton said the fact the judge, Mr Justice Floyd, agreed, ruling that Hicks and Gillett committed &quot;the clearest possible breach&quot; of their agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland, had won Broughton, Purslow and Ayre their case. The chairman emphasised again how damaging the Americans&apos; &quot;leveraged [debt-based] buyout&quot; had been for the club Hicks and Gillett bought in February 2007 with \u00a3185m borrowed from Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 repayable in only 12 months \u2013 then loaded on the club to service. The offers, from NESV, owners of the Boston Red Sox, and the Singapore businessman Peter Lim, both proposed repaying RBS that debt, since refinanced for a series of further short periods, now up to \u00a3200m. &quot;The vital thing is that all the offers have wiped out all the acquisition debt,&quot; Broughton said. &quot;That puts the club on a sound financial footing.&quot;   7.30pm: &quot;I have just have seen the picture of the victorious Christian Purslow and Martin Broughton - flanked by the Guardian&apos;s Owen Gibson \u2013 as the caption helpfully points out,&quot; writes Khalid Majid. &quot;I was wondering, given the physical proximity of the Guardian&apos;s man to the triumphant duo, whether there has been any temptation on Owen&apos;s part to ape the BBC&apos;s John Simpson re liberating Kabul and declare: &apos;It was the Guardian who liberated Liverpool from the depths of unsustainable, imperialist debt&apos;.&quot; We like to think we&apos;ve done our bit, Khalid. Spirit of Shankly? Pah!  7pm: We&apos;re now roughly one hour away from the Liverpool board meeting, where directors will be discussing the future ownership of the club.  6.46pm: Here&apos;s an email about John W Henry from Brad Reed. &quot;I don&apos;t know how many Yanks you&apos;ve heard from on this, but just in case, I thought I&apos;d write to reassure the scousers out there. I understand - even empathize - with the desire to find a deep-pocketed sheik or Russian oil billionaire to buy the club from the greedy idiots that have been running it. However, as a Red Sox fan, I attest that one could do much worse than John Henry and NESV. If they get the club, I think they will do well by Liverpool. They will want to make money, but they want to do it by building the club. They did wonders with Fenway (albeit at the cost of expensive ticket prices), and they brought a title to a Red Sox nation that hadn&apos;t seen one since 1918.&quot; Well, you&apos;d hope that NESV can&apos;t be as bad as Hicks and Gillett.  6.08pm: Legal experts are suggesting that while Tom Hicks and George Gillett would probably be wasting their time with an appeal against the high court judgement, they could yet claim for damages against Liverpool, according to the sports lawyer Andrew Lewis.  The judge made it clear that he thinks any appeal would be inappropriate so, while it remains an option, Hicks and Gillett&apos;s more realistic option is a claim for damages.They may argue they have sustained losses as a result of the board&apos;s actions and believe Liverpool to be more valuable than \u00a3300m. That would give Hicks and Gillett time to get their house in order. They will still lose the football club but if they are going to recoup some money, which is the most important objective for them, that might be the way to go. I don&apos;t expect them to let this lie. However the verdict is a significant victory for Liverpool. The court has effectively ruled that Hicks and Gillett are not entitled to stand in the way of any sale by the Liverpool board.   6.02pm: Jamie Carragher says that Liverpool&apos;s players can have no excuses for their form on the pitch, despite the ownership issues. Speaking to TalkSport, the defender had the following to say on the boardroom shenanigans and this weekend&apos;s Merseyside derby.  We have changed the manager, we have changed the board and if things don&apos;t change now then the players will go too. Everything else has changed, it is just the players who have stayed the same. I hope we can look forward now. I don&apos;t think the protests have affected things too much, because the protests and marches were usually before or after games. The atmosphere has not been great at Anfield recently because the performances have not been that great. But a lot of supporters will be delighted with the outcome today. I am sure that will give us a feel-good factor and we hope that will help us.   5.38pm: Evening all. I&apos;ll be carrying on this live blog for the next few hours or so, but as I have various other jobs to do tonight, the updates will be sporadic at best. The main focus is, as Steve points out below, the Liverpool board meeting at 8pm, where we&apos;ll hopefully be told whether the NESV takeover bid receives the green light. You can email me here or tweet me here.  5.23pm: My colleague Jacob Steinberg will be taking over this blog for the evening. He has other jobs to do too, but he will post major updates. The Liverpool board meeting is due to start at 8pm. We will hopefully be told if that meeting ratifies the NESV takeover bid. There may or may not also be updates on whether Hicks and Gillett will attempt to appeal against today&apos;s court ruling. Thank you for reading, commenting, emailing, tweeting today.       4.50pm:Time to recap today&apos;s events: \u2022 Judge rules against Hicks &amp; Gillett, saying that they did not have the right to oust the board. Mr Justice Floyd ruled that Hicks and Gillett have &quot;no absolute right to veto a sale&quot; and said he didn&apos;t want to issue a ruling that could &quot;damage&quot; the Boston bid. \u2022 The &quot;reconstituted&quot; board of Liverpool FC will meet tonight, in London, from 8pm, to decide next move, which is expected to be.... \u2022...ratifying the decision to sell Liverpool FC to John W Henry and New England Sports Ventures for \u00a3300m. \u2022 NESV says it has a &quot;binding agreement in place&quot; to buy the football club. \u2022 But Singapore businessman Peter Lim is still pursuing his rival bid for Liverpool. He urged the board to &quot;not simply ratify a sale to NESV&quot; after he unveiled a \u00a3320m offer yesterday. \u2022 Royal Bank of Scotland - which had set a deadline of Friday for the repayments of the club&apos;s debts - said &quot;RBS has every confidence...the board will now reach appropriate decisions regarding the next steps&quot;. \u2022 Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton said: &quot;We will have a board meeting this evening and proceed with the sale process. I&apos;m not going to prejudge the board meeting...But the club&apos;s going to have a great future. ... We will get the right owners for the fans.&quot; \u2022 The judge said it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; for Hicks and Gillett to appeal. The owners will also have to pay legal costs of up to 500,000 pounds. \u2022 But H&amp;G may go directly to the court of appeal. Such a move would be unlikely to be able to stop a sale, but might become a case for damages. \u2022 During the case it was also revealed that American hedge fund Mill Financial has put in a bid that also pledges to wipe out the club&apos;s debts and would provide up to \u00a3100 million pounds to fund a new stadium. Mill Financial technically controls Gillett&apos;s 50 percent stake after he defaulted on the loan used by Gillett to fund his part of the leveraged takeover in 2007. And, as Paul Kelso tweets: &quot;Atmosphere in #LFC board meeting could be interesting: &quot;Hi Tom, it&apos;s Martin...&quot;  3.55pm: Talking to legal experts, the feeling seems to be that H&amp;G probably will try to get the appeal court to hear them. But if the LFC/NESV talks are concluded and the deal is done, an appeal court ruling won&apos;t be able to unpick that deal. It might become a case for damages, though. H&amp;G could potentially hope for \u00a3100m damages, but would be very unlikely to get them. Lawyer (and Liverpool fan) Damian McPhun emails: &quot;In order for any appeal to succeed, H&amp;G will need to demonstrate that the verdict of the judge at first instance (i.e. Justice Floyd) was &quot;wrong&quot;. In reality this means they will need to show that the verdict was not within the reasonable spectrum of decisions that could be made about the case. The mere fact that an Appeal judge might have come to a different opinion is not the determining factor - the Court of Appeal won&apos;t interfere unless a verdict is obviously wrong. Even to get permission to appeal H&amp;G will need to show that an appeal would have reasonable prospects of success - not a formality in this case.&quot;  3.49pm: LFC board meeting that will decide future of club will take place at Slaughter&amp;May&apos;s London offices at 8pm - media scrum already in place, tweets @danroan.             3.15pm: Andy Thornley filmed the scenes outside the High Court earlier today. There is also this Guardian film of the singing and the post-verdict interviews.  2.58pm: Royal Bank of Scotland statement:   Today&apos;s judgment vindicates the actions RBS has taken to ensure that decisions concerning the future of Liverpool Football Club are made by a properly constituted Board acting in the Club&apos;s best interests. RBS has every confidence that having been put on a proper footing, the Board will now reach appropriate decisions regarding the next steps.   2.34pm: I&apos;ve had a lot of emails and comments below the line about Anthony O Connell&apos;s email (10.35am) which said: &quot;Is it just me or is there no future for courtroom MBM, they are seriously long and boring a bit like a cricket match.&quot; I&apos;d just like say that I think Anthony was teasing. But thank you to you all for your thanks and compliments for our work over the last couple of days. It is nice to be appreciated. But it&apos;s not over yet...             2.27pm: Long-time Liverpool supporter, and the man who brought Lady In Red to the world, Chris de Burgh, says: &quot;I&apos;m delighted by the Judges decision in the high court action involving Liverpool Football Club. In spite of what may have been the best intentions Hicks &amp; Gillett have been catastrophic for the club, they&apos;ve been like unwanted houseguests who overstayed their welcome. So with this sorry saga behind us, it&apos;s time for the club and it&apos;s millions of supporters to move on, hopefully to a brave new beginning and put Liverpool Football club back where it rightfully belongs, at the top of the Premier League.&quot; Entirely coincidentally, Chris has a new album out next week which will be exclusively available at Asda.  2.13pm: So, beyond that NESV statement, how have the events at the High Court been playing out in America? Boston.com reports that John W Henry spent 90 minutes yesterday afternoon in the Phoenix Landing pub in Cambridge (US), which is apparently &quot;a haven for supporters of Liverpool FC&quot;. He left when a British TV crew appeared. (Thanks for that link to Vin Miles). Meanwhile, the Boston Red Sox MLB site reported at the end of last week: &quot;The owners of the Red Sox have successfully acquired a new endeavor. New England Sports Ventures, a group headed by John Henry and Tom Werner, learned Friday that the English Premier League has approved their $476 million bid to purchase the Liverpool franchise.&quot; (Phil Unsworth emailed that link in, with hopes that the &quot;Americanisms&quot; will not creep in at Anfield)  2.08pm: New England Sports Ventures has released a statement saying that it has a &quot;binding agreement&quot; to buy Liverpool. Full statement:  NESV welcomes today&apos;s High Court judgment, which is a huge step forward for Liverpool FC. NESV has a binding agreement in place with the Board of Liverpool FC and we are looking forward to concluding the deal. We are ready to move quickly and help create the stability and certainty which the Club needs at this time. It is time to return the focus to the Club itself and performances on the pitch.   2.04pm: Singapore billionaire Peter Lim, who yesterday put in a \u00a3320m bid for Liverpool FC, says today:   I welcome the decision of the Court. The way is now clear for the Board to sell the Club. I have delivered my Offer to the Board and believe that my ownership represents the best option for the future of the Club and it&apos;s supporters. I hope that when the Board is reconstituted tonight that it will not simply ratify a sale to NESV but will consider all the Offers before them. I am asking the Board to run a full and fair process that enables all of the Offers to be considered on their merits before the future of the Club is decided.        1.58pm: &quot;Lim welcomes judgment and calls on reconstituted #LFC board to consider his new, improved offer rather than simply rubber stamping NESV&apos;s,&quot; tweets Owen Gibson.  1.53pm: post-verdict Q&amp;A with Martin Broughton, carried in full by SportingIntelligence: Q. Will NESV own the club by tomorrow?A. There&apos;s a board meeting this evening, hopefully to determine whether or not that is the case.Q. Do you have a duty to consider any of the other bids that have come in that may be higher?A. We will take legal advice on this.Q. Do you expect the owners to take part in this?A. I would expect they will. They will certainly be invited as they were last time. I have no reason to believe they will not be there.Q. If there is an appeal next week will that affect the process?A. We will take legal advice on that.      Scouse Humour Photomontage by Andy    1.30pm: Probably the best...       1.12pm: Graham Sharpe gives the bookies view: &quot;William Hill betting on who takes over Liverpool - NESV 1/10 favs with Peter Lim&apos;s Meriton 6/1 and Mill Financial 14/1 outsiders.&quot;  12.43pm: Some legal opinions: Andrew Nixon, Associate at Thomas Eggar LLP, said:   This ruling means that there will be no need for Mr Broughton and the board to bring their own declaratory proceedings seeking an Order that they are entitled to push ahead with the deal. Hicks and Gillett do have a right to appeal the ruling against them and given the amount of cash they are set to lose on a sale to NESV, they are likely to do so. Should they decide to take that option, then there will be further delay. If an appeal is launched then RBS may extend the loan deadline. Regardless of Justice Floyd&apos;s assertion in this morning&apos;s judgment that it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to appeal it seems likely that there is still considerable mileage in this case.  Gerald Krasner, Partner at insolvency and recovery specialist Begbies Traynor and former Chairman of Leeds United Football Club (before selling to Ken Bates in 2005), said:   This morning&apos;s announcement means that the possibility of Administration is now highly unlikely and the smart money is on the deal with NESV now going through. Even though there are obviously other parties now looking to muscle in, the chances of them being able to usurp John Henry&apos;s bid are remote although, if Hicks and Gillett look to appeal against today&apos;s ruling, that will delay things somewhat.        12.24pm: NESV boss and prospective LFC owner John W Henry tweets this morning: &quot;Well done Martin, Christian &amp; Ian. Well done RBS. Well done supporters!&quot; Yesterday he also tweeted this: &quot;One question I can answer: Who are we? http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?c_id=bos&amp;content_id=12766377&amp;tcid=fb_video_12766377&quot;  12.18pm: My colleague Gregg Roughley (yes, a Liverpool fan) says: &quot;Liverpool fans might enjoy knowing that on Margaret Thatcher&apos;s 85th birthday she&apos;ll be watching nothing but celebrating scousers and miners all day on TV.&quot;  12.13pm: The Liverpool Echo has tweeted a nice picture of a very pleased Christian Purslow. Meanwhile, our new picture at the top of this blog, similarly portrays the happy board emerging from court. And on their right, getting as close to the news as possible, is our man Owen Gibson.  12.01pm: An appeal is not being ruled out yet by Hicks and Gillett, says Keith Oliver, a senior partner with solicitors Peters &amp; Peters, who are acting for the Liverpool owners.  Mr Oliver said:   We are obviously disappointed with the judge&apos;s decision. Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett will now be considering their next steps, and that will include whether to make an application to the court of appeal.   11.56am: Lord Grabiner QC, who represented the board, put the costs of the case at between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000.             11.55am: There were chaotic scenes outside the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand, reports PA, when more than 100 Liverpool fans mobbed club chairman Martin Broughton, singing: &quot;We love you, Martin, we do.&quot;  Security guards tried and failed to move the crowd blocking the entrance as they broke into You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone.      Martin Broughton Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images    11.51am: More from the chairman: Broughton described himself as &quot;elated&quot; with the result but stopped short of saying that the club will definitely be sold to John Henry&apos;s New England Sports Ventures, reports the Press Association.  He told Sky Sports News:   I am absolutely elated, it&apos;s a very important day for our club. This will clear the way for the sale, we will have a board meeting this evening and proceed with the sale. It has been an anxious time but we have been confident. But when you go to court you can never be sure.  Regarding the sale to NESV, Broughton added:   The board has to be reconstituted and I can&apos;t prejudge what the board is going to say. It would be inappropriate to prejudge what the board may say. I want to thank the fans for their support through a difficult time. We hope to have the board meeting this evening. We will get the right owners for the fans. It was an excellent outcome and I will be very pleased when the process we came in to do is completed.   11.43am: So, while we have the verdict, this live blog will need to keep going for the rest of the day: \u2022 Despite the Judge telling H&amp;G that an appeal would be &quot;inappropriate&quot;, the owners could still try for an appeal at the court of appeal \u2022 A board meeting will be held by 8pm to try to see through the sale to New England Sports Ventures  11.28am: Martin Broughton outside court:   Justice has been done. We will now continue with the sale process. We will have a board meeting tonight and the owners will certainly be invited.  Christian Purslow: &quot;This is a great day for the club and will hopefully allow Liverpool to concentrate on football for the next ten years.  11.22am: Mr Justice Floyd has declined to grant an appeal. The judge said it would be inappropriate in the circumstances for him to grant leave. He said that if Hicks and Gillett are determined to appeal, they would have to apply to the appeal court for permission.  11.11am: Judge tells Hicks and Gillett it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to appeal. But that route does still remain open, although it is unclear what it could achieve with a board meeting by 8pm tonight. Sachin says that the Liverpool/RBS barristers are now being cheered by the crowd outside.  11.07am: We will be fleshing out more detail of the court ruling over the next few hours. The judge seems to be allowing a breakneck speed to the sale process, which is what RBS and the board wanted. Will H&amp;G appeal? Have they time to? Even if they do, can it halt the sale? Will NESV wish to proceed if new litigation is hanging? Lots of questions, hopefully some answers in the coming hours....  11.05am: The board also want court costs paid by H&amp;G.  11.04am: Judge rules that owners should pay RBS costs.  11.02am: Broughton wants a board meeting by 8pm today to sort out the sale and there is a dispute over whether the owners will be able to communicate via phone. The owners&apos; QC is asking for the meeting to take place at ten o&apos;clock tomorrow. Judge rules that it should be at 8 today.  11.01am: RBS want the owners to cover their court costs. Wonder how much they are?  10.59am: More detail: The high court today granted injunctions that could open the way for the prompt sale of Liverpool. The club&apos;s owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett asked a judge to delay the hearing of an application by creditors Royal Bank of Scotland for mandatory orders paving the way for a possible sale this week. But the plea was rejected by Mr Justice At RBS&apos;s request, the judge imposed injunctions on the two men requiring them to restore the original constitutions of the companies and managing directors. This removes the final stumbling block to a \u00a3300m takeover by New England Sports Ventures which will see the RBS recoup its original \u00a3237m loan to Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett when they bought the club in March 2007.  10.54am: Judge throws out attempt by owners to have interim injunction put on board.  10.50am: The injunction means the board is reconstituted with Purslow and Ayre back in place and Broughton allowed to see through the sale, reports Sachin Nakrani  10.49am: Mr Justice Floyd: &quot;The owners do not have an absolute right to veto a sale.&quot;  10.43am: Judge rules against H&amp;G, which means NESV deal can proceed. We will try and flesh out the details and ramifications...  10.42am: JUDGE RULES MANDATORY INJUNCTION WANTED BY RBS AGAINST OWNERS IS GRANTED: SALE CAN GO AHEAD  10.35am: Anthony O Connell emails to say: &quot;Is it just me or is there no future for courtroom MBM, they are seriously long and boring a bit like a cricket match. On a more serious note as a Liverpool fan this could be a big day for football in general as Liverpool are the first truly big club to go through this process and it shows exactly what could happen at various other clubs particularly Man Utd should debt default raise its head in other clubs.&quot;  10.28am: While we continue to wait for Mr Justice Floyd&apos;s judgment, (which, experience tells me will be long and complicated), I just need to tell you that we have had to turn off the autorefresh component of this page because there are so many readers. So you will need to hit refresh or F5 to update the page.  10.16am: While we await word from court, here&apos;s yesterday&apos;s recap of the basic positions argued by the main parties: RBS says owners have contradicted rules of sales agreement by trying to oust two members of the board and there should be a mandatory injunction imposed by the court to make sure the board is reinstated. G&amp;H admit they have breached sales agreement but say they only did it because the board excluded them from the sales agreement and refused to take into account stronger alternative bids to NESV. As a result, they dispute the injunction claim. The Board disputes the claim that the owners were excluded from the sales agreement and says that instead the owners simply refused to take part. It also insists the NESV bid was the strongest on the table after a thorough process to find a buyer for the club.      Mr Justice Floyd: What will he say? Picture: Gary Lee/UPPA    10.05am: Mr Justice Floyd has arrived...  10.03am: A moment of lightness before the serious stuff: the public gallery is so overcrowded that two fans are asked to leave. &quot;Can we appeal?&quot; they ask.The clark of court says no.  9.59am: Broughton, Purslow and Ayre are all in court. Mr Justice Floyd has not yet arrived though....  9.53am: Something cheerful for Liverpool fans to contemplate. The post-Hicks Texas Rangers won their first ever post-season series last night, to reach the American League Championship Series. If they beat the Yankees they will play in the World Series. There is life after Tom Hicks. And whatever happens over the coming minutes, hours, days, Hicks is fairly certainly going, that much was clear from court last night. Sure this will be enjoyed on the liverpoolfc.tv fans forum thread: Any baseball fans?  9.47am: The case has moved to court 18 today. Sachin Nakrani says it&apos;s a packed room again, standing room only, not helped by the fact that this room is smaller than yesterday&apos;s court 16.  9.42am: As Paul Kelso says, today is very unlikely to bring an end to this saga:   Whoever loses is certain to appeal. Hicks and Gillett have launched their own counter-suit against RBS and the board, while Broughton and the club have begun proceedings for a separate declaratory judgment approving the sale to NESV. Meanwhile the three potential buyers - NESV, Peter Lim and Mill Financial - could seek damages if their ambition to control Liverpool is frustrated.        9.24am: Sports news correspondent Owen Gibson tweets from The Strand: &quot;Back to High Court for #LFC judgment day. But legal frenzy unlikely to end here, whatever the result. Big winner? The lawyers, of course.&quot;  9.10am: Here&apos;s Barney Ronay on the atmosphere inside the high court yesterday. One imagines it will be pretty tense there this morning. It is unclear how long the judgement will take, these things can go on. And on. Or not. Sorry I can&apos;t be any clearer. But, just again to say, the judgement could come by 10am. If you have read other interesting pieces about what happened yesterday and what may happen today and beyond, please email/tweet/post comments with links. Thanks      Dirk Kuyt: out until the new year? Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images    9.07am: As if things weren&apos;t complicated enough for Liverpool off-the-pitch, Dirk Kuyt&apos;s injury last night won&apos;t help either.  9.02am: After much discussion yesterday over the various bidders that were discussed in court, Owen Gibson produced this handy guide to &quot;Who&apos;s who in the battle to own Liverpool FC&quot;. Although there is still much to be revealed about the bidders that H&amp;G highlighted as rivals to the one accepted by the board, NESV.  8.54am: Good morning, Steve here. We think the verdict might come as early as 10am today. We will again have Sachin Nakrani nipping in and out of court to give us updates and Owen Gibson catching all the courtroom drama. David Conn will give us more analysis.  8.35am: Good morning, Steve will be here shortly. In the meantime, here&apos;s an extract from David Conn&apos;s blog on the proceedings yesterday:  At the end of the day, as they say in football, or of QCs in the wood-panelled courts of The Strand picking over a football club&apos;s guts: what have we learned? Well, that poor Tom Hicks and George Gillett have been much misunderstood. They are not, their barrister, Paul Girolami QC, insisted, &quot;trying to throw a spanner in the works&quot; of Liverpool&apos;s sale to New England Sports Ventures. That is the deal agreed by the board, chaired by Martin Broughton, last Tuesday, which might finally pay off the \u00a3200m Hicks and Gillett borrowed from Royal Bank of Scotland to buy the club in the first place, then loaded on the club to repay. Hicks and Gillett may be holding it up with all the legal armoury corporate sluggers can pay for but, they say, it is all for the good of the club. The bids from Peter Lim, the Singapore businessman who owns a chain of Manchester United cafes in south-east Asia, and Mill Financial, the hedge fund which has apparently repossessed Gillett&apos;s shares because he defaulted on a loan, might offer more money to the club, Hicks and Gillett say, not to them. They do not want to stay in control or resist a sale of the club, Girolami said, but they believe the &quot;English directors&quot; \u2013 Broughton, the managing director, Christian Purslow, and the commercial director, Ian Ayre \u2013 ganged up on them. Hicks and Gillett&apos;s barrister said the &quot;English directors&quot; formed &quot;a sub\u2011committee&quot;, calling it the &quot;home team&quot;, and excluded the Americans from the decision\u2011making.

The bank, which specialises in emerging markets in Asia and Africa, said it would offer shareholders the right to buy one new share for every eight shares held at a price of 1,280p, a 32% discount to Tuesday&apos;s closing price in London. Fees for the cash call, including those paid to its underwriters JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and UBS, will amount to just over $100m. Temasek, the Singapore state investment agency, is the bank&apos;s largest shareholder with a 19% stake, and said it intends to take up its rights. Standard Chartered has already raised half a billion dollars this year on the Bombay stock exchange. The bank also said it had made &quot;very good progress&quot; in the third quarter, with income rising faster than in the first half. Trade volumes were almost back to pre-crisis levels, it added. Chief executive Peter Sands insisted the rights issue had nothing to do with talk that rivals were eyeing up the bank. The shares rallied 2% yesterday as rumours swirled that it was in the sights of JP Morgan. He also denied suggestions that the rights issue was intended to build up a warchest for acquisitions. &quot;We see many opportunities for growth across Asia, Africa and the Middle East as the world continues to rebalance between east and west,&quot; he said. &quot;We are launching this rights issue to ensure that we can continue our strong record of organic growth and take full advantage of these opportunities, while at the same time being prepared for likely increases in capital requirements resulting from Basel III implementation.&quot; The bank said the capital raising would lift its core tier one capital ratio - top-quality capital that banks hold in reserve - to about 11%, from 9% at the end of June. The new Basel rules require a ratio of at least 7%. However, the new rules also tighten the definition of core tier one so that common equity and retained earnings must make up the bulk of a bank&apos;s capital base. This means that the current ratios could be lower under the Basel III rules. &quot;Sands clearly wants to stay ahead of the capital game in a similar manner to Deutsche Bank,&quot; said David Buik at BGC Partners. &quot;There were some wild suggestions that Standard Chartered might be in the sights of JP Morgan, which as a business fit makes a lot of sense. However, we are talking here of something close to $75bn \u2013 a somewhat indigestible sum for JP Morgan to swallow in the rather parlous state of the economy.&quot; Gary Jenkins at Evolution Securities said: &quot;If this becomes a trend and banks move ahead of the timetable set by Basel III is can only be a good thing for bondholders.&quot; Standard Chartered shares dropped 67p to \u00a318.41 in early trading in London, a fall of nearly 3.6%."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/oct/13/liverpool-sale-martin-broughton-hero", "sentences": ["Paul Girolami QC, representing Hicks and Gillett, admitted they had breached their sales agreement with RBS but claimed they only did so because Broughton, Purslow and Ayre, the other members of Liverpool&apos;s five-man board, had overlooked two other offers for the club, from the Singapore billionaire Peter Lim and Mill Financial, a US hedge fund which is understood to have assumed control of Gillett&apos;s stake in the club."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-13T11:44:08Z", "title": "Liverpool sale: Fans have new heroes after victory in the high court | Sachin Nakrani", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Liverpool is littered with heroes and this morning, a few minutes after 11 o&apos;clock, their supporters greeted some more. As Martin Broughton, the club&apos;s chairman, stepped out of Court 18 of the Royal Courts of Justice, followed by his fellow directors Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre, and the trio&apos;s legal team, they were met by roars of approval from waiting men carrying Liverpool scarves and shirts emblazoned with Liverbirds. It was a curious sight but a wholly appropriate one given the momentous victory that had just been achieved. Unrelenting despair has come to characterise this once mighty football establishment but after events at the high court today, Kopites can truly start dreaming of better times to come. That is because after a case spreading over two days and taking in more than six hours of legal arguments, Mr Justice Floyd has ruled that Liverpool&apos;s current owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, can no longer continue with their attempts to block a sale of the club, most likely to New England Sport Ventures, owners of the Boston Red Sox, who had a \u00a3300m bid for the club accepted last week before Hicks and Gillett tried to derail the process by replacing Purslow and Ayre with two of their own cohorts. The case against Hicks and Gillett was not actually brought by Liverpool, but instead by the Royal Bank of Scotland, who are owed close to \u00a3235m by the Americans, the deadline for which expires this Friday. They deemed the actions of the pair as a breach of an agreement signed in April, which gave them the finances to extend their control at Anfield in exchange for an agreement that the Americans would allow Broughton, appointed by RBS, to see through a sale of the club within six months. &quot;Breathtaking arrogance&quot; was how Richard Snowden QC, representing RBS, characterised the conduct of Hicks and Gillett in trying to block the sale of Liverpool to NESV. It was &quot;as clear a breach of contract as you will ever see&quot; he went on to say yesterday in a packed Court 16, where the case initially started. During the course of that day, a catalogue of counter evidence was heard which turned this already stupefying sporting saga into one of even greater drama and intrigue. Paul Girolami QC, representing Hicks and Gillett, admitted they had breached their sales agreement with RBS but claimed they only did so because Broughton, Purslow and Ayre, the other members of Liverpool&apos;s five-man board, had overlooked two other offers for the club, from the Singapore billionaire Peter Lim and Mill Financial, a US hedge fund which is understood to have assumed control of Gillett&apos;s stake in the club. Girolami accused the &quot;English directors&quot; of excluding Hicks and Gillett from the sales process and creating their very own sub-committee, which they were accused of referring to in emails as &quot;the home team.&quot; This accusation, among many other put forward by Girolami, was dismissed not only by Snowden but also Lord Grabiner QC, the much-experienced, much-respected and, at times, amusing representative for Liverpool. He claimed the &quot;home team&quot; reference was simply the name of a conference call line the board used to speak to bidders and described Hicks and Gillett as &quot;slippery&quot; for attempting to adjourn a meeting to discuss the NESV offer by a week knowing full-well that the group, headed by John W Henry, wanted an answer to their proposal by last Friday. All this took the case into another day and into the smaller Court 18. &quot;It&apos;s as packed as the Kop&quot; remarked one observer pressed up against the wall as Justice Floyd summarised the case and prepared to give his verdict. It duly arrived at about 10.40am when the judge granted RBS a mandatory injunction against Hicks and Gillett, preventing them from again trying to restructure the club&apos;s board and meaning Purslow and Ayre were back on it. He also threw out an attempt by the Americans to have an interim injunction placed on the board as well as ruling that they should pay the court costs for both RBS and the Liverpool board. Lord Grabiner estimates those costs will be between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000. In a final kick for Hicks and Gillett, who took over at Liverpool in February 2007 with promises of building a new stadium and ploughing millions into the club before reneging on both of those promises, their QC was advised by Floyd that it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; of them to appeal the ruling. They may, however, still decided to do so. What now? Well, Broughton will reconvene a board meeting for 8pm this meeting for which, he stated clearly afterwards, Hicks and Gillett, are &quot;certainly invited&quot;. That meeting is likely to confirm the sale of the club to NESV and it is hoped that the sale, which will clear the club&apos;s \u00a3200m-plus debts, can go through before Friday&apos;s deadline with RBS. All this begins to lift the dark, spreading cloud that has hung over Liverpool for over a year now. It also means they are unlikely to go into administration - the heaviest cost should Hicks an Gillett have won - and, as such, avoid a potentially devastating nine point penalty, which would have seen them go into Sunday&apos;s Merseyside derby against Everton bottom of the league on minus three points. There is no great evidence to suggest that NESV will be any better for Liverpool than Hicks and Gillett were but they cannot be any worse. Little wonder then that the supporters who gathered inside and outside the High Court today were so relieved to hear that the owners could no longer block a sale of the club, which it was widely accepted they were only doing in order to minimise their own individual financial losses and not, as they argued in court, for the benefit of the club they have seen to ruin. Fighting their actions throughout have been Broughton, Purslow and Ayre, who up to today have all been treated with great suspicion by Liverpool supporters. No more, however. &quot;We love you Martin, we do&quot; they chanted as the trio departed down Fleet Street. It was that type of day."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/oct/13/liverpool-martin-broughton-hicks-gillett", "sentences": ["The offers, from NESV, owners of the Boston Red Sox, and the Singapore businessman Peter Lim, both proposed repaying RBS that debt, since refinanced for a series of further short periods, now up to \u00a3200m."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-13T18:23:20Z", "title": "Martin Broughton comes out roaring after quiet man saves Liverpool", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Football", "Sport", "Business", "Business"], "article": "Throughout the grim course since the 1990s of English football clubs being bought by &quot;owners&quot; for personal enrichment, contrary to the game&apos;s time-honoured tradition that directors should be &quot;custodians&quot;, none have been served with the wallop meted out today to Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Beaming on the steps of the high court, Liverpool&apos;s chairman, Martin Broughton, declaring himself &quot;delighted&quot;, said: &quot;Justice has been done.&quot; He repeated what he has said for a week, that the club&apos;s American owners committed &quot;flagrant abuses of undertakings&quot; when they tried to sack Christian Purslow, Liverpool&apos;s managing director, and Ian Ayre, the commercial director, and oppose the board&apos;s agreed sale to New England Sports Ventures. Broughton said the fact the judge, Mr Justice Floyd, agreed, ruling that Hicks and Gillett committed &quot;the clearest possible breach&quot; of their agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland, had won Broughton, Purslow and Ayre their case. The chairman emphasised again how damaging the Americans&apos; leveraged [debt-based] buyout had been for the club Hicks and Gillett bought in February 2007 with \u00a3185m borrowed from Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 repayable in only 12 months \u2013 then loaded on the club to service. The offers, from NESV, owners of the Boston Red Sox, and the Singapore businessman Peter Lim, both proposed repaying RBS that debt, since refinanced for a series of further short periods, now up to \u00a3200m. &quot;The vital thing is that all the offers have wiped out all the acquisition debt,&quot; Broughton said. &quot;That puts the club on a sound financial footing.&quot; That, of course, is the burden which dare not speak its name at Manchester United, where Sir Alex Ferguson and the chief executive, David Gill, maintain the stance, wholly contradicted by Broughton, that huge debt \u2013 \u00a3769m in United&apos;s case \u2013 does no damage to a football club. Hicks and Gillett, watching Broughton, Purslow and Ayre approve a sale, will lose the money they loaned to Liverpool which, according to the chairman Broughton, amounts to \u00a3140m. That suggests one of the holding companies, Kop Football, which owes the \u00a3200m to RBS, is the company being sold, not solely the football club. This is not the exit Hicks and Gillett foresaw when they bought into Liverpool and the Premier League&apos;s expanding TV revenues which Hicks, in particular, spoke of so eagerly at the time. That loss, and the sale of their shares in the club for nothing rather than the fat profit they envisaged, has been wrought by Broughton, the blue-chip chairman who kept his counsel for months, then came out fighting so defiantly last week. During the quiet time, Broughton&apos;s silence sowed doubt. He is a Chelsea fan, and as the chairman of British Airways and previously British American Tobacco (BAT), not the most obviously sympathetic figure to the Anfield faithful. Very little information was released about what he and Barclays Capital, appointed to find a buyer for Liverpool, were actually doing. Fans winced during the embarrassments of the deals that never were, fronted by the Hong Kong wheeler-dealer Kenneth Huang and the Syrian-Canadian former pizza shop proprietor, Yahya Kirdi. It was also difficult to understand what boardroom sources meant when they insisted Broughton, Purslow and Ayre had the right to outvote Hicks and Gillett in a decision over a sale. Sure, they had a board majority, but directors can normally only recommend a deal to shareholders, which, as half-each owners of Liverpool, the American pair could surely reject. Last Tuesday the quiet man finally showed his mettle. Despite worldwide attention and relentless prodding from the media and fans, Broughton and Purslow had managed to negotiate with NESV and Lim without a leak. Purslow observed, as many serious business people do, that the deals which are concluded are usually ones nobody talked publicly about beforehand. With the NESV deal agreed and Hicks and Gillett having sought to block it by sacking Purslow and Ayre and replacing them with Hicks&apos;s own son, Mack, and Mack&apos;s assistant, Lori Kay McCutcheon, Broughton took the strategic decision to go to court, and go public. Suddenly he was on television, radio, on a conference call with journalists and even giving Hicks and Gillett a mauling on Liverpool&apos;s official website. Broughton revealed what we had not been told earlier: he had not taken on the job of becoming Liverpool&apos;s chairman, getting the club sold and relieved of its appalling debt, without having the power he required. He had insisted Hicks and Gillett give the undertaking to RBS that only Broughton had the right to appoint and remove directors, and that they would not obstruct a &quot;reasonable&quot; sale process. Saying, straightforwardly, what everybody has known since they breached their promises to build a new stadium and not load debt on Liverpool, that Hicks and Gillett had &quot;no credibility,&quot; Broughton said: &quot;I was not prepared to be their patsy.&quot; They now know that he meant what he said. Amid the absorbing drama which erupted this week, it was revelatory to watch a businessman of Broughton&apos;s quality operating in football. This is a sport whose most garlanded administrator is Sir David Richards, the chairman of the Premier League and FA vice-chairman, who formerly ran a small engineering company which went bust in 2001 and whose club, Sheffield Wednesday, are now in League One, saddled with much the same \u00a320m debt Richards landed them with when he was chairman. This is an emerging change in the Premier League: the presence of business people of a higher calibre than those traditionally involved. Chief executives such as Ivan Gazidis, at Arsenal, seem to understand what a football club is, that it is not &quot;just a business like any other&quot;, the spivvy Thatcherite philistinism which dominated through the 1990s. Broughton, who has run a company with as dubious a moral purpose as BAT, has stated that a football club is different, and that debt is bad for it. Purslow is known to have watched approvingly Arsenal&apos;s &quot;fanshare&quot; initiative aimed at giving supporters an ownership stake in the club, and at the weekend he said: &quot;I&apos;ve asked [NESV] to consider a scheme at our club that will give our fans a real sense of ownership, a real sense of inclusion, the kind of voice they deserve and NESV have told us they&apos;ll look at this very seriously if they complete.&quot; Liverpool&apos;s supporter groups, strangely credulous when Hicks and Gillett rode into town, before waking up and mounting spirited campaigns, must now show themselves to be partners for peace time, to play a part \u2013 perhaps including raising money as ShareLiverpoolFC always promised \u2013 in decision-making. It may be too much to hope that Broughton&apos;s victory might usher in a more enlightened future not just for Liverpool but for football clubs more generally. The culture is surely set: owners will expect to make money for themselves, by seeing the value of their club increase. But this better-educated breed of businessman seems to understand they must do so over the long term, by nurturing their clubs and working with supporters, by cherishing the game&apos;s traditions and heritage, as Hicks and Gillett promised and spectacularly failed to do at Liverpool. Many false dawns have cast shadows over optimism, but justice was done today, so the reformers will allow themselves to dream."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/13/viewpoint-standard-chartered", "sentences": ["Sceptics, however, say Standard Chartered would have little difficulty in jumping the queue at the cash machine if Basel eventually provokes a round of capital-raisings \u2013 its management is highly regarded and it has a supportive 18% shareholder in the form of Temasek of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-13T19:55:15Z", "title": "Standard buys a brolly when the sun is shining - and that's a good thing", "tags": ["Business", "Standard Chartered"], "article": "Standard Chartered would not be most people&apos;s top suspect as a bank likely to cite the Basel 3 arrangements as a reason to tap shareholders for cash in a hurry.

And Basel 3 doesn&apos;t arrive until 2019, which allows time to add padding to reserves via everyday lending. Yet Standard Chartered insisted the Basel capital regime, when combined with opportunities to lend in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, is the reason for raising \u00a33.26bn via a rights issue. Is the claim credible? Actually it is, despite widespread scepticism. It is true that Basel 3 is a gentle piece of work. But there are two clauses that could yet bite. So-called systemically important banks will have to hold an extra layer of capital (size yet to be decided) and regulators can impose a &quot;countercyclical buffer&quot; (of up to 2.5%) when the financial weather turns threatening. Sceptics, however, say Standard Chartered would have little difficulty in jumping the queue at the cash machine if Basel eventually provokes a round of capital-raisings \u2013 its management is highly regarded and it has a supportive 18% shareholder in the form of Temasek of Singapore. Perhaps, they say, chief executive Peter Sands has another motive for accepting the dilution from issuing more shares. Perhaps he has his eye on an acquisition \u2013 maybe Nedbank in South Africa. We shall see. For now, Sands deserves the benefit of the doubt. His shares have almost trebled in value since March 2009. The opportunity to remove the Basel risk, however slight, is there now. If the west&apos;s slowing economies hit the east next year, he would look dumb to have let the moment pass. OK, he would also look silly in a year or two if Standard Chartered finds itself with too much capital and a collection of angry shareholders demanding a return of the surplus.

They still hope to conclude the deal with NESV. Please share your thoughts below or via email or on Twitter.  8.46am: Good morning from Steve. Well, there were some people on the pitch yesterday, they thought it was all over...but, far from it, it turns out. We&apos;ll be tag-teaming on this desk a little this morning (I have to go to the dental hospital), but we will keep you up with all developments. Because this is a can&apos;t-put-down-page-turning-cliff-hanger. You would not believe - or maybe you would - the number of emails I have received from people hitting the refresh button every twenty seconds until the early hours of the morning, or clearly unable to focus on work because of events. My favourite was this:   I had to meet a pension broker today and i had your MBM on the whole way through as i was like Homer Simpson all i was hearing from him was Bla Bla bla.  Just in case the pension broker is also reading this blog (but not during meetings), I&apos;ll spare the name of this Scouser.  9.08am: Owen Gibson, who was up half the night following the extraordinary developments, has this to say today:  Liverpool and NESV will challenge the injunction and aim to have it thrown out. But the big question is whether they will be able to do that before the weekend. Even though they think it completely without foundation, they are taking it seriously because none of the named parties want to end up in contempt of a US court. But both the board and NESV remain committed to the deal for now. RBS argued in court that they needed a quick decision to avoid possibility of administration - what will they do now that the sale will not be complete before 15th? My feeling is they will stick it out but it leaves them in a less clear cut, more tricky position. As far as NESV go, Henry is in town and his partner Tom Werner arrives today - they had hoped to hold a press conference to announce their purchase. What will they do now? Will their frustration at the endless obstacles return? And will Lim take encouragement from events overnight? We also need to look at the other supposed rival bids named by Hicks in the petition - as David Conn has already pointed out, there is a certain flaky-ness to them. Some are suspected to have been &quot;stalking horses&quot; persuaded to come forward by Hicks to up the price. As far as Hicks&apos; end game goes, I can only summise he has nothing left to lose and is effectively daring RBS to push the button on admin, so perhaps reopening the sale process and achieving a higher price. And trying to embarrass RBS and the directors in the process - seems to me he really does believe he has suffered a huge injustice.  And now we are back in the territory where this story will be played out with an eight hour time difference...  (So those who wondered why Owen was looking so grim in that picture on the court steps yesterday, maybe it was just that he had an inkling that this wasn&apos;t over yet)       9.21am: Sorry to leave you with everything up in the air, but I really do have to go to the dental hospital. My colleagues, James Dart, Owen Gibson and Sachin Nakrani  will be covering. Every twist and turn will be covered here....  9.55am: James here. Just taking a selection of your views from below the line: \u2022 &quot;I don&apos;t know much about legal documents, but I looked at the PDF of the restraining order and the fact that Ian Ayre&apos;s name is spelled &apos;Ayer&apos; and Gillett&apos;s name as &apos;Gillette&apos; suggests that this was not drafted with the kind of attention to detail that will prevent it from being easily overturned by half a million quid&apos;s worth of lawyers&quot; - milkymoon. \u2022 &quot;BBC Breakfast were refering to Liverpool as &apos;we&apos; quite a bit this morning. Apparently they must be a national treasure of significance to all of us in this country. Many clubs have been through much worse than Liverpool, so spare me all the hand-wringing&quot; - SirBevois. \u2022 &quot;The only way this saga could get more enthralling is if it were set in a Texas courthouse. Preferably with Rafa bursting in at the last minute with a grubby bit of A4 to present his &apos;facts&apos;&quot; - juncopartner.  10am: According to the BBC sports editor, David Bond, NESV will not be put off its takeover of Liverpool by Hicks/Gillett&apos;s latest Texas hold&apos;up tactic. &quot;He is prepared to wait for the order to be lifted,&quot; says Bond. &quot;Sources tell me he has binding agreements.&quot; Those sources sound a little like Henry himself, yesterday, who said (albeit before the last-ditch injunction): &quot;NESV has a binding agreement in place with the board of Liverpool FC and we are looking forward to concluding the deal.&quot;  10.10am: Ah, here we go: it&apos;s the Judge Jim Jordan website.             10.11am: Meet the Judge ...  10.30am: Love them (unlikely) or hate them, were we really so surprised that Hicks and Gillett had an eleventh-hour, last-ditch manouevre, in place? Anyway, here&apos;s the latest from the Liverpool Echo:  A LFC legal challenge to the American co-owner&apos;s dramatic Texas restraining order obtained last night is expected to be heard in the next 24 hours. Lawyers for the Reds were locked in complex discussions until 3am today deciding how to deal with the latest challenge from by Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Today Liverpool FC were said to be confident they would overcome a lawsuit seeking $1.6b damages from the English directors at Anfield - Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow, Ian Ayre and Philip Nash \u2013 along with lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and successful Liverpool bidders New England Sports Ventures (NESV) \u2013 claiming they were undervaluing the price of the club and disregarding other, allegedly higher, offers. The Echo understands the defiant English board members remain confident they will push through a deal with NESV. This morning solicitors for the Reds were hoping to have the matter listed in the High Court in London &quot;as a matter of urgency&quot; to obtain an injunction overturning the lawsuit. And the Echo understands to completely veto the move they must ask for a similar hearing at a court in America. Once that happens Liverpool can be sold to NESV for \u00a3300m.        10.40am: This from the BBC&apos;s excellent Dan Roan: &quot;Tom Werner, Henry&apos;s NESV partner was about to board flight to London ahead of big unveiling tmrw - Hicks bombshell meant he stayed at home.&quot;       10.44am: Steve back. So, Tom Werner&apos;s not coming over yet. That would make sense. I have a huge backlog of emails that i&apos;ll work through and share with you. Plus any further developments as they happen.  10.50am: Fascinating short blogpost from the BBC&apos;s Robert Peston, which argues that Mill Financial might actually be in the box seat:  Royal Bank of Scotland tells me that if it&apos;s true that Mill has taken the Hicks/Gillett shares and if Mill repays the \u00a3200m long-term debt owed by Liverpool FC (plus penalty fees) to RBS and Wachovia, then Mill is in the driving seat. Once the debt is repaid, RBS&apos;s power ends.  As bizarre as this may seem, it also makes a lot of sense. Mill took over \u00a375m worth of Gillett&apos;s stake/debt when he defaulted. So, in a sense, they already own a chunk of the club/debt. We are endeavouring to find out more about Mill Financial. Thanks to all of you who have already sent over information about them. Please feel free to send more.  10.56am: Stephen S Henry (not sure whether the initial is a new Red Sox-inspired affectation) forwards an email which, I imagine, is similar to many that have been sent:  Dear Judge Jordan, You must be aware of the Judgement issued at the High Court London only yesterday regarding this matter yet you have taken it upon yourself to issue an injunction under US Law that is inappropriate, inflammatory and confrontational. I respectfully ask you to take this opportunity to explain what jurisdiction you believe you have in this case and what right you have to involve the US Courts in this matter. Yours respectfully, Stephen S Henry   11.01am: Why did the US judge grant H&amp;G an injunction? Well, one simple answer is that he was asked to. He has only heard one side of the case so far, but will hear the RBS/Liverpool side. The big question is timescale. One Liverpoolfc.tv forum reader, Roshi98,  also has this:  Just thought I&apos;d use the fabulous interwebs to dig up some info on the amazing Judge Jim Jordan, whose breathtaking arrogance in approving an injunction from a little known district court in Texas has thrown a small bit of uncertainty to an otherwise done deal with NESV. In 2008 the good judge received beaucoup funding for his failed campaign to win a seat on the Texas Supreme Court (yes, in Texas SC justices are VOTED into office). One organization caught my eye - K&amp;L Gates LLP. Why? Because they provided Mr. Jordan with $10K in campaign contributions. One of the head partners for K&amp;L Gates LLP is one Vester Hughes. Mr. Hughes shares multiple board seatings at various organizations with one Tom Hicks. Examples are: Dallas Civic Leaders CouncilCooper InstituteDallas Museum of Art   11.06am: Liverpool and Royal Bank of Scotland are to return to the High Court at 2pm this afternoon. More on this when we know more....  11.21am: Sachin Nakrani tries to unpick where each of the main factions go from here: &quot;What next for this saga&apos;s principal factions? LFC board, H&amp;G, NESV, Lim, Mill Financial, RBS.&quot;       11.24am: &quot;#LFC and #RBS in High Court [at 2pm] to injunct against Hicks&apos;s restraining order. They claim a Texas court has no jurisdiction over UK company law,&quot; tweets Bloomberg&apos;s @tariqpanja  11.29am: The Mirror reports that Liverpool have &quot;appointed lawyers in Dallas this morning to file a counter claim in the Dallas court as soon as business begins there, moving to have the restraining order removed.&quot; Presumably, LFC are exploring all legal avenues, given that they are due in the High Court in London at 2pm too.  11.37am: Given that Forbes&apos; valuation of Liverpool is an element of the US injunction claim, the Red And White Kop website has put some serious work into this analysis of how the figure was calculated: &quot;Here&apos;s how the Forbes guys royally screwed up their $822M Valuation (\u00a3515M)&quot;. The most stunning revelation in this piece is that Forbes&apos;s calculation of Liverpool&apos;s value does not include the club&apos;s debt. (Thanks to @H_T84 for tweeting that).  11.44am: Mill Financial has now taken over Tom Hicks&apos;s shares, according to the Liverpool Echo.  It is being claimed the American based Hedge Fund has acquired all of Tom Hicks&apos; shares to go along with those of George Gillett, which it already owned. It is further claimed that if they repay all outstanding loans to RBS before the set deadline, they will by default become the new owners of LFC, nudging out New England Sports Ventures. However the Echo understands the move would not signal Hicks and Gillett returning to ascendancy in the battle for the Reds. Instead it is believed Mill Financial, in turn owned by Springfield Financial who have links with the Washington Redskins American Football team, may be acting on behalf of another, as yet unnamed and unknown group who have put themselves in a position to move in at the 11th hour and take over the club.   11.54am: The Liverpool Echo also speculates that Kenny Huang could be involved.  12.01pm: In what would be an interesting sting in the tail for Hicks and Gillett, supporters on the Liverpoolfc.tv website are proposing a Class Action against H&amp;G.  12.13pm: Here&apos;s a view that some Liverpool fans won&apos;t necessarily like, emailed by Bob Boxwell:  I&apos;m a Red Sox fan so I hope Henry doesn&apos;t do this deal \u2013 the Sox need him fully focused \u2013 but that aside, it all seems like some nationalist fist pumping and gate storming you&apos;d expect from a banana republic. The &quot;Board&quot; can&apos;t just sell at way below market value because they don&apos;t like Hicks et al (though granted, there&apos;s a lot not to like there). And they&apos;re selling to more Americans, no less. You couldn&apos;t make this stuff up. What do you suppose FIFA is thinking right now watching all this stuff? I bet Blatter&apos;s buying a copy of Fodor&apos;s Visit Moscow. UK football is out of control.   12.16pm: Mill Financial are not mentioned in the court papers filed in Texas (points out Matt Young via email). Page 2 Paragraph 2 of the petition:   &quot;Based on the arguments of the verified petition and the arguments of counsel, the Court further finds that Liverpool FC is owned - through the various plaintiffs - ultimately by Thomas O Hicks and George Gillett.&quot;   12.21pm: Many of you are asking below the line and via email about the status of the Fit and Proper Person test with regards to Mill Financial&apos;s position. We are trying to get some answers on that. Imran Zaffar asks: How did Hicks pass his own shares into the ownership of Mill Financial given the fact there is a restraining order against the sale? If Hicks has passed over ownership to Mill Financial, then he has no link to the club and therefore the Texas ruling cannot stand [unless Mill Financial are Texas residents, and they brought about the injunction].  12.25pm: Why are the Board back in the High Court at 2pm if they are now facing an injunction in Texas? The belief is that the Board could get a UK court ruling that the injunction should not stand. Although this might not bind the Dallas court, it could be used to persuade the Texas judge to lift the injunction.       12.29pm: &quot;Hicks Dallas lawyer: &quot;Anyone ignoring a restraining order in Texas does so at their peril&quot;,&quot; tweets the Telegraph&apos;s Paul Kelso.  12.30pm: Responses to Red Sox fan from Mark Baker:  What relevance does Bob Boxwell&apos;s comment have? The issue here isn&apos;t about screwing over H&amp;G or the board selling at way below market value. It is about RBS wanting the loan repaid as H&amp;G defaulted on the loan as far back as April. H&amp;G signed up for this and like when any other business venture goes south, will have to pay the financial consequences.  and Ryan Moss:  The Board are acting in the best interests of the club, that is to avoid administration which would be disastrous for the club and its current league standing. The club is not being undervalued with all things considered. However, I too do not think that the sale to NESV is the best course of action. Have LFC learned nothing? On the basis that Mr Lim&apos;s bid is legal then I&apos;d be cheering his corner if I were in that board room.  and Clive Rowlandson:  Can we just kill the &apos;below market value&apos; thing once and for all. &apos;Market Value&apos; is what the market is prepared to pay and despite 130 parties contacting the club no-one has been prepared to pay more than the \u00a3300m - \u00a3320m from NESV or Lim. Otherwise RBS would have bitten their hands off   12.32pm: Many people have emailed to say how upsetting it is to see Hicks and Gillett at the top of this blog every time they refresh the page. Leigh Cocker emails this link to help people channel their frustration. (Disclaimer: This website in no way condones violence).  12.35pm: Updates from the BBC&apos;s Robert Peston:   RBS feels its hands would be tied if \u00a3200m were to turn up in its accounts from Mill Financial... ...So the race is on to see who can get the \u00a3200m into RBS&apos;s coffers faster - NESV or Mill? After months of fearing they&apos;d never get their money back, RBS must be laughing all the way to the...   12.50pm: The Fit and Proper Person test: Owen Gibson analyses the current situation:  In the wake of the meltdown at Portsmouth and the travails of Liverpool, the Premier League introduced new rules on ownership. Last June, a new fit and proper persons test required anyone with a shareholding of more than 30% to show they had no unspent criminal convictions for a string of &quot;honesty&quot; offences. Anyone with a stake of more than 10% must be declared publicly and ultimate ownership revealed. This summer, it introduced three other new rules as below: 1. Means and abilities testA prospective new owner must provide future financial information to show the projected financial position of the club should a takeover go through. A prospective new owner must also show proof of funds to prove they can sustain the club for the year ahead. 2. Meeting new ownersThe Premier League Board will have the power to request a meeting with any person proposing to acquire control of a club. 3. HMRC reportingThe Premier League Board can request quarterly information from each club showing that they are up-to-date with payments to HMRC in respect of PAYE and National Insurance As far as Liverpool goes, the Premier League are understood to be &quot;two thirds&quot; of the way to passing NESV. They have met the new owners, who have passed the directors test. They have yet to formally approve the so-called &quot;means and abilities&quot; test that involves providing proof of funds and forward looking financial information for the coming year but do not believe it will pose a problem. They have received no approach from Mill Financial and will not begin any other checks until the mists have cleared.    12.58pm: Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks remains in control of his share of the club and has not sold out to Mill Financial, Press Association Sport reports.   Reports this morning suggested the hedge fund, a branch of Washington-based Springfield Financial, had acquired the Texan&apos;s 50% share having already taken ownership of his fellow co-owner George Gillett&apos;s half. However, a UK-based spokesman for Tom Hicks told Press Association Sport Mill Financial had not acquired Hicks&apos; shares.        Mr Justice Floyd. What will he say this afternoon? Picture: Gary Lee/UPPA    1.01pm: &quot;Are H&amp;G not in contempt of court by going and getting the injunction in the US? Seems to me that Judge Floyd is going to give them a rocket this afternoon at the very least for not revealing that they were planning on taking action in the US.&quot; asks Mark Teuten via email.  1.17pm: A spokesman for Tom Hicks has confirmed to my colleague Andy Hunter that the stake has NOT been sold to Mill Financial.       1.40pm: This story is still moving fast, and the protagonists are expected back in court at 2pm, but here is a recap of today so far: \u2022 Just as the Liverpool board were hoping to sell the club to New England Sports Ventures last night, Hicks and Gillett obtained a temporary injunction in a Dallas court, claiming $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) in damages and calling the sale an &quot;epic swindle&quot;. The restraining order appears to prevent a sale taking place before the hearing on 25 October. \u2022 The Liverpool board has vowed to overturn the injunction. Lawyers are understood to have been appointed in Texas in order to do this. \u2022 The Liverpool board and the Royal Bank of Scotland will return to the High Court at 2pm. It is believed that the board hope that Mr Justice Floyd will rule that the injunction should not overrule his ruling yesterday, but a further hearing in Dallas may still be needed. \u2022 There was much speculation that US hedge fund Mill Financial has bought out Tom Hicks&apos;s stake in the club (it already controls George Gillett&apos;s), but this has been denied. \u2022 &quot;What next for this saga&apos;s principal factions? LFC board, H&amp;G, NESV, Lim, Mill Financial, RBS.&quot; Sachin Nakrani tries to unpick where each of the main factions go from here. \u2022 NESV continues to be the board&apos;s preferred bidder, but one of its top executives, Tom Werner, who was due to fly to England today has decided to wait in the US. \u2022 &quot;Tom Hicks and George Gillett cannot accept Liverpool rules have changed,&quot; says Owen Gibson  1.48pm: In response to the 12.29pm quote from a Texas lawyer, Simon Just emails to say: &quot;I&apos;d be more frightened by an annoyed bunch of scousers any day than a restraining order issued in haste in Texas !!&quot; Along similar lines, The Wall Street Journal carried this piece a couple of weeks ago: &quot;A Texas Tycoon Learns a Lesson: Don&apos;t Mess With Liverpudlians.&quot;  1.56pm: Back in court 18. Less packed than yesterday, reports Sachin Nakrani.  2.01pm: Mr Justice Floyd is in the house. Lord Grabiner QC is there again, representing the board, although there is no sign of the board members themselves.  2.04pm: QC Snowden speaking for RBS: This hearing is the result of &quot;extraordinary events yesterday&quot;.  2.06pm: QC Snowden speaking for RBS: &quot;Texas court appearts to have been told remarkably little about yesterday&apos;s verdict. This is the most outrageous abuse of process.&quot;  2.07pm: Liverpool fans who are planning to launch a counter claim Class Action against H&amp;G have set up a Facebook page.  2.09pm: Back to court 18, QC Snowden speaking for RBS: &quot;Proceedings in Texas are inappropriate. It involves an English football club and three English companies. It is intended to frustrate.&quot;  2.14pm: QC Snowden speaking for RBS: &quot;Judge made verdict in Texas on basis of no evidence and solely on what was told to him.&quot; It is claimed that H&amp;G tried at the Dallas injunction appeal to make sure that it could not be contested in the High Court in London. But the Texas judge did not agree to that, Sachin texts from outside court 18.  2.20pm: QC Snowden speaking for RBS: Accuses H&amp;G of preparing injunction request before yesterday&apos;s verdict here and anger that it was not disclosed during the trial by H&amp;G legal team in the High Court. BBC&apos;s Dan Roan tweets: &quot;H&amp;G&apos;s lawyers haven&apos;t turned up&quot;  2.28pm: While we wait for Sachin to next get a chance to step outside court and update, here is some legal opinion from Quentin Bargate, Senior Partner of the City of London law firm Bargate Murray:   What struck me as most unusual was that the proceedings already taking place before the High Court in London merit only a passing reference in paragraph 53 of the petition...More surprisingly, I can find no reference in the Temporary Restraining Order made by the court in Dallas to the &quot;British Court&quot; decision at all. The court asserts it has jurisdiction without, it would seem, considering the possible impact of its order upon the already extant proceedings in London and whether the Dallas court should accordingly decline jurisdiction in favour of the High Court proceedings \u2013 where Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett may well have raised similar points already. In short, it would appear that Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett&apos;s legal team decided against the option of seeking permission to appeal from the Court of Appeal, or decided that process would not yield a result in time and instead have attempted to take a second bite at the cherry in a different jurisdiction. Clearly, the Dallas court agrees that they were entitled to do so, at least for the time being. So in essence, we have two diametrically opposing decisions of superior courts in England and the US based on essentially the same subject matter. It will be interesting to see what the High Court in London makes of all this...  Let&apos;s hope we find out soon...  2.32pm: &quot;Just received statement from Peter Lim - he is pulling out of bidding!&quot; tweets BBC&apos;s Dan Roan.             2.35pm: For those who think that this is a bit like a bad episode of a long-running US soap opera about the rich and powerful in a certain US state.... &quot;Does that mean I&apos;ll go into the shower and find that David Moores is still in charge with Graeme Souness as manager?&quot; asks Stephen Cottrell.  2.45pm: Back to Sachin outside court 18: QC Snowden speaking for RBS: Only one par in H&amp;G injunction appeal refers high court case and even that is incorrect as it says Martin Broughton was restored to the board. In fact only Purslow and Ayre were. &quot;This is a grossly inappropriate summary.&quot; Witness statement from Martin Broughton reveals the board were close to agreeing deal with NESV at last night&apos;s meeting. Appears the Texas injunction stalled the process.  2.54pm: &quot;Dare we ask RBS to loan us QC Snowden for impact off the bench? Assuming it won&apos;t reconstitute our boredom,&quot; asked by Jackson Gothe-Snape by email.       2.58pm: AbyKopite\u200e tweets: &quot;Why does Peter Lim release his press statements when Liverpool are in court? #LFC&quot;       2.59pm: &quot;Court proceedings interrupted: it seems H&amp;G are currently in court in Dallas arguing Lfc board were in contempt of US court y&apos;day!&quot; tweets Dan Roan  3.02pm: QC Snowden speaking for RBS: Argues that an injunction granted in a foreign country should not be allowed to take force when companies involved are all English. Describes H&amp;G claim of &quot;epic swindle&quot; scurrilous.  3.05pm: Lord Grabiner QC now speaking for Liverpool: &quot;simply incredible&quot; that facts of this case were not revealed in Dallas court. &quot;They want second bite of cherry and if it wasn&apos;t so serious, it would be a joke.&quot;  3.10pm: Lord Grabiner QC for the board: Describes H&amp;G&apos;s actions as &quot;grotesque parody, preposterous, unfair, unjust. They are incorrigible&quot; He points out that H&amp;G signed up to this jurisdiction by getting into agreement with RBS and by agreeing to proceedings here. &quot;It is preposterous&quot; that they will simply go to another jurisdiction because they are not happy with the verdict. He says G&amp;H are probably &quot;sitting ang giggling&quot; at their behaviour right now.  3.14pm: A lawyer from Texas emails to say:  The Board need to go to the Texas court and file a Rule 12 Motion to Show Authority. Since the British High Court granted the board the right to conduct the affairs of the corporation(s), H&amp;G were therefore without authority to seek a Texas TRO on behalf of KOP Holdings, et al.   3.21pm: Peter Lim says he will not proceed with his bid because the board is intent on selling to NESV &quot;at the exclusion of all other parties...In these circumstances, I am not able to proceed with my intention to acquire the club.&quot; He added that &quot;if current events cause the circumstances to change, my interest in acquiring the club remains.&quot;  3.25pm: Here are the official documents that were lodged at Companies House for the reconstituted board. Always good for finding out people&apos;s strange middle names.  3.27pm: Lord Grabiner QC for the board: describes Dallas court as that &quot;world famous jurisdiction&quot; to much laughter. (Personally, I&apos;m not sure that they want to turn the jurisdiction debate into a fight with Dallas. Rather a simple question of primacy and priority).  3.32pm: Trying to find details of when the courts in Dallas open and when there might be some hearings.  The Dallas Morning News this morning reports:   Dallas businessman Tom Hicks persuaded a state judge to halt the sale of Liverpool Football Club on Wednesday and may have gained something new in the battle: home field advantage...State District Judge Jim Jordan agreed with the lawsuit&apos;s argument that the defendants have done enough business in North Texas to fall under a Dallas court&apos;s control.   3.40pm: Sachin from outside court 18: It is clarified by the board&apos;s legal team that they are looking for an order which lifts the owner&apos;s injunction. They also want an order which prevents owners from obtaining another injunction in any country except this one.  3.57pm: QC Chivers now speaking for NESV. It appears that G&amp;H may have no-one in this courtroom....  4.07pm: While we wait for another High Court update, let&apos;s revisit the debate about the picture at the top of this blog. It is clearly upsetting a lot of people (more emails and tweets than any other subject, believe it or not). Like it or not, it is the main point of today&apos;s story. I&apos;ve already offered this link to relieve the frustration. (Disclaimer: not condoning violence). Others suggest a picture caption competition. My web friend (who is enjoying the MBM really) Anthony O Connell says: Gillet let one go and Hicks is thinking to himself &quot;Thats a big smell for a small fella.&quot;  4.12pm: Back to outside court 18, where Lord Grabiner is speaking again: He says that the owners made no reference to damages claim during trial at High Court. Wrong then that they should make damages claim in Dallas.  4.15pm: Break in proceedings at the High Court. Mr Justice Floyd will reveal in a few minutes if he will make a decision today. Or tomorrow!  4.20pm: So, while we wait for the judge to return in London, here are, obviously, some picture caption suggestions: &quot;Hicks is saying to Gillet &quot;let&apos;s use a Texan Court&quot; Gillett is thinking that&apos;s wonderfully cunning.&quot; (Ian Collins) Hicks says to Gillett \u2013 &quot;Come on, sell me your share. Look, I&apos;ve got the money on me, honest!&quot; (Kevin Horsewood) Gillett just asked Hicks if he can borrow a couple of quid for a half-time pie. Hicks said &quot;only if you pay me back \u00a31 billion&quot; at full time. (Paul Sanderson) Gillett: &quot;Tom, old boy - meant to say, I forgot to make the downpayment on the new stadium. Have you got your cheque-book to hand?&quot;Hicks: &quot;Er...&quot;(Peter Tranter) Gillette: oh look \u2013 I think I can spot our last shred of credibility over there.Hicks: I&apos;ll need to put my glasses on...(Richard Kealey) Hicks to Gillett: Wanna see some dirty pictures of Rooney&apos;s wife?Gillett: Who?(Andy James) George this wallet feels a bit light\u2026.have we submitted our expenses yet?(Robert Bradshaw) There are so many of these pouring in that I will return to the caption competition tomorrow...  4.30pm: Apparently we&apos;re looking at a ruling by Mr Justice Floyd by 5pm.Sachin has confirmation that the owners have no legal team here. Their legal team were contacted and emailed back to say they would be out of the office all afternoon and would not be attending. Now there&apos;s some bare-faced cheek...  4.33pm: While we wait for that ruling, and while we have all been acting with one eye on RBS&apos;s 15 October deadline for debt repayments, how about this intriguing question: Is tomorrow&apos;s deadline irrelevant? Could it be that RBS cannot put Liverpool into administration tomorrow? Jill Treanor, our banking correspondent, writes:  The City is still poring over the restraining order issued last night by the Texan court and getting stuck on a single paragraph. It is there to be seen in the restraining order but is causing some confusion in City circles. To spell it out, at thebottom of page 5, reads.... &quot;the defendants and their officers, agents, servants, employees and attorneys.....are temporarily enjoined from engaging in the following acts;b) ...taking any action to modify, pledge, sell, transfer, seize, foreclose or dispose of Plantiffs ownership in Liverpool FC&quot;. Could this mean that even if RBS did want to call in its loan tomorrow night, when the \u00a3200m plus \u00a340m of penalty charges are due, that the Texan restraining order would stop it from doing so? RBS no doubt has lawyers trying to work that out right now.   4.43pm: Judge is back...  4.48pm: Mr Justice Floyd: It is plain that the owner&apos;s case in Texas had been in preparation for some considerable time  4.56pm: Mr Justice Floyd: describes summary of high court case in owner&apos;s petition to Dallas court as &quot;impoverished&quot;.  5.15pm: Still waiting on Mr Justice Floyd&apos;s decision...  5.21pm: Judge rules that anti-suit injunction wanted by RBS and other parties (board) against owner&apos;s action in Texas is granted. &quot;This case has nothing to do with Texas.&quot;  5.25pm: So, the board and RBS has won its London court battle. But, what exactly this means is another question. Will Hicks and Gillett now back off and withdraw their injunction?  This expert opinion from Mark Stephens, sports lawyer and international litigator at Finers Stephens Innocent:  The application for a TRO (injunction) in a Texas City court is one last, desperate, throw of the dice for Gillett &amp; Hicks reveals how bankrupt their legal position is...basic principles of international law are (1) that an injunction issued by a Texas Court has no effect on actions in this (the UK) country; and, (2) that the court first dealing with the case should be the only court dealing with the matter to the end. Therefore, the Texas court will have to relinquish control to the High Court in London...if Hicks and Gilett really wanted to stop this transaction they needed an injunction from the High Court in London and another against New England Sports Ventures in Boston where that company is located.  I confidently predict that RBS and the Directors will be able to shrug off this irksome litigation which seems calculated to delay the takeover which will ultimately be consumated.   5.30pm: Sachin Nakrani from outside court:   Good news for Liverpool but as yet we don&apos;t know what this really means. Likely that court in Texas will still have to recognise this verdict. But at moment it&apos;s Liverpool 2 Owners 1   5.36pm: Judge gives H&amp;G until 4pm tomorrow (London time) to comply with order...        5.38pm: Thanks for reading, commenting, emailing, tweeting today. This saga is still far from over... Will Liverpool&apos;s new Texan lawyers be able to make a Dallas court reconsider the injunction tonight? Do they need to? Will Hicks and Gillett abide by Mr Justice Floyd&apos;s ruling? Will NESV finally get to sign the papers and take over Liverpool Football Club? Most pressingly, will Royal Bank of Scotland press ahead with its plan to put Liverpool into administration by the end of play tomorrow if they have not been repaid (by new owners or by H&amp;G)?Evan Fanning will be taking over this liveblog for the evening. He will break any major developments here.  5.45pm: From Sachin Nakrani outside court:  Legal reps ask judge to shorten owners deadline so a takeover deal can be done by the weekend, but he refuses.  So the 4pm deadline tomorrow still stands. I thought lawyers played golf on Friday afternoon?       5.58pm: &quot;Hicks and Gillett need to withdraw the claim by 3pm UK time tomorrow for the NESV deal to go through tomorrow, NESV&apos;s lawyer said&quot; tweets Tariq Panja of Bloomberg.  6.03pm: &apos;If Hicks and Gillett don&apos;t comply by 4pm tomorrow they will be found to be in contempt of the UK court,&quot; says Sachin Nakrani outside the High Court. It was also stated in court that NESV are the new owners. We&apos;ve been here before though, haven&apos;t we?  6.07pm: Sky Sports News are reporting that there is a hearing in the court in Dallas taking place at 6pm UK time so that should be underway right now.       6.10pm: Owen Gibson has tweeted from outside the court: &quot;Judge accepted all of RBS&apos;s arguments - except plea that deadline be set for tonight. If H+G don&apos;t comply they will be in contempt.&quot;  6.13pm: The Hicks and Gillett court hearing in Dallas is now set for 7pm UK time, although Sky Sports News are reporting that it is underway and George Hicks, whoever he is, is in attendence. Rumours that Hicks was spotted in Texas singing the Warren Zevon song &apos;send lawyers, guns and money&apos; haven&apos;t been confirmed.  Is it any wonder they can&apos;t agree on anything when legal disputes are even breaking out on this blog ...  My name is Henry Adams and I am an international litigator at a firm called Birketts LLP. I acted for one of the parties in a recent leading English anti-suit injunction case which went to Court of Appeal level. I&apos;m also a Red but that&apos;s by the by. The comments on your blog from Mark Stephens are unfortunately not quite right. Here is the position: The Texan Court injunction is binding on the board et al in the UK, until the injunction there is lifted by the Texan Court. The anti-suit injunction is not an order against the Texan Court itself. Instead, it is effectively an order compelling H&amp;G to apply to the Texan Court to lift the injunction, on the basis that the Texan Court has no jurisdiction to determine this case. H&amp;G therefore face a choice: either they lift the injunction or be in contempt of the English Court anti-suit injunction, the punishment for which can include imprisonment. H&amp;G would most likely not want to return to the UK with contempt proceedings hanging over their heads. Hope that helps - fascinating scenario! Henry   6.31pm: Ed Graham has basically summed up the whole situation ...  So yesterday the English guys won in the English court; then the Americans won in the American court and blocked the English judge&apos;s decision (essentially). Then today the English guys won again in the English court and blocked the blocking of the English judge&apos;s decision. And now the Americans are fighting in the American court to block the blocking of the blocking of the English judge&apos;s decision. Can we guess who&apos;ll win that? How is this ever going to end?  We have a lawyer from Texas who seems to think he knows how it will end and that&apos;s with a massive cheque being written by an insurance company to Thomas O Hicks and George Gillett ...  The Texas TRO should be dissolved. One legal element of injunctive relief is that one must not have an &quot;adequate remedy at law&quot; (as opposed to equitable relief, which is what a restraining order involves). H&amp;G have an adequate remedy at law in that they can sue the directors for money for the breach of their fiduciary duty to the shareholders to sell the club at the highest price possible. The directors likely have several Directors&apos; and Officers&apos; insurance policies in place for just such contingencies, so for the Names at Lloyd&apos;s who underwrote those policies, it is, to quote Sir Alex, &quot;squeaky bum time.&quot; The sale goes through and somewhere down the road, Lloyd&apos;s writes two large checks to Hicks and Gillett (although the settlement will be confidential). Always get to the insurance.   6.38pm: It&apos;s been reported that John W Henry has just arrived at the offices of Slaughter and May in London, just as he did last night. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be bedding down for the evening there as they await news from Dallas. This really is Groundhog Day and we&apos;re all Bill Murray. Except for Sky Sports News&apos; Gary Cotterill. He&apos;s Ned Ryerson.  6.44pm: &quot;Interested to know where is David Moores in all these shennanigans,&quot; writes Andy Dunbar. &quot;I would love to know what his thoughts, views &amp; opinions are, after all he is the reason we are in this situation selling out to H&amp;G instead of DIC... hindsight is a wonderful thing..!&quot; I wonder if Rick Parry he should have done a little more research into Tom Hicks.  6.48pm: Keith Boundy has a question for any law-talking guys out there ... &quot;Even if Judge Jordan rules in favor of Hicks, they will still be in contempt of court when they set foot in the UK right? If we get to a stituation with the Dallas Court and London High Court at opposing ruling, given that this involves a foreign court, won&apos;t Liverpool be able to get this case in a Federal Court who may be less likely to be swayed than a judge soliciting campaign contributions?&quot;  6.55pm: There&apos;s a statement due on the official Liverpool website any minute now. Here is a snippet courtesy of the club&apos;s Twitter page ...      Liverpool Football Club statement going on official website now: Independent LFC Directors delighted with judge&apos;s verdict in court today  6.57pm: Here is that official Liverpool statement in full ...  Liverpool Football Club have tonight issued a statement following today&apos;s court hearing in London: The independent Directors of Liverpool Football Club are delighted with the verdict of Mr Justice Floyd in the High Court this afternoon which now requires Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett to withdraw their Texas restraining order by 4pm tomorrow. We are glad to have taken another important step towards completing the sale process.   7.13pm: Websites containing anything to do with Dallas law must be bemused as to why they have got so much traffic today. Colin Prudhoe has stumbled across something interesting however ... &quot;I&apos;ve been following all these events with much interest being a lifelong LFC fan. I was trying to find information about the infamous 160th Civil District Court in Dallas and came across an interesting document regards court jurisdiction: I am in no way or aim to be a lawyer, but it appears to me that the sentences in below, taken from the document at this link, indicate that as a ruling has already been issued in London, then the Dallas court had no legal right to issue the injunction yesterday?  District courts are courts of general jurisdiction. A constitutional amendment adopted effective in November 1985 amends Article V, Section 8 of the Texas Constitution, in pertinent part, as follows:  District Court jurisdiction consists of exclusive, appellate, and original jurisdiction of all actions, proceedings, and remedies, except in cases where exclusive, appellate, or original jurisdiction may be conferred by this Constitution or other law on some other court, tribunal, or administrative body. This provision, while it extends a district court&apos;s potential jurisdiction to &quot;all actions,&quot; also makes such jurisdiction relative in that the court&apos;s jurisdiction excludes any matters in which exclusive, appellate, or original jurisdiction is conferred by law upon some other court. For this reason, while one can speak of the &quot;general&quot; jurisdiction of a district court, the actual jurisdiction of any specific court will always be limited by the constitutional or statutory provisions that confer exclusive, original, or appellate jurisdiction on other courts serving the same county or counties.   7.16pm: &quot;It looks like the end for Hicks and Gillett, a great day!&quot; shouts Derek Rooney. That might be a little bit presumptuous - we were almost in this position yesterday - but as the Liverpool statement said: &quot;We are glad to have taken another important step towards completing the sale process.&quot;  7.19pm: Another question, this time from Richard Finch, but again it is beyond my intellect. Any lawyers out there?  &quot;According to Henry Adams (6:13) H&amp;G must apply to withdraw the injunction, rather than merely withdrawing the injunction. Is it possible H&amp;G apply to withdraw the injunction only to have the request declined, I ask because the injunction whiffs of the &quot;boys club&quot; alluded to at 11.01. This situation would alleviate H&amp;G of being in contempt of court in the UK and would create an interesting legal situation whereby both courts battle to determine jurisdiction rights. Is there a precedent for two courts wrangling over jurisdiction and if so how long would this take to resolve?&quot; It&apos;s all so complicated it&apos;s almost as if legal boffins have spent the past 200 years creating ever more elaborate ways of confusing ordinary folk so that their services are indispensable and they can charge whatever they want. But they wouldn&apos;t do that, would they?  7.30pm: It&apos;s time for the hourly (or so) recap on the situation ... \u2022 The High Court today issued an order against the legal action taken in Dallas last night by Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr\u2022 Hicks and Gillett have been given until 4pm tomorrow to withdraw their injuction otherwise they will be found in contempt of UK court\u2022 There is currently a hearingtaking place in Dallas\u2022 NESV claim they are now the owners of the club and BBC 5Live are stating that the deal could be done tonight\u2022 In the High Court today NESV lawyer David Chivers said the sale would go through once the Texas case is withdrawn. &quot;We are the owners,&quot; Chivers told the High Court. &quot;The owners from beyond the grave are seeking to exercise with their dead hand a continuing grip on this company.&quot; [Thanks to David Hannah for alerting me to this]  7.32pm: At least there are some law-talking guys reading this, one of whom has responded to Colin Prudhoe&apos;s earlier digging (7:13pm) ...  I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s not as simple as in your para at 7.13. The link you show refers to the district court&apos;s jurisdiction as between itself and other domestic courts. The complex rules that govern whether the Dallas court should have seised itself of jurisdiction is covered by private international law. The Dallas court granted its TRO in an ex parte hearing \u2013 which means Liverpool didn&apos;t have a chance to put their case forward. If they were there, Liverpool would have argued that Dallas should decline jurisdiction or stay its action on the grounds on forum non conveniens, that is, the English Court was much more suitable than the Dallas court and had, in any case, been first seised of the proceedings. Sorry for the latin, they still use it sometimes in law.        7.56pm:Last little update for now. Gillett is in London consulting with his lawyers. May be nothing left to consult about. We&apos;ll see, tweets Bloomberg&apos;s Tariq Panja.  I&apos;ve also been alerted to this article by Jason Cuthbert and Gary Thomas. It&apos;s a blog from the Dallas Observer which says Hicks and Gillet have filed a contempt of court motion in Dallas against the Liverpool board for violating last night&apos;s restraining order. Full article here.       8.00pm: Jim Boardman of www.anfieldroad.co.uk has tweeted: &quot;Five Live - Dan Roan: Sources close to NESV say they will get a hearing in Texas to get the Hicks injunction lifted in next few hours.&quot;  8.16pm: Breaking News ... Sky Sports News has reported that the Texas court has adjourned until 7am tomorrow morning Dallas time (1pm BST) - which is just three hours before the deadline set in the High Court today - and so there will be no decision on Hicks and Gillett&apos;s case until then. I guess this means the rumoured NESV hearing in Texas, which was said to be taking place over the next few hours, will now not go ahead.  8.29pm: I&apos;d just like to let you all know that I&apos;ve received an email from a deposed Iraqi King who I am helping remove \u00a325bn worth of gold bullion from the country. Once this has gone through - and I fully expect it will - he is going to split the proceeds down with me 50-50 at which point I will make my own bid for Liverpool. Just thought I&apos;d keep you all in the picture.  8.31pm: Martin Broughton has told Sky Sports News that he is hopeful that the sale to NESV will be completed tomorrow and that John W Henry will be at Sunday&apos;s Merseyside derby as owner of the club.       8.34pm: &quot;Told Texas hearing would take less than an hour. So NESV&apos;s takeover of #LFC may well go through tomorrow,&quot; tweets Tariq Panja  8.46pm: There seems to be some confusion over what exactly is going on in the court in Dallas (confusion in this story - never). I&apos;m not sure I can help much other than quote the passage below from the Dallas Observer&apos;s blog (courtesy of David Holden) ...  Robert is at the George Allen this very moment, where attorneys representing New England Sports Ventures and Kop Holdings (which is to say, Tom Hicks) are squaring off over who owns Liverpool FC. In light of the UK judge&apos;s ruling this morning, which basically tossed yesterday&apos;s temporary restraining order, the attorneys (and assorted media) have gathered to see what the judge will decide, since Hicks owes the Royal Bank of Scotland close to $500 million dollars by tomorrow. Right now, the judge is leaning toward a 7 a.m. hearing Friday to decide whether or not he will lift yesterday&apos;s TRO. Court is scheduled to reconvene shortly. Updates forthcoming. Update at 2:20 p.m.: Judge Jim Jordan has ordered all parties back in his courtroom at 7 a.m. tomorrow for an hour-long hearing, at which point he will decide whether or not to lift the TRO.   8.57pm: It may be tempting fate to say that we know where we stand for this evening at least, but tomorrow&apos;s case in Texas (which will begin at 1pm British time and is expected to last for one hour) will be where the next vital stage in this story takes places. David Turner QC feels that Liverpool&apos;s earlier statement (see 6:57pm) may be used by Hicks and Gillett to further their cause ...  You report Liverpool FC&apos;s statement as saying: &quot;We are glad to have taken another important step towards completing the sale process&quot;. That could be a major tactical error: paragraph (b) of the injunction granted in Dallas prohibited the taking of any steps towards completing the sale process. I had wondered whether H&amp;G might retaliate by asserting (in Dallas) that seeking the anti-suit injunction fell within the acts prohibited in Dallas and was therefore a contempt of the Dallas Court. Viewed through English eyes, such an argument should fail; but the Dallas Court will not be looking at it through those eyes and H&amp;G have instead been handed a gift which they can present as a clear admission of contempt. Possible result: a further mandatory injunction in Dallas requiring withdrawal of the anti-cuit injunction in London ...        9.01pm: &quot;Was there in Dallas. J. Jordan made it clear that he wanted &quot;this matter resolved&quot; so parties could close on 15th,&quot; says Josh Imhoff on Twitter who says he was at the hearing in Dallas which has been adjouned until tomorrow.  15 October has been the red-letter day for Liverpool&apos;s ownership for some time although absolutely no one would have predicted that a Texan courthouse was going to decide the future of the club.  9.29pm: More from the Dallas courtroom courtesy of the Dallas Observer (via Jean-Yves Mertenat) ...  Before [Judge] Jordan dismissed the parties till tomorrow morning, first thing, attorney Stephen Fox, repping Hicks and Kop Holdings, told the judge that &quot;our folks are aggressively working out an arrangement with RBS to take care of the debt.&quot; Meaning: Hicks and George Gillett would pay the close to $500 million owed and then look for someone other than NESV to buy the team. Jordan said, &quot;I hope those talks continue,&quot; but said he needs more time to consider the UK judge&apos;s ruling before making a decision concerning yesterday&apos;s temporary restraining order. Steve Stodghill, repping Hicks and Gillett, told Unfair Park after the hearing that NESV and the Liverpool board have agreed to hold off on closing till tomorrow morning, around 8 a.m. Dallas time, when Jordan&apos;s expected to rule on the TRO. If Jordan lifts the TRO, sale&apos;s a done deal. But if Jordan doesn&apos;t, says Stodghill, &quot;the ball&apos;s in the court of NESV, and they can decide if they want to attempt to close the transaction knowing they&apos;re in violation of the TRO. That&apos;s a decision they&apos;ll have to make.&quot;   10.20pm: It was about this time last night that everything kicked off but for the moment all seems quiet on the western front. Sky Sports News&apos;s Bryan Swanson remains outside Slaughter &amp; May in the hope of grabbing a word with John W. Henry when he emerges - if he emerges. I reckon there&apos;s about six feet between the door of the building and his waiting car so it&apos;s going to be a brief word if he gets one. I&apos;m going to take advantage of the lull by dealing with some emails. Daniel Strauss is unconvinced by Daniel Turner&apos;s earlier statement (see 8:57pm) ... &quot;With respect to Mr. Turner (please forgive me if there is a different title for a QC), I don&apos;t think that argument carries much weight. The judge struck the portion of the Texas TRO written by Hicks&apos; attorney which would have enjoined RBS/Liverpool&apos;s board/NESV from &quot;taking any action in any other court to effect or impede this lawsuit&quot;. The Texas TRO in no way prevented today&apos;s court action by RBS/Liverpool. Liverpool&apos;s statement only deals with the London court decision today. That being said, Hicks&apos; attorney in Dallas needs to tread very lightly, in my opinion. The original petition for the restraining order and subsequent motion for contempt could be construed to be willfully misleading the court with the rather obvious omissions, particularly as they relate to the London court actions. The Texas judge was deliberately careful to insert the word &quot;solely&quot; in every paragraph detailing the allegations in the TRO. Once the attorneys for RBS/Liverpool FC/NESV present their arguments, I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised if the judge comes down hard on Hicks. Forfeiture of the $15,000 bond they had to pay the court and Defendant&apos;s attorney costs (which would be astronomical given the extremely short notice) would be a start.&quot;  11pm: Due to technical problems, we have had to stop the live blog for the night. Full coverage will be resumed on Friday morning."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/14/liverpool-sale", "sentences": ["Peter Lim and other interested bidders Lim, the Singapore billionaire businessman, is caught in a tricky position."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-14T10:05:50Z", "title": "Liverpool sale: What next for this saga's principal factions?", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Martin Broughton, Ian Ayre and Christian Purslow After the jubilation of the high court on Wednesday came frustration 24 hours later for the men who have led Liverpool&apos;s civil war from within. Speaking this morning, Broughton, the club&apos;s chairman, claimed he &quot;remained confident&quot; that a deal to sell the club will still take place and accused Tom Hicks and George Gillett, the current owners, of trying &quot;every trick&quot; in order to stop a takeover going through. He is scheduled to meet with Ayre and Purslow, the other members of Liverpool&apos;s warring five-man board, to discuss how to move against Hicks and Gillett&apos;s temporary injunction. They will assess if the Dallas court order is valid against a high court ruling in this country and, if so, how best to fight it. Worryingly for the trio, a hearing regarding the injunction is to take place on 25 October, 10 days after the deadline for when Hicks and Gillett are scheduled to repay the majority of their \u00a3237m loan to the Royal Bank of Scotland. A failure to do so could lead to the club being forced into administration and docked nine points, a punishment which, it is expected, will see New England Sporting Ventures pull out of their takeover deal. Time then is of the essence for the board. They will hope to have the Dallas injunction overruled and a takeover deal completed within the next 24 hours. Tom Hicks and George Gillett The owners refusal to accept defeat in this saga has to almost be admired. Following the high court ruling yesterday it was expected that after three turbulent years in charge, they would finally walk away from Anfield. But some 12 hours later came the announcement of their temporary injunction and the staggering damages claim of $1.6bn (\u00a31bn). The pair appear to be captured in a wild state of denial and, as such, it is hard to predict with any great certainty how they will react next. For now, it is likely that they will sit back and wait to see how Broughton, Ayre and Purslow react to their injunction claim and if any bidders offering more than NESV&apos;s \u00a3300m proposal come forward. That, after all, appears to be their overriding motivation; to delay a sale for as long as possible in order to make as much money from it as possible. New England Sporting Ventures  When John W Henry, the principal founder of NESV, arrived in central London last night he must have expected that it would only be a matter of hours until he became the new Liverpool owner. The Dallas injunction has stalled that move, however, and the 61-year-old may now just be wondering if the hassle is worth it. After all, Henry had a bid accepted for the club as long ago as last Tuesday and since then has seen the entire process become mired in legal wranglings and threats of points deduction. It would be easy for him to walk away and concentrate fully on the Boston Red Sox, his principal major sporting interest. Liverpool supporters can, though, take heart from Henry&apos;s public backing for their campaign to oust Hicks and Gillett; he tweeted his congratulations to them following yesterday&apos;s high court victory and spoke soon after about the &quot;binding agreement&quot; between NESV and the board regarding a takeover bid. If the board can overturn the Dallas injunction in the next 24 hours or so it remains highly likely that Henry will complete an Anfield takeover. Peter Lim and other interested bidders Lim, the Singapore billionaire businessman, is caught in a tricky position. He yesterday welcomed the high court ruling but knows it actually suits him for Hicks and Gillett to delay any sale for as long as possible. Who then does he curry favour with, the club or its owners? The likelihood is that he will, like the Americans, sit tight for now. An offer has been made and if Hicks and Gillett are successful in their attempts to destroy NESV&apos;s takeover attempt than there is a strong chance the board will turn to his bid next as that is the only other one on the table. In the meantime, however, other bidders, some known, some not, are likely to come forward, but as this saga has proven, most takeover bids are little more than bluster and will not help a sale to be completed. Royal Bank of Scotland In the high court the bank&apos;s QC, Richard Snowden, made it clear that it wanted its loan from Hicks and Gillett repaid by tomorrow&apos;s deadline and took great offence in the suggestion, made by the owner&apos;s QC, that the two parties were &quot;locked&quot; into an agreement which meant no money had to be repaid by 1 November. RBS is reluctant to put Liverpool into administration and enforce a nine-point penalty and so it is likely its officials will be in communication with Broughton over the next 24 hours to discuss how his attempts to overrule the Dallas injunction is progressing and how close a takeover deal actually is. If the news is positive then there is a strong chance the bank will wait for events to unfold. If not then it may well step in and force Liverpool into an ever greater state of crisis."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/14/tom-hicks-liverpool", "sentences": ["Broughton has consistently argued, as he did in court, that of all interest communicated to buy Liverpool, only New England Sports Ventures and Peter Lim, the Singapore businessman who made his unhelpful exit today, produced solid proposals and proof of funds."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-14T20:52:00Z", "title": "Tom Hicks's aggression and refusal to go quietly shock 'Liverpool Three'", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Business", "Football", "Sport", "Business"], "article": "Some of those who have worked for Tom Hicks attest to a man who believes absolutely in his own mission, that nothing will sway the Texan corporate warrior from trying everything to have his way. There is a strong sense that when he walked into Anfield with George Gillett, all smiles, in February 2007, making all those promises, Liverpool did not understand quite what they had become involved with. Nine exhausting days since war broke out in the Liverpool boardroom, they finally do. Hicks made fortunes from leveraged buy-outs in the credit boom \u2013 borrow money, buy a company, sweat the company to service the loans, wait for its value to rise, then sell it \u2013 but then the credit crunch bit. Banks, previously happy to finance what then passed as enterprise, are now not only reluctant to do so but actually want their money back. Liverpool&apos;s crisis \u2013 and its possible salvation if the club finally rids itself of the debt Hicks and Gillett borrowed to buy it then made the club service \u2013 stems from Hicks and Gillett having borrowed the \u00a3185m from Royal Bank of Scotland for only 12 months. Hicks and Gillett were never close but Gillett had taken to Hicks, another US sports franchise owner, the possibility of buying Liverpool. Hicks admitted later he knew nothing of &quot;Reds&quot; but, as he &quot;researched&quot; it, he could see the possibilities. By that he meant the TV revenues, expanding as audiences around the world feast on Premier League contests \u2013 usually on the field. Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre \u2013 or the Liverpool Three, as they may soon be christened \u2013 knew Hicks would not go quietly if they decided as directors that the best, solid offers for the club were lower than the payday the Texan had set his mind on. Hicks placed his own baseball team, the Texas Rangers, into administrative bankruptcy last year after his holding company, Hicks Sports Group, defaulted on loans of $525m, which, like RBS, the banks wanted back. As his 28-page petition seeking the Dallas injunction makes clear, even before the fevered allegations of &quot;epic swindle&quot; and conspiracies by the three directors and RBS, Hicks is obsessed with the $822m (\u00a3513m) valuation put on Liverpool by Forbes magazine and his belief that the club should fetch a fortune approaching that. Broughton has consistently argued, as he did in court, that of all interest communicated to buy Liverpool, only New England Sports Ventures and Peter Lim, the Singapore businessman who made his unhelpful exit today, produced solid proposals and proof of funds. Some may think Hicks has a point: Liverpool is surely worth more than \u00a3300m and NESV, led by John W Henry, have themselves a steal. Broughton&apos;s response is that after an exhaustive worldwide search these were the best and only offers and therefore this is the club&apos;s true value. The main reason for this lower valuation is the &quot;acquisition debt&quot; Hicks and Gillett borrowed from RBS to buy the club in the first place. Hicks&apos;s petition nowhere mentions this, that the pair borrowed that money, or that the club has had to pay around \u00a340m interest a year to service it, or even that that is the money still owed to RBS. &quot;Messrs Hicks and Gillett have helped to solidify Liverpool FC&apos;s financial position,&quot; his petition says. That is the world according to Hicks. Broughton, Purslow and Ayre were ready for opposition from Hicks \u2013 who, rather than Gillett, with whom he has also periodically rowed, has made all the running in this battle. Broughton took consistent, careful legal advice from the club&apos;s solicitors, Slaughter &amp; May, documenting the sales process, and all communication with Hicks and Gillett. Yet even though Hicks might have been expected to pursue more money, his moves have still shocked with their aggression. Rather than attend last Tuesday&apos;s board meeting and argue the club should be securing more than \u00a3300m, Hicks attempted to sack Purslow and Ayre and replace them \u2013 not with acknowledged expert directors right for Liverpool but with his son Mack and Mack&apos;s assistant. That was when Broughton went on the attack, claiming on advice upheld in court that Hicks and Gillett were committing &quot;flagrant abuses of their undertakings&quot;. Unbowed, Hicks and Gillett defended themselves in court here, arguing the &quot;English directors&quot; had ganged up on them. When they lost that, out came the 28-page legal tirade in Dallas alleging a &quot;grand conspiracy&quot;, &quot;epic swindle&quot; and claiming over a billion dollars punitive damages from the Liverpool Three. Liverpool and RBS were back fighting in court again today, gaining the judgment from Mr Justice Floyd that his proceedings have primacy over Hicks seeking to have the same case heard in Dallas. And as ever with this dreadful saga, the broader truth hovers above the detail. As English football acclimatises to overseas ownership, unique in the world game, those in charge should ask themselves: did anybody think that allowing our clubs to be acquired with debt by all-comers could result in this, the future of Liverpool Football Club being put at risk, and fought over, in a district court in Dallas, Texas?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/15/football-transfer-rumours-wayne-rooney-real-madrid", "sentences": ["The dollar looks like taking a hit as Singapore allows its currency to appreciate against its US."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-15T08:11:36Z", "title": "Football transfer rumours: Wayne Rooney to Real Madrid?", "tags": ["Football", "Everton", "Liverpool", "Manchester United", "Real Madrid", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Wayne Rooney", "Sport"], "article": "Today&apos;s papers are dominated, as they have been all week, by the goings-on at Liverpool, with dramatic boardroom events at Anfield, in London law offices, and in a Texas courtroom set to shake football to its very core.

Last year it was the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of a recession and a slump in the value of sterling, making holidays more expensive at a time when people could least afford them. This year, the storm was tangible, in the form of the Iceland volcanic ash cloud \u2013 a phenomenon of sci-fi-like proportions that grounded flights across much of Europe in April and threatened to cast a pall over the entire summer. Then there was the more antediluvian threat of the niggling BA &quot;will they, won&apos;t they?&quot; strikes. All of which goes to show that, by now, we should have probably come to expect the unexpected. Travellers are certainly learning to be more adaptable \u2013 witness the ingenuity of many who had to make long journeys by road, rail and boat during the ash cloud shutdown.

The Global Tiger Summit in St Petersburg next month will bring together the 13 countries that still have wild tigers, along with conservation organisations, in an attempt to thrash out a global recovery plan. Britain and the US are also being urged to attend. The WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature) says it is optimistic about the summit&apos;s chances of success, but warns that failure will lead to the extinction of the tiger across much of Asia. The draft communique for the summit, seen by the Observer, notes that in the past decade tiger numbers worldwide have fallen by 40% and warns that &quot;Asia&apos;s most iconic animal faces imminent extinction in the wild&quot;. It concludes: &quot;By the adoption of this, the St Petersburg Declaration, the tiger range countries of the world call upon the international community to join us in turning the tide and setting the tiger on the road to recovery.&quot; The challenge was illustrated clearly last week when hidden camera footage showed the destruction of part of the Sumatran tigers&apos; Indonesian forest home to make way for illegal palm oil plantations. Meanwhile, in Singapore undercover officers seized several tiger skins that had been advertised for sale online. Organisers of the summit, which is backed by the World Bank, hope agreements can be reached that will lead to a doubling of tiger numbers by 2022. But some conservationists fear it is already too late and the summit will be another talking shop that fails to deliver results. Tiger numbers worldwide have collapsed from an estimated 100,000 over the past century, due to poaching and human encroachment. It is now thought there are no more than 3,200 tigers in the wild, of which only about 1,000 are breeding females. The situation is so critical that four of the 13 countries attending the summit \u2013 China, Vietnam, Cambodia and North Korea \u2013 no longer have viable breeding populations, according to a study released last month. The study \u2013 produced by researchers from Cambridge University, the World Bank and the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society \u2013 concluded that &quot;current approaches to tiger conservation are not slowing the decline in tiger numbers, which has continued unabated over the last two decades&quot;. It recommended that, rather than trying to save all the remaining tigers, governments should concentrate on sites that provided the most realistic chance of supporting a breeding population. &quot;Conflict with local people needs to be mitigated. We argue that such a shift in emphasis would reverse the decline of wild tigers and do so in a rapid and cost-efficient manner.&quot; The study will have made uncomfortable reading for the host nation. It found there had been a &quot;dramatic decline&quot; in tiger numbers in the Russian far east over the past five years \u2013 understood to be about a 15% drop \u2013 which it associated with a decline in anti-poaching enforcement. The Siberian tiger \u2013 also known as the Amur tiger \u2013 nearly went extinct in the middle of the last century, when numbers fell below 50, but there are now thought to be more than 400 left in the wild. Suggestions that numbers have dipped again will not have pleased Russia&apos;s prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who will be hosting the summit and who has been keen to portray himself as a rugged protector of the animals. In 2008 he accepted a tiger cub as a birthday present (the donor was never disclosed) and in the same year was at the centre of an extraordinary drama when it was claimed that he shot an Amur tiger with a tranquilliser dart to save the lives of a television crew. The team had been filming him taking part in a conservation exercise when the animal apparently broke free and charged. But not only Russia is struggling to save the tiger. Earlier this year the Observer revealed how India&apos;s tiger population remained in decline, with some conservationists estimating that only 800 remained in the wild, significantly fewer than the official claim of 1,411. Events in India in recent weeks have demonstrated just how great the challenge is. In the Panna reserve, which had to be restocked from other national parks last year, two young tigers have gone missing and are presumed dead. The human-tiger conflict for land was illustrated when three people in Uttar Pradesh, just 150km from the national capital Delhi, were attacked in an area not previously associated with tigers. In Indonesia, a hidden WWF camera shot footage of a rare Sumatran tiger in the forests of Bukit Betabuh. Later, the same camera filmed a bulldozer clearing the area \u2013 apparently for a palm oil plantation \u2013 and then recorded the tiger returning to the scene of devastation. But despite the gloomy picture the summit&apos;s backers remain optimistic. Diane Walkington, the WWF&apos;s head of species programme in the UK, said that considerable progress had already been made to sketch out a global recovery plan and to concentrate the minds of politicians on the problem. &quot;Tiger numbers can recover, but you can never take your eye off the ball,&quot; she said. &quot;We are down to 3,200 and that is a really low number.&quot; The solution, she said, was international co-operation to tackle issues such as smuggling. She cited deals between China and Nepal as an example of how that can bear dividends. But she warned that, with numbers so low, the tiger would not get another chance. &quot;I think that if this is not a success we will see tigers going extinct in much of Asia,&quot; she said. Some conservationists worry that the summit is more about politicians wanting to be seen to be doing something, rather than tackling the issues on the ground, such as the encroachment into tigers&apos; traditional territory by poor farmers in search of land. Aditya Singh, a conservationist and wildlife photographer who spends much of his time among the tigers of India&apos;s Ranthambore national park, said previous summits had involved a group of leaders seeking answers to a problem they did not understand. &quot;There is little or no ground-level representation. As a result, the real practical problems never get highlighted,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no link between field workers and conservation leaders. They do not even know each other&apos;s problems and the conservation efforts are not co-ordinated. Kind of like the climate summit.&quot; The &quot;tiger range&quot; countries attending the conference are Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, Thailand and Vietnam."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/19/baba-bling-prosperity-singapore-review", "sentences": ["Tens of thousands of Chinese nevertheless embarked on the perilous sea crossing to escape poverty and corruption, as we learn at the Chinatown Heritage Centre in Singapore.", "But Singapore did not regard immigrants as a separate category.", "Regardless of their origins in China, Malaysia or India, they formed the basis of the Singaporean nation, a melting pot from the outset and proud of its four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.", "Drawing attention to this hybrid background, Singapore (population 4.5 million) has made the development of culture and the arts a national priority for the coming decade.", "Coinciding with this initiative the Mus\u00e9e Branly in Paris has staged an exhibition entitled Baba Bling, Domestic Signs of Prosperity in Singapore (until 30\u00a0January).", "Baba also refers to the descendants of Chinese migrants who settled in the Malay archipelago (now Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore) as early as the 14th century, and married non-Muslim native women.", "There were other Peranakan communities, such as the (Indian Muslim) Jawi or the (Hindu) Melaka Chitty, but the Chinese community was the largest and the most influential in Singapore.", "Peter Lee is the curator of the Baba House, Singapore&apos;s last authentic Peranakan home.", "On the other hand there is no mention of the darker side of Peranakan history, in particular in the 1940s, when Singapore was under Japanese occupation.", "&quot;They are the multiracial emblems of our social mix,&quot; says Singapore&apos;s arts and information minister, Lui Tuck Yew.", "No one in Singapore would contradict that view."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-19T12:59:01Z", "title": "Baba Bling: Domestic Signs of Prosperity in Singapore - review", "tags": ["Exhibitions", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Until 1893 it was a capital offence to attempt to emigrate from the Middle Kingdom. Tens of thousands of Chinese nevertheless embarked on the perilous sea crossing to escape poverty and corruption, as we learn at the Chinatown Heritage Centre in Singapore. This surprising museum is devoted to the Chinese boat people who landed on the Malay peninsula in the late 19th century, on the heels of its British colonists, and ultimately reached the island at its tip. In 1930 alone, some 250,000 Chinese workers or porters, then referred to as coolies, arrived. But Singapore did not regard immigrants as a separate category. Regardless of their origins in China, Malaysia or India, they formed the basis of the Singaporean nation, a melting pot from the outset and proud of its four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. Drawing attention to this hybrid background, Singapore (population 4.5 million) has made the development of culture and the arts a national priority for the coming decade. Coinciding with this initiative the Mus\u00e9e Branly in Paris has staged an exhibition entitled Baba Bling, Domestic Signs of Prosperity in Singapore (until 30\u00a0January). It features more than 500 artefacts \u2013 furniture, porcelain, embroidered costumes and beaded slippers, among others \u2013 belonging to the Peranakan Chinese community. According to the historian JD Vaughan, writing in the 1870s, the Straits Chinese (born in the colonised territories of the Malay archipelago) were known as &quot;Babas&quot;, to distinguish them from their fellows born on the mainland. He noted their excessive taste for brandy, billiards and clubs, but also their attachment to traditional Chinese dress. In fact their place of birth was not the key characteristic of the Babas (literally &quot;a Chinese person&quot;), or more largely the Peranakan community (which simply means &quot;son of&quot; in Malay). Baba also refers to the descendants of Chinese migrants who settled in the Malay archipelago (now Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore) as early as the 14th century, and married non-Muslim native women. The Peranakan Chinese formed a cultivated, often prosperous caste, speaking English and Malay, but continuing to practise the religious rites of their ancestors, with a mixture of Taoist and Buddhist influences. They served as go-betweens for the British traders. There were other Peranakan communities, such as the (Indian Muslim) Jawi or the (Hindu) Melaka Chitty, but the Chinese community was the largest and the most influential in Singapore. Sadly this is no longer the case. Peter Lee is the curator of the Baba House, Singapore&apos;s last authentic Peranakan home. He is not quite as nostalgic as others. &quot;We are constantly negotiating between our roots and the dream of our roots,&quot; he says. &quot;We have this ability to exist in several worlds at the same time.&quot; According to some linguists there are now only about 10,000 Peranakan left, but their story is attracting unprecedented media attention. A Peranakan museum opened in 2008. The same year The Little Nonya, a television serial that tells the story of a Peranakan family over three generations, attracted a record number of viewers. And then there are restaurants, embroidery and cooking classes, conferences, articles and books all devoted to Baba culture. On the other hand there is no mention of the darker side of Peranakan history, in particular in the 1940s, when Singapore was under Japanese occupation. As allies of the defeated British, many Babas fled abroad, earning them a reputation as traitors. Attention focuses exclusively on the glamorous side of the Peranakan. &quot;They are the multiracial emblems of our social mix,&quot; says Singapore&apos;s arts and information minister, Lui Tuck Yew. No one in Singapore would contradict that view. The city-state, with its authoritarian, free-market values, gained its independence from Malaysia in 1965 and is now determined to assert its identity, much as it did when it developed its economy, cleaned up the city and built reservoirs. Certainly no Baba in his right mind would claim that culture is heaven-sent.

The \u00a34.6bn yearly spend on scientific research will be frozen for the review period, guaranteeing &quot;flat cash&quot; for universities and research councils, sources at the Department for Business Innovation and Skills told the Guardian. The freeze corresponds to a cut in real terms, as inflation reduces the spending power of the budget year on year. The reduction after four years is expected to be around 10%. A further \u00a31.4bn spent on large facilities will not be protected, however, and is expected to be cut by around 50% in line with reductions in capital expenditure anticipated in other departments. The business secretary, Vince Cable, and the science minister, David Willetts, were in negotiations with the Treasury until early this week finalising the scale of cuts to the science budget. Both made the case that research and innovation were critical to rebuilding Britain&apos;s finances. &quot;The Treasury appreciated that to go further than it has would have put a question mark over that,&quot; the Guardian was told. In recent weeks and months, vocal supporters of science have lobbied government and demonstrated outside the Treasury against making major cuts to the science budget. A report from the Royal Society concluded that a freeze on science funding was &quot;bearable&quot;. Cuts of 10% would &quot;seriously jeopardise&quot; scientific stability and productivity, and 20% cuts would do &quot;irreversible damage&quot; to British science. Fears of major science cuts have prompted fears of a brain drain of UK researchers to countries that have chosen to invest in science, such as Germany, France, the US and Singapore. Imran Khan, director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, said: &quot;This is still a significant cut when other countries have recognised that if you want to go for growth, you have to invest in science. Flat cash means a 10% cut over the four-year period and the people who will feel that cut soonest are the young scientists, who we will struggle to retain in this country.&quot; It is unclear what cuts to the capital budget will mean for major science facilities in Britain, but funds earmarked for the \u00a3600m UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation, which is due to open in London in 2015, have been preserved. The centre, to be built near King&apos;s Cross station, will house 1,250 biologists and other scientists and will focus on turning research into new treatments for conditions such as heart disease and cancer. John Womersley, director of science programmes at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), has warned it would be impossible to sustain major cuts without mothballing a major facility such as the \u00a3383m Diamond Light Source, which opened three years ago, or the \u00a3145m Isis neutron source. Both are in Oxfordshire. The science budget will retain a ringfence that prevents funds being moved around after the spending review. The protected \u00a34.6bn will pay for science at universities through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), and the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF)."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/19/british-travel-industry-grey-gap-year", "sentences": ["There was also a three-day stopover in Singapore and, on the return leg, three days in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-19T21:40:57Z", "title": "British travel industry boosted by 'grey gap year' adventurers", "tags": ["Travel & leisure", "Travel", "UK news"], "article": "A new breed of silver-haired adventurers is providing a boost for Britain&apos;s travel industry, which has been badly hit this year by a combination of volcanic ash, an emergency budget, the World Cup and a good spell of weather in the UK.

Sales in this area are up 300% to 400% over the past few years, the company says. Other firms are also getting in on the act. Shearings launched a collection of worldwide tours aimed at the over-50s this summer, and Get Travelling has unveiled a range of adventure tours for over-50s on its new get-lost.co.uk website. Firms aimed at younger gap-year travellers are now fighting for a share of the market. After 30 years of arranging round-the-world tickets for students and other young travellers, STA Travel is targeting the over-50s with its new business venture, Bridge the World. &quot;Over-50s want to take long-haul trips,&quot; says John Constable, STA&apos;s group managing director. &quot;A third of them will take a long-haul holiday next year. When they were 20, the gap year did not exist. That demand is there.&quot; He added: &quot;We found that we were losing our customers because, as soon as people start to have a family, the type of trip we arrange becomes less relevant for them. Bridge the World is somewhere that an STA customer can migrate to.&quot; Bridge the World&apos;s first high-street branch opened in Bournemouth last week, and it will be followed by outlets in Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Leeds and London by the end of the year. The company plans to take 50,000 passengers in 2011 on &quot;grey gap years&quot;. Some of these will be extended holidays that allow parents to visit children on their own gap-year trips; others will involve &quot;responsible tourism&quot; packages, which might include a spell teaching at a school in Africa. The company will also sell cruises, although Bridge the World customers are expected to use them like students use airlines on a round the world trip \u2013 hopping off the boat in Sydney, perhaps, but then joining another one after a tour of the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. Road less travelled Carol Domingo, 63, and her husband Vincent, 70, are the type of customer that the travel industry now craves. Two years ago they took a three-month holiday to Australia and New Zealand that included a driving trip between Sydney and Brisbane, tours of Melbourne and Cairns, and trips around New Zealand&apos;s north and south islands. There was also a three-day stopover in Singapore and, on the return leg, three days in Dubai. &quot;Stopovers are appreciated by the aged on long-haul flights,&quot; Carol said. &quot;The longer trip is better as two weeks for an older person going long haul is too short.

We are spending a week relaxing at the beach around Cancun and then plan to travel for 10 days, ideally to Palenque and back. We want to arrange our own transport and accommodation, as we prefer to do things ourselves and at our own pace, however we&apos;re not sure how easy and safe it is to travel around Mexico. I understand that buses run to most places. How easy is it to book high-end buses and find hotels or hostels at short notice? Are there any other places in the area that you would recommend visiting? Richard Timms You&apos;ll find it easy to book the top-end buses a day or two in advance. These buses are known as de lujo (deluxe) and first class (primera 1a clase) and offer the kind of luxury and comfort that have yet to surface in coach travel in this country. You can also book many services online at Ticketbus, or at least peruse fares and timetables for many services. Safety concerns for much of Mexico have been distorted by coverage of the country&apos;s drug-related violence. In general, apart from certain areas \u2013 which tourists are unlikely to travel to \u2013 you can expect few issues beyond the usual risk of petty theft that faces travellers almost everywhere. The Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office recommends completing bus travel during the day, but travelling from Cancun to Palenque you&apos;ll have plenty of other travellers for company, even on services beginning or ending at night \u2013 but take a taxi to your final destination if you&apos;re on one of these. Unless you&apos;re travelling over Christmas you won&apos;t have problems finding somewhere to stay \u2013 though consider booking in advance for your first night or if arriving somewhere unfamiliar late at night. It&apos;s not worth spending too much time in Cancun if glitzy resorts aren&apos;t your thing \u2013 you needn&apos;t even spend a night here if you don&apos;t want to. Playa del Carmen, just down the coast, has a fashionable beach scene and is a good jumping-off point for snorkelling and diving on the island of Cozumel. On the way to the region&apos;s cultural star destination, M\u00e9rida, stop off at Chichen Itza and stay a night in Valladolid, from where you can explore the magnificent cenotes (sink-holes) in the vicinity. There are more fine ruins south of M\u00e9rida at Uxmal and along the Ruta Puuc, which makes for an excellent day trip. From M\u00e9rida take the bus \u2013 there are day and overnight options \u2013 to Palenque. You can stay in the town, but the simple jungle huts by the ruins are pretty fantastic. It&apos;s another lengthy journey back to the Caribbean coast, but if you have time, aim for Chetumal, south of Cancun. There&apos;s a great Mayan museum there and more ancient treats nearby. You&apos;ll find seaside Tulum busy with day-trippers from Cancun, but a short bus ride inland at Cob\u00e0 you may find you have whole pyramids to yourself in real Indiana Jones-style jungle. I&apos;m off to Australia for a year on a working holiday visa and have decided to break the journey with stopovers in Dubai (three days) and Singapore (five days). I have been researching/speaking to friends about Singapore and the general consensus is that I&apos;m going to get bored there very quickly. Can you suggest anywhere else in the area I could visit within my time/money constraints rather than change my flights? Jade Noble As great as stopovers are for getting a taste of a place in a short time, they&apos;re a false friend to budget travellers. With limited time you tend to stay within cities, which are expensive: cities which are major world transport hubs are rarely places for a bargain stay. Whatever you think about having too long in Singapore, I&apos;d consider shortening your time in Dubai as that will eat into your hard-earned travelling fund quickly. As for Singapore, most visitors don&apos;t stay as long as you plan to, so as much as I think you&apos;ll enjoy strolling the historic district and the Malay and Chinatown areas of the city, as well as visiting the night market and Singapore&apos;s excellent museums, such as the Asian Civilisations Museum and the National Museum, a day or two out isn&apos;t a bad idea. You could grab a bus to Melaka in Malaysia, which is round about four hours away, and have an overnight stop or two in this historic port city. Unesco World Heritage status has brought plenty of tourists \u2013 and development \u2013 but it&apos;s still a charming city stuffed with interesting architecture left over from centuries of international influence. There are plenty of other possibilities \u2013 I&apos;m sure readers will have some suggestions. Please could you shed some light on why nearly all airlines presume that if you order a vegetarian meal, you don&apos;t like cake? I take quite a lot of long-haul flights and have to sit there eating my fruit while my husband tucks into a pudding or a delicious-looking piece of cake.Rhiannon, South Wales Being a meat-eater, I had thought for some time that there had to be a downside to opting for the vegetarian option and getting your grub first, and here it is. No cake. British Airways says it tries to make its puddings vegetarian friendly (made without gelatine). If you ordered a vegetarian meal and this is the case, you should get the same pudding. However, if you opt for a vegan meal you won&apos;t generally get a pudding as most are made with egg or dairy. It may be that you&apos;ve been served vegan meals by airlines cutting costs and offering only a vegan meal instead of two choices. BA also offers Hindu and Jain vegetarian options, where what&apos;s included will differ. Once on board, I can understand your reticence to specifically request some cake from the cabin crew: you don&apos;t want to be known as the lardbucket in seat 16F for the rest of the flight. If hubby won&apos;t do the decent thing and hand over half of his pudding \u2013 though bear in mind it may have been made with gelatine \u2013 maybe you could pick up the dessert of your choice from a cafe once through security and take it on to the plane. Of course, on budget carriers you are free to order \u2013 and pay for \u2013 what food you please so this should be less of an issue. Having been to Marrakech we are now heading to Fez. Can you recommend somewhere characterful to stay in the city? We&apos;re not sure if we&apos;re still in riad territory but would like somewhere memorable for under \u00a3100 a night. Also what sort of weather can we expect in mid-December?Debbie Gardener One of the best and grandest places to stay in Fez needn&apos;t cost a fortune \u2013 Riyad Sheherezade is an opulent treat and rooms start at \u00a3110 in mid-December. It&apos;s worth breaking the budget for. There are a few other riads to try, though not yet the packed scene you find in Marrakech.

Not long, according to a new report, which suggests that the productivity of ICT will halve in the coming decade as its emissions double. At least, that could be the case, if businesses fail to adopt new energy efficient ICT technologies, according to Chris Bronk, co-author of the study at the Institute for Sustainable and Applied Infodynamics at Rice University in Houston, Texas. &quot;There&apos;s this idea that ICT is a driver for productivity and advancing the economy,&quot; says Bronk. But he believes simply deploying more and more ICT will not necessarily reap enormous savings. In the 18-month study, carried out with Krishna Palem, a professor of computing at Rice University and director of the Institute for Sustainable Nanoelectronics at Singapore&apos;s Nanyang Technological University, Bronk analysed both the carbon emissions of ICT and its contribution towards the annual gross domestic product (GDP) in the US. They found that if the ICT industry continues to do business as it has in the past, its economic output will fall from about $2.83 per kilogram of CO2 emitted in 2009 to just $1.09 by 2020. This drop in productivity comes largely from the escalating electricity costs of running the equipment, which means businesses will have to start thinking long and hard about how and where they deploy ICT, says Bronk. &quot;Based on those numbers, the industry is headed for a brick wall if limits are placed on CO2 emissions. In a carbon-constrained economy, green innovation will be absolutely essential for ICT profitability,&quot; he says. Although such carbon curbing measures are still being debated in the US, the recent introduction of the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (formerly known as the Carbon Reduction Commitment) could soon make it a stark reality for businesses in the UK. &quot;Will we stop doing computing? No,&quot; says Bronk. But without change, the electricity used in data centres - one of the largest CO2 contributors of ICT - could result in electricity consumptionl doubling over the next five years, he says. The same applies to PCs, mobile phones, and gaming consoles: growth is going to come at an increasing cost. &quot;We can&apos;t support that kind of growth in consumption,&quot; he says. The industry has made many inroads towards greener technologies, such as the Green Grid initiative, says Tony Day, global director of data centre projects for APC. &quot;Besides the environmental impact of data centres, the energy costs of ensuring reliable IT services has made efficiency an imperative, in turn requiring that productivity is driven up,&quot; he says. There are technologies now available to help, from next generation greener servers to better management tools and more efficient cooling systems, although some ICT vendors have been slow to implement such measures, says Day. The other issue is ICT&apos;s potential to deliver huge efficiency savings in other sectors, such as transport, buildings and energy infrastructure, as detailed in the Climate Group&apos;s Smart 2020 report. These contributions tend to be overlooked when the productivity and efficiency of ICT is called into question, says Day. Bronk says these factors were taken into account in his study. &quot;ICT does provide some answers,&quot; he comments . &quot;But it doesn&apos;t get a blank cheque for its energy consumption.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/20/spending-review-science", "sentences": ["In his budget speech, George Osborne said: &quot;Britain is a world leader in scientific research, and that is vital to our economic success.&quot; Fears of severe cuts prompted leading scientists to demonstrate outside the Treasury and warn of a brain drain of key researchers to other countries, such as the US, Germany, France and Singapore, which are investing in science to spur their financial growth."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-20T17:12:17Z", "title": "Science community relieved as it escapes spending axe", "tags": ["Science funding crisis", "Science", "Spending review 2010", "Tax and spending", "Politics", "UK news", "Science policy"], "article": "Scientists expressed cautious relief today as fears of severe cuts to the science budget failed to materialise in the government&apos;s spending review. The \u00a34.6bn spent each year on scientific research by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Bis) will be ringfenced in a &quot;flat cash&quot; agreement that corresponds to a 10% cut, after allowing for inflation. Universities will be urged to make up the shortfall through efficiency savings drawn up by Sir Bill Wakeham, the former vice-chancellor of Southampton University, in a report earlier this year. &quot;The flat cash settlement for science is much better news than was feared and suggests that the arguments for the fundamental economic importance of scientific research have been heard and at least partly understood,&quot; said Professor Simon Gaskell, principal of Queen Mary, University of London. The settlement is a victory for the business secretary, Vince Cable, and the science minister, David Willetts, who argued that science and innovation were critical to Britain&apos;s future economic recovery. In his budget speech, George Osborne said: &quot;Britain is a world leader in scientific research, and that is vital to our economic success.&quot; Fears of severe cuts prompted leading scientists to demonstrate outside the Treasury and warn of a brain drain of key researchers to other countries, such as the US, Germany, France and Singapore, which are investing in science to spur their financial growth. &quot;The flat cash settlement for the core science budget is welcome news in the context of this very tough spending review,&quot; said Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society. &quot;The support of science is crucial not only to the strength of our education system, but to economic recovery and the solution of global problems.&quot; The deal guarantees \u00a32.75bn for the UK&apos;s seven research councils, \u00a31.6bn for university research through the Higher Education Funding Council for England, \u00a3150,000 for the Higher Education Innovation Fund and \u00a3100,000 for national acadamies. Sir Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust, said the settlement should allay fears of a brain drain, but called on scientists to make good on their promises. &quot;This should help to head off concerns of a brain drain, but it is up to scientists now to sell the subject to young people,&quot; Walport said. &quot;Scientists have argued that research is good for health, wealth and society and the government has trusted them on that. Now they have to deliver.&quot; Dr Evan Harris, the former Liberal Democrat science spokesman, said: &quot;Hopefully this will convince any scientists thinking of leaving the country that all is not lost. Morale will be boosted by this because, on the face of it, it is a good settlement.&quot; Others were less impressed with the deal and warned that Britain would struggle to be competitive. &quot;Even at about 10% down, we&apos;ll be playing catch-up in an international field which could see UK science left behind,&quot; said Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation. Question marks remain over the \u00a31.4bn capital expenditure budget for science, which is used for major facilities and administration. The allocation for science has yet to be decided, but the total capital budget at Bis has been cut by 44%. More than \u00a32bn is spent on scientific research by other departments, with the majority going to support health and defence projects. Medical research will be maintained across government in real terms, but defence research faced a &quot;moderate cut&quot;, Willetts said.

Here is what experts had to say on the levy: Brendan Barber, TUC general secretaryThis is a pathetically small amount to demand from the banks. Ministers have come up with the smallest number that they think they can get away with, even though the banks are carrying forward \u00a319bn of tax losses to offset against future tax bills \u2013 losses that have been bailed out by the taxpayer. Those who caused the recession will be cracking open the champagne today, while the full extent of the attacks on the living standards of poor and middle income Britain are starting to sink in. With government MPs yesterday cheering cuts in support for some of the most vulnerable in society, it looks like we have gone back to the 1980s greed-is-good culture. Nic Clarke, banking analyst at Charles StanleyThis announcement was largely as expected (little impact on UK banks&apos; share prices) with the levy expected to generate around \u00a32.5bn of annual revenues when fully in place. Chancellor George Osborne said that he wanted to &quot;extract the maximum sustainable tax revenues from financial services&quot; which plays to those who believe that all the current troubles are to be blamed on the banks. However, we believe that the government does understand that the sector is key to any economic recovery. It is our feeling that after extensive lobbying the banks are reasonably happy with the outcome. It could have been much worse. There have been conciliatory noises from the British Bankers&apos; Association stating that its members &quot;fully understand they have a role to play in the UK&apos;s economic recovery&quot;. However, they also highlight that the &quot;levy could undermine the competitiveness of the UK as a banking centre&quot; and it is this aspect that does concern us. The levy is based on a proposal by the IMF, but unless it is adopted by the key international financial centres then it is possible that the UK financial centre could be disadvantaged over time. Ian Gordon, banking analyst, BNP Paribas We wouldn&apos;t make too much of it, but the key takeaways (as before) are continuing relief for the UK domestic banks (especially Lloyds) when set against original expectations. This is especially true when taken in conjunction with a reduction in the UK rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% and the absence of any raid on UK banks&apos; deferred tax assets. The levy still appears unfair and disproportionate for Standard Chartered (recommendation: underperform) and HSBC (recommendation: neutral) given the potential for double-taxation (albeit this should be mitigated). The concession is to relieve uninsured (largely overseas) customer deposits at &quot;half the rate&quot;. This should soften the blow and to provide context, Standard Chartered was previously anticipating a levy of \u00a3200m in 2012 (2.5% of pre-tax profit). But the fact that its non-UK balance sheet will (in most geographies) only be subject to any levy at all due to its continuing UK domicile must be a cause of understandable irritation. Sir George Mathewson, former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland They are forgetting about one of the main things for the future, for the economy to recover we have to see growth in bank lending. Capital taken out of the banks means it is much more difficult for the banks to lend. I see this as a negative thing. Rod Roman, tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young The chancellor proclaimed in the comprehensive spending review that the bank levy had been designed to keep the UK financial services industry competitive, but would enable the Treasury to extract a fair and substantial tax contribution. However, having read through the details of the draft legislation this balancing act is going to be difficult to achieve. It&apos;s clear that UK headquartered banks won&apos;t be able to escape the levy, wherever they choose to operate in the world. In contrast, our international competitors, particularly non-EU banks, will find themselves with an advantage in certain lines of banking business. Countries such as the US, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia and Japan have indicated that they aren&apos;t going to make equivalent changes to the way they tax their banks. As margins reduce and the costs associated with banking continue to rise, these types of businesses will naturally gravitate to lower-cost models. So, while the chancellor aims to achieve a simultaneous reduction in bank risk and an increase in tax revenue, he may find, at least as far as the levy is concerned, he only gets one effect: a reduction in bank risk as certain types of banking business increasingly get done outside of London and outside of UK headquartered banks. Tony Woodley, joint general secretary of Unite, the UK&apos;s biggest union The pathetically low levy on banks \u2013 0.4% \u2013 is just another slap in the face for working people. They suffer for the mess these banks made while those that caused it literally laugh all the way to the banks. And how will throwing millions onto the dole and a life on benefits close the deficit? Gavin Hayes, general secretary of pressure group Compass The bank levy simply does not go far enough and will do absolutely nothing to change our boom and bust banking culture. David Cameron promised us &quot;a day of reckoning for bankers&quot; and his government let them off the hook. It was big banks that caused this crisis not big government and they should be made to pay their fair share. This is why the government should have imposed a bigger levy on the banks themselves and made the one-off windfall tax on excessive bankers&apos; bonuses permanent. The government could have also committed to a financial transactions tax, these measures, combined, could have raised up to \u00a330bn per annum and saved ordinary people from suffering from savage and unnecessary public spending cuts \u2013 and the resulting real risk of a double-dip recession. The government should have chosen to be on the side of the people \u2013 instead it is clear it is on the side of the bankers that caused this mess in the first place. Angela Knight, chief executive of the British Bankers&apos; Association We are well aware that we do need to pay our tax and pay our contribution to the UK economy. Care is needed to look at this legislation, look at its impact and how it fits. We have been looking at this for some time; the banking industry has been prepared for this. The BBA added in a statement:  The banks are committed to playing their part in restoring the UK economy \u2013 and that includes helping to meet the greater demands on the exchequer. The banking industry paid more than \u00a326bn in taxes last year and the bank levy will increase this figure. We will work with the Treasury to ensure the final levy also meets the aim of maintaining the UK&apos;s position as the world&apos;s financial centre while generating additional tax revenues. This bank levy applies not only to UK banks but also to the more than 200 overseas banks operating in this country. Changes to the detail have been made during the consultation period but inevitably the levy will have a significant impact. Questions are being raised about the UK proposing to apply tax to a global balance sheet. The Treasury&apos;s statement is largely silent on how this levy would interact with taxation in other countries. Until this is clearer, some banks could be taxed multiple times by multiple jurisdictions on the same activities. There is also no international consensus on how banking activities should be taxed: the G20 members still hold very different views.

Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines have all moved or are moving towards monitoring internet use, blocking international sites regarded as critical and ruthlessly silencing web dissidents. \u2022 In Vietnam, the Communist party wants to be your &quot;friend&quot; on the state-run version of Facebook, provided you are willing to share all personal details. \u2022 In Burma, political unrest can be silenced by cutting off the country from the internet. \u2022 In Thailand, website moderators can face decades in jail for a posted comment they did not even write, if the government deems it injurious tothe monarchy. While much is made of China&apos;s authoritarian attitudetowards internet access, a majority of south-east Asian governments have similar controls and , rather than relaxing restrictions on internet use, many are moving towards tighter regulation. The Guardian has spoken to five leading bloggers across the region about the present restrictions they face and future fears.     Interactive: Meet five key bloggers who fear a crackdown on freedom of expression.    Raymond Palatino, a Filipino MP and editor with Global Voices, says governments, in addition to crudely blocking websites, are starting to use arguments of morality and decency to censor access to information and quash criticism. &quot;There is direct censorship to block political dissent. You have repressive laws in Myanmar [Burma], in Vietnam, in Singapore. In fact I think Vietnam is catching up with China in terms of building strong firewalls to prevent dissidents from accessing critical content on the internet. &quot;But we also see governments using the excuse of protecting the public morality in order to censor internet content. Governments use the excuse of censoring pornography as a safe argument to make censorship acceptable to the public.&quot; More than a decade ago, George W Bush asked people to &quot;imagine if the internet took hold in China. Imagine how freedom would spread&quot;. But rather than emerging as a catalyst for democracy, the internet has become another way to to stifle dissent. Palatino sees governments using the internet for their own selfish advantage. &quot;They are learning how to prevent people for using the internet to criticise government. Instead of being a potent tool for empowering the people, the internet will be in the hands of an authoritative, repressive government.&quot; With a population of more than 600 million, south-east Asia has about 123 million internet users. But penetration ratesvary from 0.2% in Burma and Timor-Leste to more than 80% in Brunei Darussalam and 77% in Singapore. But south-east Asian use is still dwarfed by China&apos;s384 million users. In the Philippines, cybercrime legislation before the parliament would outlaw anything deemed obscene or indecent. Palatino says: &quot;The laws are deliberately broad and vague so they can be used to shut down anything subversive.&quot; Cambodia&apos;s government is seeking to monitor all internet use inside the country, by appointing the state-owned telephone company to operate the sole internet exchange. Websites will be monitored to filter out pornography, officials say, but opponents say sites critical of the government are also likely to be blocked. In Thailand, century-old lese-majesty legislation is combined with new computer-related crime laws, to mute criticism on the web. Lese-majesty laws \u2013 defaming the monarchy - are imposed inconsistently in Thailand, but wielded often enough, and against defendants of sufficient profile, to stifle almost any discussion of the monarchy&apos;s role in a country riven by political factionalism. Chiranuch Premchiaporn, the editor of Thailand&apos;s English-language news website Prachatai.com, faces up to 70 years in jail for allowing the monarch to be insulted online. The charges relate to five of 200 comments posted about an interview with a Thai man who was charged for refusing to stand for the anthem in a theatre. Premchiaporn, known as Jiew, did not write the comments, and pulled them from the website but, according to police, allowed them to stay up &apos;&apos;longer than the appropriate period&apos;&apos;, a period never defined by authorities before or since the charge. Now on bail, the prospect of jail weighs heavily on her. &quot;And it isn&apos;t just about &apos;Oh, how long I will have to spend in the cell&apos;, my whole life is uncertain. I cannot plan my life because of this legal charge, it makes everything hard.&quot; Thailand&apos;s strict laws, and harsh punishments, have had a chilling effect on political discussion on webboards and blogs. &quot;I think the biggest problem in Thai media is self-censorship \u2026 but we started Prachatai for the ideals of believing in the rights of people to access information \u2026 from many sources and not be dominated by just one source,&quot; Jiew says. Prachatai is blocked in Thailand, under order of the emergency decree after the red-shirt uprising of May. It is one of more than 100,000 websites blocked in the country. &quot;We want to promote the rights of the people to speak up about their issues, not just only people who have a big name, or who are important in government.&quot; In Vietnam, web-users can become &quot;friends&quot; with their communist government, joining the country&apos;s own version of Facebook. A trial version of go.vn was launched in May. A full version is expected online by the end of the year. The functions are familiar to those versed in social networking. Users can update their status, post photos and links, and send messages back and forth. There are news links, historical articles on founding father Ho Chi Minh and other revolutionary heroes, and members can also play state-approved network games (in one particularly violent example, players join a band of militants sworn to fight the spread of global capitalism). The site is closely monitored by the government&apos;s security services, and while, for many, the attraction of the internet lies in its anonymity, to join go.vn users must submit their full names and state-issued identity numbers to the government. The Vietnamese government says it expects to have 40 million members, half the country, in five years. Perhaps because web dissidents are dealt with so ruthlessly by the communist regime \u2013 four bloggers were recently jailed for 16 years for anti-government posts \u2013 five months on, take-up of go.vn is a bare few thousand. Burma has one of the poorest records on internet freedom in the region. All .mm sites and email addresses are closely monitored by the ruling military junta, and international sites banned, but the tiny internet cafes that dot the former capital, Yangon, are adept at bypassing the government&apos;s firewalls, using proxy servers to evade the censors and access banned sites. Outfoxed on technology, the junta responds during times of stress by simply unplugging the internet, especially to stop unwelcome news getting out of the country. At the height of the monk-led Saffron Revolution in 2007, the junta&apos;s generals shut down access completely, later claiming a break in an underwater cable had cut the country off. With Burma heading towards its first elections in a generation early next month, and the anticipated release of political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi a week later, there is an expectation the web blackout may be repeated."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/21/funding-cuts-school-sport", "sentences": ["&quot;The biggest promise we made in Singapore was to bring sport to life for children at home and around the world."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-21T21:00:05Z", "title": "Funding cuts will 'decimate' 10 years of progress in school sport", "tags": ["School sports", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The government has been accused of betraying the promises made to secure the London 2012 Games by scrapping the school sport programme with less than two years to go until the Olympics. Baroness Sue Campbell, the chair of the Youth Sports Trust, said the decision to incorporate the \u00a3162m ringfenced for a network of 450 school sport co-ordinators and other specialist programmes into the general education budget would &quot;decimate&quot; the gains made in the past decade. &quot;This is in direct contradiction of the promises Seb [Coe] made,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;The biggest promise we made in Singapore was to bring sport to life for children at home and around the world. We are doing that abroad through the International Inspiration programme while we are decimating it at home a year before the Games. It&apos;s incomprehensible.&quot; Governing bodies, who must also deal with a severe reduction in the funding reserved for capital projects through Sport England, are understood to be concerned that cuts to the network will hurt their grassroots programmes. Campbell said: &quot;This doesn&apos;t just affect sport in schools. Over the last 10 years this has become a very important route through which governing bodies deliver their grassroots strategies. That&apos;s particularly true of Olympic sport. The school sports partnerships have become an integral part of sports provision.&quot; The decision to reallocate the funding and concentrate on encouraging competitive sport in schools through a new national Olympic-style competition was also criticised abroad. Campbell said the scheme had become the model for others in New Zealand and Australia. Wenda Donaldson, director of community sport at the Australian Sports Commission, said: &quot;I am absolutely devastated to hear of the cuts to the school sport partnership models. I am astounded that such an amazing and world-leading initiative has been lost to the communities it serviced.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/24/borneo-indonesia-rainforest-illegal-logging", "sentences": ["Along with local demand, China, Malaysia and Singapore are big importers of the Kalimantan forest creatures."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-23T23:07:21Z", "title": "Borneo's majestic rainforest is being killed by the timber mafia", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Endangered species", "Endangered habitats", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Environmental sustainability", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The cows are afloat, with squawking chickens sharing their sturdy bamboo rafts. Children splash and swim in and around their homes, keeping away from the deeper channel of peat-coloured water that powers through the village of Meliau. Adults tightrope-walk across makeshift paths of hardwood thrown over huge floating logs. Others paddle around in long wooden boats. Everything that floats is lashed to everything that doesn&apos;t. The monsoon rains are not due for a month or so, but the &quot;dry&quot; season for people in West Kalimantan province in Indonesian Borneo has been marked by three months of unrelenting floods. The sky is clear and blue and the stilted long houses and huts are reflected in mirror image on the water: it is a strangely scenic backdrop to one of the largest unfolding disasters on the planet \u2013 the stripping of the Borneo rainforest. Indonesia has one of the world&apos;s largest areas of remaining forest but also one of the highest deforestation rates, ranking only behind Brazil. The vast green rainforest carpet has become a patchwork with more than half of Borneo&apos;s tree cover and peat swamps \u2013 which absorb much of the planet&apos;s carbon excesses \u2013 already gone after a decade&apos;s &quot;goldrush&quot; of uncontrolled timber logging that was at last partially curtailed in 2006. But now the rest is being pillaged by palm oil and pulpwood plantations and networks of illegal loggers \u2013 the &quot;timber mafias&quot; \u2013 in an onslaught that is endangering not only the wildlife and the people but also contributing to global climate change on a scale far out of proportion to the island&apos;s size on the map. Indonesia&apos;s carbon emissions as a result of its deforestation and land use changes put it in third place of the world&apos;s worst offenders, behind only the US and China. The timber from its rare 100- to 200- year-old diptocarp trees, each one the home of hundreds of insects, is eagerly snapped up, keeping consumers and the construction industry in the UK and elsewhere in tables, patio chairs, trinket boxes, doors and plywood. When consumers buy paper, furniture or even charcoal on the British high street there is an estimated more than 80% chance they are buying into this destruction. Only four of the 300 timber concessions currently logging in West Kalimantan have written sustainability into their methods and only 16% of the world&apos;s timber goes through members of the WWF Global Forest &amp; Trade Network, companies who commit to choosing sustainable wood where they can. Meanwhile, where the trees once stood and acted as a natural barrier, the floods rage. Kalimantan is the largest chunk of Borneo. Brunei and Malaysia occupy the top third. Divided into three provinces \u2013 east, west and central \u2013 Kalimantan has almost 10% of the world&apos;s tropical forest and an extraordinary biodiversity that constantly multiplies with three new species being discovered there on average every month. It is the only home of some of the world&apos;s most endangered mammals: the pygmy elephant, the clouded leopard, the sun bear and the orangutan. All of them face extinction if the ancient forest is destroyed. Already along many of West Kalimantan&apos;s rivers the black totem poles of dead and dying trees stand stark where rainforest once flourished. Indiscriminate chopping down of the big trees kills off the surrounding flora, too, a degradation that allows the free flow of flood waters to drown more trees, insects and plants and erode the habitat of apes and the resources of locals. Saweng, 60, a father of five of the indigenous Dayak, the infamous headhunters tribe, was born in the Long House at Meliau, a stilted home where 32 families live under one, long roof. He complains of outsiders coming in to steal their trees and the rising water levels, a 20-year high he says. &quot;The forest is important for everything for us, for tools, for house and for boat, for food and for medicine. The loss of this forest is making our lives more difficult. Now if we found someone logging in our forest we would punish them, capture them and not let them go.&quot; Another tenant, Susiana, 38, says that although the rivers have an abundance of fish the glut has seen the price crash; the result is plenty to eat but nothing to sell. The rattan that women use to weave mats and baskets is becoming harder to find. There are fears over the effect that the flooding will have on the rice harvests, pushing farmers to move further into the forest, using their traditional slash-and-burn methods to carve out new fields for their staple food. Susiana has four children, three of whom have already had to leave for the towns to find work: &quot;Not being able to speak to my children has made me very ill. I feel pain all the time and can&apos;t sleep. But many young people are leaving here. It&apos;s common for them to go to Malaysia to look for work. The waters are pushing them away.&quot; In the flooded town of Lanjak life goes on. The clothing stores are open and in the tea shop the owners serve wading calf-deep in water. Jimmy Bond is the WWF officer for this area, a charismatic 42-year-old Indonesian eco-warrior who spends much of his time out in the jungle, monitoring the dubious practices of some of the palm oil plantation managers and tracking illegal logging. Last year he was viciously beaten up by police officers for getting too close to logging machinery with his camera. &quot;Lanjak used to be the biggest illegal logging port, there were 20 sawmills and every day 400 trucks were carrying out wood day and night,&quot; he says. &quot;It seemed unstoppable and the social impact was huge \u2013 land battles caused clashes between families, between ethnic groups, local wisdom was eroded and modest and humble people became more violent as they used their new money to drink, use prostitution and gamble.&quot; The shutting of the border with Malaysia ended the town&apos;s dominance and now the timber mafias have moved deeper into the forests. Wading into Bond&apos;s office, past a floating black giant centipede the size of a large bar of chocolate, is his new convert, Unja. The former boss of a logging gang who admits he cut down around five sq km of virgin forest \u2013 around 16,000 cubic metres of timber \u2013 this Indonesian farmer effectively has a bigger carbon footprint than Finland. After having a gun held to his head in a dispute over money, Unja gave up the illicit trade. He says that he believes the tensions between local tribes are going to lead to a resurgence of the land disputes that saw widespread violence and killings across Kalimantan 10 years ago. &quot;The hate is unresolved in many hearts here,&quot; he says. &quot;The issues with the watershed and the trees being cut down will make things worse, things are tough for people.&quot; Staring out at three little boys tormenting a scorpion they have imprisoned with strips of wood, Unja says that deep down he regrets wielding the chainsaw, although it made him a relatively well-off man with his own car, which is an uncommon sight in Lanjak. &quot;The deer and boar have gone far away now, the rivers have become wider and more shallow and the rains wash away the soil. For my son, the crystal waters and the fishing is only a story I can tell. I cannot show him.&quot; Bond introduces another repentant man. Hendri Jali is head of 38 families who live at Sungai Luar Long House, rebuilt on the proceeds of illegal logging, but now he is trying to grow rubber and replant the ruined forest. He is angry that he has closed his sawmill in the forest but that a Russian company has just marked trees around his land to cut to create a palm oil plantation. &quot;I was promised aid money if I stopped logging, but I have had none and now they are giving the land to foreigners to destroy&quot; he says. &quot;Already hunting is almost impossible, we fail to find any meat and the plants for medicine are hard to find.&quot; What is not difficult to find is the ongoing illegal logging. The evidence of small-scale plundering is everywhere. Paths of wood planks leading from the road or river off into the forest, half a dozen men pulling out the spoils, sometimes by bicycle, from the sawmills tucked out of sight that cut the giant trees down before they are collected by trucks or rafts. Yelling men chase away the Observer with sticks. At the small port of Ketapang alone last year, 30 boats loaded with illegal timber were counted leaving each day, smuggled wood worth an estimated $6m (\u00a33.8m). But it is not just the locals; unmonitored, unscrupulous companies can easily haul out extra timber over and above the amounts specified on their licence. There are huge discrepancies between figures for export of Indonesian wood and reports of imports in other nations. Ian Kosasih is the forest director of the Heart of Borneo initiative, an ongoing effort to ringfence and protect 22m hectares of rainforest across the three nations of Borneo. &quot;The companies usually are even more difficult to prove a case against, they can use their existing permits and it&apos;s much more difficult to prove,&quot; he says. &quot;There are many, many cases with a lot of timber posing as coming from a certain area but the volumes are ridiculously high. Formal timber tracking is not working; you need to be able to document from the stump to the entry of the timber to the market. &quot;For palm oil plantations there are no real rules at all, they are supposed to use degraded areas, but many just cut into the virgin forest. &quot;In 2006 we knew that 70% of the logging was illegal but now it&apos;s a lot smarter, before you could actually go out and film the illegals, they were so brazen. Now its more smart, more hidden. The timber mafia can control a whole district and be running 150 to 200 trucks out and sending hundreds of teams into the forest.&quot; In Ketapang, the illicit timber trade has made one especially noticeable impact. In a small compound in the town, three orangutans throw branches at visitors through the bars of a small cages. Several babies and other adults are kept in a house nearby. &quot;I know, I know,&quot; says Dr Karmele Llano S\u00e1nchez apologetically. S\u00e1nchez is a Spanish vet who set up this sanctuary under the International Animal Rescue banner last year. &quot;But when we came they were in cages just a metre square, at least now it is a little better, of course not ideal.&quot; The compound contains 17 apes and is already overwhelmed. Oil palm workers are regularly confronted with aggressive orangutans violently defending their habitat and some, who fear killing an endangered species, ask for them to be humanely removed. Others, of course, will just kill them on sight. &quot;Also we know of another 40 to 50 orangutans now in captivity as pets who need to be rescued but we simply cannot help them right now,&quot; said S\u00e1nchez. They hope to build a far larger enclosure, which might help them to do what to date they have been unsuccessful in achieving \u2013 re-releasing orangutans. It is a problem not only because of the reduced forest cover but also because there are so many babies, left behind or sold on as pets by the hunters, who can also find a market for the hands and feet of the dead mothers from locals who regard the meat as a delicacy. &quot;Orangutans have few instincts, they learn everything from their mothers, so youngsters are very vulnerable if left alone in the wild,&quot; said S\u00e1nchez. &quot;But orangutans can survive in managed forests, so to save the orangutans we need to tackle our consumer behaviour.&quot; The illegal wildlife trade is booming. In the street markets of Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan, which sits directly on the Equator, the trade is brazenly open, although stallkeepers say the confiscation by the authorities of a baby orangutan on sale here last week has frightened a few dealers away. But still, in one short stretch of just a few hundred metres, it is possible to count seven species of birds and fish for sale in small cages and overstuffed tanks which are on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species endangered species list. From the rare red arowana river fish to the black hornbill and spotted doves, the conditions mean they die quickly, keeping the demand high. The &quot;mist nets&quot; for catching birds in the forest are also openly on sale. One man tells the Observer he has a waiting list for the endangered hill mynah, a bird prized for its ability to talk and which has been found on sale in the US for $1,000. Along with local demand, China, Malaysia and Singapore are big importers of the Kalimantan forest creatures. But, like the police raid on the Pontianak pet shops, there are pockets of hope for the Kalimantan forests. Above Ketapang is the PT Suka Jaya Makmur concession, a company awaiting its Forest Stewardship Council certification, a scheme backed and supported by WWF. They log, but sustainably and selectively, leaving cover and fruit trees for the sweet-toothed orangutans. The timber is stamped immediately after felling, and monitored in its journey to the markets and can be bought in the UK in stores including B&amp;Q, John Lewis and Argos, although consumer demand is so low that sometimes its eco-credentials are barely advertised. Many believe that the saving of the depleted Kalimantan forest can only happen through pressure from the outside, when consumers start to question the wood they are buying. In the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, the new secretary-general of the Ministry of Forestry is late for a meeting with the Observer. Hadi Daryanto is helping with the emergency relief effort as flash floods have killed more than 150 people in the previous 24 hours. &quot;We have halved the numbers who have access to the forests and are working to protect our forests from illegal loggers,&quot; he says. Norway has just given the country a grant on condition that it suspends new concessions in the forests from 2012, but Hadi insists a full moratorium is not the answer. &quot;There is $10bn coming in from palm oil, $4bn from pulp and paper, and the people who work in these concessions are many, so we cannot just stop it all or the IMF will collapse us as an economy. &quot;So please be wise about this, who will pay for that? Europe and the US has a financial crisis and who is going to help us just for the sake of climate change? Nobody. &quot;We were told to democratise and this is the price of democracy. Climate change is the price of democracy. Indonesia is trying to be a good boy, but we can&apos;t paint the sky for you. &quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/24/lewis-hamilton-mclaren-korea-alonso", "sentences": ["We&apos;ve got Monza where we didn&apos;t score, Singapore where we didn&apos;t score."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-24T20:54:59Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton looks to Brazil as McLaren remain hopeful", "tags": ["Ferrari", "Fernando Alonso", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Jenson Button", "Lewis Hamilton", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "The world championship somersaulted once more here today to leave its supporters in a state of nervous exhaustion. A race which was dominated first by rain and then by encroaching darkness and which had, for most of the time, the safety car as the dullest of star performers, seemed to threaten little more than anti-climax. When it was all over, however, most people agreed that this was just about as much fun as one could possibly have on a wet Sunday afternoon in Yeongam. For Ferrari and Fernando Alonso, who won for the third time in four races, this was another stunning triumph, the Spaniard opening up an 11-point gap at the top of the drivers&apos; championship. For Red Bull, who had locked out the front row for the eighth time this season only to see both their cars fail to finish, this was an eviscerating experience, a day even darker than the tenebrous skies that lurked over the Yellow Sea beside Jeollanam-do. For McLaren, meanwhile, it was something in between. On the one hand Lewis Hamilton revived his fading chances of a second title by finishing runner-up to Alonso, a result all the more heartening because it made a vivid contrast to the cruelties that had befallen him in recent races, and now lies third-placed and 21 points behind the Spaniard. &quot;I think this is a wonderful day,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;In terms of finishing and scoring points it was better than the last few races, which have been very, very tricky. We&apos;ve got Monza where we didn&apos;t score, Singapore where we didn&apos;t score. It was great to compete for the win. &quot;It was good for the team. But it still wasn&apos;t perfect. We still had things we struggled with. We are clearly the third fastest car. But that doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t step forward in the next two. I&apos;ve got good memories of Brazil.&quot; But for Jenson Button this was the day he lost his chance to retain the world title. True, there are still a total of 50 points to be won in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, and he is 42 behind the leader. &quot;I&apos;m not really [still in the championship]. People would need to have massive problems for me to win. I am not really in it any more.&quot; But when asked later whether he would play second fiddle to Hamilton to help his team-mate win the title, he said: &quot;If mathematically I couldn&apos;t win the championship then yes, I would help Lewis. I said that the championship was over \u2013 we say a lot of things in the heat of the moment and I don&apos;t stand by that now. &quot;You don&apos;t win world championships by conceding defeat before it is all over. If I couldn&apos;t win the championship, I would help the team in whatever way I can. Until then I&apos;ll fight and you have seen today how things can change fast. Mark was leading by 14 points and now Fernando leads by 11.&quot; If Spa in August was wet, this was wet, wet, wet. &quot;If it rains,&quot; said the admirable BBC pundit Martin Brundle three days before the race, calling upon all the knowledge and experience that made him such a competitive driver &quot;the surface will be like oiled snot&quot;. Those at home who might have recorded events, however, would have been disappointed because the delay meant that coverage was switched from BBC1 to BBC2 before most of the vital moments. The track, and its surrounds, looked unready to stage its inaugural grand prix. The start was delayed 10 minutes and then the grand prix led by the flashing safety car. Only three laps were possible before the race was stopped. And then there was another tedious series of what looked like formation laps until the safety car came in on the 17th lap, allowing real racing for the first time in the hour and three-quarters that had elapsed since the scheduled start. Red Bull, though, were soon to suffer the first of their two huge setbacks. Webber, the championship leader at the start, was running second behind his team-mate Sebastian Vettel when he lost control and crashed out on the 19th lap. Vettel now opened up a lead over Alonso, with Hamilton moving up to third. Hamilton did pass the Spaniard but surrendered the advantage almost immediately when he ran wide on turn one. Vettel, though, appeared in no danger from either driver until, at the start of the 46th lap, his engine blew up as if an incendiary device had been planted there. The Red Bull garage looked devastated as the German traipsed dejectedly from his vehicle. They have had the best car all year but have now lost the lead in the drivers&apos; championship and had it slashed in the constructors&apos; table. Alonso, though, is now the main man, until Brazil at least. This was his fourth win in seven races. His challenge for a third world title may have faltered in the summer but his car has been big, red and dangerously fast all season. He has always looked a potential champion; it seems so obvious now."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/25/red-bull-webber-vettel-f1", "sentences": ["You could say that what defined the championship for me was Monza and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-25T10:02:17Z", "title": "Red Bull vow to treat Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel equally", "tags": ["Red Bull", "Mark Webber", "Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "Red Bull&apos;s team principal Christian Horner would rather give away another world championship \u2013 and with it possibly his career \u2013 than give preference to either Mark Webber or Sebastian Vettel, he said yesterday. Red Bull were the dominant cars for much of last season but lost the world title to Jenson Button. And despite having the fastest cars again this year \u2013 they have won 14 poles out of 17 \u2013 they face the prospect of losing out again, this time to Ferrari&apos;s Fernando Alonso, whose victory in the Korean grand prix was his third in four races and his fourth in seven. It gives the Spaniard an 11-pont lead at the top of the table with two races to go. But while Alonso has a &quot;rear gunner&quot; in the shape of Felipe Massa, who is seemingly happy to accept No2 status at the Scuderia, Red Bull&apos;s divided loyalties could cost them dear. A historic first world championship for Red Bull would almost certainly transform the team. But Horner sounded adamant yesterday when he said: &quot;I have always said it is wrong to favour one driver over the other because Sebastian, 10 laps from the end, was potentially the championship leader. That makes it wrong to put our backing in one direction or the other.&quot; With both Red Bulls failing to finish yesterday Horner faces the most difficult decision of his career. Vettel is now 25 points behind Alonso, while Webber trails by 11. That means that even if Vettel wins the remaining two races, with Webber second and Alonso third, the Spaniard would still win his third world title. But if Webber won them, ahead of Vettel with Alonso third, then the Australian would be champion for the first time. Deep down, Red Bull would prefer the younger and more marketable Vettel to wear the crown. But in the 12 days leading up to the Brazilian grand prix, which is followed by the final race in Abu Dhabi a week later, Horner is likely to face some strong lobbying from Webber, who feels the team should back him. If Alonso does take the title by seven points, or fewer, it will bring back uncomfortable memories of the German grand prix in July, when Ferrari deliberately broke the rules by asking team-mate Massa to make way, though the World Motor Sport Council opted not to punish the Italian team for their transgression. When asked about that yesterday, Horner replied: &quot;We will deal with that if it happens. Our focus is on getting back ahead of Fernando and I believe we can do it. We just need fewer days like today and more like Japan where we were dominant. When people look into the history books, they won&apos;t look into the details. It&apos;s about who wins at the end of the year. We have chosen not to go racing that way. Both drivers are still in this championship and I believe it will go right down to the last lap in Abu Dhabi.&quot; Team orders during a race, of course, remain illegal \u2013 notionally, at least. But that would not prevent Horner from telling Vettel, before the race, that he must do what is in the best interests of the team. When Lewis Hamilton was asked what he thought about the seven points issue yesterday he replied: &quot;I have no idea really. You could say that what defined the championship for me was Monza and Singapore. It&apos;s not something to focus on at the moment. I&apos;ve got to focus on the next two races. This is a real positive for me. A massive positive. I&apos;m 21 points behind but that is not too far away.&quot; McLaren, like Red Bull, face a dilemma over team orders because the world champion Jenson Button, who now trails by 42 points, no longer has a realistic chance of retaining his title. When the McLaren team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, was asked whether Button would now be asked to support Lewis, he said: &quot;We will think about that. We&apos;ve had a disappointing day with Jenson, Lewis is clearly very much in the hunt and mathematically it&apos;s still not impossible for Jenson but it looks quite tough. It looks very difficult for him. We&apos;ll talk about that before we get to Brazil. &quot;If ever there was a race that you could look at and say anything could happen in the championship this is the one. From the championship point of view this is a great result. Jenson had a really bad afternoon for a whole range of reasons and was really unlucky so it&apos;s looking pretty tricky for him but you&apos;ve got to say the other four guys are very much in the hunt and anything can happen. &quot;In the race if he hadn&apos;t taken to the grass at one point he would have had a Force India on top of him. By his high standards it was a very difficult afternoon. For me I was disappointed when a win was possible. It was winnable and we didn&apos;t. Nevertheless we go away here still very much in contention with Lewis and two really interesting races ahead. This race demonstrated anything can happen in the championship. It&apos;s still wide open.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/oct/25/flyer-email-skiing", "sentences": ["Four-star Singapore cruise, from \u00a31099 - save \u00a3750This luxurious 22-night four-star cruise from Singapore to Southampton, stops off at Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, Lisbon and more, with P&amp;O Cruises Oriana.", "Price includes ensuite accommodation, meals and flights to Singapore departing Heathrow on 24 November."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-25T11:47:21Z", "title": "The Flyer: your ski season sorted", "tags": ["Travel"], "article": "Welcome to the Flyer.

The report by Transparency International reveals that Britain has dropped dramatically to 20th in a league table of countries perceived to be the cleanest in the world. Each year, Transparency International compiles a league table of all the countries in the world, ranking them as to the perceived levels of corruption among politicians and public officials. Four years ago, Britain was seen as the 11th cleanest country in the world. However the UK has steadily slipped and now nestles next to Chile and Qatar. The rankings are based on surveys of international experts and institutions. Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore tie for the accolade of the least corrupt country, while Somalia comes last. This morning, Chandrashekhar Krishnan, executive director of Transparency International UK, said: &quot;This is the leading global index of corruption, and the UK is now seriously at risk of dropping out of the top 20. &quot;Yet it should be aspiring to be within the top 10. How else can the UK&apos;s calls for better governance in developing countries be taken seriously? &quot;A reputation for probity is vital to exercising influence on the international stage and in conducting business successfully.&quot; He said that the MPs&apos; expenses scandal has had a bigger and longer-lasting impact on domestic and international opinion than politicians had hoped. For years, Britain has been criticised for failing to prosecute companies which pay bribes to foreign politicians and officials to secure big export orders. Most notoriously the Blair government abruptly halted a major corruption inquiry into Saudi arms deals in 2006. However, prosecutions have now started, and in the last year, a handful of companies and executives have been convicted. In the latest prosecution by the Serious Fraud Office, the chief executive of a City firm is due to be sentenced this morning at Southwark crown court, in London. Julian Messent, the former head of PWS insurance firm, has admitted making corrupt payments of \u00a31.2m to three officials in Costa Rica to win contracts. Britain&apos;s failure to prosecute foreign bribery has been partly blamed on its outdated, fragmented and complex anti-corruption legislation. In its dying days, the last Labour government brought in a modernised law to stamp out bribery. It was passed by parliament in April, but has yet to be implemented by this government. Ken Clarke, the justice secretary, announced in the summer that the act will not be enforced until April next year, so further consultation on its details can be held. Krishnan added that Britain&apos;s worsening performance in the league table &quot;strengthens the case for the UK&apos;s new bribery act to be properly enforced, and sends a warning signal to the government that there should be no dilution of the bribery act or further delay in its commencement&quot;.

The rise in APD has led to travel agents warning holidaymakers to check that advertised travel prices include the new taxes in order to avoid any unwelcome surprises. Passengers are charged for how far they fly under APD rules. Previously, costs were calculated according to whether travellers were flying long-haul or short-haul but, on 1 November 2009, these costs changed to fall into four distance bands \u2013 A, B, C and D, where D is the most expensive. On 1 November 2010, these costs are increasing further. It means that passengers travelling to short-haul destinations (Band A) in economy class will be least affected \u2013 with the duty on flights under 2,000 miles rising from \u00a311 to \u00a312 on Monday. But consumers travelling to medium- and long-haul destinations will be hit harder. A passenger travelling to Egypt, which falls into Band B under the new rules, will now have to pay \u00a360 in APD \u2013 \u00a315 more than today and an increase of 33%. Passengers travelling to faraway destinations such as Australia, Indonesia and Singapore will now pay \u00a385 in duty each \u2013 54% more than the current \u00a355. For those travelling in premium, business or first class, the rises are more significant. APD on Band B flights rises by a third to \u00a3120, while Band C flyers will pay \u00a3150 \u2013 50% more than today&apos;s APD levy. First class passengers flying long-haul to Band D destinations will now pay \u00a3170 or 54% more than today&apos;s tax charge. Travelzoo claims that many people in the UK are still not fully aware of the changes to APD, which was recently branded a &quot;disgrace&quot; by British Airways boss Willie Walsh. Phil Salcedo, publisher at Travelzoo UK, explains: &quot;The sad fact is that around 30% of the travel deals that we check simply don&apos;t include taxes in the price. This means that, with this new increase in tax, travellers need to be extra wary and make sure the price they expect to pay doesn&apos;t massively increase when they get to a page of taxes. &quot;We don&apos;t think this is fair and we won&apos;t feature or recommend deals from any travel company that doesn&apos;t publish taxes and charges up front.&quot; Another new rule to be introduced from 1 November is that countries will be categorised into bands according to their capital city&apos;s distance from the UK, a decision that will lead to anomalies. For example, with flights to large countries such as the US, it will be possible to travel to the state of Hawaii and pay less tax than if you travel to the Caribbean, which is much closer. Travelzoo says this clearly goes against the principle of APD rises, which are intended to charge higher prices for flights that cover more air miles. A similar anomaly arises when comparing the price of a holiday to Turkey to a holiday to Egypt. Turkey falls into Band A, while Egypt is classed as Band B. This means a family of four travelling in economy class to Turkey will pay \u00a348 APD compared with \u00a3240 APD for the same family to travel to Egypt \u2013 an increase of \u00a3192 in tax alone. Salcedo added: &quot;Those most affected by these changes will be families as they will be travelling in larger groups and all children over the age of two are subject to the full APD price hikes. Business class passengers will also be badly affected. The only consolation is that if passengers are upgraded they will not be stung for the higher-priced APD, so the joy of the &apos;free upgrade&apos; will be allowed to continue \u2013 at least for now.&quot; Consumers can read more on APD and the forthcoming increases on the HMRC on the Association of British Travel Agents website."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/29/executive-pay-bonuses-banking", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m wondering how international banks will be able to recruit in Hong Kong, Singapore or New York,&quot; he said.", "The French banks have spoken up about their concerns of hiring internationally, particularly in the financial hubs of New York, Singapore and Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-29T09:05:31Z", "title": "Bank bonus review: as it happened", "tags": ["Executive pay and bonuses", "Banking", "Regulators"], "article": " About 100 or so people are expected to turn up today at the the public hearing being run by CEBS - the Committee of European Banking Supervisors - to discuss new proposals for bankers bonuses.  The rules will impact the way bonuses are paid in the City as the Financial Services Authority has already warned that its existing rules, which currently cover 27 firms, will have to expand to cover up to 2,500 firms which operate with in the square mile, Canary Wharf and the hedge fund land to the west in Mayfair. A crowd is beginning to assemble in CEBS&apos;s offices in the City, which offer fabulous views of a very grey London from floor 19 of what used to be called the NatWest tower.  9.45am: When Cebs put its new rules out for consultation there were usual rows about bankers threatening to relocate and it looks as if they have sent legal representatives to today&apos;s hearing. Technically, the hearing today is to discuss CP 42 which is the document that has been causing all the fuss.  9.55am: Every one seems to be getting reading to go. At a table at the front there are three people. Ivo Jarofke from the CEBS secretariat and Jo Swyngedouw who is chairing the event on behalf of the Belgian regulators, assisted by Veerle De Vuyst.  10.12am: Swyngedouw is making a presentation to what he describes as &quot;informed audience&quot;. The room is packed and very hot. Most of the chaps have got their jackets off. CEBS, by the way, comprises the 27 regulatory bodies that exist across the EU, so the FSA is the main representative body for the UK - until it gets disbanded by the coalition in the next two years. He is explaining how CEBS has gone from having &quot;principles&quot; on bonuses to &quot;guidelines&quot;. He is reminding everyone that the implementation deadline is a 1 January 2011 which he admits is &quot;challenging&quot; but one that was demanded politically by the members of CEBS. By way of background, the pay guidelines were drawn up in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008 when it emerged that bonuses were still being paid out despite huge losses being run by banks. Bonuses have never been blamed for causing the crisis but have beenaccused of encouraging traders to take too much short-term risk without thinking of the long-term consequences of their actions.  10.24am: The audience is being reminded that the rules will have to be applied to any services provided by bankers during 2010 - so in other words the current bonus year will be covered by the rules. The presentation is largely a legal introduction into how the guidelines will be introduced into Article 22 which sets out a legal basis for introducing the remuneration policies across Europe. He puts up bits of Article 22 on the projector - which states that &quot;remuneration policies and practices that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management&quot;. He also says that CEBS is working on a new policy for 2011 that will deal with anyone earning over 1m euros.  10.34am: So, the presentation continues. Three areas are going to be covered: governance; risk alignment; and transparency. Swyngedouw is explaining that guidance is being sought on how to apply the remuneration guidelines to investment firms. In terms of the staff covered by the rules - only staff with a &quot;material impact on the risk profile&quot; of the institution; executive staff; senior management responsible for day-to-day operations; and traders on trading desks. The fire bell is being tested!  10.44am: Now a discussion about &quot;proportionality&quot; ie are big and small firms covered fairly. &quot;This is a very important issue of concern to both institutions and supervisors,&quot; he said. An effort has been made to ensure that firms are treated fairly. Some small firms are worried they would have to set up remuneration committees, which they will not have to do, and also issue equity to allow some parts of bonuses not to be paid in cash. That won&apos;t have to happen either. He describes some provisions as being &quot;neutralised&quot; for some firms. Penalties can also be imposed on firms that do not comply. The aim is &quot;protection of capital base [which] has priority above paying out remuneration&quot;. So, some firms could be forced to &quot;add on&quot; more capital. Avoiding &quot;circumvention&quot; of the guidelines is also important.  10.58am: The audience is being told what pay policies should look like:\u2022 no encouragement of excessive risk taking\u2022 consistent with sound and effective risk management\u2022 the long-term interests and values of the firm must be taken into account\u2022 remuneration should also be part of the planning for liquidity andcapital rules There is also a mention of pension benefits, which do not have to be included provided they are firm-wide. But, if they are discretionary for individuals then they must be included in the rules to ensure that pension payments are not used to side step the rules. Such payments must be deferred for five years. Certain types of pay will be prohibited, he said:\u2022 no guaranteed remuneration other than one year bonuses - &quot;unlessexceptional and limited to the first year of employment&quot;\u2022 there can be no personal hedging of bonuses, ie individuals cannottake out contracts with third parties that negate the impact of anybonus intended to align risk to performance\u2022 there should be no rewards for failure He is spelling out very clearly that pay policies should be fullyflexible so that &quot;remuneration can decrease and go down to zero ifnecessary&quot;. The idea in the consultation paper is that a &quot;explicitmaximum ratio&quot; is set out for what a bonus can be relative to the sizeof a basic salary. However, CEBS does not set out what that ratio canbe and is leaving it up to firms to decide how large the ratio is. So, presumably that means a bonus can be as big as a firm wants it tobe provided it sets a big ratio....  11.10am: Now on to the design of bonuses which has caused some of the controversy. Swyngedouw is admitting that some part of the requirements are &quot;an additional restraint and limits the flexibility of the pay out structure&quot; relative to non-EU countries which do not have to conform with CEBS. The idea is to &quot;avoid big upfront cash variable remuneration&quot;. [This avoids scenarios of bankers walking away from firms and leaving huge losses behind in the coming years. As an example, Royal Bank of Scotland paid out all its bonuses in cash before the 2008 bankingcrisis.] The consultation paper set outs that vesting of bonuses is postponed so 40 to 60% of a bonus must be deferred over three to five years. And instruments must be used to provide a &quot;retention&quot; element, such as shares or a share-linked instrument. Half of a variable payment should be paid in one of these instruments.  11.12am: After speaking for more than 80 minutes, he says he is coming to the end of his presentation. This section is about how firms should demonstrate they are complying with the rules. They will have to publish separate reports on pay or include a section in an annual report [presumably this is like a remuneration report published by UK companies]. The floor is open for discussion. CEBS will make a decision at its December meeting.  11.24am: First question is about timing. The guidelines have to be adopted by 1 January but firms won&apos;t know until mid-December. Is this &quot;too tight&quot;? Answer: CEBS agrees this is &quot;very tight&quot;. A decision will be taken on 9 to 10 December and firms will know on the 10th or 11th. Second question is about existing contracts. How can it be applied? Answer: CEBS is moving at the speed politicians are demanding and seems pretty unforgiving on this point. &quot;It is doable. A lot of material is out there in the public domain for some time&quot;.  11.39am: Question 3 is from a representative of the French bank Credit Agricole. He is worried about how banks can hire staff in New York or Hong Kong if it has to comply with the rules. He does not give his name but describes himself as &quot;very frightened&quot; after sitting through the presentation. &quot;I&apos;m wondering how international banks will be able to recruit in Hong Kong, Singapore or New York,&quot; he said. He asked&quot;why [would a] good trader, risk manager be willing to work with us&quot;. He added: &quot;Personally I have worked in Hong Kong or New York and I can tell you once these rules will be known or understood it would be extremely difficult to keep our good people or even worse recruit them&quot;. His idea is to fix a threshold at which the rules apply outside Europe. The answer is far from sympathetic. &quot;It&apos;s a valid issue, the issue of the level playing field but ... that is beyond the remit of the responsibility of CEBS&quot;. A questioner from another big international French bank BNP Paribas is also expressing concerns about a level playing field when hiring outside the EU. Her particular concern for flexibility on a rule that 50% of variable compensation be paid in non-cash. CEBS will consider this.  11.41am: Just as a reminder, this is what CEBS put out in its invite to the public hearing: &quot;The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) published its draft guidelines on Remuneration Policies and Practices. CEBS would like to draw attention to a number of areas where it would particularly welcome views. These include: retention period, as outlined in paragraph 125 onwards where comments on the appropriate retention period are sought; and minimum portion of instruments and their distribution as outlined in paragraph 130, where it is CEBS understanding that it is the EU legislators&apos; intention that the 50% minimum threshold for instruments applies equally to the non-deferred and the deferred parts&quot;. Those paragraphs can be looked up in the paper: http://www.c-ebs.org/Publications.aspx  11.50am: A question now about the idea that CEBS is trying to cap the maximum level of a bonus through setting a maximum payout ratio. &quot;Many people will see setting a maximum is inconsistent with having a fully flexible policy,&quot; the questioner said. It does not appear to seem so to CEBS, which appears to be dismissing the question.  12.15pm: Questions from the IMA, which represents fund managers, pointing out that the maximum payout ratio for fund managers might not work. Also asking about the role of the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) which has to decide how these rules apply to thefirms its regulates. Lots of discussions also taking place about the technicalities of retention periods and also a question from AFME, which represents big City firms, about whether there could be some flexibility to help recipients of bonuses pay their tax. CEBS does not seem keen to get involved in tax discussions but is registering the question.  12.34pm: The concern being raised is about small banks and whether they are being over burdened with rules. The answer is that they are not, and that proportionality should step in. The concern appears to be that small banks do not have shares with which to pay smallish bonuses. CEBS replies that the idea is not to force deferral of small bonuses. There are no more questions.  12.36pm: So, it has wrapped up this end. What have we learned? The French banks have spoken up about their concerns of hiring internationally, particularly in the financial hubs of New York, Singapore and Hong Kong. CEBS has pointed out that it does not have a remit to worry about such things. CEBS is talking to securities regulators through CESR - the Committee of European Securities Regulators - to establish the extent to which fund managers and securities firms are subject to the rules. CEBS was not able to say when it might learn the decision. Lots of discussion was about the technicalities about how bonuses can be structured to meet the rules, and CEBS appeared to think its guidelines were pretty clear. The consultation closes on November 8. CEBS meets next in mid December to decide and will publish the final guidelines on or around 10 and 11 December."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/29/bankers-european-bonus-rules-warning", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m wondering how international banks will be able to recruit in Hong Kong, Singapore or New York,&quot; he said."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-29T17:18:04Z", "title": "Bankers tell regulators bonus rules will damage ability to retain staff", "tags": ["Executive pay and bonuses", "Banking", "Regulators", "Business", "Europe"], "article": "Bankers warned European regulators today that new bonus rules would make it difficult for them to hire and retain staff and urged them to make changes to a proposed cap on the amount paid. At a public hearing convened by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) into its new guidelines on bonuses, the body of 27 European regulators was also told that its demand that the bonus rules be implemented across Europe by 1 January 2011 was &quot;too tight&quot;. The Financial Services Authority has already been consulting on the proposals which require the regulator&apos;s current rules on pay to be expanded from the 27 firms covered at the moment to include up to 2,500 firms operating within the City. The CEBS will not meet until 9 and 10 December to discuss the responses to the consultation and will publish their conclusions on 10 or 11 December. Attendees at the public hearing argued this did not give individual regulators much time to implement them by the deadline barely three weeks later. CEBS also said it would begin work on how to handle pay deals for staff earning more than \u20ac1m next year. Representatives of two French banks expressed concern at the hearing about the problems that European banks would face in recruiting staff outside the EU. The new plans require that 40% to 60% of a bonus be deferred over three to five years while there must be a further &quot;retention&quot; element so a bonus is paid in shares or a share-type instrument. Half of a variable payment should be made in one of these instruments, while an &quot;explicit maximum ratio&quot; must be set for the size of a bonus in relation to the basic salary. The requirement that bonuses be paid half in cash and half in shares has prompted concerns in Britain that bankers will have to dip into their savings to pay their taxes \u2013 currently 50% for high earners \u2013 as the shares cannot be sold immediately. One banker from French bank Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, who did not give his name, described himself as &quot;very frightened&quot; after sitting through a presentation about the proposals, which are open to consultation until 8 November. &quot;I&apos;m wondering how international banks will be able to recruit in Hong Kong, Singapore or New York,&quot; he said. He asked &quot;why [would a] good trader, risk manager be willing to work with us?&quot; He urged CEBS to fix a threshold at which the rules apply outside Europe. A representative of another French bank, BNP Paribas, also expressed concerns about a level playing field when hiring outside the EU. Oliver Lodge, a former director of the FSA who now runs OWL Regulatory Consultancy, expressed concern about the European regulator&apos;s plans to link bonus payments to basic salary, pointing out that the CEBS had earlier said bonus systems should be flexible enough to allow for bonuses to fall to zero."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/31/nicholas-ostler-my-bright-idea", "sentences": ["Conventional wisdom used to be that new forms of English \u2013 Jamaican patois or Singlish [English-based creole spoken and written colloquially in Singapore] \u2013 would become mutually unintelligible."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-30T23:05:01Z", "title": "My bright idea: English is on the up but one day will die out", "tags": ["Linguistics", "English and creative writing", "Language"], "article": "In the contentious and overcrowded world of English language studies, Nicholas Ostler stands out as an original analyst of a subject that usually generates more heat than light. Ostler&apos;s Empires of the Word (2005) was a critically acclaimed history of the world&apos;s languages based on his deep knowledge of linguistic theory and a familiarity with around 26 languages. In his new book, The Last Lingua Franca (Allen Lane), he brings a wide-ranging linguistic perspective to bear on the role and future of global English. His provocative conclusion \u2013 that English is likely to go the way of Persian, Sanskrit and Latin and, over many hundreds of years, inevitably die out \u2013 will bring hope to the French and dismay to many American linguistic patriots. Ostler is the chairman of the Foundation for Endangered Languages, a non-profit organisation that exists to support, enable and assist the documentation, protection and promotion of endangered languages. He lives in Bath. Can you express the central theme of your book in a nutshell? English is on an up at the moment, an up that is probably unprecedented in world history. But world history is full of languages that have dominated for a time, yet there aren&apos;t too many of them around now. So the essential idea is to see what happened to them and see if this could possibly be relevant to the situation of English, which is the world&apos;s lingua franca today. Surely the historical circumstances that led to the decline of a language such as Persian are very different from the circumstances in which English finds itself today? Well, inevitably they are different in that Persian only dominated western Asia and it was disempowered by the invasion of aliens, people coming from effectively another planet: the British in India on one hand, the Russians in central Asia on the other. In the history of languages, it usually takes centuries for the inevitable to come about. It probably took 700 years after Persian no longer had any obvious military or cultural means of support for it to be discredited. In the case of a language such as Latin, it took a millennium. So these things do take a long time, but there&apos;s no reason to believe that English is going to be the exception to the sort of trends one can discern. But global capitalism, global media, global politics \u2013 isn&apos;t that a lot to discount if English will ultimately disappear? Yes, but this sort of thing has happened in the past. I mean, do you have an explanation for why Latin wasn&apos;t given a massive buck-up by the invention of the printing press? It did get an immediate fillip, because to start with the literate public predominantly read Latin. But the trend towards vernacular literacy tended to overwhelm Latin. At the moment, English-speaking groups are very much in their ascendancy, but there is only one way to go from an ascendancy. How will new technologies \u2013 the sort of things that allow instant translation between languages \u2013 shape the future? It&apos;s been the received wisdom in language technology that machine translation isn&apos;t good enough. But all that&apos;s preventing it from being good enough is just a problem of scale. The way that machine translation is now being pushed forward simply involves being able to process more and more data in order to find the significant patterns. The power and cheapness of computers is increasing all the time. There&apos;s no way that the little problem of incompatibility between languages is going to stand in the way of it for long. And because it&apos;s being done in a data-based way, the techniques which will solve the problem will solve it for all languages, not just the big important ones. So even remote Aboriginal groups will benefit \u2013 maybe a generation later, maybe sooner. And when that happens, people will be able to fulfil themselves through their own language, which is what they always wanted to do anyway. Conventional wisdom used to be that new forms of English \u2013 Jamaican patois or Singlish [English-based creole spoken and written colloquially in Singapore] \u2013 would become mutually unintelligible. But that hasn&apos;t happened yet. Well, it&apos;s happening gradually. But I want to draw a distinction between a language which is spread through nurture, a mother tongue, and a language that is spread through recruitment, which is a lingua franca. A lingua franca is a language that you consciously learn because you need to, because you want to. A mother tongue is a language that you learn because you can&apos;t help it. The reason English is spreading around the world at the moment is because of its utility as a lingua franca. Globish \u2013 a simplified version of English that&apos;s used around the world \u2013 will be there as long as it is needed, but since it&apos;s not being picked up as a mother tongue, it&apos;s not typically being spoken by people to their children. It is not getting effectively to first base, the most crucial first base for long-term survival of a language. You run the Foundation for Endangered Languages. What does that do? Half the world&apos;s languages have fewer than 10,000 speakers and these seem to be losing the speakers they have. The point of the foundation is to raise this as a matter of concern and to bring people who are concerned with these languages together, so they can learn from each other."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/oct/31/douglas-stewart-obituary", "sentences": ["He met his second wife, Mary, in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-10-31T18:45:18Z", "title": "Douglas Stewart obituary", "tags": ["Second world war", "Scotland", "UK news"], "article": "My father, Douglas Stewart, who has died aged 92, was a submariner throughout the second world war. He was one of the first people to be conscripted and was on a submarine the day that war was declared. He had many &quot;near misses&quot;. On one occasion, he went to join his submarine at Tynemouth, but because Newcastle had been bombed during the night, his train was delay- ed. The submarine left without him and was lost at sea. Douglas had all the character and stoicism that those who served in the war were obliged to develop, and the experience stay- ed with him for the rest of his life. He was born into a working-class family in Glasgow and educated at Rutherglen academy. He returned from the war to support my mother, Peggy, and me. He qualified as a chartered surveyor and worked in Glasgow, as well as Coldstream in the Scottish Borders, and Brecon, in south Wales. In 1958 he went to Malaya to work for the war department. Peggy died in 1959 and he was left on his own but his determined character came to the fore. He met his second wife, Mary, in Singapore. They married in Hong Kong in 1960 and started a family. In Hong Kong, he worked for the housing department. In charge of the maintenance division, he was frequently called out after monsoons and floods to give his opinion on whether a building was safe for occupation. It was a demanding role and he enjoyed the challenge. When he returned from Hong Kong he suffered a serious stroke. The doctors forecast that he would be unlikely to walk again. He was determined to ensure that his young family were properly brought up and educated. He not only learned to walk again but also returned to work, as a surveyor for the Ministry of Defence in Birmingham, and maintained his role until retirement. Douglas was an enthusiastic traveller and visited America, Australia and New Zealand as well as the far east. His retirement was enlivened by travels in his camper van.

Anyone who has dared to put a date to the disappearance of newsprint has, naturally enough, suffered from much scorn. But an Australian-based futurist, Ross Dawson, is clearly unworried by the inevitable brickbats that will strike him. So here are his predictions: newspapers will cease to exist in the US within seven years. They will die in Britain and Iceland in 2019, in Canada and Norway in 2020 and in Australia in 2022. That&apos;s going to be a bad period for ink-on-dead-trees because papers will also become extinct in Hong Kong, Finland, Singapore and Greenland the the following couple of years. But France, due to governmental support for newspapers, will have papers until 2029 and Germany will last out until 2030. Dawson has published a &quot;newspaper extinction timeline&quot; on his blog, along with his reasoning. He predicts newsprint will be &quot;insignificant&quot; in 52 countries by 2040, where it will replaced by technologies such as lightweight, interactive digital paper that can show video, but can also be rolled and folded. However, newspapers will continue to flourish in developing markets such as Africa, parts of South America and parts of Asia. Dawson is quoted in The Australian as saying:&quot;In the developed world, newspapers are in the process of becoming extinct, driven by rapidly changing use of media and revenues out of line with cost structures.&quot; He believes that the key transcendent technological breakthrough will be the marketing of devices more convenient to use than the iPad.

The takeover is part of an international struggle to secure global commodity supplies against a backdrop of soaring demand and population growth in emerging economies. Potash Corporation, based in Saskatchewan, is one of Canada&apos;s largest companies and the world&apos;s biggest producer of potash, a key ingredient of food fertiliser. Demand for potash has leapt as countries such as China and India seek to boost crop yields to meet increased consumption, especially among a burgeoning middle class. But the hostile bid for Potash by BHP, headed by South African-born Marius Kloppers, has run into opposition from Saskatchewan, as well as other Canadian state governments, who argue it is foolhardy to hand a fifth of global potash supplies to a foreign firm. Now the ball is in the court of the federal government which must decide by midnight Canadian time today (4.00am GMT) whether BHP&apos;s move will be a net benefit to Canada and meet stringent foreign investment rules. Reports from Canada have indicated that Ottawa could sanction the deal, but only if BHP agrees to spend billions on Canadian infrastructure projects to compensate Canada for lost royalty and tax payments. Analysts say Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper is being pulled in different directions; protectionists argue it would be &quot;criminal&quot; to hand over one of the country&apos;s crown jewels to an overseas multinational, while champions of free trade fear that Canadian companies could face tit-for-tat measures when they seek to expand overseas if Harper blocks BHP. &quot;The devil will be in the detail,&quot; said one analyst, &quot;if the strings attached are too stretching for BHP, it could affect to what extent it sweetens its offer; or whether it offers anything extra at all,&quot; he adds. As potash prices have been heading north since BHP first tabled its hostile bid in August, brokers have argued BHP will have to raise its offer price to persuade 50% of Potash&apos;s shareholders to accept the deal. City sources suggest Kloppers could offer 10% above the current price of $130 a share to a level nearer $145, although analysts at UBS argue BHP may have to go as high as $165; BHP&apos;s major shareholders intimate that would be too high. BHP is determined not to overpay and can point to the fact that its bid is the only one on the table. China&apos;s Sinochem sought to enter the fray with backing from Canadian pension funds and Temasek of Singapore, but the Chinese were put off by a report from Saskatchewan that hinted a bid from a state-owned company would be unwelcome. The Canadians also said that as a consumer and a producer, it would be in Sinochem&apos;s interests to keep prices low, limiting the size of tax receipts. Kloppers is betting an increasingly hungry world will pay dearly for potash as BHP makes its first major move into the global food industry. With demand for grain rising and less farmland available per person, the need for fertiliser - especially potash - has never been greater. BHP&apos;s bid is not just an attempt to diversify: it is a major bet that rising food demand will cause a significant growth in the use of the fertiliser. According to Potash Corp&apos;s website, more people are eating meat, and as incomes rise in developing nations, millions of people are switching from starch to protein-based diets. Every pound of beef requires seven pounds of grain to produce, and this has a substantial impact on demand, according to experts."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/03/british-author-alan-shadrake-singapore-court", "sentences": ["The British author Alan Shadrake is today facing a possible prison sentence after a court in Singapore convicted him of challenging the integrity of the city state&apos;s judiciary in a book criticising its use of the death penalty.", "Shadrake faces a custodial sentence or a fine \u2013 or both \u2013 for contempt of court when Singapore&apos;s high court sentences him next week.", "The Singapore constitution does not specify a maximum penalty for the crime, according to reports, although prosecutors are reported to have demanded a prison sentence of between three and six months and an unspecified fine.", "The case has cast further doubt on Singapore&apos;s commitment to freedom of expression.", "The case was brought in response to Shadrake&apos;s book, Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore&apos;s Justice in the Dock, which accuses courts of bowing to diplomatic and economic pressure in deciding how to dispense justice.", "According to Amnesty International, Singapore, with a population of five million, has one of the world&apos;s highest per capita execution rates, having put more than 400 people to death over the past two decades.", "Loh said: &quot;This is a case about someone who says, among other things, the judges in Singapore are not impartial ... and are influenced by political and economic situations and biased against the weak and the poor.&quot; Last month, Singapore&apos;s attorney general&apos;s office described comments in Shadrake&apos;s book as &quot;especially pernicious&quot;, adding that they &quot;cannot possibly come within any reasonable notion of fair criticism&quot;.", "The book, which was published in Malaysia, where Shadrake is based, is reportedly not banned in Singapore, but sellers and distributors will have to seek legal advice before releasing it.", "He was arrested in July while promoting the book in Singapore, and is also being investigated for possible criminal defamation \u2013 a crime carrying a prison sentence of up to two years."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-03T06:13:40Z", "title": "British author faces prison sentence in Singapore", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "Books", "UK news", "Law", "Human rights", "Alan Shadrake", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The British author Alan Shadrake is today facing a possible prison sentence after a court in Singapore convicted him of challenging the integrity of the city state&apos;s judiciary in a book criticising its use of the death penalty.

The judge, Quentin Loh, said he was giving 75-year-old Shadrake &quot;a final opportunity to make amends&quot;. The author, who has refused to apologise, said after the ruling that he would &quot;work out how to do this and satisfy the court&quot;. The case has cast further doubt on Singapore&apos;s commitment to freedom of expression.

The case was brought in response to Shadrake&apos;s book, Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore&apos;s Justice in the Dock, which accuses courts of bowing to diplomatic and economic pressure in deciding how to dispense justice.

I have always wanted to start a piece with the columnist&apos;s favourite cliche. This week, though, it seems surprisingly apposite. Take the finding by a court in Singapore that Alan Shadrake, a British freelance journalist, had scandalised the court and should be punished for contempt. His offence? To write a book accusing judges in Singapore of bowing to diplomatic and economic pressure in deciding how to dispense justice. Either Shadrake&apos;s claims are true, in which case the court should have commended rather than condemned him or they are false, in which case the courts should have ignored them. Judges in Britain would rise above such things. And is it contempt of court to deliberately insert song titles into one&apos;s oral evidence in court? That&apos;s what a police marksman has been accused of doing at the inquest last month of Mark Saunders, the barrister shot dead in 2008 after a stand-off at his home in Chelsea. On Tuesday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would manage an investigation by Scotland Yard into the behaviour of the unnamed officer, one of four who may have fired the fatal shots. Certainly, coroners have the power to imprison witnesses for committing acts inconsistent with the dignity of the court. But quoting song titles in your evidence is inconsistent with the dignity of a police officer, whether done for a dare, a bet or just to show how clever you think you are. For someone who wants to remain a firearms officer, it&apos;s mad. And what are we to make of Louise Casey, appointed by the former justice secretary Jack Straw in March as the first victims&apos; commissioner, and her view that defendants accused of middle-ranking offences should lose the right to trial by jury? Casey&apos;s thinking seems to be that if crimes such as theft were all tried by magistrates, victims would not have to wait so long to give evidence. Ministers are already planning to give defendants a discount of 50% off their sentences for pleading guilty at the earliest possible moment and saving victims from the stress of giving evidence. But abolishing the right to jury trial for large numbers of defendants facing charges of dishonesty is something that no government has managed to get past the voters in recent years. Rightly so. Has Casey ever considered that some defendants may have been wrongly identified by their alleged victims? Or that some alleged victims may act maliciously? So long as jury trial is regarded as the best way of testing allegations against defendants, we must retain it for the most serious cases. And that includes &quot;petty&quot; theft. Shoplifting may be routine for some people. But for those holding down responsible jobs, a conviction for dishonesty may mean the end of a career and perhaps even suicide. Casey would do well to read a stirring defence of democracy by the lord chief justice, delivered during the summer to an audience in the US but released only yesterday. Quoting Lord Devlin&apos;s famous remark that trial by jury is the &quot;lamp by which we know that freedom lives&quot;, Lord Judge said the US and the UK shared the view that &quot;no one should be liable to imprisonment for a serious crime unless he or she has publicly admitted it or sufficient evidence has been produced to enable 12 of his fellow citizens to be convinced of his guilt&quot;. In Judge&apos;s view, &quot;these venerable and venerated concepts are an ineradicable part of the fabric of both our societies&quot;. Casey, it seems, knows better. The one thing this week that isn&apos;t mad is ending the blanket ban on voting by prisoners. As I explained here last month, the government had no choice.

However, the markets seem to think this is quite alright and fighting that appears altogether futile, regardless of how perverse it sounds to cheer on easy credit with full hindsight of what happened between the Dot Com crash and the 2008 meltdown.

Credit Suisse said:  One of the biggest concerns among investors is companies putting potentially risky and value destructive M&amp;A ahead of cash returns. We believe cash returns could now be high up on the agenda for BHP and the blocking of the Potash deal could be the potential cash return catalyst for the sector overall.

Both Airbus and Rolls-Royce, which manufactured the plane&apos;s four engines, have launched investigations. What happened? It is far too early to tell. But what appears clear is that there was a catastrophic failure in the fuselage-side engine on the left wing shortly after the plane took off from Singapore en route to Sydney. Passengers reported hearing loud bangs and seeing flames. Debris which appeared to be from the engine landed on the Indonesian island of Batam, near Singapore. The plane returned to Singapore and landed safely. What was the damage to the plane? Aviation experts believe that as well as the engine losing its protective cowling, sections of turbine blade sheared off. A photograph taken by a passenger from inside the plane shows a small hole in the left wing, possibly caused by flying debris. When the plane landed, the adjoining engine, on the edge of the wing, seemingly could not be shut off and was doused by firefighters, indicating possible damage to the plane&apos;s controls. Who is responsible? The vast Trent 900 engines are manufactured by Rolls-Royce in Derby, and it is the British engine manufacturer which is immediately in the spotlight. &quot;This incident is a particular worry for Rolls-Royce, and I think they&apos;re got some explaining to do,&quot; one aviation analyst said, speaking anonymously. Although Qantas was ordered to upgrade maintenance procedures two years ago after an oxygen tank exploded in one of the airline&apos;s Boeing 747s, rupturing the fuselage, maintenance is thought less likely to be a cause of today&apos;s incident. This is partly because the engine was so new \u2013 the plane was built in 2008 \u2013 and because engines on long-haul planes endure less strain as they undergo fewer take-offs and landings. What has been the response? Rolls-Royce said it would help with investigations but would not comment further until it knew more. The company&apos;s major concern will be to discover whether the engine failure was a one-off incident caused perhaps by a manufacturing error, or if it could be due to a more general fault with the design. Qantas grounded its six A380s, followed soon afterwards by Singapore Airlines. But the other airlines that operate the vast planes \u2013 Air France, Lufthansa and Emirates \u2013 will continue using them. There is less of an issue for Emirates as its A380s are fitted with different engines, the Engine Alliance GP7000 made by the US firms General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. How serious was the incident? A380s can operate safely on just two engines and some experts say there was no real danger. But others caution that it was more potentially dangerous than it might first appear, particularly given that sections of the blown engine could have caused more damage to the wing and that controls for the adjoining engine seem to have been damaged. &quot;It sounds like it might have been pretty hairy stuff. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it turns out the crew did an exceptional job landing the plane,&quot; one aviation analyst said. How often do such engine blowouts happen? They are rare, and when they do take place they tend not to cause fatalities. A lot of this is due to changes introduced after the tail-mounted third engine of a United Airlines DC-10 blew up in 1989, hurling debris through hydraulic lines and crippling the plane&apos;s controls. The plane broke up on landing at Sioux City, Iowa, killing 112 of the 296 passengers and crew on board. Since then airlines have been designed so such engine blowouts are less likely to damage control systems."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/04/qantas-a380-passengers-horror", "sentences": ["     Passengers aboard a Qantas Airways superjumbo forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore today spoke of their horror as they heard a loud bang and watched pieces of engine fall from the plane soon after it took off for Sydney.", "Officials from Singapore Airlines also announced that it would delay all flights of its Airbus A380 fleet.", "The flight, which originated in London, experienced engine problems over western Indonesia at about 10am local time, before making an emergency landing at Singapore&apos;s Changi airport almost two hours after it took off.", "I travel a lot and this is the first big scare I&apos;ve had.&quot; Sandberg said the captain had kept passengers updated throughout the plane&apos;s return to Singapore.", "&quot;My whole body just went to jelly and I didn&apos;t know what was going to happen as we were going down, if we were going to be OK.&quot; Transport officials in Singapore quickly ruled out a link between the incident and volcanic ash spewing from Mount Merapi, which has erupted several times in recent days.", "The sky over Singapore and Sumatra island is free of dust.&quot; A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said an investigation was under way: &quot;The investigation is at an early stage.", "We are aware of the situation and are working with our client.&quot; The Foreign Office confirmed that a number of British people had been aboard the flight and said they were being offered consular assistance by the British high commission in Singapore.", "As Qantas announced the launch of a full investigation, other operators of the A380 \u2013 Singapore Airlines, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and Emirates \u2013 said they had no plans to ground their fleets.", "An engine malfunction forced a Singapore Airlines A380 to return to Paris mid-flight in September 2009, and in March this year two tyres burst on a Qantas A380 as it landed in Sydney after a flight from Singapore.", "About the Airbus A380\u2022 Number in operation: 37 \u2022 Total orders: 234 \u2022 Number of airports it regularly flies to: 26 \u2022 Five airlines operating the plane: Singapore Airlines (11 aircraft), Emirates (13), Qantas (6), Air France (4), Lufthansa (3) \u2022 Engines: Four."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-04T15:42:00Z", "title": "Qantas A380 passengers tell of horror as engine failed", "tags": ["Air transport", "Airbus", "Airline industry", "Australia news", "Singapore", "World news", "Business", "Travel", "Asia Pacific", "Qantas"], "article": "     Passengers aboard a Qantas Airways superjumbo forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore today spoke of their horror as they heard a loud bang and watched pieces of engine fall from the plane soon after it took off for Sydney.

So we are obviously taking it very seriously, because it is a significant engine failure.&quot; Pieces of debris thought to have come from the aircraft were found on the Indonesian island of Batam, according to local reports. Passengers recalled the moment one of the plane&apos;s four Rolls-Royce engines exploded. &quot;I was on the plane right next to engine two, which exploded with a loud bang within the first 10-15 minutes of takeoff,&quot; Lars Sandberg, a DJ who was due to tour Australia, told the BBC. &quot;I thought something had fallen down in cargo underneath the plane, but the plane started shaking \u2026 I&apos;m a little bit shaken up. I travel a lot and this is the first big scare I&apos;ve had.&quot; Sandberg said the captain had kept passengers updated throughout the plane&apos;s return to Singapore. &quot;[He] did a good job in reassuring us, making announcements every few minutes. I&apos;m just happy to be alive and back in the terminal building.&quot; Another passenger, Tyler Wooster, said the explosion sounded &quot;like a shotgun going off&quot;. &quot;Part of the skin had peeled off and you could see the foam underneath, pieces of broken wires sticking out,&quot; he told Australia&apos;s Network Nine television. &quot;My whole body just went to jelly and I didn&apos;t know what was going to happen as we were going down, if we were going to be OK.&quot; Transport officials in Singapore quickly ruled out a link between the incident and volcanic ash spewing from Mount Merapi, which has erupted several times in recent days. &quot;The shutdown of the Qantas engine had no connection with Mount Merapi,&quot; Bambang Ervan, a transport ministry spokesman, said. &quot;It was too far from the volcano. The sky over Singapore and Sumatra island is free of dust.&quot; A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said an investigation was under way: &quot;The investigation is at an early stage. We are aware of the situation and are working with our client.&quot; The Foreign Office confirmed that a number of British people had been aboard the flight and said they were being offered consular assistance by the British high commission in Singapore. The incident is among the most serious to have affected the A380 \u2013 touted as the most economical and quietest as well as largest aircraft in the world \u2013 since it went into commercial service three years ago. Qantas and British Airways, with whom the Australian airline has a joint ticket-selling and code-sharing arrangement, are expected to fly large numbers of cricket fans to Australia in the coming days to watch the Ashes. A BA spokeswoman said the airline was in talks with Qantas about the possibility of taking on extra passengers. But she added: &quot;We don&apos;t have a huge amount of spare capacity at the moment.&quot; Neil Shephard, a former aircraft engineer who was on the flight, said the plane had circled for about an hour to dump fuel before making the emergency landing. &quot;During the landing, it was a bit wobbly,&quot; he said. &quot;We could not tell the extent of the problem until we got out of the plane, where we could see one hole around six to seven inches wide on the wing. The pilot did a good job. It could have been worse.&quot; Fellow passenger Ulf Waschbusch said he said he saw debris pierce the plane&apos;s wings about five minutes after takeoff. &quot;I saw pieces of the engine, the number three engine, fly off the wing through the wing itself and short bursts of flames for about a second or two,&quot; he said on ITV&apos;s Daybreak. &quot;It was one of the scariest things I have ever seen on an aircraft.&quot; While Qantas denied there had been an explosion, people on the ground in Batam confirmed passenger accounts of the incident, saying they heard a loud bang as the plane flew overhead. &quot;There were metal shards coming down from the sky,&quot; one witness told the AFP news agency. Burn marks were visible on the engine closest to the fuselage on the plane&apos;s left wing, while a section of plate carrying the airline&apos;s red kangaroo logo was missing. As Qantas announced the launch of a full investigation, other operators of the A380 \u2013 Singapore Airlines, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and Emirates \u2013 said they had no plans to ground their fleets. The incident comes as Qantas, which has an impressive safety record, prepares to celebrate its 90th anniversary. Neither the airline nor the A380 has ever suffered a fatality, but the incident will inevitably raise questions about the aircraft&apos;s safety as it comes after a string of problems. An engine malfunction forced a Singapore Airlines A380 to return to Paris mid-flight in September 2009, and in March this year two tyres burst on a Qantas A380 as it landed in Sydney after a flight from Singapore. About the Airbus A380\u2022 Number in operation: 37 \u2022 Total orders: 234 \u2022 Number of airports it regularly flies to: 26 \u2022 Five airlines operating the plane: Singapore Airlines (11 aircraft), Emirates (13), Qantas (6), Air France (4), Lufthansa (3) \u2022 Engines: Four.

But Rolls-Royce missed out following the dramatic failure of one of its Trent engines on a Qantas superjumbo. The Airbus A380 - en route from London to Sydney - was forced into an emergency landing in Singapore in the early hours of this morning, prompting Qantas and Sinagpore Airlines to suspend flights using the plane. Rolls advised other airlines to check their own Trent engines for possible problems. The failure comes as another embarrassment for Rolls after a test engine for Boeing&apos;s 787 Dreamliner blew up at the company&apos;s site in Derby. It ended as the day&apos;s biggest faller in the leading index, down 33p to 621.5p and wiping more than \u00a3600m off its market value. Howard Wheeldon of BGC Partners said:  Clearly whilst there is some justification for concern particularly for the engine maker we do not believe that the event will cause damage to prospects for further A380 sales. However, we suspect that given the fact that Rolls-Royce has recently suffered a separate well publicised incident on a test Boeing 787 engine it is likely that sentiment is likely to remain subdued on the shares until investors have sight of an initial report on the incident cause.  Overall, investors gave the thumbs up to Fed chairman Ben Bernanke&apos;s new programme of quantitative easing although some analysts predicted more might be needed. Credit Suisse said in a note:  We believe the Fed has effectively committed to purchasing assets until inflation returns to its target range of 1.5% to 2%. We believe this requires GDP growth of at least 4% over the next few years \u2013 and that, hence, the announced $600bn of QE will be extended by some $500bn to $750bn.  News that US claims for unemployment benefit rose by more than expected last week - ahead of tomorrow&apos;s widely watched non-farm payroll numbers - did little to dent confidence. Nor did the fact that the Bank of England and European Central Bank declined to follow the Fed&apos;s lead with more QE of their own. So the FTSE 100 climbed 113.82 points to 5862.79, its highest level since June 9 2008, while Wall Street had risen nearly 200 points by the time London closed. Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index, said:  Traders bought heavily into equities today as a knee jerk reaction to the Federal Reserve announcing a second round of quantitative easing of $600bn, slightly higher than initially speculated by the market. This is the first time the Fed has acted to stimulate an economy that was already growing. The key is that it is acting to prevent that growth from slowing and stagnating, which is a fairly aggressive stance and raises confidence that Bernanke is doing everything he can to keep the US economic recovery on track. It is however too early to come to the conclusion that today&apos;s equity market reaction is a large scale vote of confidence that the Fed has made the right choice. Inevitably there are likely to be further implications to the currency wars, however, should the Japanese central bank [which meets tomorrow morning] bring forward its own large scale of monetary easing.   Miners were among the main gainers, partly as a consequence of the Fed&apos;s QE announcement. The US move sent the dollar lower which in turn boosted metal and oil prices. So Xstrata added 90p to 1366.5p while Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation rose 61.5p to 949.5p. BHP Billiton was 150p better at \u00a324.30, following Canada&apos;s decision to block its bid for Potash Corporation. Analysts said BHP may now use its cash for share buybacks rather than attempt any more major acquisitions. Banks also benefited, with Barclays up 7.7p to 287.1p and Royal Bank of Scotland rising 1.97p to 47.14p. A number of positive results also helped sentiment, including hedge fund group Man, 37.1p higher at 290.8p, consumer goods group Unilever, up 114p to \u00a319.24 and Tate and Lyle closing 34.2p ahead at 524.5p. Housebuilders shook off the general gloom surrounding the sector after a Halifax survey showed prices rising by 1.8% in October. Taylor Wimpey rose 1.93p to 25.02p, while Persimmon put on 25.7p to 362.2p. But Panmure Gordon said:  The key drivers of the housing market remain consumer confidence and mortgage lending and we will see little progress in market conditions until these factors are both favourable. Our central case remains that new build output will remain stable (at 50% of the normal build level) with prices edging off slightly in the second half of 2010 and 2011.   Kenmare Resources led the FTSE 250 risers, up 2p to 23p after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch began coverage of the titanium minerals miner with a buy recommendation and 30p price target, saying it was a potential takeover target. The bank said:  We believe Kenmare has reached a turning point having achieved its rated production capacity in August 2010. In addition, Kenmare has secured the necessary funding ($245m) for phase two expansion of the Moma mine in Mozambique (adding 50% to existing capacity). We expect the shares to re-rate as the project is de-risked and investors become more comfortable with the company&apos;s ability to deliver on stated goals.   The company&apos;s shares came under pressure recently when a flood of water, sand and clay from Moma hit a nearby village, leaving a four year old girl missing presumed dead. On Aim, recruitment consultancy Highams Systems rose by a third, up 1p to 4p, after half year pretax profits tripled to \u00a3123,000, prompting a buy note from Seymour Pierce. Analyst Caroline de La Soujeole said:  These figures are in line with our expectations and we therefore make no changes to our 2011 forecasts, expecting pretax profits of \u00a30.31m implying a stronger second half than the first half. We believe this is achievable given the recent addition of new sales staff.  Furthermore, the company&apos;s statement indicated that it was continuing to see an improvement in demand for its services and is confident that the second half of the year will continue to show improvement in turnover and profit. We retain our buy recommendation and 4.5p target price. The shares are trading on a PE of 7.6 times 2011 estimated profit which is undemanding for this specialised operator which has a strong client base...in a niche market with solid growth drivers.

Another passenger, Lars Sandberg, told the BBC that the captain kept passengers updated throughout. &quot;[He] did a good job in reassuring us, making announcements every few minutes. I&apos;m just happy to be alive and back in the terminal building.&quot; While the passengers&apos; ordeal was over, it is another matter for Airbus, and particularly for Rolls-Royce, one of two rival companies supplying engines for the A380. The British company powers the superjumbos used by Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa, while the US group Engine Alliance fits A380s used by Air France and Emirates. Investigators from Airbus, the European Air Safety Agency and France&apos;s civil aviation watchdog \u2013 Airbus is based in France \u2013 were last night travelling to Singapore to examine the plane. Aviation experts described it as the most serious incident involving an A380 \u2013 touted as the most economical and quietest as well as the largest aircraft in the world \u2013 since the plane went into commercial service three years ago. &quot;It appears from the images of the plane that one of the engines has experienced a failure, and it looks to be a fairly massive internal failure at that,&quot; said P\u00e9ter Marossz\u00e9ky, a former airline engineer now at the University of New South Wales in Australia. &quot;This type of incident has been seen previously but it was a long time ago and with much older planes than the A380.&quot; Another analyst, who asked not to be named, said photographs of the debris on Batam appeared to show that sections of turbine blade had sheared off, as well as the engine&apos;s protective casing. While the A380 is designed to fly safely on two engines, the analyst said such an engine failure was deeply worrying. &quot;If I was Rolls-Royce I would be very alarmed at this,&quot; he said. &quot;They will need to carefully check the manufacturing records to see whether something went wrong with this particular engine or whether it&apos;s a more general fault.&quot; After the airliner landed, firefighters surrounded it, pouring water over the other left-side engine, which seemingly could not be shut down manually, perhaps indicating damage to a control system. Rolls-Royce issued a statement which said that it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; at such a &quot;very early stage&quot; to draw any conclusions from the incident. But it is the second safety scare to affect its engines in a few months. In August, a $17m Trent 1000 engine, also made at Rolls-Royce&apos;s plant in Derby, suffered an &quot;uncontained failure&quot; during testing for the new Boeing Dreamliner 787 plane. A month later, Boeing delayed the delivery date for its first Dreamliner after Rolls-Royce said it could not provide an engine for test flights this autumn. Yesterday&apos;s incident is a potentially significant blow to one of the last surviving British titans of industry, which prides itself on its global reputation for engineering excellence. As Rolls-Royce shares dropped in value by 5% in London, on the other side of the Atlantic those of General Electric, its biggest rival and a partner in Engine Alliance, rose by 2.6%. Rolls-Royce is one of the UK&apos;s largest employers, with 11,000 at its Derby site alone.

But her birth 10 days ago in the southern Spanish city of Jerez has provoked a storm \u2013 because her mother is just 10 years old. What has shocked the rest of the world, however, is described as a happy event by the family. &quot;My daughter is well, as is the little girl \u2013 who is very fine and pretty. She is very happy with her daughter,&quot; the baby&apos;s Romanian grandmother, Olimpia, told Spanish journalists. &quot;This is not a drama, it is a cause for happiness. At this age we marry in Romania. It is normal amongst we Gypsies.&quot; Can that really be true? Recorded examples suggest that mothers this young tend to be victims of abuse or rape. And what does Nicoletta&apos;s birth say about everything from the increasingly early development of young girls&apos; bodies and the cultural norms of Romania&apos;s Roma community to the laws in Spain, where the child gave birth? Doctors at the hospital in Jerez confirmed that the family had been pleased at the birth. Both the child-mother and the grandmother took it in their stride, and there had been no need for a caesarean. The hospital apparently knew nothing about the pregnancy until the mother turned up on 26 October. The father is said to be another minor, an unnamed Romanian boy aged 13. The relationship is now described as &quot;over&quot; by Olimpia. Under Spanish law, the age for consensual sex with an adult is 13 \u2013 one of the world&apos;s lowest. And, in a measure apparently maintained for Spain&apos;s own Gypsy community, the law allows a 14-year-old to marry if a judge decides there are exceptional circumstances. The United Nations has called on Spain to raise that age. But the law has little to say about consensual sex among minors (those under the age of 18), nor the responsibility or otherwise of the parents. A magistrate in the provincial capital of Seville this week opened an investigation \u2013 but apparently only to find out why the mother had not been going to school and had not visited a doctor before the birth. Little is known of the details of the young mother&apos;s journey from pregnancy to childbirth. Some reports say that she arrived in Spain only three weeks ago, apparently to attend a wedding. &quot;The mother of the young girl says they came for a wedding and that she had got pregnant in Romania,&quot; explains a town hall spokeswoman in Lebrija, where the family is living. Attempts to paint the family as welfare scroungers have failed. &quot;We have money, a home, electricity and water, so we do not need anything from the Spanish government,&quot; says Olimpia. The child&apos;s mother herself stepped out of their small apartment on Wednesday to take her baby to the local heath clinic. The girl wore a loose pink top and a flowing red dress, and her family placed a cloth over her head to protect her from photographers. &quot;She is scared they will take her baby away,&quot; says Maria, a fellow Romanian who lives in the same apartment block. &quot;The family is worried about what might happen, so they have stopped opening the door to people.&quot; The baby&apos;s grandmother has been living in Lebrija for a while. Authorities seemed so stunned by the birth that they did not know what to do. The hospital released mother and child after four days. Only later did the local social services say they were investigating to see whether the baby would be properly looked after. Mayoress Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez said the family had never visited the local health centre before, but confirmed that the baby was doing fine. Robert Rustem, of the European Roma and Travellers Forum based in Brussels, says the case is exceptional and does not reflect practices in Romania or anywhere else. &quot;I was aware of some cases of children of 15 giving birth, but it the first time I have heard of a birth to a 10-year-old. This is not an example of what happens in the entire community, though there are cases of early marriages \u2013 which we do not support \u2013 in certain communities. At the end of the day, it is really a decision of the girl and the parents \u2013 who are the guardians. The girl is a minor so her parents are the ones who must take responsibility.&quot; But he adds, &quot;It is not acceptable that a girl at the age of 10 is giving birth to a baby. She is still a child and still developing as a person. Early marriage fosters the gap between communities and reinforces the cycle of poverty.&quot; Doctors warn of the physical dangers to children whose own bodies are still growing. &quot;If the mother has not completed her physical development or does not have the right nutrition to cope with the deficiencies caused by her age and condition, the consequences can be grave,&quot; gynaecologist De Manuel Alonso told El Pa\u00eds. &quot;Even if the body is ready, a young girl is not mentally prepared to become a mother,&quot; warned child psychologist Carolina Fern\u00e1ndez. In Lebrija some of the neighbours have questioned the girl&apos;s age. &quot;She looks much older,&quot; said one. But the early onset of puberty among young girls is increasing across Europe. Little Nicoletta&apos;s case is by no means unique in Spain, where abortions were performed on two girls aged nine and 10 in 2008 \u2013 the last year for which data is available. Wikipedia \u2013 an admittedly unscientific source \u2013 lists 22 recorded cases of births to girls aged 10 and under around the world. The youngest was the extraordinary case of a six-year-old Peruvian, who suffered precocious puberty and gave birth to a healthy boy by caesarean in 1939. That birth warranted a mention in Time magazine. Of the 22 cases, there are five births to nine-year-olds from Brazil, Thailand, China, Singapore and Rwanda over the past decade. Four 10-year-olds from the United States are also on the list, including two in the last four years. The increasingly early onset of puberty will inevitably bring earlier pregnancies, says Tam Fry, of Britain&apos;s Child Growth Foundation. &quot;This is an indication of how girls are going into puberty uncommonly early,&quot; he says. Child obesity and hormone-laden chemicals that have got into the food or water cycle have been blamed for this. But while doctors disagree about the cause, the results are clear. Breast development, the first sign of the arrival of puberty, has moved forward nine months since 1958, according to Peter Hindmarsh, professor of paediatric endocrinology at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The current average age for the onset of puberty for girls is 10.75. &quot;The UK has a history of an increasing number of teenage pregnancies,&quot; says Fry. &quot;My view, without having any figures to back it up, is that they are getting earlier and earlier . . .&quot;I would be worried sick if I were a parent of these girls.

The warning came as a second Qantas jet \u2013 a Boeing 747-400 also powered by Rolls-Royce technology \u2013 returned to Singapore&apos;s Changi airport after reporting an engine problem shortly after take-off today . Qantas said the second incident was not serious \u2013 but it was enough to trigger a further sell-off in Rolls-Royce shares, which closed down 5% for the second day running, a 48-hour period that has wiped \u00a31.2bn off the group&apos;s value. Joe Lampel, a professor at Cass Business School in London, said Rolls-Royce was a serious competitor to the US engine makers GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney, forming a rivalry that mirrored the tensions between the US giant Boeing and Europe&apos;s Airbus. &quot;The news [of Thursday&apos;s emergency landing] is attracting a lot of attention in North America, where the parallels between BP and Rolls-Royce are not too far from the mind of some observers,&quot; said Lampel, speaking before the second incident. &quot;Both companies are some of the best-known global British brands, and both challenge American competitors. &quot;In the case of BP, the company took the brunt for general distrust of deep sea oil drilling, arguably in a way that would not have been the case had the same incident happened to a large American oil company. &quot;In the case of Rolls-Royce, the incident must be seen in the context of long-standing competitive rivalry between Boeing and Airbus, and between Pratt &amp; Whitney/GE and Rolls-Royce.&quot; The comments came as one analyst warned that the US federal aviation administration (FAA) could announce restrictions on A380s by the end of this week unless the manufacturer could allay fears about the engines. Rolls-Royce is one of the last surviving British titans of industry and prides itself on its global reputation for engineering excellence. But the latest \u2013 and most serious \u2013 fault with one of its aircraft engines has rattled the industry and the company&apos;s shareholders. Shares in its biggest rival, General Electric, rose in the wake of the A380 incident as investors bet that the US company would take more lucrative engine orders for the A380. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, increased the pressure on the engineering group when he said the explosion of one of the Airbus superjumbo&apos;s four engines above Indonesia was &quot;an engine issue&quot; and was not linked to the airworthiness of the aviation industry&apos;s most modern passenger plane. &quot;We believe this is most likely some kind of material failure or a design issue,&quot; he added. The A380, fitted with Trent 900 engines, was carrying 466 passengers and crew when the incident occurred over western Indonesia. The plane made an emergency landing at Changi airport. No one was injured. According to reports, the Boeing jet involved in the second incident was equipped with Rolls-Royce engines, but they were not from the Trent family. Joyce made his comments as one City analyst said Rolls-Royce &quot;must be praying&quot; that the fault is limited to an individual engine and not the whole Trent 900 class. Julian Tolley, the head of research at HB Markets, said any link to the failure in August of a Trent 1000 engine that was being tested as part of the Boeing Dreamliner programme could heighten doubts about the technology behind the engines. &quot;Rolls-Royce must be praying that it&apos;s a fault linked to that engine ... if they cannot, then an in-depth investigation will be costly for future sales,&quot; he said. &quot;Should it be linked to the Trent 100 problems as well, then people may start worrying regarding the advanced technology and design used for these technically advanced engines.&quot; Tolley added that the FAA might announce restrictions on A380s by the end of this week unless Rolls-Royce could ease fears about its engines. The Trent and RB211 engines account for nearly two-thirds of the \u00a34.5bn in annual revenues generated by Rolls-Royce&apos;s aerospace division. In a statement today , Airbus said it had asked all owners of the aircraft with Rolls-Royce turbines, including Singapore Airlines and Germany&apos;s Lufthansa, to conduct engine checks &quot;to ensure continuous safe operations of the fleet&quot;. The Qantas incident also reignited an industrial dispute between the airline and the Australian aircraft engineering union, which has been campaigning against the outsourcing of maintenance work. Joyce said the A380 involved in the engine blowout recently underwent a maintenance check by Lufthansa Technik in Germany, while the Rolls-Royce engines had been scrutinised at Rolls-Royce facilities. &quot;To suggest that Lufthansa and Rolls-Royce do not have the expertise and experience to undertake the highest quality checks is ludicrous,&quot; he added. Rolls-Royce said it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; at such a &quot;very early stage&quot; to draw any conclusions from the incident."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/05/damien-comolli-john-henry-liverpool", "sentences": ["When I saw the support the club had in Singapore a few years ago, that&apos;s the tip of the iceberg.&quot; He also admitted that a global footprint was even more important for Liverpool than their rivals."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-05T22:30:02Z", "title": "Recruitment of Damien Comolli is first step in Anfield revolution", "tags": ["Liverpool", "John W Henry", "Football", "Damien Comolli"], "article": "Liverpool&apos;s new owners have vowed to vastly boost revenues from their global fanbase and welcomed Uefa&apos;s forthcoming financial fair-play rules as the key to transforming the club&apos;s fortunes. John W Henry, the club&apos;s principal owner, said this week&apos;s appointment of Damien Comolli as director of football strategy was the first step in putting together a new structure that would still have Roy Hodgson at its core. &quot;We are building an infrastructure, we&apos;re building a team,&quot; Henry said. &quot;In Boston, we have a collegiate atmosphere and we build consensus,&quot; he added, referring to the Boston Red Sox, which New England Sports Ventures also owns, as the model. &quot;We don&apos;t change coaches very often. Stability is very important in an organisation. Roy has been unfairly criticised. He didn&apos;t build this team and it takes time for a new manager and a club to really click.&quot; Henry said Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A&apos;s baseball team and the inspiration for the book Moneyball and a forthcoming film of the same name, recommended Comolli for the job. Hodgson was not consulted but was &quot;delighted&quot; with the choice of the former Spurs director of football, Henry said. Tom Werner, the US media executive who will shortly take over as Liverpool chairman from Martin Broughton, and Henry also admitted that redeveloping Anfield or building a new stadium would inevitably mean taking on fresh debt at a club where the borrowings of the previous owners provoked a state of open revolt. Henry said he was confident fans would be able to distinguish between acquisition debt of the kind taken on by Tom Hicks and George Gillett and borrowing money to rebuild the stadium or finance a new one. &quot;I don&apos;t think Arsenal fans are complaining because they used debt to build the Emirates,&quot; Henry said. &quot;I think fans all understand that stadium debt is different to acquisition debt.&quot; Their track record at the Red Sox, where &quot;every dollar&quot; of profit has been reinvested, should give fans comfort, he\u00a0said. Werner said he had recently met Liverpool city council&apos;s leader, Joe Anderson, to discuss the stadium. Werner said it was &quot;too soon&quot; to come to any conclusion, but conceded ground-sharing with Everton would be &quot;enormously unpopular&quot; with some fans and was &quot;not our favourite way to go&quot;. The pair spoke of their admiration for the &quot;sustainable&quot; Arsenal model, while Werner said there was &quot;enormous potential&quot; for growing commercial revenues in Asia and elsewhere. &quot;We consider Liverpool to have untapped potential globally and we&apos;re focused on how to increase revenues so we can compete with Man United and Arsenal and Chelsea,&quot; Werner said. &quot;One place we&apos;ve been focused on is Asia. We&apos;re making a trip there after the season ends. When I saw the support the club had in Singapore a few years ago, that&apos;s the tip of the iceberg.&quot; He also admitted that a global footprint was even more important for Liverpool than their rivals. &quot;We don&apos;t have the wealth London has. If we were Chelsea or Arsenal, we&apos;d concentrate on London but we can&apos;t concentrate on Liverpool when it comes to generating the kind of revenues that will compete with other clubs.&quot; Henry said Uefa&apos;s impending financial fair play rules, which will be introduced in 2012-13 and eventually require clubs to break even on football operations, had been a key factor in persuading NESV to buy the club. He said they would leave Liverpool much better-placed to compete with such clubs as Manchester City and Chelsea: &quot;They are operating under the current rules. The rules are going to change.&quot; The commodities trader, who won a bitter battle with Hicks and Gillett to take control of the club, admitted he was &quot;upset&quot; with suggestions that Fernando Torres and Jos\u00e9 Reina could leave in January and insisted there was money for Hodgson to spend if required. &quot;Tell me what the opportunities are going to be in January and I&apos;ll tell you how much we&apos;re spending,&quot; he said. &quot;I was heartened by the response and by the intelligence of these players. They really understand what Liverpool is about, perhaps more than we do. They were good discussions.&quot; Comolli will be tasked with developing more homegrown players and bringing down the wage bill. Werner said: &quot;There is a lot of work to be done. We feel we can do a better job bringing in more players that are homegrown and we can improve our system. It&apos;s a big job to bring in players and analyse the quality of players coming up. We are trying to bolster Roy&apos;s operation and Damien is a first step.&quot; Henry said the size of the Anfield wage bill had shocked him, as had the power wielded by players on this side of the Atlantic. &quot;There were a number of unpleasant surprises during our due diligence. The wage bill is high, it&apos;s going to be higher next year and we&apos;re not a young team. That was disappointing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a completely different system here from what we&apos;re used to. If a player has a contract in the US, they fulfil the contract. Over here, it seems players have much more say so. We don&apos;t want players who don&apos;t want to be here. It&apos;s up to us to provide the leadership and make sure we have the right people on and off the field so that every player and every potential player wants to be there.&quot; Henry and Werner said the statistics-based approach expounded by Beane was something they would try and import to the less ordered world of football economics. &quot;In the US, we&apos;re thought of as Moneyball type people in that we use statistics above everything else. Our philosophy isn&apos;t that statistics mean everything, but it&apos;s a valuable tool,&quot; said Henry. &quot;If you can find any objective measures, you&apos;re going to use them. The problem is finding relevant data that is meaningful. That might be difficult in football.&quot; Werner said the objective was clear: &quot;When we arrived in Boston they hadn&apos;t won in more than 80 years. We knew that our job was to win more than one World Series. We know coming in here that since the Premier League was created we haven&apos;t won. That&apos;s what our charge is, first and foremost.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/06/renewed-marriage-vows-50-times", "sentences": ["We had one wedding in England and another in Australia, so\u00a0we&apos;d already renewed our vows once by the time we went on honeymoon in Singapore and Indonesia."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-06T00:02:01Z", "title": "Experience: I've renewed my wedding vows more than 50 times", "tags": ["Marriage", "Relationships", "Life and style"], "article": "When I moved from Australia to England nine years ago, my mum said, &quot;Denise, don&apos;t go falling in love with an Englishman \u2013 I&apos;ll never see you again.&quot; I had no plans to move permanently, but after university I\u00a0was offered a job I could not resist at a charity in London. Mike was volunteering with the same charity and we hit it off straight away, though it took me six months to ask him out. We&apos;d been together for seven years by the time we got married. We had one wedding in England and another in Australia, so\u00a0we&apos;d already renewed our vows once by the time we went on honeymoon in Singapore and Indonesia. We hadn&apos;t travelled much in the years we&apos;d been together, but the honeymoon planted the bug. We&apos;d always hoped to take time off work at some point and see more of the world, and when a friend texted to say, &quot;I&apos;ve found you the perfect job&quot;, I was curious. The job entailed travelling round the world for six months, testing the best honeymoon and wedding destinations. There were 30,000 applications \u2013 luckily, ours was one of the first, and I think we said the right things at the right time. At first, our idea of renewing our vows in each location we visited was just a bit of fun \u2013 a way of giving the trip a twist. In New York, we were married at the top of the Empire State Building and in the back of a yellow cab, by a spiritualist minister. At one point, we had 10 weddings in a single week. A slight sense of Groundhog Day did start to set in eventually, particularly given Mike&apos;s repeated joke of turning to me before each and every vow and saying, &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; But when people turn up to watch, it seems only right to make an effort, even if we&apos;ve only had 20 minutes&apos; notice. Mike finds that situation easier, of course, because he only has to slip on a suit, whereas I have to struggle with make-up and hair each time. It&apos;s not a legal ceremony \u2013 anyone can perform it \u2013 but it should ideally be someone with a high standing in the community. We&apos;ve had hotel managers, local politicians, tour guides and athletes. We almost had Jedward lined up to marry us at one point, but in the end our schedule didn&apos;t quite match up with theirs \u2013 I\u00a0think I may have been more disappointed than Mike about that. In Kenya we were married in front of a Masai tribe by three elders. We hadn&apos;t expected it \u2013 we thought our hotel&apos;s manager was going to perform the ceremony, and it was only when three Masai warriors arrived to escort us from our room and we walked outside to hear singing that we realised something else entirely had been planned on our behalf. We don&apos;t want to tarnish the memory of our &quot;real&quot; weddings, and 50 renewals down the line, of course, it&apos;s not special every time. Some ceremonies don&apos;t take place in ideal circumstances \u2013 in Jordan, we&apos;d been camping for a week in the hot sun, without showers, when we mentioned to the team leader that we wanted to renew our vows. He called his cousin and got him to go to buy us robes, got us dressed, made sure our turbans were wound right \u2013 there&apos;s something very moving about the amount of effort some people have made for us. In Bali, a\u00a0canopy had been built for us that had clearly taken hours, complete with an aisle of perfect, symmetrically placed frangipanis. In those sorts of situations, it&apos;s impossible to become blas\u00e9 about what we&apos;re doing. I do often feel genuinely emotional \u2013 sometimes I even feel myself holding back from it, as if I shouldn&apos;t cry like I did at the first two weddings. My favourites so far are the two neo-pagan ceremonies, one\u00a0in Ireland and the other on the Arran Islands, conducted by a druid\u00a0priest where our hands were bound together. Some friends and family members have voiced their concern that this is an unrealistic start to married life, that living in one place again with office-based jobs and responsibilities will seem terribly flat in comparison. But I can&apos;t imagine wanting to continue repeating our vows once our six months are up, and in four months we&apos;ve probably spent no more than an hour apart \u2013 I suppose that&apos;s pretty intense. When we go back to work \u2013 proper work, in separate offices \u2013 I probably will miss Mike. On the other hand, it might be\u00a0nice to be able to say, &quot;Guess what I did today?&quot; rather than, &quot;I do.&quot; \u2022 As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

For six weeks I made my way through England, France, Spain, Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and the US without carrying so much as a man-purse or a bum-bag. The few items I did bring (including a toothbrush, an iPod, and a few extra items of clothing) were tucked away in my pockets. Along the way I learned a thing or two about improvisation, hygiene, and what is and isn&apos;t necessary when travelling the world. When I announced my intention to circumnavigate the globe without luggage, the common (and admittedly reasonable) reaction from friends and family was: why? I usually answered that I&apos;d always liked to travel light, and that going without any bags at all sounded like a fun challenge. But beyond the stunt-like nature of the trip, I wanted to know how travelling ultra-light would affect my time on the road. At the heart of my whimsical journey was an experiment that would test out a more philosophical idea: that what we experience in life is more important than what we bring with us. In order to document this experiment, I travelled with a cameraman, my friend Justin Glow, who shot and edited three webisodes each week for my No Baggage Challenge blog. Justin brought a bag for his camera equipment and his stuff, though according to the rules I set up for the trip, I wasn&apos;t allowed to borrow any of his items, or store any of my items with him. These rules also stipulated that I couldn&apos;t mail things to myself along the route \u2013 though I could buy items along the way (such as a mineral-salt deodorant I picked up in Fez), and I could borrow items from locals or other travellers (an option I only used once \u2013 borrowing a sweater and stocking cap to keep warm in New Zealand). Naturally, my packing list had to be simple. In addition to the clothes on my back (cargo pants, boots, socks/underwear, T-shirt) I brought a toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste, a small deodorant stick, two small bottles of concentrated liquid soap, sunglasses, a small tube of sunscreen, an iPod touch and foldable Bluetooth keyboard, a small digital camera, a small flashlight, a credit/cash card, and my passport. All of these items fitted, along with a change of socks, underwear, and T-shirt, into the inner pockets of a jacket/vest. All told, my total kit weighed less than two kilos. In the early days of my journey, when I left New York for London and made my way overland into France and Spain, my biggest challenges weren&apos;t logistical so much as psychological. It took me nearly a week to get past the nagging, instinctive fear that I had forgotten my bag someplace \u2013 and on more than one occasion I found myself looking around under bus seats or in my hotel room for luggage that did not exist. Since even my friends had insisted that my no-baggage strategy would leave me (and my clothing) smelling horrible after a few days, I immediately got into the habit of showering twice a day, and washing my clothes each night before I went to bed. For the first two days this felt like a slight hassle, but in time it became a part of my daily routine, as instinctive as brushing my teeth. The advantages of travelling without luggage became apparent on the first day of the journey, during a four-hour layover in London. Had I been carrying bags, I probably would have gone straight from Heathrow to St Pancras and waited for my Paris-bound train \u2013 but without luggage I was able to storm into the heart of London and get a three-hour taste of the city before moving on. Just over a week later, I ended up going to the wrong Moroccan city (I&apos;d mispronounced Chefchaouen to my taxi driver, and he took me to the town of T\u00e9touan) on the day Berber merchants had come in from the mountains to sell their wares. Without baggage, I was able to spontaneously explore the colourful medina for an entire afternoon \u2013 and still make it to Chefchaouen before sundown. By the time I left Morocco it was apparent that not having luggage wasn&apos;t going to add a lot of drama or complication to my day-to-day activities. Luggage \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 ceased to be much of an issue; I just threw myself into enjoying the adventure. In Egypt I had an elaborate shave with a cutthroat razor in a back-alley barbershop and explored the quirky tout-culture surrounding the pyramids at Giza; in South Africa I spotted lions, rhinos and giraffes in Kruger national park, and I sampled bush tea made from elephant poo in Welgevonden game reserve. In Bangkok I went out on the town and was tickled to find that I could get into some of that city&apos;s most exclusive nightclubs, in the clothes I&apos;d worn for 25 days in a row. In Thailand I discarded a few items I hadn&apos;t been using (camera, flashlight, one bottle of liquid soap), and continued on to Malaysia, Singapore and New Zealand even lighter than before. After six weeks on the road I arrived back in New York craving a little fashion variety \u2013 but for the most part my no-baggage challenge was less of a challenge than I&apos;d anticipated. Does this mean I&apos;ll spend the rest of my life travelling without bags? Probably not. Bags do serve a purpose: they make some aspects of a journey easier, and one can still travel ultra-light while carrying a small bag. In the end, then, my no-baggage experiment was less a test of extremes than a simple illustration of what you do and don&apos;t need on the road. All too often, I think, we pack a bunch of &quot;just in case&quot; items when packing for a journey (be it around the world or a weekend away), and most all of these &quot;just in case&quot; items are either available on the road, or not necessary in the first place. We also tend to pack unnecessary things because certain items feed into our psychic bubble of comfort \u2013 a kind of half-hearted attempt to bring home with us \u2013 when in fact not much is required, in the material sense, to enjoy a great time on the road. \u2022 Follow Rolf&apos;s luggage-free adventure at rtwblog.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/nov/06/formula-one-form-guide", "sentences": ["However, victories at high-speed Monza and twisty Singapore suggest that Ferrari has, arguably, the best all-round car at the moment.", "He has won races that he should not have, like Singapore, which is the sign of a champion.", "He started better than Hamilton in Singapore but surrendered the place almost immediately, surprising in light of the sublime moves he made in Brazil last year particularly."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-06T00:14:00Z", "title": "Formula One form guide: how the drivers match up in Brazil", "tags": ["Formula One", "Fernando Alonso", "Mark Webber", "Sebastian Vettel", "Lewis Hamilton", "Jenson Button", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "Fernando Alonso 2010 record: five wins, nine top-threes, 231 pts, two DNFs Last five races: 1st (most recent), 3rd, 1st, 1st, DNF: 90pts Brazilian GP record: Has finished on the podium five times and has been outside the top four twice when he had to retire. Has never won at Interlagos. The former double world champion is very much the man to beat heading to Brazil, one of the five tracks on the calendar where he has never won. However, victories at high-speed Monza and twisty Singapore suggest that Ferrari has, arguably, the best all-round car at the moment. Despite Alonso&apos;s win-at-any-cost mentality, he allies that to the other attributes a team looks for \u2013 leadership, raw talent and consistency. Alonso carries these in abundance and has exploded into life in the second half of the season. Not only does he have the speed, with four fastest laps this season, but he handles the pressure better than any of his rivals. He has won races that he should not have, like Singapore, which is the sign of a champion. The 29-year-old looks strong to give the Scuderia its 16th drivers&apos; title, although probably in Abu Dhabi rather than Brazil. Mark Webber 2010 record: four wins, nine top-threes, 220 pts, two DNFs Last five races: DNF, 2, 3, 6, 2: 59pts Brazilian GP record: Aside from his emphatic victory last year, Webber has finished no higher than ninth in his eight previous visits. Webber arrives in S\u00e3o Paulo off the back of a disappointing exit in South Korea, where he lost the car in wet conditions and took out Nico Rosberg. Webber rarely gets involved in incidents and instead subscribes to the mantra of hard but fair racing. Nevertheless, on the basis of past form, Webber is the weakest of the contenders in tricky conditions and with unpredictable weather a distinct possibility at Interlagos, the Aussie may be under further pressure. The 34-year-old can afford no more mistakes. It is his time to shine, perhaps his best chance to take a richly deserved title that would put an Australian back at the top of the sport for the first time in 30 years. The Buckinghamshire-based driver has proved himself over the past two years and, with four dominant wins under his belt this season, he needs a repeat of last year&apos;s race to take the title on to Abu Dhabi. Lewis Hamilton 2010 record: three wins, eight top-threes, 210 pts, four DNFs Last five: 2, 5, DNF, DNF, 1: 53pts Brazilian GP record: A mixed bag certainly, Hamilton has narrowly won and lost a championship here, finishing seventh in 2007 and fifth a year later. His best result \u2013 third \u2013 came in a year he was not in contention. Hamilton has had an up-and-down season and, as he goes to a track where his fortune is equally mixed, it is hard to say whether this is where his championship challenge ends or he remains in contention. The 2008 champion, with a title famously clinched at Jun\u00e7\u00e3o, the last corner, is arguably the best overtaker on the grid, perhaps because he takes the most risks. His daring is fantastic to watch but with double the number of retirements (four) of his rivals, there has been one too many at the most crucial point of the championship. Still only 25, he lacks the experience of some of his rivals, which can often be decisive at this stage of the season. What the Briton lacks in experience, he makes up for in ability. His drive in Australia was particularly inspired, overtaking cars all over the track, including the turn 11 and 12 high-speed chicane, only to be thwarted by a questionable strategy and Webber&apos;s over-zealousness. Hamilton&apos;s fundamental flaw, however, may not be his own, with McLaren seemingly struggling to keep pace with Red Bull and Ferrari. The MP4-25 lacks overall downforce and Hamilton may well be doing a rain dance in S\u00e3o Paulo to keep his hopes afloat. Sebastian Vettel 2010 record: three wins, eight top-threes, 206 pts, two DNFs Last five: DNF, 1, 2, 4, 15: 55pts Brazilian GP record: Has finished fourth in the last two years and failed to finish in 2007. The young German should be leading the championship right now. However, a cocktail of mechanical unreliability and impetuousness means his chances are diluted. Vettel&apos;s story is that of 2009 all over again \u2013 astounding ability but bitter disappointment. Unfortunately the 23-year-old does not seem to have matured at all. His incidents with Webber in Turkey and Button in Belgium are low points he cannot afford to repeat in the final races. He has not shown a tremendous amount of race-craft and lacks the overtaking ability to carve his way through a grid. In fairness Vettel has also been let down by his car far too often. Bahrain, Australia and Korea were nailed-on wins that would have unquestionably changed the complexion of the title fight. Red Bull and Renault must address this if they want to achieve Ferrari-style domination which, with Adrian Newey at the helm, is entirely possible. Vettel is a champion in waiting. Nine pole positions and demonstrations of the Red Bull&apos;s speed reinforce that belief but it will surely be at least another year before his name is etched on the coveted trophy. Jenson Button 2010 record: two wins, six top-threes, 189 pts, two DNFs Last five: 12, 4, 4, 2, DNF: 42pts Brazilian GP record: Although he has competed at Interlagos more than any of his rivals, Button&apos;s record does not inspire confidence. Aside from clinching the title here last season, the 30-year-old has stood on the podium (third) once in 10 visits. Button&apos;s chances of successfully defending his crown are now purely arithmetical. Despite a fantastic start to the season, winning two of the first four, with unparalleled tyre choices in Australia and China, the world champion has not won a dry race since Turkey last year. He has come close on several occasions, namely in Italy behind Alonso with an unconventional higher downforce set-up, but has struggled on several counts. He knows as well as anyone that to win a world championship consistency is key. Six wins out of the first seven in 2009 put him firmly in control but this year he has encountered several more hurdles. More often than not Button&apos;s car has not hit the spot in terms of the perfect balance he needs and he has not been able to show the tremendous pace that made him world champion. Neither has he been as aggressive as last year. He started better than Hamilton in Singapore but surrendered the place almost immediately, surprising in light of the sublime moves he made in Brazil last year particularly.

The move came as number of people killed by Mount Merapi in the last two weeks climbed to 138 after the volcano unleashed a surge of searing gas yesterday that torched houses and trees and incinerated villagers. Officials at Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific and AirAsia fear the ash is a safety threat and could damage aircraft. &quot;The volcanic ash presence in the airways surrounding Jakarta could cause severe damage to our aircraft and engines which could impair the safety of our operations including passengers and crew,&quot; said Azharuddin Osman, director of operations for Malaysia Airlines. The eruption of Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in April forced the closure of most European airports for a week and led to the cancellation of more than 100,000 flights. The Indonesian government has expanded the volcanic &quot;danger zone&quot; to a ring 12 miles (20km) from the peak, bringing it to the edge of Yogyakarta in central Java, which has been put on its highest alert. Mount Merapi is still spitting ash up to five miles (8km) in the air, dusting windshields, rooftops and leaves on trees hundreds of miles to the west. Yogyakarta&apos;s tiny Sardjito hospital at the foot of the volcano is struggling to cope with survivors, some with burns on up to 95% of their bodies. At least 94 people died yesterday when a gas cloud incinerated fleeing villagers and severely injured more than 200 others who suffered burns, respiratory problems, broken bones and cuts. The hospital, where bodies were piled up in the morgue yesterday, has the only burn unit in town, but it has only nine beds and it has been forced to turn away all but the most severe cases. Those with severe smoke inhalation \u2013 which scorches and inflames lung tissue, making breathing difficult, if not impossible \u2013 get top priority, since the only ventilators in the hospital are in the unit. The severity and extent of burns are also considered. Conditions are also deteriorating at emergency shelters in the shadow of the volcano that are crammed with more than 200,000 people evacuated from the mountain. Many evacuees complained of poor sanitation, saying there were not enough toilets or clean drinking water. They are also worried about what is yet to come. &quot;It&apos;s scary... the eruption just keeps going on,&quot; said Wajiman, 58, who was sitting in a shelter near a girl reading a newspaper headlined: &quot;Merapi isn&apos;t finished yet.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/07/bbc-strike-pensions-nuj", "sentences": ["\u25a0 Alan Shadrake, a 75-year-old Brit who lives in Malaysia, wrote a book about Singapore&apos;s profligate way with death sentences.", "But this is &quot;free&quot; Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-07T00:06:29Z", "title": "BBC strike is bad news for public service broadcasting", "tags": ["BBC", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "ITN", "TV news", "Sky News"], "article": "Some 64 journalists around the world have been killed in action this year, the latest figures show.

Earlier that day, the British author had attended the launch of his controversial book, in which he accused Singapore&apos;s judiciary of bowing to outside pressure and applying double standards in its application of the death penalty. He knew that the authorities did not like what he had to say. While wealthy \u2013 often well-connected foreigners \u2013 can expect leniency, he argued in Once the Jolly Hangman: Singapore&apos;s Justice in the Dock, the poor and disenfranchised are summarily executed. But at dawn he was woken by the arrival of three police officers who ransacked his room before taking him away for questioning. Two days of interrogations later, Shadrake was released on bail, minus his confiscated passport, fearing he, too, was about to feel the full force of the same unforgiving criminal justice system he had lambasted in print. &quot;They used shock and awe tactics in an attempt to terrify me into submission.&quot; Last week the 76-year-old was convicted of contempt of court, for which he could spend up to six months in Singapore&apos;s Changi prison, when the high court sentences him this week. He also faces separate charges of criminal defamation, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a hefty fine. Shadrake&apos;s crime was to challenge the enthusiastic use of the death penalty in a country notoriously intolerant of dissent. Drawing on interviews with a retired chief executioner, lawyers, former police officers and human rights activists, his central claim is that justice in one of the world&apos;s most advanced economies is anything but blind.He highlights several inconsistent applications of the law which, he says, prove Singapore&apos;s judiciary &quot;picks and chooses how they respond depending on the state&apos;s diplomatic and economic interests&quot;. In handing down the guilty verdict, the judge, Quentin Loh, said Shadrake had &quot;scandalised&quot; the judiciary through &quot;a dissembling and selective background of truths and half-truths, and sometimes outright falsehoods&quot;. He offered the prolific British author the chance to &quot;make amends&quot;, but Shadrake was unrepentant. &quot;They are effectively asking me to apologise, but I have done nothing wrong and I have no amends to make,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s utter nonsense - I haven&apos;t scandalised anyone. &quot;I&apos;m not going to run away or back down. If they want to jail me, then so be it.&quot; Past experience suggests that Shadrake should have taken the advice of the British high commission in Singapore and excused himself from the book launch. The country&apos;s elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, whose son is now prime minister, has frequently used strict anti-defamation laws to crush dissent and punish foreign journalists. A Wall Street Journal editor was fined $10,000 last year for publishing articles deemed to have shown contempt for Singapore&apos;s judiciary, while three local activists were sentenced to short prison terms for wearing T-shirts illustrated with a kangaroo dressed as a judge.Shadrake&apos;s conviction has thrown into sharp relief the contradiction at the heart of Singapore&apos;s rise from colonial backwater to economic powerhouse: that the gains that have given its people the highest living standards in Asia since it declared independence from Britain in 1963, co-exist with an unapologetic contempt for freedoms taken for granted in other developed Asian economies. The government is also highly sensitive to attacks on its draconian attitude towards serious crime. According to Amnesty International, Singapore, a country of nearly 5 million, has the highest per capita rate of executions in the world, having put more than 420 people to death since 1991. In a 2004 report, Amnesty said the death penalty was disproportionately used against migrant workers, drug addicts and poorer people. &quot;Singapore&apos;s drug laws flout global fair-trial standards by shifting the burden of proof to suspects,&quot; says Lance Lattig, a researcher on Singapore for Amnesty in London. &quot;A drug trafficking suspect faces hanging unless he can manage to prove his innocence. If the Singapore government has issues with Shadrake&apos;s book, it should address his arguments directly, not threaten him with prison.&quot; Shadrake has admitted one minor inaccuracy in his book, but insists the rest of the material is &quot;devastatingly accurate&quot;.&quot;They know the book is accurate, which is why they&apos;re going to all this trouble,&quot; he said. As he waits to learn his fate, the former Fleet Street journalist, who arrived in Singapore in 2002 to write travel articles for the local tourist board, admits to fantasising about swimming along the causeway and over the border to Malaysia, visible from his hotel room. But he has no intention of fleeing: &quot;I am prepared to go to jail: if I apologise, or try to abscond, it means I lied, that I got my facts wrong.&quot; With his client&apos;s biggest day in court only days away, Ravi is concerned about the toll the trial is taking on Shadrake&apos;s health. He suffers from high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, and in August he spent two days in hospital after a longstanding colonic complaint caused internal bleeding. Shadrake, meanwhile, insists he is in good spirits, even managing to belt out a defiant karaoke version of &quot;My Way&quot; on the night of his conviction. And while the British high commission in Singapore has offered only &quot;words of comfort&quot; since his arrest, he says he has received countless messages of support from ordinary Singaporeans. &quot;The authorities overreacted without thinking through the consequences and the anti-Singapore hysteria that followed,&quot; he said. &quot;And that is growing all the time.&quot; Shadrake refuses to reveal how he will respond if he is sent to prison this week, saying only that he has several back-up plans in place: &quot;This story is never going away. I&apos;ll keep it on the boil for as long as I live.

The Guardian can reveal the joint winners of an international design competition launched by the foundation, and sponsored by the Tiffany &amp; Co Foundation, the charitable arm of the famous jewellers. Trumpet, a slender bronze by Ben Addy intended to be cast in one piece at a traditional bell foundry, and Watering Holes, a pierced Cornish granite standing stone created by Rome-born Robin Monotti and Mark Titman, will appear as prototypes next year. Like their Victorian predecessors, both designs will also supply water at a lower level for thirsty dogs. After hours of argument, the judges were unable to choose between the two designs, so declared them joint winners. The competition was open to students and artists as well as engineers and architects. More than 150 entries from Scandinavia to Australia, via Russia and Singapore offered the sober and the wild \u2013 toadstools and umbrellas through to giant flowers. The winners will be sited throughout London&apos;s eight royal parks: St James&apos;s, Regent&apos;s, Hyde, Green, Kensington Gardens, Greenwich, Richmond, and Bushy. Sara Lom, chief executive of the Royal Parks Foundation, expects other parks across the country to follow suit. &quot;When we went looking for the perfect design to replace some of our ageing fountains which are now beyond repair, we found there was just nothing suitable available. I am overwhelmed at way designers have risen to the challenge.&quot; The Tiffany &amp; Co Foundation is paying to restore historic fountains in the royal parks. Public drinking fountains have a long and recently depressing history. In 1859 the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, installed one on Snow Hill in London and was soon building animal troughs too. A descendant still operates, but although many of the original urns and troughs remain, most have long since dried up, and remain as flower beds or sad eyesores choked with litter and scrawled with graffiti. A recent survey found that 11% of UK parks attempt to provide drinking water, and within those only two-thirds are actually working. Meanwhile these open green spaces battle with the millions of plastic bottles discarded every year. Ben Addy \u2013 whose Moxon firm made it to the finals of the young architect of the year last week \u2013 said: &quot;This competition was incredibly important to us. The chance to create something both beautiful and functional for a public space, where so much is off the peg and barely considered in design terms, was just wonderful.&quot; Trumpet is deceptively elegant: it will be engineered to create vulgar gurgling noises. Monotti and Titman were first inspired by an ancient Greek sundial, and sketched out their ideas in a sunny hour sitting in a park. Their final design for a slab of granite, pierced with holes to suit adults, children and dogs, also recalls the prehistoric standing stones, often associated with the phases of the moon and sun. Their design too has its cheerfully vulgar side \u2013 they think people will want to stick their heads through and be photographed, like in a seaside postcard. &quot;Stick your head in a hole and get a drink of water too \u2013 could anything be more delightful?&quot; Titman said. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 November 2010 to make clear that the competition was launched by the Royal Parks Foundation and sponsored by the Tiffany &amp; Co Foundation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/08/qantas-airbus-a380-engine-faults", "sentences": ["No one was injured when the plane made an emergency landing in Singapore but Qantas grounded its fleet of A380s.", "The Qantas head said he hoped the airline would get the double-decker planes flying again soon: &quot;We still believe with the progress we are making \u2013 this is days not weeks \u2013 but we will take as long as it needs to in order that we are absolutely comfortable the aircraft is safe to fly.&quot; Flight QF32 from London to Sydney had just taken off from Singapore when a large section of the rear of the engine, seemingly including part of a turbine, was blown off, damaging the plane&apos;s wing and dropping debris on to the Indonesian island of Batam below.", "Singapore Airlines briefly grounded its fleet of A380s, which also use the Rolls-Royce engines."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-08T01:33:15Z", "title": "Qantas finds engine 'anomalies' in its A380 fleet", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Rolls-Royce", "Business", "Australia news", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Qantas"], "article": "The chief executive of Qantas said last night the airline has found engine problems in more of its Airbus A380s following an incident last week in which one of its superjumbos made an emergency landing after an engine exploded in mid-flight.

The plane&apos;s wing was damaged and debris dropped on to the Indonesian island of Batam. The plane landed safely back in Singapore. Engineers conducted eight hours of extensive checks on each Rolls-Royce engine over the weekend and the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said today they discovered oil leaks in the turbine area of three different aircraft. &quot;That shouldn&apos;t be occurring,&quot; he said. &quot;The oil leaks were beyond normal tolerances.

The company lost \u00a31.2bn of its value in 48 hours amid fears of a BP-style backlash against the company in the US. Shares in Qantas, which has never had a fatal accident since it start flying jetliners, have fallen 2% since Thursday. Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, the other airlines that fly A380s fitted with Trent 900 engines, briefly grounded their planes last week but resumed services after checks.

Britain&apos;s biggest supermarket is understood to be among a handful of suitors to submit &quot;second-round&quot; bids for the Carrefour stores in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand as it seeks to boost its presence in the fast-growing Asian markets. Acquiring Carrefour&apos;s stores would significantly expand Tesco&apos;s Asian operations, which include outlets in Thailand, South Korea, China, Japan and Malaysia. Tesco&apos;s biggest Asian market is South Korea, with sales of \u00a34.2bn last year. The acquisition would follow Tesco&apos;s takeover of other Asian retailers, such as its \u00a3958m purchase of South Korea&apos;s Homever discount chain in 2008 and of Japan&apos;s C Two Network discount retailer. Tesco, which would not comment on the auction, is said to be the favourite to secure the stores because it is the world&apos;s third-biggest supermarket chain and already has a strong presence in Malaysia and Thailand. The retailer&apos;s deep pockets give it the firepower, while the scope for cost-cutting through mergers with its local operations could justify a higher price than its competitors are likely to be able to afford, analysts said. Sir Terry Leahy, Tesco&apos;s outgoing chief executive, has publicly stated that it &quot;makes sense&quot; to buy the stores, adding that &quot;it depends on price always&quot;. Carrefour is selling 40 stores in Thailand, 19 in Malaysia and two in Singapore. Some bidders are thought to be making offers for different combinations of these stores, although Tesco is understood to be interested in all the outlets. Carrefour is selling the stores after deciding to redeploy resources into markets it believes that it can lead. However, it is not leaving Asia altogether. Carrefour will keep its outlets in China, which make up about 70% of its sales in the continent, as well as in Indonesia. Tesco&apos;s pursuit of the Asian market comes as the retailer continues to underperform the UK grocery market, according to Kantar Worldpanel.

In the wake of BP&apos;s experience, aren&apos;t companies meant to recognise threats to their reputations immediately and give full details of their response? Well, yes and no. At this stage, Rolls is probably wise to be paranoid about making statements it could later regret. The hunt for parts of the engine still continues in Indonesia, after all, and nobody doubts that it has its top engineers working on the inquiry.

Qantas also said that oil &quot;was found where it shouldn&apos;t be&quot; in three more of its Rolls-powered A380s. The company will provide another update on Friday when it reports a routine trading statement. Jason Adams, aerospace and defence analyst at Japanese investment bank Nomura, said Rolls-Royce was under pressure to get the problem fixed before safety regulators grounded all 20 A380s \u2013 the &quot;superjumbos&quot; \u2013 around the world fitted with its Trent 900 engines. The planes are used not only by Qantas but also by Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa. &quot;Rolls, Airbus and the airlines involved have been self-policing this,&quot; Adams said. &quot;So far, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is being relatively patient, but it could intervene and ground the whole fleet of A380s which are fitted with Trent 900s if they don&apos;t sort this out. The onus is on Rolls and Qantas to say, &apos;This is what we&apos;re doing to put planes back in the sky&apos;.&quot; The crisis began on Thursday when a Trent 900 engine on a Qantas A380 exploded midair. Another Rolls-Royce engine failed on a Qantas 747 the next day, bringing the total number of serious incidents to four in less than three months. Adams said today&apos;s statement, the first since Thursday, would not satisfy the FAA indefinitely. &quot;The statement released by Rolls this afternoon helps, but the FAA will want to know definitively what went wrong and what Rolls needs to do to fix it,&quot; he added. Lufthansa kept flying its A380s after safety checks revealed no problems. Singapore Airlines briefly grounded its fleet after Thursday&apos;s explosion, but they soon resumed flying. It is thought that the Trent 900s fitted on the Qantas A380 are more prone to failure because the turbines spin at a higher velocity. Rolls-Royce, which also has marine and defence divisions, makes almost half its \u00a310bn revenues from its civil aerospace division. The Trent and RB211 engines \u2013 which power the Boeing 747 \u2013 account for nearly two-thirds of this. Rolls-Royce does not break down the sales for each type of engine, but sales of its Trent 900 \u2013 it supplies almost half, all A380s \u2013 represent increasingly big earnings. It already has orders to equip 70 new A380s, and airlines have options on 20 more. In total, the company makes 230 large aerospace engines each year. Rolls-Royce also makes engines for helicopters and small jets. Of the 13,000 engines made by Rolls-Royce currently in service, about a fifth are part of the Trent family, which entered service in 1995. Rolls-Royce is the second largest civil aerospace engine manufacturer in the world, behind General Electric (GE). Julian Tolley, head of research at HB Markets, said Rolls-Royce&apos;s competitors could benefit from the A380 problems. &quot;While we do not expect an immediate impact on sales, our concern is on the future for the advanced design engines known as the Trent 900 and the follow-on Trent 1000,&quot; Tolley said. &quot;The danger of increased maintenance schedules or reduced load cycles could easily swing purchasers towards the GE alternative.&quot; Rolls-Royce shares are still down by 7% since Thursday&apos;s explosion. &quot;We are seeing some of the shine come off the Rolls premium,&quot; Adams said. The doubts surrounding Rolls-Royce&apos;s engines for large planes have emerged just as Rolls&apos;s reliance on them is about to increase. Adams said when Airbus and Boeing decide to fit new engines to their narrow body aircraft, Rolls-Royce would probably lose out to other suppliers. Investors are also nervous after the government recently decided that its new joint strike fighters would not require the lift system made by Rolls-Royce to enable vertical landings. This puts more pressure on the much bigger US joint strike fighter contract going ahead as planned. In the midst of all this, chief executive Sir John Rose is retiring in March after 14 years at the helm. Adams said there is no reason yet for him to delay his departure, provided that the fault does indeed turn out to be specific to the Trent 900 and is resolved by the end of the year. But the fact that such a question could even be contemplated shows how much Rolls-Royce \u2013 and Sir John \u2013 have to do to restore the reputation of what is arguably Britain&apos;s last globally renowned industrial goliath."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/08/obama-us-dominance-asia-over", "sentences": ["Politically damaged Thailand as well as Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan have recovered from the downturn."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-08T21:30:00Z", "title": "Obama, the street kid from Jakarta, knows US dominance of Asia is over | Pankaj Mishra", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "India", "Malaysia", "Indonesia", "China", "US foreign policy", "World news", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Barack Obama has embarked on his tour of four Asian countries (India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan); and you might expect him to have a full foreign-policy agenda. Relations between Japan and China have deteriorated sharply following the Japanese seizure of a Chinese fishing boat. South Korea, another stalwart American client, has much to fear from the political transitions of its mysterious neighbour. India and Indonesia also present some complex strategic challenges. The dispute in Kashmir, which Obama identified as among his &quot;critical tasks&quot; in 2008, clearly saps Pakistan&apos;s commitment to America&apos;s war in Afghanistan. After two cancelled trips to Indonesia, Obama finally has the chance this week to commemorate his childhood in the country, and to re-engage his audience in the Muslim world that he first addressed in Cairo in 2009. However, Obama insists on defining his mission in Asia in less than lofty terms. &quot;We need to find,&quot; he wrote in an op-ed last week in the New York Times, &quot;new customers in new markets for American-made goods.&quot; This article, which went on about trade pacts with South Korea, Indonesia&apos;s chairmanship of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), and the importance of creating thousands of American jobs, had not a word to say about the political and military role of the United States in Asia. Visiting India, Obama has remained on message, talking about business deals and American jobs. He may be feeling a bit chastened after the setbacks in US midterm elections last week. Certainly he must stem growing unemployment as well as stimulate an economic recovery if he hopes to win a second term as president in 2012. And he may be trying to avoid the impression of being too preoccupied with abstruse foreign policy issues. Still, Obama&apos;s geopolitical diffidence acknowledges an undeniable fact: that America, weakened by the recession and successive military-diplomatic failures, can no longer dictate the course of events in Asia \u2013 a power it exercised, with often devastating effect, throughout the cold war. The oft-repeated story of China&apos;s rise is only part of the explanation for this. More importantly, mass politicisation and economic regionalism have emboldened many Asian countries that previously followed America&apos;s lead or cowered in its long shadow. There is probably no American politician more aware of this impalpable but dramatic turnaround than Obama, who lived on a mud lane in Jakarta in the late 1960s, and visited Pakistan and India as a student in 1981. He came of age when the United States still wore the mantle it had inherited from European empires in the east; and many American officials, politicians and intellectuals dreamed, as Lawrence of Arabia once had, &quot;of hustling into form \u2026 the new Asia which time was inexorably bringing upon us&quot;. Two years before the six-year-old Obama moved with his mother to Jakarta, the CIA colluded in the killing, by military and paramilitary Muslim groups, of nearly half a million suspected communists in Indonesia. Indonesia during General Suharto&apos;s long New Order (1967-1998) became a perfect client of the United States. There were always high-class intellectual justifications available for crony capitalism and military brutality of the kind Suharto specialised in. In 1968 Samuel Huntington published Political Order in Changing Societies, which in terms of political effect seems more influential \u2013 and malign \u2013 than The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of the Political Order. Pro-American despots from Suharto to South Korea&apos;s Park Chung-hee and the Shah of Iran took careful note of Huntington&apos;s emphasis on the utmost necessity of political stability and military modernisation. Another beneficiary of the American preference for sturdy anti-Communism over messy democracy was Pakistan&apos;s General Zia-ul-Haq. In 1954, the year Pakistan along with Turkey and Iran was drafted into the cold war, the great Urdu writer Saadat Hasan Manto addressed &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; in a series of satirical (and prophetic) letters. &quot;Dear Uncle,&quot; he wrote, &quot;you are seriously concerned about the stability of the world&apos;s largest Islamic state since our Mullah is the best antidote to Russian communism.&quot; By 1981, the year Obama visited Pakistan, Zia had persuaded the United States that global jihad was the correct response to monolithic communism. Of course, none of the political and economic arrangements frozen during the cold war were destined to last; and they melted in their own way, often causing a more extensive chaos than the one Huntington feared. Mass revolts finally unseated Suharto, plunging Indonesia into a turbulent period of democratisation. General Zia departed mysteriously in a plane crash; but the religious-political passions he unleashed are still with us, partly feeding on the cruel injustices of Pakistan&apos;s feudal society that Obama witnessed on his visit to the country. The military may have been forced out of politics in Indonesia. In Pakistan it still slyly fattens itself on feckless American aid. Indeed, Pakistani military and intelligence have refined their money-extraction ruses into an art form even as popular sentiment in Pakistan turns overwhelmingly against the United States. But then, as Manto put it to Uncle Sam: &quot;I am your Pakistani nephew and I know your moves. Everyone can now become a smartass, thanks to your style of playing politics.&quot; Almost everywhere in Asia, the United States finds itself distrusted, outmanoeuvered and encircled, by present allies (Pakistan, Karzai) as well as erstwhile proteges. Decades after getting rid of the shah, Iran&apos;s rulers can still draw upon strong anti-western passions as it bankrolls its proxies and friends in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Lebanon and Gaza. The politicians and businessmen of Japan and South Korea can barely keep a lid on mass opposition to America&apos;s lingering cold war presence in the region. Malaysia, from where I write, consistently &quot;looked east&quot; for its economic growth in the last three decades. Here, the east Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 stigmatised American policies long before the &quot;Washington consensus&quot; received its final rites elsewhere. The shrinking of American influence is apparent even in India, whose political and business elites adore US wealth and power with an embarrassing intensity. (&quot;The people of India,&quot; Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, blurted out to George Bush, &quot;love you!&quot;) India remained as protective of its farmers as ever at the stalled Doha round of talks. The Bush administration&apos;s generous gift of a nuclear deal has not made India much more hospitable to American investors and exporters. As Obama will find out, India has many more likely and rewarding partners in booming Asia than in the recession-hit west. Politically damaged Thailand as well as Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan have recovered from the downturn. Last year India signed a major free-trade deal with Asean. Not surprisingly a columnist in the Star, Malaysia&apos;s leading newspaper in English, deemed the Indian prime minister&apos;s visit to Kuala Lumpur last week more important than the jaunt of Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, to the region at the same time. A tangle of bilateral trade agreements underpins Asia&apos;s new economic unity. China and Asean countries already constitute the biggest free-trade zone in the world. Asian fears of China&apos;s rise, which the United States keenly monitors, look minor beside the fact that China is now the largest export market for Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, in addition to being India&apos;s biggest trading partner. All this sounds a planet away from those Tea-Partying Americans who think that the US can bomb its way out of any political and economic difficulties abroad. It now falls to Obama to advance their education; and he&apos;ll most likely fail in this thankless task. But it can&apos;t be said that this president, once a street kid in Jakarta, didn&apos;t try, or that he ever imagined he could hustle into form the new and intractable Asia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/09/rolls-royce-announces-china-deal", "sentences": ["The news is welcome relief for Rolls-Royce whose shares fell 10% after a Qantas airliner made an emergency landing in Singapore last week following the mid-air explosion of a Trent 900 engine."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-09T13:08:00Z", "title": "Rolls-Royce announces \u00a3750m China deal", "tags": ["Rolls-Royce", "Business", "Airline industry", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Rolls-Royce delivered a boost to David Cameron&apos;s trade mission to China by announcing a \u00a3750m deal to supply and service jet engines for a Chinese airline. The British engineering firm has also been contracted to reduce the carbon emissions of China Eastern Airlines, by 190,000 tonnes in the first year of a fuel management service. The airline has a fleet of more than 300 aircraft. The companies signed a memorandum of understanding in Beijing for the largest order secured so far during the prime minister&apos;s visit to China. The news is welcome relief for Rolls-Royce whose shares fell 10% after a Qantas airliner made an emergency landing in Singapore last week following the mid-air explosion of a Trent 900 engine. Qantas has grounded all its Airbus A380 superjumbo planes powered by the Rolls-Royce engines while the incident is investigated. Until the Rolls-Royce deal, signed in Cameron&apos;s presence in the Great Hall of the People, the government could only account for a string of modest deals with British firms, including measures to boost Scotch whisky sales and allow imports of breeding pigs into China. Rolls-Royce, whose shares were up nearly 2% on the news, will supply and service Trent 700 engines for 16 newly-ordered Airbus A330 aircraft. It will also provide enhanced performance kits to upgrade the Trent 700s on China Eastern Airlines&apos;s 20 existing A330s. The deal follows the $14bn (\u00a310bn) order for the 16 Airbus planes, signed in Paris last week, which could earn British firms $5bn. Rolls-Royce has an order book nearing \u00a360bn but will be cheered by the extra orders from the Chinese airline. Like many UK companies, Rolls-Royce plans to expand in China and sell high-value services to the country&apos;s 1.3 billion population. Liu Shaoyong, the chair of China Eastern Airlines, said: &quot;We have found the Trent 700 to be extremely effective in service and are pleased to select it for our latest aircraft. &quot;We also look forward to working with Rolls-Royce through our carbon partnership, which, we anticipate, will reduce fuel consumption by at least 2% in its first year alone, the equivalent of a 190,000-tonne reduction in CO2, which equates to the amount of CO2 produced by 80,000 cars over the same period.&quot; Cameron, who is is accompanied by four senior ministers and more than 40 business leaders, said: &quot;We want a stronger economic and business relationship with China \u2013 we are the fifth-largest economy in \u00a0the world, but we have only 2% of China&apos;s imports.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/nov/09/singapore-censorship-alan-shadrake", "sentences": ["Sometimes the Singapore government cannot help itself.", "Imagine if Singapore had shown a little more foresight and ignored the affair.", "As a frequent visitor to Singapore (where I was born), I have seen the best and the worst of the place.", "In spite of, or perhaps because of, the denunciations, I sought to engage the Singaporeans at the top of government.", "The vacillations in my treatment suggest that the government in Singapore is not talking with one voice.", "Will Singapore begin to loosen its stifling grip and tolerate free expression?", "Singapore&apos;s population is well travelled and highly educated."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-09T17:55:41Z", "title": "Singapore need not fear loosening censorship | John Kampfner", "tags": ["Singapore", "Censorship", "Media", "Law", "World news", "Alan Shadrake", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Sometimes the Singapore government cannot help itself.

Shadrake is the latest in a long line of victims of one of the world&apos;s most vicious defamation cultures. Pretty much any criticism can be deemed as &quot;insult&quot;. International media have fallen foul \u2013 from the Economist to the Far Eastern Economic Review \u2013 and most of the tiny group of opposition politicians have over the years been bankrupted and then imprisoned for going against the grain. Shadrake, who divides his time between Malaysia and the UK, knew what he was doing, and he knew the consequences. He knew he was inviting trouble \u2013 more specifically charges of contempt \u2013 by calling into question the probity of the judiciary. But that does not make the attack on him any less acceptable or sensible. Imagine if Singapore had shown a little more foresight and ignored the affair. The book would not have matched Jamie or Nigella on the bestsellers. Sentencing has now been deferred for a week, with prosecutors asking for &quot;only&quot; 12 weeks jail. This is more lenient than anticipated, perhaps denoting an element of embarrassment at the bad press. But the trial should not have happened in the first place. As a frequent visitor to Singapore (where I was born), I have seen the best and the worst of the place. When nearly two years ago I wrote a piece for the Guardian previewing my book, Freedom for Sale as the model of the global tendency of people trading their liberty for either wealth or security \u2013 I was instantly denounced. They did not appreciate my description of the consumer culture there as &quot;the anaesthetic for the brain&quot;. In spite of, or perhaps because of, the denunciations, I sought to engage the Singaporeans at the top of government. I suggested to them that their kneejerk response to all criticism, no matter the tone or subject matter, was doing their country enormous harm. They then surprised me by inviting me over to launch my book there. My father suggested they might &quot;do a Polanski on me&quot; and arrest me at the airport. In the event, I was treated well and the government-controlled Straits Times devoted two pages to a measured critique of my thesis. The vacillations in my treatment suggest that the government in Singapore is not talking with one voice. Everyone is wondering what will happen once the 87-year-old Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the independent nation and father of the present prime minister, passes on. Will Singapore begin to loosen its stifling grip and tolerate free expression? I examine these questions in a special report later this week on BBC Radio 4&apos;s The World Tonight. Singapore&apos;s population is well travelled and highly educated. The country is stable and completely integrated into the global economy and communications. Already it is allowing just a little more cultural freedom, but it does so nervously. The regime has nothing to fear except fear itself."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/nov/10/davidcameron-china", "sentences": ["Proof, perhaps, that Confucius was right when he said: &quot;Within the four seas all men are brothers.&quot;   9.37am: David Cameron&apos;s decision to scrap HMS Ark Royal and Britain&apos;s fleet of Harriet jets means &quot;Argentina is practically invited to attempt to inflict on us a national humiliation on the scale of the loss of Singapore [by invading the Falkland Islands]&quot;, a group of senior, retired commanders are claiming in a letter to the Times today."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-10T08:33:27Z", "title": "Politics blog + PMQs \u2013 Wednesday 10 November 2010", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "David Cameron", "China", "PMQs", "House of Commons", "Harriet Harman", "Nick Clegg", "Asia Pacific"], "article": " 8.31am: David Cameron has just delivered a speech to students in Beijing. As Patrick Wintour and Philip Inman report in the Guardian today, he was due to say:   The rise in economic freedom in China has been hugely beneficial to China and to the world. I hope in time this will lead to a greater political opening because I am convinced that the best guarantor of prosperity and stability is for economic and political progress to go in step together.  On the Today programme this morning, someone referred to it as the &quot;Set your people free&quot; speech. I&apos;m not sure it was quite that strong, but I will put up more extracts when I&apos;ve read the full text. For more about the China trip, I&apos;d also strongly recommend Patrick&apos;s &quot;human rights and poppies&quot; colour piece about the trip 9.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies publishes a report on reforming the tax system. 9.45am: The supreme court delivers its ruling on whether or not the three Labour MPs accused of fiddling their expenses can use parliamentary privilege to avoid criminal trial. 10am: Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan police commissioner, appears before the London assembly to answer questions about how cuts will affect policing. Midday: Nick Clegg takes prime minister&apos;s questions. Harriet Harman will speak for Labour. As usual, I&apos;ll be covering all the breaking political news, as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.       9.11am: I&apos;ve now read the full text of Cameron&apos;s speech. The key messages were released in advance, and you&apos;ll find them in today&apos;s Guardian front-page story, but here are some more good extracts: \u2022 Cameron said he saw the rise of China as an opportunity, not a threat.  [People] can see China&apos;s rise as a threat, or they can see it as an opportunity. They can protect their markets from China, or open their markets to China. They can try and shut China out, or welcome China in, to a new place at the top table of global affairs ... I choose engagement not disengagement. Dialogue not stand-off. Mutual benefit, not zero-sum game. Partnership not protectionism. Britain is the country that argues most passionately for globalisation and free trade. Free trade is in our DNA. And we want trade with China. As much of it as we can get.  \u2022 He said his approach to China was the same as Labour&apos;s. &quot;On this vital point there is absolute continuity between my government and the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.&quot; \u2022 He said that he wanted China to rebalance its economy, spend more and adjust its exchange rate.  For the world economy to be able to grow strongly again \u2013 and to grow without creating the dangerous economic and financial instabilities that led to the crisis, we need more than just adjustment in the advanced world. The truth is that some countries with current account surpluses have been saving too much, while others like mine with deficits have been saving too little. And the result has been a dangerous tidal wave of money going from one side of the globe to the other ... I know from my discussions with Premier Wen [Jiabao] how committed China is to actions to rebalance its economy. China is already talking about moving towards increased domestic consumption, better healthcare and welfare, more consumer goods as its middle class grows, and in time introducing greater market flexibility into its exchange rate. This can not be completed overnight, but it must happen.  \u2022 He said he would push for China getting market economy status in the EU. \u2022 He said that he wanted to see &quot;greater political opening&quot; in China. (He meant freedom.)  The rise in economic freedom in China in recent years has been hugely beneficial to China and to the world. I hope that in time this will lead to a greater political opening because I am convinced that the best guarantor of prosperity and stability is for economic and political progress to go in step together.  \u2022 He said he raised human rights issues with the Chinese because the public wanted him too.  We don&apos;t raise these issues to make to us look good, or to flaunt publicly that we have done so. We raise them because the British people expect us to, and because we have sincere and deeply held concerns.  \u2022 He quoted Confucius.  Two different countries, past and future Olympic hosts, on far sides of the world, sowing the seeds of a flourishing relationship in the future, a relationship which has the potential to grow and to bloom. Proof, perhaps, that Confucius was right when he said: &quot;Within the four seas all men are brothers.&quot;   9.37am: David Cameron&apos;s decision to scrap HMS Ark Royal and Britain&apos;s fleet of Harriet jets means &quot;Argentina is practically invited to attempt to inflict on us a national humiliation on the scale of the loss of Singapore [by invading the Falkland Islands]&quot;, a group of senior, retired commanders are claiming in a letter to the Times today. My colleague H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mulholland has the full story.  9.37am: Killing the Taliban actually makes achieving peace in Afghanistan harder, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, Britain&apos;s former envoy to the country, told the Today programme this morning. As Julian Borger reports in the Guardian today, Cowper-Coles gave evidence to a Commons committee yesterday and said the army was submitting &quot;misleadingly optimistic&quot; reports about the situation in Afghanistan. On the Today programme, he raised another concern:  The more Taliban we kill, the more difficult in the end it is going to be to negotiate a sustainable settlement. These people were never defeated in 2001, they were pushed down to the south and the east. Until they are brought into the political settlement there won&apos;t be peace in Afghanistan. What we need to do, and what our prime minister understands, is give the Obama administration the cover and the courage to get the political process going.   9.47am: The supreme court has rejected the claim that parliamentary privilege should stop the former Labour MPs David Chaytor, Elliot Morley and Jim Devine from facing criminal trial over claims that they fiddled their expenses. That means their cases will go to trial.  9.53am: The supreme court did not give reasons for rejecting the appeal by the three former Labour MPs. It will publish its judgment later. But it gave its decision today because the case is deemed an urgent one. The three, who are all pleading not guilty, face separate trials at London&apos;s Southwark crown court and the first is due to begin on 22 November.  9.57am: Here&apos;s some more on Cameron&apos;s visit to China, from the Press Association stories filed overnight. \u2022 The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, complimented Cameron on the &quot;drive and energy&quot; of his team. Cameron was accompanied by Vince Cable, Michael Gove and Chris Huhne when he met Hu. Hu told him:  You are the youngest prime minister Britain has had in the last 200 years and most of your cabinet members are very young. They are full of drive and energy. am sure that under your excellency&apos;s leadership, the China-UK relationship will see greater development.  (Actually, if you are told that you are &quot;very young&quot; by a Chinese leader, is that really a compliment? I thought they had more respect for the old. Hu himself is 67.) \u2022 Cameron visited the Great Wall of China. It was a &quot;memorable&quot; experience he would never forget, he wrote in the visitors&apos; book. \u2022 Cameron welcomed the launch of a $500m UK-China investment fund by private equity house First Eastern Group.  10.10am: Another court decision. The high court has ruled that Eric Pickles&apos;s decision to scrap regional housing targets was unlawful. The court was responding to a case brought by housing developers who said that, if Pickles wanted to scrap the targets, he should use primary legislation, instead of just using ministerial powers. Here some Press Association copy explaning the background to the case:  At a hearing last month Peter Village QC, appearing for Cala Homes (South) Ltd, told a judge Pickles was seeking to revoke regional strategies through an executive decision. Village argued primary legislation should have been introduced, giving parliament the opportunity to debate an issue crucial to future planning in England. Pickles&apos; decision &quot;struck at the heart of parliamentary democracy&quot;, he said. Cala Homes has asked Mr Justice Sales, sitting in London, to intervene and quash the secretary of state&apos;s action. The court heard that Pickles had taken a decision in July to revoke the strategies, which include house building targets, under the 2009 Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act. The government said its aim was to return planning powers to local communities.   10.37am: Michael Gove&apos;s education department has just put out a press notice about his deal to train 1,000 more Chinese language teachers for secondary schools in England. David Cameron referred to this yesterday in his talks with the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. &quot;Perhaps in future, a visiting British prime minister will be speaking in Mandarin and not English,&quot; Cameron joked. Then again, perhaps not.  11.00am: You can read all today&apos;s Guardian politics stories here. And all the stories filed yesterday, including some in today&apos;s paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here are two stories that I particularly enjoyed: \u2022 Sam Coates in the Times (paywall) says Labour frontbenchers have become the latest victims of the party&apos;s obsession with form-filling. They have to go through a laborious vetting process if they want to announce a new policy.  The administrative burdens being placed on shadow cabinet members could provoke some mirth among opponents. First, all new policy must be signed off by the relevant shadow secretary of state, and a questionnaire obtained from the Treasury team. Completed forms must then be handed into the the office of Angela Eagle, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, two weeks in advance of any announcement, and written confirmation of her approval will be given within a week. The first draft of any full announcement or speech must be handed in to Ms Eagle&apos;s office &quot;no later than&quot; three days before it is made. The final draft must then be sent in 24 hours before delivery. Significant speeches not containing new policy announcements are only subject to a seven-step clearing process and only have to be handed to Ms Eagle two days before the speech is to be delivered. Only then can the shadow cabinet member go ahead with the announcement.  One shadow cabinet source said: &quot;It seems a terribly laborious process to have when we are meant to be a rapid rebuttal unit.&quot; The source added: &quot;It is still early days. I&apos;m not sure we should be making loads of new and costly policy announcements.&quot;  \u2022 Sue Cameron in the Financial Times (subscription) says that Tony Blair tried to put a personal photographer on the Downing Street payroll, but that Sir Richard Wilson, the then cabinet secretary, vetoed the idea.  Apparently TB&apos;s press secretary, Alastair Campbell (a political appointee, in case you had forgotten), fought hard to have a snapper on the payroll but came up against a brick wall in the form of then cabinet secretary Sir Richard, now Lord, Wilson. According to one insider, Lord W &quot;could see no justification for public money to be spent on such a post \u2013 particularly as there&apos;s never any shortage of people wanting to photograph the PM without charging taxpayers a penny&quot; ... But why has Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, the present cabinet secretary, not applied the same tough rules to Mr Cameron? ... Word is that Sir Gus \u2013 or possibly Sue Gray, director of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office \u2013 warned against the appointment. So why did Sir Gus sign it off? One view in Whitehall is that if the PM insisted, it would have been hard for Sir Gus to refuse \u2013 after all, technically the appointment is not against the rules. Sir Gus could have gone for an accounting officer&apos;s letter \u2013 when top civil servants demand a written order from a minister to do something of which they disapprove \u2013 but that would have meant using a ludicrously large sledgehammer on a tiny nut. It would also have upset his relationship with the PM.   11.12am: David Cameron is facing a possible rebellion over Europe tonight. MPs are debating various policy documents from the European Union and more than 20 Tory MPs have signed an amendment tabled by Bill Cash suggesting the government should veto the proposed changes to the Lisbon treaty because they could affect British sovereignty. You can read it on the order paper. Douglas Carswell, another Tory Eurosceptic, has tabled a rival amendment saying that Britain&apos;s most senior diplomat in Brussels should be summoned to the Commons to explain what&apos;s going on. Carswell has explained his motives on his blog.  11.34am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a major review of how the tax system could be simplified. It was chaired by Sir James Mirrless, the winner of a Nobel prize for economics, and you can find a four-page news release summarising the main recommendations here. They include: \u2022 Merging tax and national insurance. \u2022 Introducing an integrated benefit (which sounds very similar to Iain Duncan Smith&apos;s proposed universal credit.) \u2022 Extending VAT to cover almost all spending. \u2022 Abolishing stamp duty and reforming council tax. Mirrlees said in a statement:  The review shows that the UK system falls short of the ideal in costly and inequitable ways. It discourages saving and investment, and distorts the form they take. It favours corporate debt over equity finance. It fails to deal effectively with either greenhouse gas emissions or road congestion. The revenue it raises, and the redistribution it does, could be achieved in less costly ways.    11.59am: With prime minister&apos;s questions looming, this is a good time to mention Tim Loughton&apos;s brave speech last night. Loughton is the Tory children&apos;s minister and his speech was brave because, as Allegra Stratton reports in the Guardian today, he used it to mock his boss&apos;s big idea \u2013 never a wise career move. Here&apos;s what Loughton said about the &quot;big society&quot;. We may hear the quote again in the next 30 minutes.  The trouble is that most people don&apos;t know what the big society really means, least of all the unfortunate ministers who have to articulate it.   12.02pm: Nick Clegg is on his feet now. He says he is replying because David Cameron has been in China, and is now travelling to South Korea for the G20 summit.  12.02pm: Clegg pays tribute to a serviceman killed on his return from Afghanistan.  12.02pm: He also offers his congratulation to Ed Miliband and his partner Justine on the birth of their son. It&apos;s &quot;wonderful news&quot;, he says.  12.04pm: Jason McCartney (Con) asks what the government is doing for victims of contaminated blood. Clegg says the health secretary is looking at this issue.  12.04pm: Harriet Harman, standing in for Ed Miliband, also offers her tribute to the dead serviceman, and her congratulations to the Labour leader and his partner.  12.06pm: She says Clegg said before the election that is was his aim to end university tuition fees. Can he update the house on how his plan is progressing? Clegg says he has had to accept that he could not get rid of tuition fees. But he has stuck to his ambition to make sure that going to university is done in a &quot;progressive way&quot;. The government&apos;s policy is more progressive than Labour&apos;s.  12.07pm: Harman says that if Clegg thinks his policy is progressive, he should tell the students and lecturers on today&apos;s march. Clegg said fees of \u00a37,000 would be a &quot;disaster&quot;. If \u00a37,000 was a disaster, what about \u00a39,000 (the government&apos;s current plan for an upper limit)?  12.08pm: Clegg defends the government&apos;s plans and says the plans will end the discrimination faced by part-time students.  12.08pm: Harman is still talking about tuition fees. She says you all know what it&apos;s like. You&apos;re at freshers&apos; week and you meet up with a dodgy bloke and do things that you regret. Clegg is in the same situation, she says.  12.09pm: Clegg says Labour is not in a position to present itself as the friend of students. Labour is proposing a graduate tax that half the Labour frontbench does not support.  12.09pm: Harman asks Clegg what the percentage cut to the university teaching grant is.  12.10pm: Clegg does not answer, but he says Labour had plans to make &quot;massive cuts&quot; to university funding. Under the government&apos;s plans, all students will pay less per month than they do at the moment.  12.10pm: Harman says Clegg has been taking lessons from the prime minister on how not to answer the question. Funding for university teaching will be cut by 80%.  12.12pm: Clegg says the graduate tax that Harman advocates would be more unfair. It would allow higher earners to opt out of the system altogether. &quot;We have a progressive plan; she has no plan whatsoever.&quot; Harman says Clegg hawked himself around university campuses at the election promising not to put up tuition fees. Clegg should honour his promise to students. Clegg says it is quite something to take lectures from Harman on party management. Before the election, he did not know the &quot;unholy mess&quot; that would be left by Labour.      Nick Clegg speaks during today's PMQs. Photograph: PA    12.14pm: Snap verdict: Harman won on style, Clegg on substance. More later.  12.15pm: Tom Greatrex (Lab) asks why the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, is opposing the sale of forests in Scotland, but not in England. Clegg plays for time with a line about about everyone is picking on Alexander. He refers to Harman&apos;s jibe comparing Alexander to a &quot;ginger rodent&quot;. Then he says this is a devolved matter, and that different policies apply in Scotland.  12.17pm: Asked about the cancellation of the loan to Sheffield Forgemasters, Clegg says the loan was made by Labour just before the general election, when the party should have known that no money was available.  12.18pm: Labour&apos;s Gavin Shuker asks Clegg is he has a message for the students protesting about tuition fees. Clegg says he meets student leaders all the times. Shuker should explain what Labour&apos;s policy is.  12.21pm: Labour&apos;s Sheila Gilmore says the government has said that the tuition fee reforms are designed to shift responsibility for university funding to the student. How does that square with Clegg&apos;s claim that the policy is all about deficit reduction? Clegg says the government looked &quot;exhaustively&quot; at whether to introduce a graduate tax, but decided it could not work.  12.23pm: There&apos;s only one subject of interest to Labour today. Paul Blomfield (Lab, Sheffield Central) asks if the government will continue to fund arts subjects. Clegg dodges the question, and repeats the point about the reform package being progressive.  12.24pm: Caroline Dinenage, a Conservartive, asks if Sure Start funding will be focused on the poor. Clegg says this is starting to happen.  12.25pm: Labour&apos;s Emily Thornberry asks when Clegg changed his mind about tuition fees. Clegg says he finds it &quot;extraordinary&quot; that Thornberry can &quot;piously&quot; ask questions about this when, in the past, Labour has also changed its mind about tuition fees. Labour set up the Browne review. But now it is rejecting its conclusions. &quot;Make up your mind,&quot; Clegg says.  12.27pm: Meg Munn, a Labour MP with a Sheffield seat (like Clegg), asks Clegg what he will do to ensure that there is no repeat of the problem there was at polling stations at the election. Clegg says passing a new law will not deal with the problem. The problem was poor organisation and lack of resources. Tim Farron, a Lib Dem MP, asks if teacher training colleges, like one in Cumbria, will continue to have the leading role in training students. Clegg says they will continue to have a role.  12.28pm: Labour&apos;s Heidi Alexander says a new survey said a first-time buyer would need a salary of \u00a3100,000 to buy a home in London. What is the government doing about affordable housing? Clegg says the government has a plan to increase the number of affordable homes being built.  12.30pm: John Baron, a Conservative, says the conditions for a successful counter-insurgency do not apply in Afghanistan. Clegg says the government needs to have its political strategy and military strategy in balance.  12.31pm: Labour&apos;s Tom Blenkinsop asks what pre-election promises Clegg has kept, apart from giving murderers and rapists the vote. Clegg says Britain needs to bring its law into line with international human rights law. This is regrettable, he says.  12.33pm: Stephen Lloyd, a Liberal Democrat, asks if Clegg agrees that the pupil premium will be significant. Yes, says Clegg. It will give poor pupils more access to one-to-one support.  12.34pm: Labour&apos;s Phil Wilson asks what the government will do about landlords who fiddle the housing benefit system. Clegg welcomes the question, and says it underlines why it is important to reform housing benefit.  12.43pm: Verdict: It&apos;s helpful to see Nick Clegg do PMQs because it makes you realise how good David Cameron actually is in this arena. Harman was great fun. Her jokes aren&apos;t always a success, but she delivers these slightly risque &quot;you know what it&apos;s like ... &quot; lines brilliantly and Clegg was on the defensive throughout their exchanges. Clegg is not very good at humility and his attempt to explain why he had changed his mind on tuition fees was not as effective as Vince Cable&apos;s answer to a similar question a few weeks ago. But, once he started explaining the policy, he was better. He had some solid points to make about the benefits of what the government is proposing and, as soon as ministers at the dispatch box start to talk policy, Labour&apos;s policy vacuum leaves them looking opportunistic.  12.48pm: Jim Murphy, Labour&apos;s defence spokesman, has put out a statement about the letter in the Times from retired naval commanders criticising the decision to get rid of Harrier jets and HMS Ark Royal. (See 9.37am.)  The government hasn&apos;t been able to convince the country, nor our most senior ex-Navy commanders, that we are certain that Britain will not need Harriers on our carriers over the next decade. Nick Harvey did not address the main questions this morning. How much extra is the cost of retaining Tornado over Harrier? Will the government publish the advice that led them to make this decision? Can the government guarantee that Britain&apos;s strategic interest around the world will not be harmed by their decision? Our country&apos;s friends have passed polite comment and our own military experts are deeply concerned. It is bewildering for a maritime nation to build two new aircraft carriers yet leave them devoid of Carrier strike capability for a decade.   12.51pm: Here&apos;s a lunchtime summary. \u2022 Three former Labour MPs will go on trial charged with fiddling their expenses after the supreme court rejected their argument that parliamentary privilege meant that the matter should be dealt with by the House of Commons instead. David Chaytor, Elliot Morley and Jim Devine all deny theft by false accounting over their parliamentary expenses. Their legal team had argued that the investigation and any sanctions should &quot;should lie within the hands of parliament&quot;. The supreme court rejected this, although it will not give its reasons for this until a later date.\u2022 David Cameron has urged the Chinese to embrace political and economic reform. In a speech in Beijing, the prime minister said he wanted to see &quot;greater political opening&quot; (ie, freedom) in China. He also said that China should rebalance its economy, spend more and adjust its exchange rate. As Patrick Wintour and Phillip Inman report, Cameron said that in return he would push for China to given better access to lucrative European markets. (See 9.11am.) \u2022 Harriet Harman mocked Nick Clegg at prime minister&apos;s questions over the Lib Dem tuition fees U-turn. On the day of a major demonstration in London against the proposed tuition fee increase, the deputy Labour leader said: &quot;In April [Clegg] said that increasing tuition fees to \u00a37,000 a year would be a disaster. What word would he use to describe fees of \u00a39,000?&quot; She even ventured a risque joke: &quot;We all know what it&apos;s like: you are at freshers&apos; week, you meet up with a dodgy bloke and you do things that you regret. Isn&apos;t it true [Clegg] has been led astray by the Tories?&quot; Clegg responded: &quot;Every single graduate under our scheme will pay less per month than they do under the scheme we inherited under Labour. The bottom 25% of earners will pay much less in their contributions to their university education than they do at the moment.&quot;  \u2022 The high court has ruled that Eric Pickles&apos;s decision to scrap regional housing targets by ministerial order was unlawful. The government is not going to appeal against the decision because it is introducing legislation that that will mean the regional housing targets get scrapped anyway. Bob Neill, the communities minister, said: &quot;This judgment changes very little. Later this month we will be introducing the localism bill to parliament, which will sweep away the controversial regional strategies. Top-down targets don&apos;t build homes - they&apos;ve led to the lowest peacetime house-building rates since 1924.&quot; (See 10.10am.) \u2022 The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published the results of a major review into how the tax system should be reformed. Sir James Mirrlees, the Nobel prize-winning economist who chaired the review, said the current tax system &quot;falls short of the ideal in costly and inequitable ways&quot;. (See 11.34am.) \u2022 Labour renewed its attack on the decision to build two aircraft carriers without having jets to fly on them. Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, was responding to a letter in today&apos;s Times from a group of retired naval commanders saying the decision meant Britain would not be able to defend the Falkland Islands. Murphy said: &quot;It is bewildering for a maritime nation to build two new aircraft carriers yet leave them devoid of Carrier strike capability for a decade.&quot; (See 9.37am and 12.48pm.)  1.44pm: Charles Walker, the Conservative MP for Broxbourne, told the World at One that he was unhappy about an election court being able to overturn the result of an election. He said that elections were &quot;always hard fought&quot; and that it was common for candidates to make extravagant claims about their opponents. He even suggested that he had done it himself.  None of us are without guilt in this, none of us ... Lots of candidates - perhaps even this candidate, Charles Walker - have said things in election literature that might not stand up to the scrutiny of full daylight. That is the nature of politics ... I&apos;ve been in hard fought campaigns. I was in a hard fought campaign with Stephen Pound in Ealing North. We both said some very nasty things about each other. I don&apos;t think I really meant them at the time. I don&apos;t he meant to say them about me. But things get said. We apologised afterwards and we moved on ... At the end of the day we have to have our electorate deciding who they want to be their MP, not a court.   1.52pm: The student demonstration against the tuition fee increase is getting rowdy. Around 200 protesters have broken into Millbank Tower, where the Conservative party is based. Some windows have been broken. My colleague Adam Gabbatt has all the details on his live blog.  2.00pm: This is rather tame compared to the student demo, but here goes anyway. Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, has just named the 12 groups that will run the national citizen service pilots next summer. Around 11,000 places will be available for 16-year-olds who will take part in a voluntary programme lasting about eight weeks. The Challenge Network will provide the most places (3,240) in London, the West Midlands and Greater Manchester. The smallest providers are the Lincolnshire and Rutland Education Business Partnership, which is providing 120 places, and Bolton Lads and Girls Club, which is providing 270. The full details should be on the Cabinet Office website soon.  2.43pm: The government won its vote in the House of Lords last night on the public bodies bill. Yesterday I said the vote could be tricky, because peers are unhappy about the fact that the bill will give ministers the power to abolish quangos by ministerial order. In the event, even though some Tory and Lib Dem peers expressed unease about the measure, a Labour attempt to delay the bill until it had been the subject of a select committee inquiry was defeated by 37 votes. One of the peers who complained about the bill was Lord Woolf, the former lord chief justice. He is unhappy because the bill would allow some judicial quangos to be abolished easily. He said the bill was &quot;a matter of grave concern to the judiciary&quot;.  2.58pm: The Archbishop of Canterbury may have God on his side, but he doesn&apos;t have the support of the voters. YouGov have been polling on his statement at the weekend about the government&apos;s plan to force some unemployed people to work for their benefits putting them into a &quot;downward spiral of uncertainty, even despair&quot;. Only 23% of respondents said they agreed with the archbishop&apos;s comments. Some 64% said they disagreed. The full figures are here. The same poll also shows widespread support for the government&apos;s plan, with 74% in favour and 22% opposed. For the record, here are the latest figures from last night&apos;s YouGov poll of GB voting intentions. Conservatives: 40% (up three points from the general election)Labour: 39% (up nine)Lib Dems: 13% (down 11) Government approval rating: -7       3.44pm: Here&apos;s an afternoon reading list. \u2022 Cory Hazlehurst at Liberal Conspiracy lists three &quot;silly misconceptions&quot; about the Phil Woolas case.  This level of ignorance about the legal system is shocking. The case is on whether election law was broken. And it&apos;s judges who interpret the laws that elected MPs pass. That&apos;s their job. It&apos;s called the separation of powers; it&apos;s quite famous and useful. As I mentioned above, it&apos;s politicians who make these laws. And Woolas was found guilty of illegal practices under section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (false statements as to candidates). This section was most recently amended by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. According to www.publicwhip.org.uk, guess who voted in favour of this legislation? Yep, that&apos;s right. A certain Mr Phil Woolas MP.  \u2022 Julian Glover at Comment is free says there is nothing new about British aircraft carriers having no jets on them.  The government&apos;s decision to complete two new aircraft carriers, but wait a decade for the planes, is in fact the continuation of a ludicrous naval tradition. In 2006, recently built navy Sea Harrier jets were pulled out of service, to meet the cost of the Afghan war. The remaining Harriers \u2013 run by the RAF \u2013 were sent to Afghanistan, and almost never visited the aircraft carriers they were supposed to serve. The carriers were left to sail around with a few helicopters on board, hoping that the RAF might find time to call by with its jets.  \u2022 Dizzy Thinks reveals that the cost of producing Commons early day motions is about \u00a31m a year. \u2022 Alastair Campbell on his blog writes about the event held to celebrate the life of Michael Foot. \u2022 Michael Crick on his blog says that the decision to delay the new election in Oldham East and Saddleworth was not taken by the Speaker, John Bercow. It was taken by all three main parties. &quot;Mr Bercow did not even make a recommendation on the issue,&quot; Crick writes.  4.05pm: I&apos;m calling it a day. This afternoon has been dominated by the student demo and the violence at Millbank. As I write, a group of (mostly posh-sounding) students are arguing among themselves live on Sky about whether or not breaking the law is justified. For more details, do read my colleague Adam Gabbatt&apos;s live blog.  People are already starting to ask questions about the quality of the police operation today. As for the political implications? It&apos;s hard to say at this stage. I think we can be pretty certain that the Lib Dems are going to have trouble holding university seats at the next election, but we probably knew that already. At the Telegraph, Benedict Brogan has written a blogpost suggesting today&apos;s events could even be a boon for ministers. Thanks for the comments. Tomorrow we&apos;ve got the welfare reform white paper."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/nov/10/bae-positive-investor-day", "sentences": ["Rolls-Royce&apos;s rollercoaster continues, with the shares down 9p at 597.5p following reports Singapore Airlines planned to replace the company&apos;s Trent 900 engines - the ones involved in the Qantas incident - in three A380s after it found oil stains.", "Singapore Airlines said the moves were precautionary and the stains seemed different to the oil leakage in the Qantas engines."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-10T11:09:41Z", "title": "BAE Systems climbs after positive investor day, but FTSE still under pressure", "tags": ["Business", "BAE Systems", "Lonmin", "BHP Billiton"], "article": "BAE Systems has seen strong growth in US orders in the third quarter, despite some concerns that new large military programmes could be delayed due to cost cutting. So with a positive note from Investec Securities in the wake of an investor day, BAE&apos;s shares have climbed 14.2p to 362.7p in a falling market. The company told Reuters that it expected the start of a US programme for new ground combat vehicles to be delayed by six to nine months, but third quarter sales still grew in the US. This tallies with comments made by the company at yesterday&apos;s meeting with the City. Investec analyst Andrew Gollan said:  We re-iterate our buy recommendation following a bullish investor day yesterday. The key takeaways for us are: 1) BAE is the most global of the defence majors, and 2) for the first time in a long time, management is talking in terms of growing the top line across its broad portfolio, despite slowing defence budgets in the UK and US. BAE is not ex-growth.  BAE has played a clever political game through the SDSR [strategic defence and security review], guiding to slightly lower earnings per share in the recent interim management statement. However, we think the group is well placed to exploit long term growth opportunities and hence the shares are still good value at a 2011 estimated PE of around 8.0 times \u2013 a 20% discount to the sector and a 22% discount to US defence majors with the added attraction of a 5.2% forecast yield.   The rise in BAE has done little to lift the wider market, with the FTSE 100 down 27.51 points at 5847.68. It slipped a little further following the Bank of England&apos;s inflation report, which indicated inflation would fall below target in two years time but the outlook was still highly uncertain. Gilts fell while sterling moved higher as the details of the report emerged and analysts said the comments suggested there would be no UK quantitative easing in the near term. There were continuing worries about the Irish economy too, as well as Greece, where there were reports its budget deficit would be revised up from 7.8% to 9.2% or so, due to weak revenue growth as austerity measures make an impact. A fall in the US market overnight set the tone for the morning&apos;s caution. Joshua Raymond, market strategist at City Index said:  Large chunks of selling into the key miners was a key drag on US markets last night and so it is no surprise to see the miners struggling in today&apos;s European session. I would not say that the selling we have seen in the miners today marks a turnaround in sentiment but may simply be investors locking in strong gains having seen the mining sector hit a new 28 month high yesterday. Weaker than expected data from China which showed that import growth was potentially slowing has been the trigger.   So Lonmin is 63p lower at \u00a318.31 while BHP Billiton is down 63.5p at 2405.5p. Rolls-Royce&apos;s rollercoaster continues, with the shares down 9p at 597.5p following reports Singapore Airlines planned to replace the company&apos;s Trent 900 engines - the ones involved in the Qantas incident - in three A380s after it found oil stains.

The signatories, who include former navy chief Lord West and admiral of the fleet Sir Julian Oswald also said they believed David Cameron had been badly advised before agreeing to the measures, which they said &quot;practically invited&quot; Argentina to attempt to inflict a national humiliation on the British on the scale of the loss of Singapore in 1942. But a spokesman for the Falklands government said it was not concerned that defence cuts would leave the islands vulnerable to attack. &quot;The Falkland Islands government is satisfied and grateful for the levels of defence on the islands which are suitable to maintain an effective deterrent,&quot; a spokesman said. West, who served as a counter-terrorism minister in the previous Labour government, told the Times he was not convinced that the prime minister had been given a &quot;full and proper briefing about the implications&quot; of the defence cuts. Describing the Harrier decision as &quot;strategically and financially perverse&quot;, the group claimed that keeping Tornado jets would cost seven times as much in maintenance during the next decade. &quot;Was the recent exercise not supposed to save money?&quot; they wrote. West told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme this morning that the Falklands were an example to illustrate the lack of capability: &quot;It applies all around the world,&quot; he said. &quot;The only way to get fixed-wing air covering our troops is to have them on aircraft carriers. The Tornado can&apos;t get to any of these places.&quot; On the Falklands, West said: &quot;What we mustn&apos;t forget is that the Argentines still see sovereignty as a major issue. If the islands were captured we have absolutely no way whatsoever of recovering them unless we have carrier air.&quot; Nick Harvey, the junior defence minister, hit back at the claims, claiming the difficult decision had been based on the &quot;balance&quot; of advice given by those now at the helm. Harvey told Today: &quot;The actual battle we are involved in here and now is the battle in Afghanistan. This was a very difficult decision. It was looked at in immense detail. In the end a decision had to be made and we took the decision on the basis of the balance of military advice coming from the current military leadership.&quot; The other signatories to the letter were Vice-Admiral Sir Jeremy Blackham, Vice-Admiral John McAnally and Major-General Julian Thompson. They wrote: &quot;In respect of the newly valuable Falklands and their oilfields, because of these and other cuts, for the next 10 years at least, Argentina is practically invited to attempt to inflict on us a national humiliation on the scale of the loss of Singapore. One from which British prestige, let alone the administration in power at the time, might never recover.&quot; The strategic defence and security review outlined plans to ditch the fleet of 80 Harrier jump jets, which can take off and land from carriers, decommission the Ark Royal and scrap a number of other ships. Other measures included cutting the number of army troops by around 7,000, taking them to 95,000 by 2015, and scrapping the planned Nimrod MRA4 maritime reconnaissance aircraft, despite spending \u00a33bn on its development. The admirals invoked the threat from Hitler to warn about the cuts, saying: &quot;The government has, in effect, declared a new &apos;10-year rule&apos; that assumes Britain will have warning time to rebuild to face a threat. The last Treasury-driven &apos;10-year rule&apos; in the 1930s nearly cost us our freedom, faced with Hitler.&quot; They concluded: &quot;We believe that these decisions should be rescinded in the over-riding national interest, before it is too late.&quot; Liam Fox, the defence secretary, defended the changes in comments to the Times: &quot;It is simply not the case that decommissioning the Harrier would impact upon our ability to defend territories in the south Atlantic. We maintain a wide range of assets, not least a well-defended airfield to ensure the defence of the Falkland Islands. The Harrier force has made an impressive contribution to our nation&apos;s security over the decades but difficult decisions had to be made ... and I&apos;m clear that rationalising our fast jet fleet makes both operational and economic common sense.&quot; Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, said the government had not been able to convince the country or &quot;our most senior ex-navy commanders&quot; that Britain would not need Harriers over the next decade. &quot;Nick Harvey did not address the main questions this morning,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;How much extra is the cost of retaining Tornado over Harrier?

He said: &quot;[The commanders] are clearly trying to defend their corner by using the Falklands as an emotive subject. But it doesn&apos;t reflect the reality. We should move on from this language suggesting war is likely.&quot; Fowler, the islands&apos; superintendent of education at the time of the Falklands war in 1982, said he was reassured by the attitude of the government in Argentina. &quot;The main thing that is preventing us trembling in our boots is watching Argentina. It doesn&apos;t seem particularly interested or capable of mounting an invasion. There&apos;s no popular will for that in Argentina, the strength of their armed forces have been much reduced since 1982.&quot; Some on the island said they shared the concerns expressed by the retired naval commanders. Neil Watson, who farms 2,000 sheep on Long Island, said: &quot;I think it is stupid for Britain not to have a fixed-wing aircraft that can land on an aircraft carrier. It will affect other parts of the world, too, but we are the most vulnerable.&quot; &quot;If Argentina invaded again we would be outgunned in the air and outgunned on the sea,&quot; he added. Charles Dickson, who manages two sheep farms, said the islands would be defenceless if Argentina attacked Mount Pleasant Airport. &quot;We would be left dangling in the wind before anyone could get to us, if there isn&apos;t an aircraft carrier to get planes here quickly.&quot; He added: &quot;I&apos;m grateful for the way they look after us, but with no aircraft carrier the insurance isn&apos;t so good.&quot; Argentina says it is committed to recovering sovereignty of the islands by peaceful means. Fowler said there was no sense of alarm on the island about the cuts. &quot;Nobody on our letters pages has been raising these concerns recently. &quot;We will wearily include a story about it on Friday, because we are not particularly excited or upset about it at the moment. We feel that we are very well protected for the size of population.&quot; He added: &quot;We were very surprised at the time of the invasion, so I&apos;m a little bit cautious about saying everything will be fine. But the situation has changed so much since then.&quot; Tony Blake, a former member of the Falklands government, suggested relations with Argentina are improving. An Argentina veteran of the 1982 invasion is coming to stay at his home next weekend for the second time, as part of a visit with two other veterans. &quot;They come here to bury the ghost. People here don&apos;t show any aggression to them,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;I don&apos;t think people here are concerned at present. There appears to be no weakening of the political will to defend us.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/10/singapore-airlines-withdraws-a380s", "sentences": ["Rolls-Royce&apos;s share price was put under further pressure today after Singapore Airlines withdrew three superjumbo airliners from service.", "Singapore Airlines recalled three A380s from Melbourne, Sydney and London after checks revealed oil stains on their engines, less than a week after a Qantas engine blew up during a flight over Indonesia and forced the aircraft into an emergency landing.", "Singapore Airlines said: &quot;Based on further analysis of inspection findings as the investigation into last week&apos;s incident involving another operator&apos;s Airbus A380 is progressing, Singapore Airlines will be carrying out precautionary engine changes on three A380s.&quot; The other A380 customer with Trent 900 engines, Lufthansa, confirmed that it had changed the engine on one of its superjumbos, but said the move was not related to concerns about oil leakage.", "Jason Adams, aerospace and defence analyst at Japanese investment bank Nomura, said: &quot;It&apos;s still too early to say what&apos;s exactly wrong but the news from Singapore Airlines makes the situation a bit more concerning.", "Singapore would not have gone to the trouble \u2013 and time \u2013 to replace these A380 engines if they did not think it was serious.", "But the news that Singapore Airlines has reported a similar oil problem in three of its Trent 900s suggests that the fault could hit all 20 of the A380s which are fitted with Rolls-Royce engines."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-10T19:25:11Z", "title": "Rolls-Royce shares slide after more aircraft are grounded", "tags": ["Rolls-Royce", "Airline industry", "Business", "Air transport", "World news"], "article": "Rolls-Royce&apos;s share price was put under further pressure today after Singapore Airlines withdrew three superjumbo airliners from service. Singapore Airlines recalled three A380s from Melbourne, Sydney and London after checks revealed oil stains on their engines, less than a week after a Qantas engine blew up during a flight over Indonesia and forced the aircraft into an emergency landing. Today shares in the British engineering firm fell 3%, finishing at 588p. Singapore Airlines said: &quot;Based on further analysis of inspection findings as the investigation into last week&apos;s incident involving another operator&apos;s Airbus A380 is progressing, Singapore Airlines will be carrying out precautionary engine changes on three A380s.&quot; The other A380 customer with Trent 900 engines, Lufthansa, confirmed that it had changed the engine on one of its superjumbos, but said the move was not related to concerns about oil leakage. Qantas said initial checks of its A380 fleet had revealed traces of oil in engines, which is considered irregular for new aircraft. The news puts even more pressure on Rolls-Royce to provide further information on the problems when it publishes a routine trading statement on Friday. In the last week, it has only made two brief statements claiming that it has made &quot;good progress&quot; in understanding the cause and that the explosion of a Trent 1000 test engine for the Boeing Dreamliner in August was not connected to the faults affecting the 900. Jason Adams, aerospace and defence analyst at Japanese investment bank Nomura, said: &quot;It&apos;s still too early to say what&apos;s exactly wrong but the news from Singapore Airlines makes the situation a bit more concerning. Singapore would not have gone to the trouble \u2013 and time \u2013 to replace these A380 engines if they did not think it was serious. It had been thought that only Qantas&apos; Trent 900 engines had been affected because the carrier runs them harder than other airlines. But the news that Singapore Airlines has reported a similar oil problem in three of its Trent 900s suggests that the fault could hit all 20 of the A380s which are fitted with Rolls-Royce engines. So far, almost a tenth of the Trent 900 engines in operation are faulty, with six found with oil leaks and one having blown up in mid-air. Airbus, the A380 manufacturer, added today that it has not had any orders cancelled since the engine problems emerged."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/10/gordon-ramsay-open-letter", "sentences": ["In a shameless appeal to the nation&apos;s patriotic instincts, the six say the move would leave the Falklands wide open to attack, &quot;practically inviting Argentina to attempt to inflict on us a national humiliation on the scale of the loss of Singapore, one from which British prestige ."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-10T19:30:01Z", "title": "Gordon Ramsay: 'Dear Mother-in-law'", "tags": ["Gordon Ramsay", "Chefs", "Life and style"], "article": "It&apos;s been a good week for the open letter.

But it&apos;s not always the right thing to do, and it doesn&apos;t always work. Open letters may be written to make their signatories&apos; views plain; to criticise the behaviour of a person, organisation or government; to draw attention to, and spark debate about, an issue; to prompt action by the recipient. Written by an individual, says PR expert Mark Borkowski, an open letter can certainly, on occasion, &quot;really work. If someone takes a bold step, puts themselves out there, says: &apos;This is who I am, and this is what I stand for.&apos;&quot; Signed by a group of people \u2013 &quot;academics, pressure groups, NGOs&quot; \u2013 making &quot;a serious collective point&quot; (on healthcare, education, green technology) it can also be &quot;a highly effective tool&quot;. For Toby Orr, a partner at influential London lobbyists Portland, the open letter can be &quot;a valuable device&quot;, but really only &quot;if it leads to a front-page news story. If it stays on the Letters pages it can be a valuable contribution to the debate, certainly, but no more. When it&apos;s really effective is when it becomes a story in its own right.&quot; The open letter format, adds Orr, is also &quot;a very good method for carefully managing the message from multiple voices&quot; \u2013 in other words, ensuring all involved sing from the same hymn sheet, a feat that &quot;isn&apos;t always easy to achieve, certainly within, for example, a political party&quot;. Particularly effective recent open letters, Orr says, include a couple of memorable salvos fired by the Conservatives during this year&apos;s general election, including an opening one from prominent business leaders to the Telegraph supporting Tory objections to Labour&apos;s plan to increase national insurance, and another to the Times in the final week of the campaign claiming that &quot;under Labour, the UK is becoming hostile territory for entrepreneurial businesses&quot;. A slightly desperate Labour riposte, in the form of a counter open letter to the Guardian signed by a academics and economists, was &quot;simply not as effective&quot;, Orr says. In repressive societies, open letters can be as dangerous as they are explosive. Iranian economist Nader Habibi, who teaches at Brandeis University in the United States, admits his reluctance to sign a recent open letter to Iran&apos;s Grand Ayatollahs calling on them to condemn the government&apos;s violence against political protesters. While he agreed with the content of the letter and wanted to add his name to the signatories, &quot;I was afraid of the consequences for myself and my family.&quot; Habib suggests a solution he calls the &quot;pre-participation threshold assurance mechanism&quot;, under which an open letter of protest would be published only once a certain number of signatories had put their name to it. Of course, the mother of all individual open letters (and one that also held considerable danger for its author) was Emile Zola&apos;s J&apos;accuse, published on 13 January 1898 on the front page of the newspaper L&apos;Aurore. Addressed to the French president, F\u00e9lix Faure, the letter accused the government of &quot;shameful&quot; antisemitism in what Zola asserted was the unlawful jailing of Alfred Dreyfus, an army officer sentenced to a lifetime of hard labour in a far-off penal colony for alleged espionage. In a long, impassioned and eloquently argued text, Zola pointed to a succession of judicial errors, a complete lack of any serious evidence, and a long series of official coverups of the condemned man&apos;s innocence, all resulting in &quot;one of the greatest inquities of the century&quot; whose &quot;filth . . . has sullied the image of France&quot;. He concluded by accusing assorted named military officers of deceit, fraud, villainy and evil, by stating that he was aware he was opening himself up to the charge of libel, and by declaring: &quot;I have but one passion: to enlighten those who have been kept in the dark, in the name of humanity which has suffered so much, and is entitled to happiness. My fiery protest is simply the cry of my soul. Let them dare, then, to bring me before a court of law and let the inquiry take place in broad daylight! I am waiting.&quot; Zola was indeed tried and found guilty of libel, but fled to England. After losing one retrial (but winning a pardon nonetheless), Dreyfus finally had his guilty verdict annulled in 1906. Similarly feted is Martin Luther King&apos;s Letter from Birmingham Jail \u2013 also known as The Negro Is Your Brother \u2013 written on 16 April 1963 by the American civil rights leader from a prison cell in Birmingham, Alabama, where he had been locked up for his part in a non-violent protest against racial segregation by the city authorities and certain shopkeepers. King&apos;s letter, a response to eight white clergymen who argued that while social injustices might exist, the battle against segregation should not be fought on the street, argued that true civil rights could never be achieved without non-violent, but forceful, direct action. &quot;This &apos;Wait&apos;&quot;, he wrote, &quot;has almost always meant &apos;Never,&apos;&quot; adding that &quot;one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws&quot; and concluding, famously: &quot;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&quot; (Unusually, the Letter from Birmingham Jail was first published without King&apos;s consent in the New York Post Sunday Magazine; it appeared the following month in its entirety in four other publications including the Atlantic Monthly.) Equally powerful was Siegfried Sasson&apos;s letter to his commanding officer refusing to return to duty in 1917. This was published in the Bradford Pioneer on 27 July, read to the House of Commons on 30 July, and reprinted in the Times the following day. Risking a court martial and possible execution, Sassoon declared that he was making his statement &quot;as an act of wilful defiance of military authority, because I believe that the war is being deliberately prolonged by those who have the power to end it&quot;. He had, he said, &quot;seen and endured the sufferings of the troops&quot; and could &quot;no longer be a party to prolonging these sufferings for ends which I believe to be evil and unjust&quot;, and was protesting &quot;not against the conduct of the war, but against the political errors and insincerities for which the fighting men are being sacrificed&quot;. Open letters that led to notable results include Professor James Syme&apos;s impassioned calls for medical reform in 1854 and 1857, addressed to the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, which led directly to the Medical Act of 1858, drawn up essentially as Syme had dictated. These days, of course, open letters have become a favoured form of corporate communication, written simply to relay the same thing to lots of people in an apparently personal way. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s now-famous apology to users of the social networking site upset about privacy changes began, memorably: &quot;We really messed this one up.&quot; Part of the power of the literary open letter, says John Sutherland, emeritus Lord Northcliffe professor of Modern English Literature at University College London, is &quot;the contradiction, since letters are personal communication, unlike oratory. What gives a banal collection of correspondence like Philip Larkin&apos;s Letters to Monica its zing is the furtive sense of peeking through the keyhole.&quot; In the literary genre, Sutherland recommends the Screwtape Letters, CS Lewis&apos;s epistolatory novel of Christian apologetics; Letters to my Torturer, Iranian journalist Houshang Asadi&apos;s searing memoir of his 682 days in solitary confinement written in the form of letters to Brother Hamid, his torturer; and the remarkable website Letter to my Abuser, on which women can publish letters to their abusers. Only very seldom, though, are open letters used to pursue private differences in public \u2013 and when they are, the result is rarely elevating. Literary spats can be an entertaining exception: former newsreader Anna Ford laid into Martin Amis in a recent open letter to the Guardian, accusing him of &quot;narcissism&quot;, an &quot;inability to empathise&quot; and an unwillingness to look &quot;closely and honestly at himself&quot; in relation to other people. She also related a couple of very personal anecdotes illustrating the above alleged shortcomings. (Amis seems, for some reason, to attract this kind of public feuding: he and Marxist critic Terry Eagleton engaged in a very public row over alleged Islamophobia after a 2006 interview in which Amis said Muslims ought to &quot;suffer until they get their house in order&quot;; Eagleton subsequently described Amis&apos;s father Kingsley as a &quot;racist, antisemitic boor; a drink-sodden, self-hating reviler of women, gays and liberals&quot;, adding: &quot;Amis fils has clearly learned more from [his father] than how to turn a shapely phrase.&quot;) So what to say of Ramsay&apos;s bizarre effort? &quot;He is what he is,&quot; says Borkowski. &quot;A very passionate man. But really, that letter was a terrible idea. I don&apos;t know what he was thinking of; I don&apos;t know why, when he&apos;s a TV beast, when he&apos;s spent most of his life sword-fighting with the tabloids, he didn&apos;t turn to TV instead. Time will tell, but I don&apos;t know whether this won&apos;t go down as one of the truly great PR blunders.&quot; In the letter, addressed to Greta Hutcheson but published in the London Evening Standard, Ramsay asks her not to punish his wife Tana \u2013 Greta&apos;s daughter \u2013 for his decision last month to fire Chris Hutcheson as CEO of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. But he goes on to accuse Hutcheson of being controlling and dictatorial in his day-to-day running of the company. He also reveals that he hired a private detective to look into Hutcheson&apos;s &quot;complex&quot; private life \u2013 and hints at hidden realms of further scandal, declaring cryptically that his father- in-law&apos;s &quot;away days&quot; (whatever they might be) were &quot;rarely what I thought they were&quot;. Thus an open letter purporting to be about preventing the complete breakdown of relations between Ramsay&apos;s family and his mother-in-law actually comes across as some kind of veiled warning to Hutcheson; a kind of &quot;Watch your step, sunshine; I&apos;ve got stuff on you that you wouldn&apos;t want aired in public.&quot; Ramsay&apos;s letter did, admittedly, follow an interview Hutcheson gave to a Sunday newspaper claiming Ramsay was a &quot;monster&quot; who had become &quot;warped&quot; by the jet-setting celebrity lifestyle. But the problem with responding as Ramsay did, says Borkowski, is not just that family matters should &quot;never be aired in public&quot;, or that the rumour mill will now be turning even faster than it already was. It&apos;s that these days, the public &quot;aren&apos;t interested in the facts, they&apos;re interested in the story. It&apos;s the gesture of publishing this letter that everyone&apos;s talking about, not the letter&apos;s contents.&quot; And that&apos;s the opposite of what a good open letter should do. An open letter, by its very nature, has to carry some kind of moral authority, real or assumed; with Ramsay, you&apos;re far from sure who you can trust with the truth. Zola he isn&apos;t."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/11/the-fiver-holloway-wilkins-barton", "sentences": ["And France&apos;s Etoile FC have become the first foreign club to win Singapore&apos;s S-League championship.", "&quot;It&apos;s much more difficult for a foreign team to win because most Singaporeans are against us,&quot; ooh-la-lahed captain Matthias Verschave, neglecting to mention that 75% of the S-League&apos;s 12 teams are foreign."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-11T16:32:14Z", "title": "The Fiver | Attacks of the vapours; and Joey Barton | Barry Glendenning and Rob Bagchi", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "BETWEEN A BLACKPOOL ROCK AND A HARD PLACE When Wolves manager Mick McCarthy fielded what amounted to a reserve team for a trip to Manchester United last season, no end of sanctimonious hacks, Wolves fans and non-Wolves fans were overcome by Downton Abbey-esque attacks of the vapours.

By hitting Wolves with a suspended fine, the blazers of the Premier League set a dangerous precedent. And last night, Blackpool manager Ian &quot;Ollie&quot; Holloway threw down the yellow rubber Marigold, threatening to resign if he was punished for doing much the same thing against Aston Villa, the only difference being that instead of getting hammered 3-0 at Old Trafford, his team of Premier League-approved Premier League players playing in the Premier League were desperately unlucky to lose. &quot;Let some person from the Premier League even try to tell me who I can pick,&quot; he roared, before some person from the Premier League had even tried to tell him anything. &quot;I&apos;d just pack it in, I can&apos;t work for this madness.

The current favourite is Russia, but bids have also been submitted, both jointly, by Spain and Portugal, and by Holland and Belgium. In a sign of the seriousness with which Cameron, a part-time Aston Villa supporter, is treating the bid, he reminded cabinet at the beginning of this week that the decision was only a month away and that everyone should do all they could to garner votes. He is also planning to lobby key politicians at the Nato summit in Lisbon next weekend, even though politicians formally have no voting power. Cameron also met Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in Seoul, where the two men discussed their rival bids, and Cameron accepted an invitation to Russia for a summit next year, the first sign of a thaw in relations between the two countries for more than five years.

The prime minister, David Cameron, said it was significant the G20 had recognised that global imbalances posed a problem and was alive to concerns of a race to the bottom. He praised the G20 for putting in place a mechanism that will allow the International Monetary Fund to assess countries and the effects of their exchange rate policies. Downplaying concerns the issue had been &quot;kicked into the long grass&quot; he said it was significant there was a timetable for addressing concerns at the next G20 summit in France. He also hailed a point made in the communique that there was a critical, but narrow, window of opportunity to conclude the long-elusive Doha round of trade liberalisation talks launched in 2001. Britain stood on the sidelines for much of the conference as verbal jousting between the United States and China dominated proceedings. Washington argued progress towards a more balanced global economy is undermined by China&apos;s policy of undervaluing its currency. China has stockpiled its trade surpluses while the US has been left with record trade deficits. China responded that moves by the Federal Reserve to print money were also having a distorting effect. &quot;Exchange rates must reflect economic realities \u2026 Emerging economies need to allow for currencies that are market driven,&quot; US President Barack Obama told a news conference after the communique was agreed. &quot;This is something that I raised with President Hu [Jintao] of China and we will closely watch the appreciation of China&apos;s currency.&quot; Little firm progress The G20&apos;s accord sought to recapture the unity that was forged in crisis two years ago, but deep divides meant the leaders could not venture much beyond what was already agreed by their finance ministers last month. Negotiators had laboured until the early hours of the morning to thrash out an agreement their leaders could all endorse, despite sharp disagreements that were on public display in the days before the meeting. In a departure from earlier statements, the G20 said it would allow emerging market countries with &quot;adequate reserves and increasingly overvalued flexible exchange rates&quot; to use &quot;carefully designed macro-prudential measures&quot;. That is a green light for countries such as Brazil, which has already sought to stem massive inflows of capital, to take further measures, short of deliberately engineering a lower exchange rates. Tempers had flared over the US Federal Reserve&apos;s latest $600bn bond-buying programme aimed at strengthening a shaky recovery, while Ireland&apos;s worsening debt troubles served as a reminder that the financial system is far from fully healed. &quot;This hasn&apos;t been a love-fest,&quot; an official who participated in the negotiations said. In particular, the leaders were unable to agree on how to identify when global imbalances pose a threat to economic stability, merely committing themselves to a discussion of a range of indicators in first half of 2011. Tim Condon, head of research at ING Financial Markets in Singapore said it was &quot;hard to disagree&quot; with the vows of the leaders but they had fallen short of the progress hoped for going into the summit. &quot;They decided just to put down a lot of laudable objectives as the conclusion of the meeting and hope that they can do better, that more can be accomplished in future meetings,&quot; he said. The G20 has fragmented since a global recession gave way to a multi-speed recovery. Slow-growing advanced economies have kept interest rates at record lows to try to kickstart growth, while big emerging markets have come roaring back so fast that many are worried about overheating. &quot;G20 credibility does depend on showing results \u2026 we cannot get out of this with beggar-thy-neighbour policies,&quot; Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, said. &quot;We need instead to continue to co-ordinate our actions going forward. The recovery is fragile. &quot;I don&apos;t think the fact that we aren&apos;t there yet, we haven&apos;t resolved all these problems, means we will fall back.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/12/rolls-royce-traces-a380-fault", "sentences": ["Singapore Airlines recalled three Airbus A380s this week after discovering oil leakage on the engines."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-12T10:54:01Z", "title": "Rolls-Royce identifies component that caused Qantas explosion", "tags": ["Rolls-Royce", "Business", "Airbus", "Airline industry", "Air transport", "World news", "Qantas"], "article": "Rolls-Royce today blamed a single faulty part for last week&apos;s Qantas engine explosion over Indonesia, and warned that the incident will hit its profits this year.

Rolls-Royce also told the City that the incident means its profit growth for 2010 will be lower than expected. Singapore Airlines recalled three Airbus A380s this week after discovering oil leakage on the engines. A Qantas superjumbo fitted with a Rolls-Royce engine was forced into an emergency landing last Thursday when the engine blew up in mid-flight, and the Australian airline&apos;s six Airbus A380s have been grounded since then. Following engine checks, Rolls-Royce has concluded that the problem only relates to the Trent 900 engines used in the superjumbos and that the &quot;failure was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine. This caused an oil fire, which led to the release of the intermediate pressure turbine disc&quot;. This means that 20 A380s in service which are fitted with the Trent 900 engines are affected. The world&apos;s second-largest maker of aircraft engines said it would work with its airline customers over the next few days to replace the faulty component and bring the whole A380 fleet back into service. &quot;Safety is the highest priority of Rolls-Royce,&quot; said Sir John Rose, the chief executive. &quot;We have instigated a programme of measures in collaboration with Airbus, our Trent 900 customers and the regulators. This will enable our customers progressively to bring the whole fleet back into service. We regret the disruption we have caused.&quot; In July, Rolls-Royce expected underlying profits to grow by between 4% and 5% this year, but it now anticipates that profit growth will be &quot;slightly lower&quot;.

The Lionhart Aurora Fund, managed by Cayman-based Lionhart Advisors Group, has chalked up a 79% gain since the beginning of January, more than any other European hedge fund. Globally it is the second best performer after US-based Willowbrook Fund (up 97% this year), according to data from BarclayHedge. Part of a group that employs 25 people in London, Toronto, Singapore and New York, the $65m (\u00a340m) Aurora Fund is mostly invested in everything that western world asset managers have been chasing this year: mining and mineral resource companies as well as early-stage businesses including porcelain and leather companies. &quot;We invest in assets in their early stages, and when they mature, we float them on the stock market, mostly in Toronto,&quot; said Tom Scanlan, head of marketing at Lionhart. Some of the fund&apos;s top listed investments have been in Sri Lanka, a country in the midst of civil war until last year, but now offering some of the highest stock market returns in the world. &quot;We only made very small investments when we arrived, we waited until the end of the civil war, and then we were well placed to decide what to buy,&quot; Scanlan said. Mining investments, such as copper assets in Zambia, are typically sold off once production starts, passing on the development risk to another party. Scanlan said: &quot;We are using the financial markets to monetise the improvement of the viability of an asset coming to production.&quot; Lionhart floats its start-up businesses in Toronto rather than on London&apos;s Alternative Investment Market as it has more liquidity, Scanlan said. Toronto is also the base of the company&apos;s founder, Terrence Duffy, who moved to Canada almost a decade ago. A trader with 20 years&apos; experience, Duffy founded Lionhart in an office near his family home in Wimbledon in 1993, with less than $10m under management. The company now manages $800m. The hedge fund industry has about $1.7tn of assets under management worldwide, after adding a net $19bn of new capital in the third quarter, according to Hedge Fund Research. Stocks and bonds in developed markets in Europe and the US have produced single digit gains at best this year, as they have been hit by languishing economies and the European sovereign debt crisis. &quot;Institutional investors are aware that western equities are no longer the only option, that they have to diversify and one of the easiest ways is to go to hedge funds with exposure to emerging markets,&quot; said Gwyn Roberts, editor of HFMWeek, the trade publication. Hedge funds, usually more flexible and able to make faster decisions than large pension funds or insurance companies, started moving east almost three years ago. Asian economies were continuing to develop as Europe and the US were about to sink in the worst recession since the 1930s. Hedge funds have produced an average return of just 7.1% this year \u2013 a disappointment to investors who pay fees of up to 20% of any profits made.

The explosion in one of its engines on a Qantas &quot;superjumbo&quot; Airbus A380 prompted fears that the Derby-based business might just be about to suffer a similar hit to its reputation as that endured by BP in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Investors \u2013 and airlines around the world \u2013 became increasingly concerned that Rolls&apos;s other engine models could also be faulty, which would have been devastating for a company which prides itself on its global reputation for excellence and safety. Rolls-Royce engineers scrambled to determine the cause of the explosion \u2013 but the limited information the firm provided added to the growing uncertainty. At one point more than \u00a31bn was wiped off the stock market valuation of the company. It would have been a disastrous end to an otherwise illustrious career for its chief executive, Sir John Rose, widely regarded as one of Britain&apos;s premier industrialists, who recently announced he would retire next March after 14 years at the helm. However, after a holding statement this week, Rolls looks as if it has weathered the immediate storm. The company finally gave more details about what had caused the explosion \u2013 a single faulty component which led to oil inside the engine overheating and catching fire. Preliminary inspections found that this resulted in a turbine disc breaking off and shooting through the wing of the aircraft, which was forced to make an emergency landing. The company said it would replace this component in all 20 A380s that were fitted with its Trent 900 engines. It repeated its previous statement from earlier in the week that the fault was specific to the Trent 900, and not connected to an explosion of a different model during tests in August. Rose issued an apology, and despite a warning that the problem would dent its profits this year the shares rose almost 5%, even though analysts at stockbroker Charles Stanley cautioned that Rolls could not draw a line under the problem while further inspections continued. The shares are still some 7% lower than they were before the safety scare began. After the mid-air engine explosion last week, Qantas and Singapore Airlines, two of the three airlines which use the Trent 900, found oil leaks on some of their A380s and then grounded all of their superjumbos. In today&apos;s routine trading statement, Rose used a humble tone. &quot;Safety is the highest priority of Rolls-Royce.\u00a0 We have instigated a programme of measures in collaboration with Airbus, our Trent 900 customers and the regulators.\u00a0 This will enable our customers progressively to bring the whole fleet back into service. We regret the disruption we have caused.&quot; This may be the closest Rose gets \u2013 or needs to get \u2013 to issuing a mea culpa during his time running the company. As Rolls-Royce has been fond of repeating in the last 10 days, this is the first serious incident involving a Rolls-Royce engine on an airliner since 1994. Jason Adams, aerospace and defence analyst at Japanese investment bank Nomura, argued that what unnerved investors was not so much the fault itself \u2013 most aerospace manufacturers have suffered technical problems at one point \u2013 but the revelation that Rolls-Royce was not, after all, infallible. He said: &quot;There has been enough bad news \u2013 which could turn out to be circumstantial \u2013 related to Rolls-Royce&apos;s recent engine failures which has caused some investors to question the company&apos;s reputation and safety record, which previously had been taken for granted.&quot; The impact of the engine problems goes further than Rolls. EADS, the European aerospace conglomerate which controls Airbus, warned that the scare would hit orders of the superjumbo. The need to replace the faulty $14m (\u00a310m) engines \u2013 which Rolls is expected to pick up the tab for \u2013 and extra inspections would slow down deliveries, particularly next year. Tim Clark, president of Emirates airline, also piled further pressure on Rolls this week. Emirates operates the biggest fleet of A380s, albeit with engines made by the Rolls rival Engine Alliance. He called on the company, which before today had only issued two curt statements on the problem, to be a &quot;little bit more communicative about what&apos;s actually going on&quot;, adding it was &quot;vitally important&quot; that the A380 did not become a &quot;bete noire&quot;. It is hard to assess the damage to Rolls-Royce in the longer term, assuming no more faults are discovered. Cass Business School Professor Joseph Lampel said that privately airlines might decide to opt for A380 engines made by its rival. &quot;Inevitably, no airline will openly admit to this, so the potential consequences will unfold over the long run.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/nov/12/lewis-hamilton-formula-one", "sentences": ["I loved the car and it was a great weekend, probably the most perfect weekend I&apos;ve had.&quot; Asked about his worst moments, he said: &quot;It would be easy to say the DNF [did not finish] in Singapore and Monza, but also easy to say DNF in Barcelona and Hungary and the points lost in Suzuka."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-12T21:59:01Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton: 'I'd give everything I possess' to win championship", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2010"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton has raised hopes of achieving his first victory since August after finishing first in the second free practice session ahead of Sunday&apos;s Abu Dhabi grand prix.

Hamilton admits he is looking for a miracle \u2013 he needs to win while the leading three drivers fall by the wayside. But he said: &quot;I&apos;m going to push like never before. There&apos;s no pressure on me. I&apos;ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain. I&apos;ll go and have some fun and hope things turn out well.

Since a wet track is a factor almost as essential as a hint of skulduggery to enliven any grand prix, observers were tempted to detect the influence of Bernie Ecclestone in creating freak conditions for the showdown to the 2010 season, the first time in six decades of world championship history that four drivers have gone into the final race of the year with a chance of winning the title. On Tuesday, as the members of the grand prix circus began assembling at this futuristic circuit, built on a man-made archipelago close to the capital of the richest of the United Arab Emirates, they were greeted by a brief shower. Yesterday morning came a downpour that soaked the circuit and kept most of the Formula One cars in their garages as they waited for the track to dry. The weekend forecast indicates 1mm of rain tomorrow, although there is no guarantee that its arrival will be delayed until 5pm local time (1pm in the UK), when the race, which begins in daylight and ends under floodlights, is scheduled to start. No season has ever been launched with higher expectations, based on the promise of a battle royal between a field containing four world champions, among them Michael Schumacher, making an unexpected return from retirement. The comeback of the seven-times champion turned out to be an anti-climax, as did the opening race at another desert circuit, in Bahrain. Since then, however, the season has pulsated with incident, spectacle and close competition, and now Ecclestone is able to repay the Abu Dhabi rulers&apos; huge investment by bringing the show to their track with the title still at stake and no shortage of intrigue in the paddock. Ferrari&apos;s Fernando Alonso, viewed by most of Fleet Street as the sport&apos;s very own pantomime villain, is the favourite to be celebrating his third championship tomorrow night. Mark Webber, lying eight points behind the Spanish driver, needs to win the race in his Red Bull, with Alonso finishing no higher than third, in order to grab the opportunity of becoming the third Australian to hold the title. For that, however, he may require the co-operation of Sebastian Vettel, his team-mate, who will start the race with his own chance of entering the record books as the youngest ever champion but has hinted that if he is not able to win it himself, he may be ready to give in to the pressure to hand victory to a man 11 years his senior. The fourth contender, Lewis Hamilton, lies 24 points behind Alonso, 16 behind Webber and nine behind Vettel, which leaves him needing snookers, or at least the sort of chaos generally brought about by a sharp shower early in the race, if he is to win his second title. His silver McLaren glittered under the lights as he set the fastest time in yesterday evening&apos;s second practice session, which was an encouraging start. So the stage is set for an epic shoot-out. After 18 rounds and more than 2,600 miles of racing across four continents, the issue will be settled over 55 laps of a 3.45-mile track which winds around a harbour, under a seven-star hotel enclosed in a glass bubble and past spectacular canopied grandstands. Unstained by the blood and grime of history, the Yas Marina circuit resembles an airbrushed setting for a video game and could hardly be less like such traditional battlegrounds as the Belle Epoque amphitheatre of Monaco, the majestic flat-out challenges of Spa-Francorchamps and Monza, the open countryside of Silverstone or the howling, passion-filled cockpit of Interlagos. But this, by Ecclestone&apos;s decree, is Formula One&apos;s future. In resolutely following the scent of new money, the sport&apos;s ruthless impresario has fulfilled his ambition to turn grand prix racing into a genuinely worldwide enterprise. Next year there will be a race in Delhi, followed by one in Austin, Texas in 2013 and another in Sochi, Russia a year later. The first world championship, in 1950, was decided over seven rounds, all but one in Europe. This year there have been 19, involving each member of the eight UK-based teams in a travel itinerary totalling just over a quarter of a million miles, 54,000 of them in the past eight weeks as the campaign reached its climax with a hectic succession of trips to the far east, South America and the Persian Gulf. This weekend most of the teams&apos; workers are running on empty, relying on a squirt of adrenaline to see them through to the finish. Not all, however, will admit to exhaustion. &quot;Not this year,&quot; Ole Schack, a 32-year-old Dane who is the No2 mechanic on Vettel&apos;s car, said yesterday in Abu Dhabi&apos;s spacious paddock. &quot;Not at all. We&apos;ve had a fantastic season and when you go from one strong result to another, you look forward to the next race \u2013 even if it&apos;s a tight schedule and you&apos;ve got a lot of work to do in between.&quot; The two Red Bull drivers have won eight of the 18 races between them, scoring maximum points for a one-two finish in Sao Paulo last weekend as the Milton Keynes-based team, who took over the Jaguar infrastructure in 2005, wrapped up their first constructors&apos; championship. &quot;That means a huge amount to us,&quot; Schack said. &quot;It&apos;s what every team works towards, and in six years we&apos;ve achieved the biggest prize in Formula One.&quot; Not, of course, the most glamorous. It is the drivers&apos; title that engages the emotions of the sport&apos;s global audience, but Schack was adamant that no special tensions are evident in the Red Bull camp this weekend as Vettel and Webber prepare to fight it out with Alonso and Hamilton. &quot;The pressure&apos;s always there,&quot; he said. &quot;You prepare to be the best you can, and this weekend is no different.&quot; For Andy Latham, who has spent this season as Hamilton&apos;s race engineer, and who says he will only allow himself to feel exhausted once the season is over, the year&apos;s fortunes have been more fluctuating. The McLaren team began with the surprise package of the innovative F-duct, but took time to get into a winning stride. &quot;For me the high point was Lewis&apos;s win in Canada, which was strategically a tough race,&quot; said Latham. &quot;The low point was the crash with Webber in Singapore \u2013 our second failure to finish in a row, which made the championship look a lot more difficult. Lewis was a little bit down after that. We all were. The car was a match for anything at that point and he was driving fantastically.&quot; The reference point has been the speed of the Red Bulls. &quot;All three of the leading teams have been battling hard to upgrade their cars all year,&quot; Latham said, &quot;and we&apos;ve done a good job to be where we are. But they&apos;ve been the class of the field in terms of ultimate pace for most of the season, to be honest.&quot; Of all the contenders, Hamilton and Latham have the most straightforward task. &quot;We&apos;ve got to win the race,&quot; the 32-year-old engineer said. &quot;We can&apos;t do a lot about what happens to the rest. It&apos;s just got to be a perfect weekend.&quot; For Ferrari, who are sponsored by one of Abu Dhabi&apos;s investment companies and who launched their vast theme park \u2013 complete with a 150mph rollercoaster ride \u2013 next to the track this week, the perfect weekend would involve a championship for Alonso in his first season with the team. The four horsemen of this season&apos;s F1 apocalypse topped the timing sheets under the lights last night, with Hamilton ahead of Vettel, Alonso and Webber. Were they to finish the race itself in that order, the title would be the Spaniard&apos;s. &quot;We need to do the things we normally do,&quot; Stefano Domenicali, the team&apos;s 45-year-old principal, said last night, knowing that the Scuderia Ferrari long ago outgrew a reputation for imploding under pressure. &quot;We don&apos;t need to think too hard or make too many strategies, otherwise you get lost. &quot;Every one of us is trying to control the emotions that we feel inside,&quot; he concluded, speaking for his own team but echoing the thoughts of all those with a stake in this most compelling of Formula One finales."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/14/my-bright-idea-john-maeda", "sentences": ["Singapore or Japan are highly known test-taking countries focused on science and engineering, yet are desperate to find innovation."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-14T00:05:02Z", "title": "My bright idea: Innovation is born when art meets science", "tags": ["Technology", "Art and design", "Culture", "Science", "iPod", "Design", "Education", "Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "article": "A graphic designer and computer scientist, known for his work on the online computer game Second Life, as well as the author of bestselling self-help book The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda has\u00a0made great use of dual educations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and art school. Drawing from his experiences in these two disciplines, the 44-year-old has come to believe that too stark a distinction is drawn between science and the arts. It is Maeda&apos;s conviction that scientists need art and artists in their professional lives in order to invent and innovate successfully, and with a particular focus on education he has toured the world to promote the idea that government-approved &quot;Stem&quot; subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) should be widened to include art; &quot;turning Stem into Steam,&quot; as he puts it. This week Maeda, who is president of the Rhode Island School of Design, will expound on these ideas at an experimental installation at London&apos;s Riflemaker gallery, where he will &quot;dispense wisdom from a sandpit&quot;. See Riflemaker.org for more on this eccentric project. Why does science need artists? We seem to forget that innovation doesn&apos;t just come from equations or new kinds of chemicals, it comes from a human place. Innovation in the sciences is always linked in some way, either directly or indirectly, to a human experience. And human experiences happen through engaging with the arts \u2013 listening to music, say, or seeing a piece of art. So to help them become more humanist, you&apos;d parachute artists and musicians into laboratories? Which already happens to some degree with artist-in-residence programmes in scientific labs. They&apos;re usually very small, but these programmes are seen as quite desirable by scientists. Because all scientists are humans, and they are humanists inside, and by bringing that part out, innovation happens more naturally. Can you think of an example where an injection of the arts has helped the sciences? I recently saw something in Time magazine, a famous Nobel laureate chemist making molecular models out of clay. It shows how these more fluid, abstract materials traditionally belonging to the artist lend themselves better to ways of thinking about the world, as opposed to some kind of ball-and-stick model that shows a constrained view. Art helps you see things in a less constrained space. Our economy is built upon convergent thinkers, people that execute things, get them done. But artists and designers are divergent thinkers: they expand the horizon of possibilities. Superior innovation comes from bringing divergents (the artists and designers) and convergents (science and engineering) together. Such as? Look at Apple&apos;s iPod. A perfect example of technology \u2013 an MP3 player \u2013 that existed for a long time but that nobody ever wanted, until design made it something desirable, useful, integrated into your lifestyle. Look at the success of Mint.com [a colourful money-management website] which has recently been sold. It&apos;s an app in which 80% of the experience is what you see, how you touch it. Not the technology. I&apos;m also interested in how art and design links into leadership. Because leaders now are facing a very chaotic landscape, things are no longer black and white, things are harder to predict. What better mindset to adopt than the artist&apos;s, who is very used to living in an ambiguous space? Real innovation doesn&apos;t just come from technology, it comes from places like art and design. George Osborne recently announced protection in the higher-education cuts for the so-called Stem subjects, but not the arts. Is this blinkered? You know, it&apos;s easy for politicians to look at the measurability of a science and maths education. I mean, fill out 100 questions, you get 100 right or 50 right or zero right, it&apos;s easy to measure. There&apos;s no test that can give you a score from zero to 100 on the question, &quot;Is this student a good writer?&quot; And society&apos;s so focused on measurement. It&apos;s awkward and sad. Singapore or Japan are highly known test-taking countries focused on science and engineering, yet are desperate to find innovation. And where are they looking? They&apos;re looking to the west for new ideas. It&apos;s kind of like a dog chasing after its tail a little bit \u2013 this weeding out of the idea that expression, something that exists in the intuition space, can matter. I mean, it&apos;s ironic that the people who talk about these kind of things [cuts to the arts] are all counting on things to carry their message \u2013 like images, the written word \u2013 as givens. Do you think that scientists tend to lack humanity? Scientists would say otherwise. But scientists strive to be pure, to live in what&apos;s called a &quot;concept space&quot;. And by doing so they tend to move away from the core humanist principles that actually put those two arms and legs on them in the first place. The best scientists that I&apos;ve met are those that are humanists and scientists at the same time."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/14/victoria-glendinning-biographies-publishers", "sentences": ["&quot;Getting an advance is very, very hard if you want to do something a bit different to what you&apos;ve done before,&quot; said Glendinning, who is shortly to set off on a self-financed trip to south-east Asia to research a major new work on the life of statesman and adventurer Sir Stamford Raffles, best known now as the founder of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-14T00:06:31Z", "title": "Biographers fear that publishers have lost their appetite for serious subjects", "tags": ["Biography", "Publishing", "UK news"], "article": "Victoria Glendinning, author of lives of Edith Sitwell and Anthony Trollope, is being forced to self-finance the research for her next work as a result of the shrinking market for serious biography. &quot;Getting an advance is very, very hard if you want to do something a bit different to what you&apos;ve done before,&quot; said Glendinning, who is shortly to set off on a self-financed trip to south-east Asia to research a major new work on the life of statesman and adventurer Sir Stamford Raffles, best known now as the founder of Singapore. &quot;I&apos;m not commissioned. But I&apos;m feeling quite confident somehow,&quot; she added. &quot;I will write 50 pages and try to sell it.&quot; Jeremy Lewis, author of studies of Graham Greene and Cyril Connolly, suspects that the publishing industry is undergoing a backlash after a long spate of huge advances for books that were always unlikely to make much money. &quot;Writing a biography is time-consuming and labour-intensive and is getting increasingly difficult, but it will be sad if the only people who can afford to write them are salaried dons,&quot; said the writer, who is embarking on a biography of David Astor, a former editor of the Observer, for Jonathan Cape. &quot;I have a fifth of the \u00a350,000 I got for my book on Connolly in 1992, but I&apos;m not complaining. The publisher in me disapproved of those absurd advances, anyway\u2026 publishers were behaving stupidly.&quot; Editors tried to push him towards a better-known figure, such as Arthur Conan Doyle, but in a piece for the Oldie magazine he argues there is no need for successive studies of the same few literary figures. &quot;Sixty years ago Jonathan Cape told Norman Lewis that he couldn&apos;t go wrong with a life of Captain Cook; his modern equivalents seem obsessed by Hitler, Churchill and Conan Doyle, but take a dim view of less familiar names,&quot; he writes. Glendinning came up against the same prejudice: &quot;This new book will be a biography of a fascinating man\u2026 in my opinion, this is the book of my life. I thought publishers would all be thrilled. But no. They want Victoria to do something exactly the same as before.&quot; She was asked, instead, if she would write about the Bront\u00eb sisters: &quot;I nearly fell off my chair. It is playing safe to a ridiculous level. The Bront\u00ebs have been so well written about. They don&apos;t need another book and I cannot go on that tragic trip with them again.&quot; Many would argue that the literary biography began with Elizabeth Gaskell&apos;s study of the life of her friend Charlotte Bront\u00eb, which appeared in 1857. But its heyday may have arrived in the late 1980s when Michael Holroyd, acclaimed biographer and husband of Dame Margaret Drabble, capped his success with Lytton Strachey with a four-volume study of George Bernard Shaw, earning him a reported advance of more than \u00a3600,000 from Random House. Large advances also went to Peter Ackroyd for his biography of Dickens and more recently to Adam Sisman, whom Weidenfeld paid around \u00a3100,000 to write his biography of Hugh Trevor-Roper. Andrew Kidd, the non-fiction publisher-turned-agent, suggests writers and publishers now have to work harder to breathe life into the genre: &quot;It may just need to be reinvented because readers are bored by the form. There were a number of projects that publishers paid a lot for upfront, on the back of what had been a wave of successes. Then they discovered the market had fallen away and took significant losses.&quot; The theory was the trend might correct itself in time, said Kidd, but he wonders if readers still engage with serious projects in book form: &quot;There has been a change in the reference culture and big serious books have not rebounded as one might have hoped.&quot; Glendinning believes writers now have to &quot;downgrade our expectations. I am quite old and I have raised my family and so it doesn&apos;t matter so much. But it is a bit worrying for others,&quot; she said. Editor Clara Farmer, who works on non-fiction titles at Chatto &amp; Windus, admits advances have shrunk, but believes publishers have become more discerning. &quot;In general, it has always been very rare for a writer to make a living, but biography is a longer road than others because of the research,&quot; she said. She has an exception to the rule though, in Chatto&apos;s upcoming biography by Hermione Lee about novelist and poet Penelope Fitzgerald. &quot;The right author on the right subject will work. The advances may not be as big as for celebrity biographies but people still want these books.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/nov/15/city-travel-blogs-london-paris", "sentences": ["Plus it&apos;s in English so there&apos;s no problem if your Spanish isn&apos;t up to much.whatsupbuenosaires.comelectricsquirrel Angry Angmo (Singapore) This is a blog about life in Singapore city written from the perspective of a German expat.", "It covers all the best places to eat, go out, etc, while also highlighting the chaotic cultural influences which make Singapore a unique melting pot.angryangmo.comNewlyNorthern"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-15T14:25:48Z", "title": "Readers' tips for city travel blogs", "tags": ["City breaks", "Paris holidays", "London holidays", "Buenos Aires holidays", "Rio de Janeiro holidays", "Singapore holidays", "Budapest holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "Bologna holidays", "Travel"], "article": "Winning tip: Invisible Paris This blog helps visitors understand Paris as it appears to residents, with fascinating insights into the parts of the city that don&apos;t make it into the traditional list of sights.

An Italian cabinet minister, Roberto Calderoli, called for the resignation of Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the Ferrari president. And even the team&apos;s principal, Stefano Domenicali, who has been criticised in the past for being too nice, admitted that heads could roll following poor decision-making in the final race of the season at the Yas Marina circuit. Fernando Alonso was the championship leader and favourite to win the title but poor tactics meant he finished a hugely disappointing seventh and lose out to Red Bull&apos;s Sebastian Vettel, who until that point had not led the table all season. Domenicali said yesterday: &quot;A mistake was made, which may yet result in changes within the Ferrari hierarchy and which may yet take a while to forget.&quot; The trouble for Ferrari is that wholesale changes have already been made as the team have struggled to match the success enjoyed when Michael Schumacher was their leading driver, winning five of his seven world championships for the Scuderia. The German left in 2006 but in recent years the team have lost Ross Brawn, one of the most brilliant engineers in Formula One, Jean Todt, their hard-line team principal, the leading designer Rory Byrne and the former head of aero John Iley. That may explain why the team suffered a catastrophic 2009, something their passionate fan base, the tifosi, will not tolerate, since this is by far the biggest team in Formula One and one that pays Alonso the biggest salary, an estimated \u00a330m. A crestfallen Domenicali said: &quot;What I feel inside is a lot of pain. When you arrive at our situation and see you can do it, only to miss out, then you feel very painful. For sure it was the worst race of the year for us, so that is why it hits you very strong in your head. &quot;But after a moment like this the only thing you can do is try to disconnect, breathe a lot and recharge the battery to push people to do a better job next year. &quot;We have all the elements to do it. We know we can count on a group of people who have grown, but who need to grow again.&quot; Domenicali did offer sympathy to Alonso, who went to Abu Dhabi at the head of the field, having won four of the previous eight races. The Spaniard had only to finish second to confirm his third world championship and, with Vettel winning, he could have come as low as fourth. But his team made a crucial mistake when they decided to bring him into the pits when in fourth position. Ferrari were too interested in shadowing Red Bull&apos;s tactics for the race and it cost them dear because Alonso hit heavy traffic when he rejoined the race and then found it impossible to get past the Renault second-string driver, Vitaly Petrov. Domenicali said: &quot;I have to say I feel sorry for Fernando. He had a fantastic year, always pushed the people to work and never gave up.&quot; The Ferrari looked the best car at the start of the season and when Alonso followed up some impressive performances in pre-season testing by winning the opening grand prix in Bahrain, he was the clear favourite for the title. But then Alonso and his car struggled. The car did not seem quick enough and Alonso made uncharacteristic mistakes in Monaco and China. Felipe Massa struggled even more before he was humiliated in Germany, when he was asked to move over for Alonso, an illegal manoeuvre but one that Ferrari got away with after an initial fine. After the British grand prix in July, when Alonso finished 14th, the Spaniard was 47 points off the lead. But then came a dazzling sequence. He won in Germany, was second in Hungary, won again in Italy and Singapore, was third in Japan, won in Korea and was third in Brazil. That meant he went to the final race eight points in front and, when he qualified third on the grid, he had the championship in his grasp. But he did not take the opportunity and the final, unedifying memory of him in this year&apos;s championship is of him shaking an angry fist at Petrov, who had frustrated him for so long in Abu Dhabi. A source close to Ferrari said last night: &quot;There will be changes at Ferrari for sure. What happened on Sunday was a big, heavy mistake. &quot;But they won&apos;t be changing the car, Alonso, the president or Domenicali. Instead there will be changes to the inefficient pit area. It may not even be a sacking. But next season some important people will no longer hold the positions they do today.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/15/sebastian-coe-olympics-funding", "sentences": ["Lord Coe, the chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, yesterday said that the package would produce up to 1,000 local sports facilities carrying a &quot;London 2012 Inspire&quot; mark, and deliver the legacy he had promised in a rousing speech in Singapore that helped win the Games in 2005.", "&quot;The legacy promise we made in Singapore was to transform a generation of young people through sport,&quot; said Tessa Jowell, the former Olympics minister who remains on the 2012 board."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-15T21:50:29Z", "title": "Sebastian Coe says \u00a3135m fund guarantees Olympics' legacy", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "UK news", "Lord Coe", "Public sector cuts", "Public services policy", "Public finance", "Society", "Tax and spending", "Sport", "Politics", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The government and Olympic organisers yesterday unveiled long awaited plans designed to address fears that the 2012 Games will not fulfil the promises made when they were won for London. A \u00a3135m scheme, called Places, People, Play, will be funded through a change to the Lottery that directs more money to the agency Sport England for it to train up to 40,000 volunteers, and invest \u00a350m in club facilities and \u00a310m in playing fields over the next five years. Lord Coe, the chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, yesterday said that the package would produce up to 1,000 local sports facilities carrying a &quot;London 2012 Inspire&quot; mark, and deliver the legacy he had promised in a rousing speech in Singapore that helped win the Games in 2005. He said that the scheme would also help meet a deficiency in the number of people able to harness the expected increase in interest and enthusiasm as a result of the 2012 Olympics. &quot;We have consistently, to our shame, undervalued the role of coaching and demeaned its definition. I&apos;m a product of world class coaching, so coaching infrastructure and people prepared to give their time and expertise is why I think this is a seismic shift in attitude,&quot; said Coe. But critics questioned whether it would compensate for likely reductions in spending by local authorities facing budget cuts. Sports minister Hugh Robertson said the scheme would form the &quot;cornerstone of grassroots legacy&quot; from the Olympics. But he appears likely to drop pledges by the previous government that the Olympics would inspire more sport or exercise. After London won the Games Labour vowed to get 1m people doing more sport by 2012, delivered through Sport England, and gave a broader pledge to have another 1m active in walking or gardening. But Sport England has made slow progress towards its targets, and Robertson yesterday refused to commit to retaining them, beyond saying the new plans were a co-ordinated response to criticisms he had often made in opposition. &quot;What we&apos;ll do is to get the policy in place. Then we&apos;ll work out an appropriate and ambitious way to measure it,&quot; said Robertson. &quot;London 2012 gives us a once-in-a-generation opportunity.&quot; Critics said the funding would not compensate for cuts elsewhere, including the decision by the Department for Education to end the ringfenced \u00a3162m annual budget for a network of school co-ordinators through the Youth Sports Trust. &quot;The legacy promise we made in Singapore was to transform a generation of young people through sport,&quot; said Tessa Jowell, the former Olympics minister who remains on the 2012 board. &quot;This additional money is welcome, but it goes nowhere near replacing funds the coalition have already taken away from sport, particularly sport in schools.&quot; Under the &quot;places&quot; banner, Sport England will invest \u00a310m a year for five years in funding local sports facilities. They will be encouraged to select improvements such as clubhouse roofs, prefabricated changing rooms and drainage systems from a central catalogue, in order to benefit from economies of scale. The quango, which will merge with elite sport body UK Sport after the Olympics, will also invest \u00a310m over that period in securing playing fields and a further \u00a330m in larger &quot;iconic&quot; regional facilities that can host two or more sports. Under the &quot;people&quot; heading, Sport England will work with the British Olympic Association and the British Paralympic Association to train and deploy 40,000 new &quot;sports leaders&quot; who will commit to at least 10 hours of volunteering. Under the &quot;play&quot; element, \u00a332m will be invested in a scheme called Sportivate to encourage 14- to 25-year-olds to try new sports and \u00a34m to support a new independent initiative called Gold Challenge that will allow members of the public to take part in Olympic events to raise money for charity."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/16/alan-shadrake-jailed-contempt-singapore", "sentences": ["A court in Singapore today sentenced the British author Alan Shadrake to six weeks in prison after he was earlier found guilty of contempt over claims in his book about city-state&apos;s application of the death penalty.", "Shadrake, 76, was also fined US$15,400 (\u00a39,600) over allegations he made in Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore&apos;s Justice in the Dock, which claimed that the state bowed to foreign influence and favoured the wealthy and well connected in deciding who should hang.", "The features a profile of Darshan Singh, the former chief executioner at Singapore&apos;s Changi prison, as well as interviews with human rights activists, former police officers and lawyers.", "According to Amnesty International, Singapore, a country of nearly 5 million, has the highest per capita rate of executions in the world, having put to death more than 420 people since 1991.", "In finding Shadrake guilty of contempt of court earlier this month, Singapore&apos;s high court judge, Quentin Loh, said the book contained &quot;half-truths and selective facts; sometimes outright falsehoods.&quot; Shadrake, who suffers from an irregular heartbeat and a serious colonic illness, offered a qualified apology last week, but stood by the claims made in his book.", "Loh dismissed Shadrake&apos;s last-minute apology as &quot;nothing more than a tactical ploy to in court to obtain a reduced sentence&quot; \u2013 the longest given for contempt of court in Singapore, according to reports.", "Shadrake&apos;s trial has reignited debate over Singapore&apos;s alleged use of contempt laws to stifle dissent and punish journalists deemed to have insulted the authorities.", "Shadrake was arrested on 18 July after attending an event to launch his book in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-16T05:29:50Z", "title": "British author jailed for contempt by Singapore court", "tags": ["Singapore", "UK news", "Capital punishment", "Books", "Law", "World news", "Contempt of court", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "A court in Singapore today sentenced the British author Alan Shadrake to six weeks in prison after he was earlier found guilty of contempt over claims in his book about city-state&apos;s application of the death penalty.

Prosecutors representing the attorney general&apos;s office had demanded a three-month jail term, claiming that Shadrake&apos;s book had cast doubt on the impartiality, integrity and independence of the judiciary. According to Amnesty International, Singapore, a country of nearly 5 million, has the highest per capita rate of executions in the world, having put to death more than 420 people since 1991. In a 2004 report, Amnesty said the death penalty was disproportionately used against migrant workers, drug addicts and poorer people.

The head of Langdon Park comprehensive school in Tower Hamlets, east London, is talking about the rising tide of protest at the government&apos;s decision to end the Labour administration&apos;s \u00a3162m annual funding for school sport in England. Michael Gove, the education secretary, has been accused of everything from ignorance to stupidity and betrayal over the change, which was part of the coalition&apos;s drastic cost-cutting measures in the recent comprehensive spending review. Critics warn that it will be ruinous for pupils&apos; involvement in physical activity, worsen the childhood obesity epidemic, and dishonour the ambitious pledges the UK made about combating children&apos;s increasingly sedentary lifestyles to help London win the right to stage the Olympic games in 2012. Dunne knows a thing or two about sport&apos;s importance at school. Langdon Park became a specialist sports college in 2005, just after 30 of its pupils joined London&apos;s galaxy of sporting and political stars, such as David Beckham, in Singapore when Lord Coe&apos;s bold pledges persuaded the International Olympic Committee to bring 2012 to London. Those pupils added visible authenticity. &quot;I really think it&apos;s a total contradiction for Michael Gove to be saying that he wants to encourage more competitive sport yet then disbanding the very vehicle that has led to much more competitive sport being played than before. It&apos;s absurd and illogical,&quot; says Dunne. &quot;Heads are scratching their heads in disbelief. There&apos;s been a huge proliferation in competitive sport in recent years that&apos;s been largely driven by the school sports partnerships [SSPs].&quot; The axe will fall on the \u00a3162m grant at the end of March. After that, schools will no longer be able to access that ring-fenced fund and instead will have to pay for efforts to improve the take-up and quality of the sporting activities they offer from their general budgets. The full effects are as yet unknown. But what is sure is that the 675 core staff who run England&apos;s 450 school sports partnerships \u2013 450 partnership development managers and 225 competition managers \u2013 will lose their jobs, as there will be no money to employ them. Beyond that, the \u00a3162m also funds 3,200 school sport co-ordinators, one for every secondary school, and 18,000 primary link teachers, one in each primary school, who between them coach, motivate and organise children, whose enthusiasm to participate can range from non-existent to intense. Their future is unclear. Their jobs are not at risk, as they are paid teachers. But, as the Youth Sport Trust (YST) points out, they are a dedicated resource, whose countless hours spent providing sporting opportunities to millions of young people will be lost because of the cut. In Oxford, for example, the sporting opportunities open to 19,000 state pupils are at risk because its \u00a3250,000 annual payment will disappear. &quot;We know we&apos;re in a tight fix in terms of money and something had to give, but it seems short-sighted in terms of children&apos;s futures&quot;, says Margaret Stevens, the local school sports partnership development manager. &quot;We&apos;ve already got an obesity problem in our schools and without people like the SSPs to keep raising the profile, it can only get worse. It&apos;s also hard to convince schools to support the [2012] Olympics when the funding enabling them to do that is no longer there.&quot; Carl Hamilton, her counterpart in the North Oxfordshire school sports partnerships, adds: &quot;The danger is that if this funding goes, the profile will no longer be there and a lot of schools, particularly primary schools that don&apos;t have specialist teachers, will put other things in place of sport. The reason the government put funds in initially was not for the sake of sport, but because there was so much evidence PE helped raise attendance, improve behaviour and self-esteem, developed leadership skills, tackled the obesity problem and got children off the streets, giving them something worthwhile to do.&quot; When that partnership began in 2004, some 25% of local pupils got two hours of school sport a week. Now it&apos;s 90%. On Merseyside, the fear is that 170,000 students will lose their sporting opportunities once the area&apos;s \u00a34m grant goes. In Worcester, one headteacher believes that the end of its school sports partnership will lead to the equivalent of a 50% cut in the amount of sport children can play. In the north-east, petitions are being organised and a Facebook group called Save School Sports Partnerships has been set up. &quot;This decision is a mistake,&quot; says Dr Gavin Sandercock, an expert in children and physical activity at Essex University. &quot;School sports co-ordinators and PE staff from sports colleges do an amazing job disseminating good practice and providing high-quality PE to primary schools, which may not have a full-time, qualified PE teacher. This gives the children in these schools a chance to be exposed to and experience many competitive and non-competitive activities.&quot; Now is not the time to axe SSPs, given that the amount of physical activity children do is falling, particularly in out-of-school time, because of parental fears for children&apos;s safety, increases in traffic and the disappearance of green play spaces, he adds. National Obesity Forum spokesman Tam Fry says: &quot;The SSP programme began to deliver the one hour of real term-time activity a day that every child needs. To consider scrapping it now is sheer lunacy. If axed, the coalition will have wasted the millions invested in sport over the last decade and reneged on the UK&apos;s Olympic bid commitment that sport would be a lasting legacy of the 2012 games.&quot; Some of Britain&apos;s best-known sporting names want Gove to reverse his decision. &quot;I regularly visit schools and see the most talented children now getting the support they need to develop their skills to be future champions&quot;, says ex-sprinter Darren Campbell, who won Olympic gold in the 4x100m relay in Athens in 2004. &quot;I see the positive impact sport is having, not just in PE, but across the school curriculum. To cut funding now when such incredible results are being achieved is beyond belief.&quot; Steve Grainger, the YST&apos;s chief executive, is similarly dismayed. &quot;Our school sport system is world-leading.

Widening the definition of sport to include climbing, yoga and cheerleading helped to widen participation. Back at Langdon Park school, Chris Dunne is deeply frustrated. The borough&apos;s \u00a3350,000 a year is set to go. &quot;This will mean a lot less sport, and especially competitive sport, for the children of this country,&quot; he says. &quot;It will especially hit children in deprived areas like this, where there aren&apos;t middle-class parents taking their kids around after school at weekends to tennis lessons and the like. In this borough, some of our staff drive pupils to cricket, hockey and golf clubs in other parts of London as part of their work, because there aren&apos;t any locally.

Born in Essex, he spent a lengthy period in the 1960s as a Fleet Street correspondent in West Berlin. In the 1970s, he turned to writing books, having initial sales success with an authorised biography of Bruce Lee. After moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, he quickly became a fixture at Ye Olde King&apos;s Head pub in Santa Monica.  From 1990 to 2003 he wrote the popular but contentious Shooting From The Lip column for the Santa Monica-based paper that serves the large British expat community in California, the British Weekly.  He later moved on to Las Vegas, where he enjoyed continuing success as a freelance writer for various publications across the world.

By listing only three titles, they are sending a signal that there wasn&apos;t a fourth of sufficient stature to be shortlisted. Why should this be? In last Sunday&apos;s Observer the biographer Victoria Glendinning complained that the squeeze on advances for literary biography meant she was having to finance her research for her next book herself. Gone are the days when Michael Holroyd could command a high six-figure advance for a four-volume study of George Bernard Shaw. The Shaw biography was, in truth, never likely to repay its advance. But neither is a series of novels by a high-end literary novelist and advances for fiction have also been slashed, yet with little effect on the ambition of the literary novel. The difference is novels can be written in a garret while a good biography may involve years of research in far-flung places. Glendinning&apos;s so far uncommissioned biography of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles requires visits to Singapore, the city state he founded. As the fortunes of biography ebb, some historical biographers have fled into fiction. Philippa Gregory and Alison Weir are just two who have made very lucrative defections in recent years. But another outcome seems more relevant to the Costa judges&apos; decision: with nobody prepared to underwrite it, biography as a form has been thrown into crisis. Over 11 years of the Guardian first book prize, I have seen more and more biographies of &quot;safe&quot; subjects, often put together from secondary sources. The adventure lies elsewhere. It is habitual to bemoan the rise of the celebrity biography, as if it is somehow to blame. But showbiz cuttings jobs have no more in common with literary biography than a literary novel has with a Mills &amp; Boon. The UK has a sentimental attachment to biography that is regarded with some amazement from the US and mainland Europe. Perhaps it is time for the Costa to broaden its remit to cover narrative non-fiction as a whole."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/nov/16/death-discrimination-singapore-shadrake", "sentences": ["Last week, when the high court of Singapore convicted the British author Alan Shadrake for contempt, he knew that he faced the possibility of imprisonment for the offence.", "Today that became a reality when the 75-year-old was sentenced to six weeks in jail and fined for &quot;scandalising the judiciary&quot; for remarks in his book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock.", "The book includes an interview with Darshan Singh, the former chief executioner at Singapore&apos;s Changi prison, who was said to have executed 1,000 prisoners over half a century.", "However, the central theme of the book is Shadrake&apos;s claim that Singapore&apos;s legal system does not accord equal treatment to those suspected of capital offences.", "In Singapore, as a result, he asserts that the question of who lives and who dies is an arbitrary lottery.", "With a population of 5 million, Singapore has one of the world&apos;s highest per capita execution rates.", "Such disturbing details are of general concern and provide a strong basis for self-criticism by the Singapore government and perhaps even a commission of inquiry."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-16T22:00:02Z", "title": "Death and discrimination in Singapore | Parvais Jabbar and Saul Lehrfreund", "tags": ["Alan Shadrake", "Law", "Singapore", "Books", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Last week, when the high court of Singapore convicted the British author Alan Shadrake for contempt, he knew that he faced the possibility of imprisonment for the offence. Today that became a reality when the 75-year-old was sentenced to six weeks in jail and fined for &quot;scandalising the judiciary&quot; for remarks in his book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock. The book includes an interview with Darshan Singh, the former chief executioner at Singapore&apos;s Changi prison, who was said to have executed 1,000 prisoners over half a century. However, the central theme of the book is Shadrake&apos;s claim that Singapore&apos;s legal system does not accord equal treatment to those suspected of capital offences. The death penalty is mandatory for a number of offences including murder and possession of drugs over a certain amount. In Singapore, as a result, he asserts that the question of who lives and who dies is an arbitrary lottery. He explains that this is because the manipulation and decision-making takes place at the time of investigation and prosecution. Those who are rich, powerful or likely to have the backing of a significant trade partner escape charges that carry the death penalty. Those who have no influence behind them are charged with capital crimes, convicted, sentenced to death and executed. If his analysis is correct, it makes a mockery of the claim that the law is applied equally to all and without discrimination. With a population of 5 million, Singapore has one of the world&apos;s highest per capita execution rates. While official figures are not produced, according to Amnesty International there have been at least 400 executions over the past two decades. Shadrake&apos;s case highlights two important issues. First, the power to punish a person for contempt on the ground of &quot;scandalising the court&quot; is in many parts of the world a rare offence. Legitimate criticism of judicial conduct is protected by the right to free expression and in turn strengthens public confidence. In Britain the judiciary has been subject to heavy and sometimes personalised criticism arising from miscarriage of justice cases. But it has never sought to invoke a criminal prosecution for &quot;scandalising the judiciary&quot;. The prospect of judges punishing someone in the matter of a book criticising the legal system creates a very dangerous precedent. The judiciary should not be judges in their own cause. To convict a man for writing a book of this nature, and furthermore to imprison him, fails to deal with the issues he has raised; and this is the second point. Shadrake seeks to place the application of the death penalty in context. He argues that politics, international trade and business determine who lives and who dies at the gallows; and that foreign nationals, whose cases may result in negative political and economic fallout, have succeeded in escaping execution. He highlights the execution of the migrant Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion \u2013 whose treatment brought relations between the two countries to such a crisis point that Shadrake says the next Filipino maid could not be executed \u2013 and the case of Julia Bohl, a German woman who escaped the death penalty although she had originally been arrested for possession of drugs that carried a capital charge. Shadrake claims that because of the likely repercussions, the authorities eventually charged her with a lesser offence to which she pleaded guilty and for which she was ultimately sentenced to five years in prison. The book has drawn important attention to serious issues that surely require further investigation. Such disturbing details are of general concern and provide a strong basis for self-criticism by the Singapore government and perhaps even a commission of inquiry. Instead Shadrake finds himself convicted of an attack on the judiciary. He has suffered because he chose to write a book that has brought to the fore the politics of the death penalty. Let us hope he has not suffered in vain."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/17/press-freedom-singapore-grip", "sentences": ["Singapore is proud of its place near the top of many international rankings.", "But there are two league tables which shame Singapore.", "The second is the rate at which Singapore executes convicted criminals: arguably higher, per capita, than any other country in the world.", "Singapore presents itself as a modern liberal democracy: it has a parliament, elections, courts, a constitutional right to free speech and the consumerist gloss of capitalism.", "His book Once a Jolly Hangman questioned the independence of Singapore&apos;s legal system, and its use of the death penalty.", "It is depressing that a country as successful as Singapore should feel the need for such restrictions on free speech.", "Singapore argues that, without them, the balance between the country&apos;s Chinese, Malay and Indian populations would be upset.", "Singapore is making itself a less significant place by refusing to give its people the sorts of freedoms that are routine elsewhere.", "His book has had far greater attention because of it, and Singapore&apos;s reputation has been harmed.", "The suspicion is that the Singapore government resented the exposure of a squalid system of routine executions which sits uneasily with the image it likes to present to the world.", "Singapore wants to be judged as a first-world nation."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-17T00:05:12Z", "title": "Press freedom: The Singapore grip | Editorial", "tags": ["Singapore", "Freedom of speech", "World news", "Press freedom", "Media", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Singapore is proud of its place near the top of many international rankings. Its school system is by some measures the world&apos;s best. The island state promotes itself as diverse, competitive and cultured \u2013 an exciting global hub. But there are two league tables which shame Singapore. The first, compiled by the campaigning group Reporters Without Borders, places the country 136th in the world for press freedom \u2013 below Iraq and Zimbabwe. The second is the rate at which Singapore executes convicted criminals: arguably higher, per capita, than any other country in the world. Singapore presents itself as a modern liberal democracy: it has a parliament, elections, courts, a constitutional right to free speech and the consumerist gloss of capitalism. Its citizens are free to become rich and to travel. Many do both. The country has by any measure succeeded since independence. But its autocratic political culture \u2013 overseen by the country&apos;s founding father and now official minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew \u2013 is highly and needlessly restrictive. The media is largely state-owned. Defamation and contempt laws threaten dissent. The latest victim of these is Alan Shadrake, a British-born writer sentenced yesterday to six weeks in prison and a large fine after being found guilty of contempt of court. His book Once a Jolly Hangman questioned the independence of Singapore&apos;s legal system, and its use of the death penalty. It is depressing that a country as successful as Singapore should feel the need for such restrictions on free speech. Singapore argues that, without them, the balance between the country&apos;s Chinese, Malay and Indian populations would be upset. But the reality is that other successful parts of Asia \u2013 Hong Kong and Taiwan, for instance \u2013 have thrived by extending free speech and the rule of law. Singapore is making itself a less significant place by refusing to give its people the sorts of freedoms that are routine elsewhere. On a practical level, the decision to prosecute Mr Shadrake was also foolish. His book has had far greater attention because of it, and Singapore&apos;s reputation has been harmed. Mr Shadrake is quite right to attack a criminal justice system whose victims are often poor migrant workers. His book was legitimate and \u2013 despite the court&apos;s claim to the contrary \u2013 largely accurate. The suspicion is that the Singapore government resented the exposure of a squalid system of routine executions which sits uneasily with the image it likes to present to the world. Singapore wants to be judged as a first-world nation. It must find the confidence to allow its citizens the freedoms that go with that status. Repression is not the route to success. In the end, it will prove its enemy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2010/nov/17/ask-tom-northern-lights-budget-flights", "sentences": ["Air Asia is the best known of the Asian budget carriers, but Jetstar Asia (the Singapore-based offshoot of Qantas-owned Jetstar), Tiger Airways and Bangkok Airways (both operating from Bangkok) offer useful connections around the region."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-17T10:29:24Z", "title": "Ask Tom - your travel dilemmas answered", "tags": ["Travel", "Flights", "Asia", "Northern lights holidays", "Sweden holidays", "San Francisco holidays", "Paris holidays"], "article": "I am embarking on a round the world(ish) trip on 4 January.

Furthermore, if I book it earlier will it be any cheaper or is time irrelevant to the price of a flight? Ashley-May Cashwell Air Asia is launching this route from 10 December, and is offering one-way fares for \u00a349 including taxes, operated by Thai Air Asia. At a rate of just over 2p a mile I wouldn&apos;t hesitate too much before booking this fare even if it is non-refundable. Air Asia is the best known of the Asian budget carriers, but Jetstar Asia (the Singapore-based offshoot of Qantas-owned Jetstar), Tiger Airways and Bangkok Airways (both operating from Bangkok) offer useful connections around the region. In India, budget carriers are increasingly reaching out to neighbouring countries, with the excellently-monickered SpiceJet flying from Delhi to Colombo and Kathmandu. Other options on the subcontinent for cheap flights include Air India Express, IndiGo and Deccan Airlines. I&apos;m thinking of making a northern lights trip for my birthday with a group of friends. It will need to be on a tightish budget, and I&apos;d prefer to avoid an organised tour. I also want to make sure that if it&apos;s not possible to see the lights, that the trip itself would be exciting anyway. I don&apos;t really have a preference as to which country to visit, but was mainly thinking Sweden or Iceland. I&apos;ve had a bit of a look round, but mostly found packages...Bex Singleton Aside from the excellent suggestions in this week&apos;s Guardian Insiders&apos; Guide to the northern lights I have two Swedish suggestions.\u00a0 The first and most economical option is to take advantage of SAS&apos;s new weekly direct three-hour flight (\u00a3175 return including taxes) from Heathrow to Lulea, in northern Sweden. The town is an excellent base for winter activities including husky sledding as well as being a lively base for exploring the surrounding area. Specific northern lights spotting trips aren&apos;t available, but simply by getting out and about you stand an excellent chance of seeing the lights. The Vandrarhem Kronan Hostel (vandrarhemmetkronan.se) set in woodland a couple of miles from the city centre has single rooms from \u00a322 and its darker location makes it a smart and good-value option. There are also hotels to aim for in the city centre. Unless you go for a week, however, you&apos;ll need to add in the best part of a day to fly back via Stockholm. Abisko Mountain Station (abisko.nu; singles from \u00a362; cheaper hostel accommodation also available) offers basic but comfortable beds in the national park of the same name. Abisko has a reputation for clearer skies than other northern regions. It is surrounded by mountains and has less cloud cover. This beautiful, remote setting is perfect for aurora spotting as well as Nordic skiing, ice climbing and snowshoeing, all of which you can arrange when you get there. The Aurora Sky Station (auroraskystation.se), a viewing station reached by a chairlift, can be visited nightly giving you the best possible chance of seeing the lights. It costs \u00a362 to go up for one evening or you can get access included in an accommodation package. Discounts on the above are available for YHA (Hostelling International) members (yha.org.uk). Visit Sweden (visitsweden.com) has more information on all of this. Taxi transfers can be arranged from Kiruna Airport for \u00a3140 per car \u2013 more reasonable if there are a few of you sharing, or there are train and bus options. Return flights from the UK to Kiruna go via Stockholm \u2013 charter flights are only available as part of a package \u2013 and start at \u00a3283.60 including taxes. If you have more time you could also look into taking the night train (sj.se), which runs directly from Stockholm to the station at Abisko with no need for transfers. This would also give the possibility of cutting down on flight costs by taking a cheaper flight. Me and my boyfriend are off to San Francisco for five days in early November for a wedding on the Friday and Saturday. We&apos;ve both been before so have done all the touristy stuff and would love recommendations on good bars, restaurants and boutiques to check out. We want to hang out with locals rather than tourists if at all possible.Claire\u00a0Barry     Green 'living' roof of the California Academy of Sciences. Photograph: Art on File/Corbis    Lonely Planet&apos;s American base is in Oakland, a short hop across the bay from San Francisco so I asked for a few suggestions from them. It&apos;s not hard to leave tourists behind in San Francisco \u2013 just steer clear of cable cars, Fisherman&apos;s Wharf and Alcatraz and big-name chain restaurants. If you haven&apos;t been for a couple of years you may have missed the reopening of the California Academy of Sciences (calacademy.org) a gorgeous museum with a full aquarium, a multi-storied rainforest \u2013 complete with wildlife - a state of the art planetarium, a living roof that is home to native plants and a cafe that only serves organic, local and sustainable food items. The new building was designed by Renzo Piano. It gets lots of families and school groups, but is adults only on Thursday nights. A great street to shop and eat is Hayes Street in between Franklin and Laguna Streets, west of the Tenderloin. Arlequin (arlequincafe.com) and Bar Jules (barjules.com) are recommended for eating and drinking. If you don&apos;t get round to a reservation, an early-evening mooch around should take you past somewhere you fancy. For dessert you can really go to town. SF is crazy for artisanal ice-cream right now with some marvellously odd flavours to try. Humphry Slocombe (humphryslocombe.com) located in the Mission is one place to head for, though you&apos;ll find other examples on your travels. Join the queue and pick up a few tips on flavours. For a late drink aim for Bourbon &amp; Branch (bourbonandbranch.com) on Jones Street close to Union Square. It&apos;s decor and speakeasy-style secrecy harks back to the Prohibition days and you need to call ahead for a password if you want to sit in the main bar area. I am going to Paris in the week before Christmas. Is there anything in particular you would recommend to get into the festive spirit?Eva Johnson There are traditional Christmas markets all over the city, from the huge one lining the Champs-Elys\u00e9es \u2013 itself festooned with an impressive lights display - to smaller ones at Place Saint-Sulpice and Place des Abbesses in Montmartre, and though these can feel a little cheesy they&apos;re pleasant places for a festive stroll. You should aim for the Hotel de Ville in the evening \u2013 the winter ice rink there is no secret but remains one of the most beautiful locations in the city with a lovely atmosphere. Skating is free if you have your own blades or it costs \u20ac5 to hire a pair. The window displays of stores throughout town are striking, but those of the huge department stores on Boulevard Haussmann are especially impressive. Smaller boutiques in the Marais and the streets between Place St Germain de-Pres and the Seine offer lower-key opportunities to pick up last-minute presents. \u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/17/england-2018-world-cup-bid", "sentences": ["The hope is that they can ape the job done by Tony Blair in Singapore in 2005, when 72 hours of intensive lobbying and an inspirational final presentation fronted by Lord Coe helped London overhaul favourites Paris to win the 2012 Olympics."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-17T21:01:43Z", "title": "World Cup 2018: England bid team call on Prince William but not Kate", "tags": ["World Cup 2018", "Fifa", "Prince William", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "article": "In the face of fierce competition, England&apos;s 2018 World Cup bid today insisted their lobbying team would be the strongest in Zurich in two weeks&apos; time.

England will be allowed to have five members of their team onstage during their presentation, with 30 more in the audience. Fabio Capello, Gary Lineker and the Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, are among those expected to travel. Amid increased confidence that their representations to voters have helped repair recent damage caused by Fifa corruption allegations, England believe the trio will help press their case home to undecided voters on the back of a strong technical report published today. &quot;Our strategy is to use them in key roles to lobby individual members of the Fifa Exco right up to the last possible moment,&quot; said Anson, who paid tribute to the contribution made by all three so far. He said Beckham had &quot;a strong relationship with a number of key guys&quot;, that Cameron had &quot;done an amazing job in the last month or two&quot; and Prince William had spent time with many of the executive committee members at the 2009 Champions League final in Rome and in South Africa.

Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, chief executive of Air France-KLM, said: &quot;I have no doubt whatsoever that Rolls-Royce will deal with this issue, and that the problem will be completely resolved within a few weeks or months.&quot; Joyce declined to confirm an Australian newspaper report that his airline&apos;s six A380s were likely to remain grounded until December or later. But he did confirm it wanted Airbus to replace some of its existing engines with new ones from aircraft still on the assembly line. The problem with the Trent 900 is thought to develop over time, so the new engines should not present safety issues and will give Rolls-Royce time to come up with a permanent solution. Airbus has orders for almost 200 A380s. Airbus said todayit would seek full compensation from Rolls-Royce for any costs incurred. Rolls warned last week that the problems would hit its profits this year. Shares in the world&apos;s second-largest maker of aircraft engines edged 4p higher to 603.5p. The A380 programme has already suffered a number of delays. Airbus was due to deliver more than a dozen Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft \u2013 mainly to Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa \u2013 by the end of next year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/19/the-ashes-2010", "sentences": ["(Thanks to karlinlondon for his Singapore airport tips too)  Not the Ashes: Windies and Sri Lanka draw 10.59am: The match in Galle has ended in a draw, with Chris Gayle unsurprisingly made man of the match:   It&apos;s good to be in the same class as the great players (who hit two Test triple centuries)."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-19T09:45:01Z", "title": "The Ashes 2010 countdown: 6 days to go | Steve Busfield", "tags": ["The Ashes", "Cricket", "Sport", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Ashes 2010-11"], "article": " The Sprinkler Dance 5.57pm: @VaughanCricket has just landed in Abu Dhabi and tweets: &quot;Sounds like I have missed out on something ??

Lord Selvey in Hobart 2.40pm:Lord Selvey&apos;s report from Hobart contains this splendid passage:  There is a comforting sturdiness about Bresnan, an admirable willingness to muck in. Beyond the artisan appearance, though, is a clever operator. Today he managed to make the ball wobble just enough to be awkward rather than disconcerting, and was canny enough to vary his pace by bowling within himself, so that he was able to go up a gear as well as down. There was use of the crease too and, particularly to Hughes, whose stock in trade is the flay square on the offside given the slightest width, an ability from round the wicket. Bresnan is no front-liner but in support he is as sturdy as any cathedral buttress.   Not the Ashes: County Championship update 2.33pm: Wisden Cricketer deputy editor Edward Craig tweets:   Looks like County Championship is going to get all asymmetrical - eight teams in first div and 10 in second - 14 matches in both leagues  Why, oh, why can&apos;t the ECB leave it alone. Two divisions of 9 works well, makes sense, is explainable to the uninitiated, and is symmetrical. Please leave the CC as it is!  Our Man trains with England     Our man.    1.45pm: Special report from David Hopps  Graeme Swann&apos;s Ashes video diary for the ECB website has been one of the talking points among the English media during the tour, never more so than this week when he features a media training day with the England players arranged by the sponsors, Brit Insurance.  We are all here to cover the Ashes but it would be dangerous to deny that we like hearing about ourselves once in a while.  Often such media days are followed by a hackneyed piece along the lines of &quot;How Our Man Took On England,&quot; normally accompanied by Our Man, with eyes firmly closed, ducking a 90mph bouncer. Fortunately I ducked out of that one. In my case, How Our Man just could not hold a catch fired from a bowling machine no matter how frustrated he got did not seem worth writing about. It still irks me several days later.  But a few comments are worthy of mention. The first is that this England squad, superbly managed by messrs Strauss and Flower, deserve respect for the way they went about the afternoon. There was a lot of laughter as media types of varying degrees of decrepitude were put through their paces (nothing is funnier for a cricketer occasionally slagged off by the media to see his adversary trying to skip) but the laughter was never superior, never demeaning.  It was a privilege to be fed balls off a catching mat by Kevin Pietersen, to be vaguely tutored in the art of short leg catching by Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, for Paul Collingwood to take a bat and offer slip catches and for Graham Gooch to fling down throwdowns. Note that it was the senior players who took on the central role on a day when it must have been tempting to make the juniors do the donkey work. Now try to imagine the England football team agreeing to do the same thing. That says something about the enlightened regime in charge of England cricket.  As Graham Gooch, the batting coach, put us through a simple routine designed to improve a batsman&apos;s foot movement \u2013 a routine involving nothing more complicated than a stopwatch four cones, two balls and a set of stumps \u2013 it was a reminder of the simple truth that so many of the ideas used by England can work successfully in all areas of the game.  As David Saker outlined simple bowling routines, it was blindingly obvious that every cricket club in the land should have a bullseye on a pole around the top of off stump.  So that is my attempt at payback. Not just to remark that English cricket has role models in which, by and large, they can take pride, but to remind every club in the land that with a modest financial outlay, a bit of imagination, and a coaching course or two, practice nights can be so much more fulfilling.

Overnight form 9.44am: While England were doing a thoroughly professional job in Hobart, the Australian test players were getting their final workout before the First Test, with Mike Hussey coming good at just the right time with a century in Melbourne. Meanwhile Shane Watson took a five-for in a thrilling, but low-scoring, match between NSW and Tasmania at Sydney. (Tasmania won by one wicket). Nathan Hauritz, however, bowled just one over in the match. It would be hard to judge his form - or lack of it - from that. But that lack of bowling may be to Hauritz&apos;s advantage, because, as he was being chronically underemployed, few Australian A players managed to apply any pressure to the senior squad. Phillip Hughes is the only one with any credit against his name, unbeaten on 58 overnight. The TV commentators on England&apos;s game spent most of the evening worrying that Ian Bell had scored TOO MANY runs. But below-the-line this morning, Palfreyman points out that 192 was actually 8 too few: &quot;the lad has a concentration issue - just when he was set and looking good for a big score, he fluffs it 8 runs short of his double.&quot; Collingwood too fell short of a major mark, out for 89. But Bresnan claimed the first three wickets, just in case he&apos;s needed, including bright new hope Usman Khawaja first ball.

Not the Ashes At teatime in Galle, Sri Lanka are 39 runs ahead with 6 wickets remaining, so it will require an almighty push from West Indies to claim victory. There was much debate below the line after Gayle scored his triple hundred about whether such a thing was ever useful to a team, as triples usually led to draws.

The Fifa ethics committee said yesterday that it could not find &quot;sufficient grounds&quot; of collusion between Spain-Portugal&apos;s 2018 bid and Qatar&apos;s 2022 bid, said to have secured a bloc of seven votes by trading influence. &quot;You cannot avoid collusion but if there should be something wrong in such collusion then naturally somebody should intervene,&quot; Blatter said after an emergency meeting of the executive committee to consider Fifa&apos;s decision to suspend two of its number and four other officials for between one and four years in the wake of bribery allegations. &quot;You find collusion in politics, in elections, when two parties are enemies during the year and then they run together,&quot; added Blatter, who has admitted it was a mistake to run both races in parallel. Blatter also insisted that England&apos;s chances of hosting the 2018 World Cup had not been damaged by a British newspaper investigation into corruption that led to the suspensions. England&apos;s bid team had feared that a backlash against the Sunday Times and an upcoming Panorama documentary, which led to the BBC being dubbed &quot;unpatriotic&quot; by the bid&apos;s chief executive, Andy Anson, would damage their chances . They wrote to all 22 voting delegates to distance themselves from the allegations. But Blatter said: &quot;Why should this have an influence on the English bid? I don&apos;t think they will take into consideration what has been published or not.&quot; Lord Coe, the London 2012 chairman and a 2018 board member who will join David Cameron, David Beckham and Prince William in Zurich for the final round of lobbying, told the Guardian that the path to victory would require &quot;cool heads&quot;. &quot;The next two weeks are very clear. It&apos;s about cool heads, clear messaging, cutting through all the noises off. It&apos;s about continuing to deliver and lobbying appropriately,&quot; said Coe, who played a pivotal role in Singapore in 2005 in securing the 2012 Olympic Games. Blatter also announced that two former Fifa employees also caught up in the Sunday Times scandal had been declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; by the executive committee. The former general secretary Michel Zen-Ruffinen, who was ousted by Blatter after he backed a rival camp during an acrimonious re-election campaign, and the former tournament director Michel Bacchini recommended to investigators that they should offer illegal incentives to secure World Cup votes. Blatter said the bans imposed on the Oceania representative Reynald Temarii, suspended for one year for breaking rules on confidentiality, and Nigeria&apos;s Amos Adamu, suspended for three years for breaking Fifa&apos;s anti-bribery code, gave the organisation a chance to &quot;clean up&quot;. But like the ethics committee&apos;s chairman, Claudio Sulser, he criticised the methods employed by the Sunday Times. Blatter said: &quot;No, I&apos;m not pleased about that because this is not very fair but now we have a result it gives us an opportunity to clean a little bit whatever has to be cleaned. &quot;But I cannot say that it is very fair when you open traps to entrap people. But if ... the objective is to have a clean sheet in football then I can understand it.&quot; The 22-month bidding race has been criticised for its lack of transparency and opaque rulebook. Asked if he thought the quality of the bids would be decisive, Blatter said: &quot;In principle, yes, otherwise it wouldn&apos;t be worth making a technical report if finally those who are going to vote are not using the information of such reports. &quot;But we are not only dealing with the World Cup institution, we are also dealing with human beings and they have ideas other than those which are available in the documents.&quot; Coe said it was important to focus on the fundamentals of England&apos;s pitch. &quot;The England 2018 bid is pre-eminently the best bid. It meets every criteria in terms of passionate fans, a sport understood the length and breadth of this country, a police force that helps deliver safe football every night of the week and a sponsorship market that is pre-emininent.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/nov/19/coe-london-olympics-marathon", "sentences": ["We want a track and field legacy, we made very clear commitments in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-19T17:42:43Z", "title": "Protests fail to sway Coe over change of London Olympic marathon route", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "UK news", "London", "International Olympic Committee", "Lord Coe", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Lord Coe, the chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog), will not back down over his decision to change the 2012 marathon route in the face of protests from London&apos;s East End and politicians.

Olympic organisers announced in September that the original route through the East End to the stadium was being changed to one passing well-known landmarks in central London because of the potential for traffic chaos and security issues. That provoked a furious response from local councillors and Tower Hamlets council recently said it would seek a judicial review of the decision. But Coe said that, having taken the decision for sound logistical reasons, he would not be revisiting it. &quot;I made the judgment for very good operational reasons that the reputational damage to this city, to the Olympic movement, to the sport of track and field, to the people of London for the next 50 years to come if we get this wrong, was not worth the risk,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s one of the toughest decisions I&apos;ve had to make but the reasons for those decisions have been communicated to the international federations and the IOC. They have been signed off and I won&apos;t be changing my mind.&quot; Denis Oswald, the leader of the IOC&apos;s co-ordination commission, said he &quot;understood the disappointment of people in the borough&quot; but agreed with Locog&apos;s reasons for changing the route to avoid road closures potentially disrupting other events. Locog today unveiled a scheme that has been agreed with the IOC to allow every competing athlete to buy two tickets for every event. Oswald refused to be drawn into the increasingly acrimonious debate over the future of the Olympic Stadium. &quot;This is not really a question for the IOC. It&apos;s up to the Legacy Company and UK Athletics to determine what is best for the country, for the athletes and for the city. There was a commitment to have an athletics legacy for the bid and for us it&apos;s important this is respected. But as far as I understand, whichever bid is selected this will be respected.&quot; West Ham United&apos;s joint bid with Newham council, which has the backing of UK Athletics, is going head to head with a joint bid between AEG, the US sports and entertainment giant that operates the O2, and Tottenham Hotspur. West Ham would keep the running track in a 55,000-seat stadium but AEG plans to scrap it and instead provide an &quot;athletics legacy&quot; elsewhere, perhaps by revamping Crystal Palace. It is believed that the Olympic Park Legacy Company, which said it would reach a settled position on a &quot;preferred bidder&quot; by the end of the year, may now leave its decision until the new year. Coe said: &quot;You know historically where I stand on this issue. We want a track and field legacy, we made very clear commitments in Singapore. But I will wait for that decision to be announced.&quot; The co-ordination commission, on its seventh visit to London to check on progress, visited venues including Wembley Arena, Earls Court, the Royal Artillery Barracks and the velodrome on the Olympic Park. &quot;We can see the pieces of the puzzle falling into place now and the big picture is rapidly becoming visible,&quot; Oswald said. &quot;Preparations are advancing at an astonishing rate and Locog, the ODA and their partners should be congratulated for the high quality of the work they are producing across this complex project.&quot; Coe said the \u00a37m &quot;wrap&quot; that was to surround the stadium \u2013 billed as a key design element but recently scrapped to save money \u2013 could be resurrected after commercial partners came forward with ideas to fund it. No advertising is allowed inside or outside the stadium under IOC rules but Coe said: &quot;Since the decision was made we have had a number of commercial overtures to fund the wrap. Watch this space.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/nov/20/working-life-examiner", "sentences": ["Overtime At parties people ask Karen whether she works for a living because of long school holidays: &apos;I just laugh.&apos; They also ask about the many places she has been to train teachers, which include Botswana, Indonesia, Namibia, Singapore and India."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-20T00:01:03Z", "title": "A working life: The examiner", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Teaching", "Education", "Guardian Careers"], "article": "As someone who marks papers, Karen Borrington sees her fair share of excuses, even if they are not in quite the same league as &quot;the dog ate my homework&quot;. One boy wrote on his exam paper: &quot;I&apos;m very sorry I haven&apos;t revised as hard as I should have, but I have been taking out my girlfriend.&quot; Another hapless examinee wrote: &quot;Dear examiner, I have tried really hard, please be kind to my paper.&quot; On top of her job as a teacher of economics and business studies at the Ecclesbourne school in Duffield, near Derby, Borrington works as a principal examiner of Cambridge IGCSEs, the internationally recognised alternative to GCSE for 14 to 16-year-olds. &quot;I wanted to do it to help me become a better teacher,&quot; she says. &quot;Having a good understanding of assessment helps me to be more effective in my teaching of all ability of students and helping students to achieve their potential.&quot; It also didn&apos;t hurt that becoming an examiner brought in a little of bit of extra money, she says. An added bonus is the travel. In the last 10 years, part of her job is to make flying visits far afield for intense training sessions for those teaching IGCSE courses. &quot;I was sent to Nairobi and part-way in the afternoon, there was a &apos;thump thump&apos; on the roof of the outbuilding,&quot; she says in her strong Derbyshire accent. &quot;The teachers all laughed and said not to worry. At three in the afternoon, a troop of baboons always goes across the roof.&quot; The atmosphere was more sombre when she travelled to Jakarta on another training session, just after the 9/11 attacks. Every time she arrived at her hotel in the Indonesian capital her taxi was stopped and searched. She has also trained teachers in Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Brunei and India. It sounds glamorous, particularly for someone who was born in Derby and has spent most her life in villages around there, including Heage where she lived opposite a windmill. The trips, however, are gruelling and there is little time for sightseeing. &quot;It&apos;s two or three days of intensive work,&quot; she says. &quot;You are pretty tired by the time you come back, but it&apos;s very interesting working with different people. You are actually meeting local people in a way that you don&apos;t when you are on holiday.&quot; When Borrington went to Chennai, India, she arrived late on a Thursday, rested on Friday and did teacher training on Saturday and Sunday. &quot;You could say I went to India for the weekend,&quot; she says. During these training sessions, she helps teachers understand what students need to do to earn high marks from questions. A technique she uses comes from Dragon&apos;s Den, the BBC TV programme where a panel of investors interviews entrepreneurs for possible investment opportunities. It&apos;s a way to convey to teachers that they need to solicit the analytical skills students must have to succeed in exams. Surprisingly for a teacher, and somebody who trains teachers, she does not like to &quot;perform&quot; in front of an audience. &quot;I am not an extrovert,&quot; she says. &quot;Standing in front of a class was something I had to learn how to do. It did not come naturally. You&apos;ll always find me at the back of the class, working away with groups.&quot; Borrington, who graduated with an economics degree from the University of Leicester, has been an examiner for more than 20 years, her curiosity piqued by an Ecclesbourne colleague who was doing the same thing. She is now one of about 9,000 Cambridge IGCSE examiners marking papers from all over the world. Marking takes place in June, July and November, when Borrington has to wade through hundreds of submissions. July gets particularly busy, when she has to mark as many as 400 to 500 scripts in three to four weeks. Some examiners blitz solidly through the weekend but Borrington likes to keep her Saturday evenings free, so gets up at 6am during the week. Still in her dressing gown, she&apos;ll make a cup of coffee and switch on her laptop. All marking is done online, eliminating the need for masses of papers on the kitchen table. It&apos;s a rural setting, so the view through the window is of flowers, trees, the odd squirrel, blue tits, sparrows, starlings and the neighbour&apos;s cat. After an hour she takes a break, showers, gets dressed and works for another hour before the house wakes up. It takes her about an hour to go through four or five scripts, although she will take longer over really good candidates as there is more to read. She then spends another two hours marking in the evening. &quot;In the middle of exam season, you need to be very well organised, you have to set yourself so many scripts to mark and meet the deadlines. And you have to be consistent, you can&apos;t get up one day and say &apos;I feel mean&apos;. You should be applying marks as set out in the guidelines.&quot; Borrington says she tries to mark &quot;positively&quot; and not look to &quot;knock marks off&quot;. When a paper initially gets a very low mark, she rereads it two or three times to see &quot;if there is anything I can give credit for&quot;. This approach, she says, reflects the changing nature of examinations in the past 20 years. Besides marking she also sets papers, an art in itself. The whole process takes over a year from start to finish. First, she drafts a paper and a mark scheme, then sends it for review and comments. It will come back for redrafting, after which an evaluation committee makes a final draft that will become the examination paper. &quot;We have to make sure the paper is as good as it can be and fair,&quot; she says. Devising papers, Borrington says, requires conscientiousness, creativity and care. &quot;You have to be very careful how you phrase questions,&quot; she says. &quot;The language must be clear and not ambiguous. You have to avoid words with multiple meanings.&quot; It helps that that she has an eye for detail. She says she is the kind of person who mentally keeps track of how much she has spent on her credit card and has never run up an overdraft. In the 1990s, she helped to run an air conditioning business and did the accounts, all background knowledge which serves her well when setting questions now. As her papers are designed for students all over the world \u2013 this year, Cambridge IGCSE papers were taken by students in more than 120 countries as well as at some 400 schools in the UK \u2013 the subjects and questions have to be &quot;culturally sensitive&quot;, so no mention of alcohol or Christmas trees, for example. Case studies, therefore, need to revolve around businesses relevant everywhere to any part of the world \u2013 restaurants, hotels or taxis. In past papers, she has constructed questions around a vegetable farm, a newspaper printing company, a furniture shop and a car repairer, to name but a few. &quot;You start with a business and you think of what problems it would have and then you look for questions on various aspects of that business such as HR, marketing, finance, where it&apos;s going to sell, the competition,&quot; she says. &quot;You try and keep it general.&quot; Papers typically have five questions split into two parts: the first tests a candidate&apos;s knowledge and application, while the second measures analytical and evaluative skills \u2013 where the bulk of the marks are scored. The candidate has one hour and 45 minutes for the test, which is marked out of 100. The highest she ever gave was 98 and the lowest a big fat zero \u2013 to a candidate &quot;who just copied chunks out of the case study&quot;, she recalls. &quot;They had written something for every answer but didn&apos;t say anything. It&apos;s very rare. Usually candidates do very well&quot;. And even though English is a second language for many of her candidates, she reckons that once the exams begin, they are not necessarily at a disadvantage to native English speakers. &quot;When you set papers, you want candidates to demonstrate what they can do,&quot; she says. &quot;You want them to think, &apos;Oh, I can have a go at that,&apos; when they look at the questions. You try to prepare papers that are inviting.&quot; Sometimes her inspiration comes from the least likely places. &quot;When we travel, I&apos;m always on the lookout for businesses to use for case studies,&quot; she says. &quot;When wandering through Bangkok airport I saw several flower shops selling flower arrangements, and this started me thinking about the ones you see in hotels and restaurants.&quot; And so comfortable is she with her work, it has become a form of relaxation, albeit not one that might instantly appeal to many. &quot;I think about case studies when sitting on a beach,&quot; she says. &quot;It is so peaceful; it gives me time to think and put together the outline of a question paper. Then I research and write it up when I get home.&quot; Curriculum vitae Pay &quot;You&apos;re paid per script so for an exam session, anything from \u00a3800 upwards, depending on the number of scripts and exams marked.&quot; Hours &quot;As I also teach full-time my days are fairly long during the examination session. An examiner will work on average three to four hours a day so I fit this round my school day by getting up about 6am and marking for one to two hours before going to school and then early evening to about 9pm. As a principal examiner, I also need to reply to emails and telephone calls from my team.&quot; Work/life balance I have to be very organised, so I still see friends and go riding. Life has to be fun. Best thing Having a question paper I set answered \u2013 I am happy it worked as intended. I also love training teachers in other countries. Worst thing Having to be extremely disciplined about marking a set number of hours each day. Overtime At parties people ask Karen whether she works for a living because of long school holidays: &apos;I just laugh.&apos; They also ask about the many places she has been to train teachers, which include Botswana, Indonesia, Namibia, Singapore and India. For lunch, Karen has jacket potato filled with anything from beans to chilli or cheese. For relaxation, Karen goes horse riding every week in Sherwood forest, aerobics twice a week, wine tasting and most important is spending time with her family \u2013 &apos;three beautiful daughters and a wonderful partner&apos;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/21/libel-reform-simon-singh", "sentences": ["Only authoritarian societies push beyond the limit and jail defendants for criticising public officials rather than revealing their secrets, as Singapore showed by threatening to jail the British author Alan Shadrake last week for lambasting its judges&apos; use of the death penalty."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-21T00:04:16Z", "title": "Now the libel law sharks are going for the little guy | Nick Cohen", "tags": ["Libel reform", "Law"], "article": "It is a sad truth about the British media that a story&apos;s chances of making the newspapers increase in proportion to an editor&apos;s ability to attach breasts to it. The tale of how the makers of Boob Job tried to undermine freedom of speech by threatening Dr Dalia Nield was no exception to the rule. I don&apos;t mean to mock. The press does not argue strongly enough for the freedom on which its business and our liberties depend and it was good to see journalists defend the doctor. The Mail had asked her opinion of Rodial&apos;s claim that its \u00a3125 jars of Boob Job would expand breasts by half a cup size if a woman rubbed the cream into her chest for 56 days on the trot. Dr Nield is one of Britain&apos;s foremost cosmetic surgeons. She gave every impression of not believing a word of Rodial&apos;s hype. She told the Mail that women needed a lot more data from Rodial and wondered whether the cream would do more harm than good. For this, Rodial sent her a letter threatening defamation proceedings. Quite rightly, reporters protested about yet another attempt by our wretched legal profession to silence informed debate on matters of public interest. Yet they missed the most sinister aspect of the affair. My colleagues at the Mail say that Boob Job has not sent threatening lawyers&apos; letters to them. The Mail published the original story, it has the money to pay damages, but Boob Job is leaving it alone. Instead, it threatened to sue Dr Nield personally. They wanted to compel her to retract or risk losing her home, her savings \u2013 everything she has earned. Rodial&apos;s behaviour fits a sinister pattern. When Simon Singh published his now famous attack on the &quot;bogus&quot; claims of back-pummelling chiropractic quacks, the British Chiropractic Association did not sue the Guardian, which ran the article. It, too, sued him personally and forced him to risk financial ruin and waste two years of his life in his ultimately successful battle against the purveyors of pseudo-science. The American health conglomerate NMT is suing Peter Wilmshurst, one of the best doctors in the NHS, for criticising a procedure it uses to close holes in the heart. BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today interviewed Wilmshurst last year and he expressed his determination to fight the lawyers who wanted to limit scientific debate. NMT issued another writ to punish his fresh impertinence. It was not directed at the BBC but at Professor Wilmshurst. For all the arguments about freedom of speech, there is surprising consensus around its basic principles. All democratic societies protect the official secrets of public officials and make it a criminal offence to reveal, say, troop movements in wartime. Only authoritarian societies push beyond the limit and jail defendants for criticising public officials rather than revealing their secrets, as Singapore showed by threatening to jail the British author Alan Shadrake last week for lambasting its judges&apos; use of the death penalty. All democracies have laws against incitement to commit a crime. As murder is a crime, they agree that the courts must punish those who would incite murder. However, democracies run the risk of turning authoritarian when they try to push incitement law to cover the new &quot;hate speech&quot; crimes. Incitement to racial hatred or incitement to religious hatred are contentious offences because it is not a crime to hate someone any more than it is a crime to envy them or lust after them. It may be a sin, but it is not a crime. Finally, all democracies have some kind of libel law to compensate citizens for unwarranted damage to their reputation. With a bit of luck and a lot of arm-twisting, Parliament will reform libel in Britain because the legal profession has pushed the law beyond the limits any liberal democracy should tolerate. If Rodial thinks it has suffered damage as a result of an unjustified attack on its spotless reputation, why isn&apos;t it suing the Mail, which has the money to make amends? Come to that, why didn&apos;t the chiropractors sue the Guardian or NMT sue the BBC? Lawyers are targeting individuals because they are no longer over-interested in seeking compensation for real wrongs but in tying up or scaring off those who supply newspapers, politicians and the editors of scientific journals with the critical opinions informed debate relies upon. It is not just Big Pharma and alternative health cranks who have discovered the virtues of what Americans call &quot;lawfare&quot;. Radical Islamists and Iraqi, Russian and Ukranian oligarchs have used the threat of crippling costs to shut down debate about their very interesting activities before it can properly begin. England is providing an ugly illustration of the power of money in the law. I doubt if Richard E Davis, chief executive officer of NMT, thinks about his writs from one month to the next as he sits in his office in Boston, Massachusetts. Professor Wilsmshurst has been worrying about them every waking hour for two years. Who can deny that fear works? Dalia Nield&apos;s lawyer is Robert Dougans, an excellent and dedicated solicitor. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll see off Rodial. But he tells me his client is stunned by what has happened and doesn&apos;t want to talk to the press. Even if Rodial drops its action, and it looks like it may, it will have shut up a sceptical voice we could do with hearing more from. America stood where we stood in 1964. The issue it faced then was not the power of wealth but the power of white supremacists. Martin Luther King was leading a campaign of civil disobedience to draw attention to racism in the deep south. When the New York Times and other liberal papers ran accounts of police racism, however, the cops sued in front of confederate judges and all-white juries in Alabama. They won, of course. Civil disobedience, like scientific inquiry, relies on the free flow of information to move public opinion and the libel law was shutting it down. In the case of the New York Times v Sullivan, the American Supreme Court said it was not prepared to see restrictions on free speech stop the advance of political freedom and tore up the laws it inherited from England. The power of money is like the power of white supremacy. It trumps all and ensures that the playing field is never level. Almost 50 years on, it is about time that Britain followed the American example and rewrote rules that were designed to keep us in ignorance."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/21/tristram-hunt-praises-serious-biographies", "sentences": ["Well, not any more it isn&apos;t.

Well, not any more it isn&apos;t. Last week, the Observer reported that leading biographer Victoria Glendinning was having trouble finding a publisher for her new life of East Indies explorer and Singapore founder, Sir Stamford Raffles. Then came the news that the Costa book awards couldn&apos;t fill its biography shortlist. Suddenly, Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form. This could be no more than a passing literary fad, but it also points to a broader truth about how we now approach the past: less concerned with learning from our forebears and more interested in feeling their pain. Today, we want empathy, not inspiration. From the earliest days of the Renaissance, the writing of history meant recounting the exemplary lives of great men. In 1337, Petrarch began work on his rambling treatise De Viris Illustribus \u2013 On Famous Men, highlighting the virtus (or virtue) of classical heroes. From the founder of Rome, Romulus, via Camillus and Marcellus to Cato and his hero, Scipio, Petrarch celebrated their greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top. This was the biographical tradition which Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli turned on its head. In The Prince, he championed cunning, ruthlessness, and audacity, rather than virtue, magnanimity and justice, as the skills of successful leaders. Over time, the attributes of greatness shifted. The Romantics commemorated the leading painters and authors of their day, stressing the uniqueness of the artist&apos;s personal experience rather than public glory. By contrast, the Victorian author Samuel Smiles wrote Self-Help as a catalogue of the worthy lives of engineers, industrialists and explorers. &quot;The valuable examples which they furnish of the power of self-help, of patient purpose, resolute working, and steadfast integrity, issuing in the formation of truly noble and manly character, exhibit,&quot; wrote Smiles, &quot;what it is in the power of each to accomplish for himself.&quot; His biographies of James Watt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his arduous life. This was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle, who focused his biographies on the truly heroic lives of Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte. These epochal figures represented lives hard to imitate, but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere mortals. The primacy of biography underscored not just Carlyle&apos;s writing, but his major role in founding the National Portrait Gallery. Portraits of statesmen and generals were taken out of private collections and offered as inspiration to the public at large. Not everyone was convinced by such bombast. &quot;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles,&quot; wrote Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto. For them, history did nothing, it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles: &quot;It is man, real, living man who does all that.&quot; And history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle. As such, it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the social contexts and power relations in which each epoch stood. For: &quot;Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past.&quot; This was the tradition which revolutionised our appreciation of the past. In place of Thomas Carlyle, Britain nurtured Christopher Hill, EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. History from below stood alongside biographies of great men. Whole new realms of understanding \u2013 from gender to race to cultural studies \u2013 were opened up as scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost societies. And it transformed public history too: downstairs became just as fascinating as upstairs. This trend started with Merlin Waterson&apos;s restoration of the National Trust property, Erddig, which had stood for 250 years as the family seat of the Yorkes. Philip Yorke, the property&apos;s enlightened 18th-century owner, had taken an exceptional interest in the wellbeing of his servants, making detailed sociological studies of their lives. It gave the National Trust just the raw material it needed to return to Erddig a living sense of its domestic community, marketing it as &quot;the most evocative &apos;upstairs-downstairs&apos; house in Britain&quot;. The Erddig innovation caught on and no country house exhibition is now complete without some insight into the working day of the scullery maid. Points of access are offered into the daily grind of &quot;ordinary people&quot; as ever-more detailed genealogical records help to establish our predecessors&apos; drudging lives. This was the mindset which Kazuo Ishiguro caught so brilliantly in The Remains of the Day, while Julian Fellowes received a peerage last week for raking over the past in Gosford Park and Downton Abbey. Increasingly, the public spurned the lives of great men to trace their personal lineages through local archives, genealogy websites and Who Do You Think You Are? formats. As social class, organised religion and traditional labour markets decline, leaving people devoid of clear identity, history offers relief. In this season&apos;s TV hits of The High Street and Edwardian Farm, the people&apos;s past has been brought back to life. As historian J\u00fcrgen Kocka has put it: &quot;It seems fair to say that a generation ago many people studied history in order to learn from it\u2026 nowadays, many people deal with history in order to find out where they come from and who they are or with the aim of discovering and observing alternative ways of life.&quot; The quest for identity and empathy has taken over: explanation has become less desirable; understanding has assumed centre-stage. The only problem is that such a retreat into the warm, fuzzy embrace of the past can serve to undermine history as a discipline worthy of proper study. It is history as entertainment, without the capacity to teach about the past or shed light on the present. So perhaps it is no surprise historical biography is on the way out. In its place come ever more volumes of &quot;everyday&quot; letters, journals and diaries. We are no longer interested in the difficult questions of the past and what it poses for the present. Just when we could do with a cracking new biography of President Roosevelt and the progressive response to the Great Depression, or the life of Ramsay MacDonald and the perils of coalition, or the travails of Francis Younghusband and the quagmire of Afghanistan, the publishers are withdrawing. But those of us who do want to know about the pioneering days of globalisation, the early days of free trade and its contemporary relevance today await Glendinning&apos;s biography of Sir Stamford Raffles with enthusiasm."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/22/financial-sector-clearing-otc-market", "sentences": ["The offer by ICE, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was backed by the Singapore stock exchange and highlights how clearing has become a major new sector for mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the financial crisis.", "The Singaporeans are keen to expand in London and view ICE as a potential ally."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-22T00:04:00Z", "title": "UK clearing house LCH.Clearnet spurns \u00a3400m US bid", "tags": ["Financial sector", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Business", "Financial crisis", "Global recession", "Banking", "Stock markets", "AIG", "Insurance industry"], "article": "Europe&apos;s largest independent clearing house, London-based LCH.Clearnet, has rebuffed a \u00a3400m bid for the company from InterContinental Exchange (ICE). The offer by ICE, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was backed by the Singapore stock exchange and highlights how clearing has become a major new sector for mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the financial crisis. Regulators are drawing up rules that will force almost all derivatives transactions to go through registered exchanges and be processed by clearing houses. The moves are designed to boost transparency in the derivatives market and improve risk management for deals that have traditionally been done over-the-counter (OTC): in other words, in private via brokerages or &quot;bilaterally&quot; between individual institutions. Clearing houses act as central counterparties, ensuring that players get their money back if one participant involved in a deal goes bust. Clearers require clients to furnish collateral or &quot;margin&quot; to provide a financial cushion for the clearing house so that it can repay debts that turn sour. The opacity of the OTC market was blamed for the near-collapse of the US insurer AIG in 2008 and is a major reason for reforms being introduced on both sides of the Atlantic. LCH.Clearnet is controlled by more than 90 shareholders who are also its users \u2013 mostly banks and trading organisations such as the London Metals Exchange. The organisation is believed to have rejected ICE&apos;s bid on the grounds that it did not reflect the true value of the clearer. ICE&apos;s offer also ran into opposition from LCH.Clearnet&apos;s shareholders who feared a takeover could result in higher trading fees from fewer players in the market. &quot;A higher offer could have brought them round to the negotiating table,&quot; said one stakeholder. Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, refused to comment on &quot;bid speculation&quot; but admitted the upshot of initiatives to put trading in financial instruments such as credit default swaps through registered exchanges and clearing houses would be &quot;extreme&quot;. He said: &quot;Just look at the interest rate swap market, where trades today are worth a notional value of $350tn [\u00a3219tn] but only $115tn go through LCH, the rest are traded over-the-counter.&quot; Liddell said the expanding market will increase competition but bring fees down in the long term as consolidation follows &quot;proliferation&quot;. ICE serves global markets for agricultural, credit, currency, emissions and energy markets. It also operates three futures exchanges, including the London-based ICE Futures Europe, which hosts daily trading in half of the world&apos;s crude and refined oil futures contracts. Two years ago, ICE began to build its clearing house operation in London, but observers believe the Americans want to acquire LCH.Clearnet because building their business organically was too slow a process. The Singaporeans are keen to expand in London and view ICE as a potential ally. Paul Swann, of ICE Clear Europe, said: &quot;We are likely to see more asset classes go through clearing houses following initiatives announced at the G20 meeting in London last year and the passing of new laws in Washington.&quot; Analysts say LCH is under pressure as the London Stock Exchange has indicated it plans to set up its own clearing house for cash equities, making it more important than ever that LCH expands into areas that were previously dominated by over-the-counter businesses."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/22/the-ashes-2010-australia-kookaburra-free-beer", "sentences": ["Email from Singapore:  I am safely here and settled into my first hostel, Sleepy Sam&apos;s.

Ashes guides 2.24pm: New Holland Publishers have been in touch to plug their Ashes 2010 Guide, taken from the book &quot;A Fan&apos;s Guide to World Cricket.&quot; Also, here&apos;s the Guardian&apos;s interactive guide to the venues for the Ashes tour matches.  Jimmy Anderson and his baby plans 1.23pm: Opening bowler James Anderson will leave the Ashes after the second test to fly to England for the birth of his second child, reports the Mirror. The plan is that he will fly home immediately after the Adelaide test, on December 7, miss a warm-up match against Victoria, and return to Australia in time for the third test in Perth. James and his wife Daniella already have a daughter, Lola Rose.  Andy Flower avoids predictions 1.01pm: Mike Selvey reports on the mood in the England camp and the weather in Brisbane.     Flower: No predictions Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA    England coach Andy Flower says:   I think everyone should keep their feet firmly on the floor in that regard because we know the challenge that is ahead of us. In the last 20 years Australia have won 16 and drawn 4 at The Gabba, for instance. That is the sort of history we are looking to overturn. Those simple figures show what a powerful unit they are in their own country. There is no getting away from that. Our guys are excited by that challenge but I don&apos;t like getting drawn into predictions or who is favourite or underdog. Ask any of those players who are out there in the middle and those sort of thoughts mean nothing at all. We know we have a big challenge on our hands.   Why Hauritz was dropped 12.42pm: Peter Roebuck in the Sydney Morning Herald argues: &quot;Good but not great: dropping Hauritz is an indication of Australia&apos;s new outlook.  No longer is it enough to manage a slow decline from the heights attained in recent decades. Australia has inexorably slipped from first to fifth in the rankings. It is not enough. Excellence is expected, and it is better to suffer defeats in its pursuit than to retain a stable position. That is the meaning of the move. It&apos;s not entirely about the contenders. It&apos;s about a state of mind. Hauritz has not been dropped because he has done anything wrong, or let the side down. He has been ditched because he is serviceable, not special. The selectors have decided that is no longer enough. He might be the best spinner around but he cannot fly.   Ashes preparations 12.24pm: Australia spent the day in the nets today. England took a day off. @Swannyg66 tweeted:   A day off today. Out of bed at 1, room service for lunch and then eastbound and down series 2 on my iPad.

More Ponting on Doherty here.  Broad on The Sprinkler dance 10.44am: Stuart Broad&apos;s column in the Daily Mail today explains how The Sprinker dance came about:  It all started when there was a rain delay at Adelaide and we were sitting in the changing room listening to music. Everyone started doing silly dance moves like the &apos;lawnmower&apos; and &apos;reverse parking&apos;, just having a laugh. Then Jimmy pulled out this &apos;sprinkler&apos;. Swanny is doing a weekly video diary and he got everybody to do it at the press training session in Hobart. Now it seems it&apos;s going to be the dance of the Ashes! I&apos;ve had hundreds of messages about it on Twitter, apparently the Barmy Army are practising it and it&apos;s been on the TV at home and over here. If we start well and Australian wickets fall, there might be a few &apos;sprinklers&apos; floating about...             Here&apos;s a handy guide on how to do the sprinkler dance.  Not the Ashes 10.29am: India have declared on 566-8, with Dravid making 191 and Dhoni out for 98.  Weather in Brisbane 10.23am: There&apos;s a distinct possibility of rain in Queensland during the first test. Here are the weather forecasts for Brisbane for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Although it is categorised as likely to be &quot;a shower or two&quot;. (Hat-tip to Aussieinexcelsis for the weather site links).  Michael Clarke injury doubt 9.55am: Usman Khawaja has been called up as cover for Michael Clarke, who did not practice today as he recovers from chronic back trouble, reports David Hopps. Not the Ashes: England Women claim 20/20 series England women beat Sri Lanka by 17 runs in the second 20/20 international to claim the series 3-0, having already won the one-day series.  9.35am:  Nielsen v Fletcher, Warne v Flower, Australia v England Temperatures are rising ahead of the Ashes, and not just because the teams are gathering in Brisbane. Australia coach Tim Nielsen has reacted angrily to former England coach Duncan Fletcher&apos;s claim that this is the worst Australian team for 30 years. Nielsen responded:  You can quote me on this, we could not care less what Duncan Fletcher thinks about anything or anyone. His opinions on most things in Test cricket are irrelevant. To be honest, Duncan Fletcher would not know the first thing about playing Test cricket in Australia. Have a look at his record here. His record speaks for itself. He doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about, but that&apos;s no great surprise.  Meanwhile former Australian star Shane Warne has been doing his own stirring, accusing England of making Kevin Pietersen feel like &quot;an outcast&quot;. He told the Brisbane Courier Mail:  KP&apos;s lean trot has a lot to do with the way he has been treated by England. He was forced out as captain and sacked from the one-day side earlier this year. The way they have treated him is ordinary and he has been made to feel as if he is a bit of an outcast. KP might be the walking ego and can rub people up the wrong way. He does have an attitude. But he has to be made to feel important and like he is the man.

It was Beatles week on the X-Factor and, for the England 2018 chief executive, Andy Anson, next Thursday&apos;s vote in Zurich will represent the end of a long and winding road. Just as scrutiny of England&apos;s bid to host the 2018 World Cup began in earnest with all eyes on Jack Warner, the often controversial Concacaf president, so it will end. It was Warner&apos;s intervention more than a year ago that presaged a fervent bout of soul-searching over the composition of England&apos;s bid board and ultimately prompted a wholesale reorganisation. The three votes believed to be controlled by Warner \u2013 his own plus those of the larger than life American Chuck Blazer and the Guatemalan Rafael Salguero \u2013 will be crucial if England are to negotiate a passage through the first round of voting with enough momentum to make them potential winners. Hence Warner&apos;s lunch invitation from David Cameron, who has thrown himself with gusto into the final few weeks of lobbying with half an eye on proving himself the heir to Tony Blair in more ways than one and repeating the former prime minister&apos;s late push that helped secure the 2012 Olympics. Hence, too, the continued nervousness about next Monday&apos;s Panorama. England&apos;s bid team feel they have done all they can to distance themselves, including writing to all 22 executive committee members, but are acutely aware it could undermine their final push. Warner yesterday spoke out on the topic for the first time, claiming he was &quot;sure it&apos;s a personal vendetta&quot;. &quot;But it is sooooooooooo stupid \u2026 for it can have no effect on me personally or on anyone else in Fifa for that matter and, in my personal opinion, it is deliberately designed to negatively impact on England&apos;s chances,&quot; he wrote in an email. &quot;It is just a rehash of the same old bullshit so I continue to sleep very soundly at nights.&quot; Deconstructing the problems with the process \u2013 the parallel races for 2018 and 2022 that virtually guarantee collusion, the small electorate with power but little accountablity, the secret nature of the ballot, the way in which bidders are encouraged to criss-cross the globe making promises \u2013 is a debate for another day. The bidders have to deal with the world as it is, and that means a frantic last bout of lobbying if they are to come from behind and triumph. They remain convinced there are still votes up for grabs. Through all the internal ructions that dogged the first 18 months of the campaign, England&apos;s team have always known that it would come down to this. The outcome remains impossible to call between their bid and those of Spain/Portgual and Russia because the margins are so fine. There also remains the possibility that one of the three could crash out in the first round at the expense of Holland/Belgium. For England to remain in contention, they need to carry the three Concacaf votes to reach their target of the seven required to definitely progress. Danny Jordaan, the man who worked for 16 years to bring the World Cup to South Africa, warned last year that the three votes (four before Amos Adamu&apos;s suspension) from Africa would also be crucial. England have lobbied hard to secure them, but Russia appears in pole position. Likewise Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam. While the Premier League has forged close links with Bin Hammam and the AFC in recent years, Bin Hammam appears to have hitched his wagons to Spain/Portugal&apos;s bid because it offers the best chance of getting Qatar over the line in 2022. But Asia will not vote as a bloc. Japan&apos;s Junji Ogura is expected to back England, while the Thai Worawi Makudi is thought to be in the Spain/Portugal camp and the intentions of South Korea&apos;s Chung Mong-joon remain unclear. England&apos;s bid team believe they retain a good chance of securing the majority they require. Russia&apos;s support base may have been weakened by Spanish alliance with Qatar and Sepp Blatter&apos;s rearguard action against Spain and Qatar could lead to a reluctance from those outside the bloc of seven to join them in later rounds. Speculation of this sortabout the voting will intensify as the bidders read the runes and construct their lobbying strategies for the final week, when some of the biggest names in politics and football will take up residence in the lakeside hotel favoured by executive committee members for one final frantic push. The twists and turns of the past few weeks have been enough to destablise all involved. Two Fifa executive committee members have been suspended, provoking a state of near revolt among some of their colleagues and leaving all the bidders hurriedly recalibrating their strategies. And while Fifa&apos;s ethics committee ruled that there were not &quot;sufficient grounds&quot; to prove vote trading between Spain/Portugal&apos;s 2018 bid and Qatar&apos;s pitch for 2022 it is widely assumed that their interests are aligned to the extent that they can each rely on the support of seven executive committtee members. Turbulence has been the default setting for the England bid for most of the 22 months since a delegation landed in Zurich in January 2009 to submit the bid. The week before, the Guardian published an analysis headlined &quot;tensions threaten united front as England launches push for 2018&quot; and things continued in much the same vein for the next 18 months. Initially, there was disquiet at the lack of Premier League representation on the board, against the backdrop of an ongoing power struggle between the FA and the Premier League, and concern that it was stuffed full of political appointees. That eventually led to a wholesale reorganisation in an attempt to get the campaign back on track. Each new eruption chipped away at morale and diverted attention and resources, preventing the campaign message from evolving much beyond &quot;back the bid&quot;. The Premier League chairman, Sir Dave Richards, flounced out over a perceived slight while Lord Triesman, with whom he never saw eye to eye, resigned as bid chairman after a newspaper sting in May that still provokes debate over its morality. Each internal crisis was viewed with an air of amused inevitablity by England&apos;s rivals, who looked on as the bid threatened to self destruct, and credit is due for getting it back on track. There are those, including some on the bid board, who argue that Triesman&apos;s departure in May was no bad thing in removing a divisive influence who was unpopular with many at Fifa. There are others who argue with equal force he was forced to leave for no good reason, that he had built good relations with the Uefa president Platini and was beginning to win over other members of the global football family. Up until a month ago, England had been enjoying a good run on the back of a positive inspection visit in the summer and a successful visit to Downing Street by Blatter. But then came the Sunday Times investigation and the spectre of Panorama. Both played into long-held Fifa fears about the British media and the bid team went into damage limitation mode. In Fifa&apos;s alternate reality, Russia&apos;s crackdown on free speech is seen as preferable to the prospect of facing the British media for eight years. Anson and co have been buoyed by what they say has been positive feedback from an attempt to nullify the effects and are convinced they have a good chance of pulling off a comeback. Almost all of those close to the process insist it remains too close to call. With such a small electorate, and such fine margins at play, persuading a single voter to switch his second preference to England could prove crucial in the latter rounds of voting. Anson, sounding more upbeat of late, yesterday headed east to the Asian Footballer of the Year awards in Kuala Lumpur with board member Paul Elliott, his chairman, Geoff Thompson, and the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Meanwhile, the globetrotting international president, David Dein, was in Brazil at Soccerex in a final attempt to swing the votes of Fifa executive committee members. &quot;We are in it to win it,&quot; he said, before leaving for Paraguay. Through all its ups and downs the English bid has been played out in public. Spain and Portugal, in contrast, have barely had a public profile. Instead, they have largely relied on the prodigous networking skills of their executive committee member Angel Maria Villar Llona and go into the final week with a strong chance of victory. The fundamentals of England&apos;s bid remain strong, as emphasised by the technical reports published last week by Fifa. Passionate fans, impressive and already built stadiums, a promised record commercial return, a &quot;home from home&quot; for competing teams and the promise of a legacy for world football. The drive to ensure that the bid was not hobbled by the sense of arrogance and entitlement that tripped up the last attempt to secure the World Cup has been largely successful, even if it has sometimes led to a curious timidity. Paradoxically, England&apos;s strength is also its weakness. The Fifa president, and others on the executive committee are in thrall to the idea of making history and taking their biggest cash cow into new territories. For all England&apos;s hopes that the global recession would promote caution, Russia remains a beguiling option \u2013 particularly if the multi-billion pound investment is underwritten by the government and personally guaranteed by Vladimir Putin. The Spain/Portugal bid highlights another perceived blind spot for England. Not only does English football not have a Platini or a Franz Beckenbauer, it does not have a Villar Llona. The first chairman, Triesman, built good relations with Platini but others were scathing. And the second, England&apos;s representative on the Fifa executive committee, Geoff Thompson, has kept a characteristically low profile that his supporters say is quietly effective and his detractors say may as well be non-existent. If England fail to prevail, much soul searching will follow. The bid itself will come under scrunity, but so too will the Football Association and Fifa itself. Others will ask whether we should have been bidding in the first place. The core bid team is seen to have generally done a good job in the last six months, for all the problems of the previous eighteen. To win, they will have to replicate the late burst of momentum that saw London 2012 over the line in Singapore in 2005 and hope that the stardust of their delegation combined with a glitzy presentation expected to major heavily on Premier League stars will be enough to beat Russia&apos;s compelling legacy driven pitch and Spain/Portugal&apos;s superior political clout. The recurring questions that have repeatedly bubbled to the surface will return a thousandfold if the best efforts of Cameron, Prince William, David Beckham and co do not prove enough on 2 December."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/23/the-ashes-2010-australia-mitchell-johnson-tattoo", "sentences": ["Ma B&apos;s Ashes 11.16am: Mum&apos;s missive from Singapore:   Spiritual segment @ Cathedral of the Good Shepherd.Culture: guided tour of SAM (Singapore Art Museum) Long walk to Suntec Flyer.", "Fantastic views, excellent commentary and attractive, circular viewing guide.Raffles hotel and a Singapore Sling.", "($25+$2.50+tax ie nearly $30)Hostel is practically next door to the Sultan Mosque, largest in Singapore.I chatted to a young American Muslim chap on duty there."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-23T09:52:42Z", "title": "The Ashes 2010 countdown: 2 days to go | Steve Busfield", "tags": ["The Ashes", "Cricket", "Sport", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Ashes 2010-11"], "article": " Some people are trying not to think about the cricket 4.26pm: Graeme Swann and Matt Prior are trying to relax take their mind off the Ashes.       @Swannyg66 tweeted: &quot;Well it doesn&apos;t look like I&apos;ll be getting much sleep from here on in.

Jesse Hogan, in the SMH, writes:   Who fills the last fast-bowling slot will rest on what Australian selectors rate more highly: potential or preparation.

Pommie baiting 2.15pm: Richard Hinds of the SMH reacts to some Aussie-baiting. He quotes Matthew Norman in the Telegraph:   The peculiarly upsetting thing here is that winning at games - and I hope this doesn&apos;t sound condescending - is all Australia has. For a country without a shred of history or a soupcon of culture, and geographically distended (with apologies to New Zealand) from the developed world, sport is the only route to international relevance. Their economy may have nimbly sidestepped the global downturn, and even be booming, but sporting success is all they care about. And with excellent reason. Without it, Australia is nothing.  Hinds replies:   What those such as Newton (sic) fail to acknowledge - or perhaps fail to recognise in themselves - is that, as the British government pours millions into chest-thumping Olympic sports and Trafalgar Square is made ready for the now traditional Ashes celebration, our cultured English taunters have become every bit as addicted to the self-affirming fix that comes from a major international sporting triumph as Australians.

Batsmen watch footage of a bowler&apos;s approach projected on to a screen in front of the machine, before a ball shoots out from a hole in the screen where the bowler&apos;s normal release point would be. But with Pointing watching footage of young Victorian fast bowler James Pattinson running in yesterday, the screen suddenly went blank before a short-pitched ball spat out and viciously bounced up at an unprepared Ponting...

He broke a finger in a Twenty20 All Stars exhibition match at the Gabba. Peter Roebuck in the SMH opines:   Either Australian cricket has gone mad or I have. No one watching Tim Paine suffer a devastating injury in a silly self-indulgent, poorly timed and irrelevant costume drama at the Gabba on Sunday night could reach any other conclusion. The governing body of the game in this country has taken leave of its senses...Paine, a player held in high regard in all quarters, found himself facing Dirk Nannes in this supposedly light-hearted shindig (actually it was about as amusing as Chekhov in a grumpy mood). Nevermind it was damp and rain had been falling on the Test pitch, or Paine is Australia&apos;s next-in-line Test wicketkeeper and represented Australia A against England last week. Still, he was expected to risk body and bone in a footling contest. Later it emerged it was the season launch. If so it was a little late as Australia have already played three matches.    Ashes points and pointers 9.51am:  England wicketkeeper Matt Prior reveals, in an interview with Donald McRae, a very unusual occurrence on this tour:  I&apos;m still waiting for an Australian taxi driver to start sledging me. It just hasn&apos;t happened so far. Everyone&apos;s been very warm and respectful to us. It&apos;s something we&apos;ve really noticed because the respect we&apos;re getting in Australia has been surprising. Most of the comments have been about the very good cricket England are playing and what a good chance we have this time. Now I&apos;m saying it out loud I wonder if they&apos;re winding us up?  But the Australian team are trying to ratchet up the war of words: David Hopps reports that &quot;Mitchell Johnson to target Strauss and Pietersen&quot;. But, aside from the &quot;being aggressive&quot;-style quotes, the most interesting comments are by Andy Flower on Kevin Pietersen in response to some Shane Warne stirring:  He&apos;s anything but an outcast. He&apos;s a good guy to have in the dressing room, a great player to have on your side, a very dangerous player that the opposition worry about. We expect great things from him and that he takes part in team dynamics like everyone else. We do have very good team unity and that is one of our strengths. Kevin does like the big stage and that&apos;s one of the great things about him. He enjoys the chance to bat brilliantly while everyone&apos;s watching. It&apos;s part of what makes up a very fine competitor.   On the same subject, David Hopps also reports that &quot;Xavier Doherty refuses to poke at Pietersen&apos;s weak spot&quot;. Indeed, Doherty appears to be a very quiet and unassuming (and therefore unusual) sort of Australian cricketer. Andy Wilson assesses Jimmy Anderson&apos;s Ashes credentials, including this assessment from Stuart Law, who saw a lot of Anderson at Lancashire and a lot of the Gabba playing for Queensland:  If there&apos;s a ground in Australia that suits Jim and his skills, it&apos;s The Gabba. The pitch is fast and bouncy, and the ball will usually swing.  Tattooed man There&apos;s a rather striking image of Mitchell Johnson illustrating the Daily Mail&apos;s Ashes coverage today (written by Lawrence Booth, formerly of this parish), headlined: &quot;I&apos;ll make Strauss crumble, says Mitchell Johnson (the bloke with the pussycat tattoo).&quot; Not the Ashes New Zealand&apos;s battling tour of India came to an unfortunate end today: after two battling draws they were beaten by an innings. Tim Southee&apos;s 31 being the highest score in their second innings. Updates Further Ashes coverage may appear here later. You can keep up to date with those via  Twitter.

Schools will be set tough new targets, with secondary schools considered failing if less than 35% of their pupils achieve five good GCSEs, including English and maths. Failure to improve could lead to a change of management. There will also be a new national standard for primary schools, which will need to get 60% of their pupils to benchmark literacy levels by the age of 11. Michael Gove, the education secretary, will propose establishing a new chain of teaching schools, in the style of teaching hospitals, where new recruits can learn from the best teachers. &quot;I think the problem has been, over the last 13 years, teaching as a profession has had the initiative, the fun, the enjoyment squeezed out of it,&quot; Gove told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme. The minister will today give further details of a new &quot;English baccalaureate&quot; qualification to recognise the achievements of GCSE students who complete a broad course of studies. The &quot;English bac&quot; would not replace GCSEs, but would be a certificate to reward pupils who pass at least five of the exams, at grade C or above, including English, maths, one science, one foreign language and a humanities subject such as history. The national curriculum will focus on core areas of knowledge, allowing teachers more time in the school day for subjects like music. Gove told the BBC: &quot;We&apos;ve had a national curriculum, which was initially intended just to specify how to impart knowledge in the core subjects. &quot;Its grown to occupy all the space almost during the teaching day and at the same time our league tables which measure achievement have I think driven the sort of behaviour which has led to fewer and fewer students doing stretching subjects, and more of them doing subjects which count in the league tables but employers do not value.&quot; Gove will also outline plans to restore respect for teachers by confirming that heads will be given the power to punish pupils who misbehave on the way to or from school. Ministers believe that their reforms will change the balance of power in the classroom to put teachers back in charge. Teachers who are the subject of allegations by pupils will also win the right to anonymity until they are charged with an offence. The white paper to be published later today will cast teachers as the guardians of the country&apos;s intellectual heritage. Under coalition plans, pupils will be marked down in exams for poor spelling, punctuation or grammar. Gove argues that the classroom should be an &quot;open space&quot; for teachers to collaborate. Emulating the practice in Singapore, the government plans to encourage the filming of the best lessons, which will be put online to inspire other teachers. &quot;We will all be better off if we can watch a fantastic physics lesson online and other physics teachers can see how they can work more effectively,&quot; he said at the weekend. The government also plans to make more bursaries available to teachers to pursue masters degrees or other postgraduate qualifications to deepen knowledge of their subjects. &quot;I think it&apos;s important that teachers feel part of the intellectual fabric of the country.&quot; Gove describes teaching as a &quot;craft&quot;, which should be learned in the workplace. It requires both emotional intelligence and intellectual accomplishment, he argues. &quot;If you look at a surgeon, the craft of surgery is allied to a real intellectual knowledge of how the body works. Teaching should be up there with surgery, where you combine the intellectual skills and the talent to produce amazing results.&quot; The white paper is also expected to abolish the current GCSE structure of frequent &quot;bite-sized&quot; modules, to be replaced with a single exam at the end of two years. Ministers are concerned that breaking the courses into chunks means children spend more time revising rather than learning. The wideranging white paper will outline further plans to extend academy-style independence to more schools. Academies, which are independent of local authority control, were praised in an Ofsted report published yesterday. Out of 43 that were inspected in the past academic year, 11 were outstanding, Ofsted said. However, plans for all state schools in England to have their funding set directly by central government, bypassing local authorities, have been dropped."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/24/the-ashes-2010-brisbane-gabba-harmison", "sentences": ["Ma B&apos;s Ashes 12 hours to goMy Mum texts from Brisbane:  I had a lovely last morning in Singapore in the Botanical Gardens.", "And, courtesy of karlinlondon, here is Ma B&apos;s blog from yesterday reimagined:  Singapore training camp going wellMa B is attending the Singapore training camp ahead of the gruelling ashes schedule.", "Having spent several long sessions in the spa at the Skipton municipal pool, she felt well-prepared for Brisbane, but the humidity training in Singapore will also prove its value deep into the 3rd and 4th days of the Brisbane test.", "First, some altitude training on the Suntec Flyer where a rotund tour guide advises Ma B on where to cast her eyes across the glistening Singapore skyline (\u00a9)."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-24T09:54:15Z", "title": "The Ashes 2010 Countdown... | Steve Busfield", "tags": ["The Ashes", "Cricket", "Sport", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Ashes 2010-11"], "article": " 6 hours and 30 minutes to go That&apos;s all from me today.

Some words of warning from Australia 7 hours and 40 minutes to goPeter Roebuck in the SMH warns: &quot;Strauss must defy history for place in exclusive club.&quot; Roebuck asks:   Can Andrew Strauss succeed where so many England captains have failed? Can he bring a team to Australia, arrive without a great fast bowler, face the might of the home nation and go back with the spoils? Since the First World War, 25 England captains have toured this country and only six have gone home victorious. Amongst them only Percy Chapman was in the same position as the current leader. Better than anything else that sums up the size of the task.   Humouring the Aussies            8 hours and 40 minutes to goWhile we are still in pre-Ashes mode and Aussies such as Thom in Sydney are being all friendly, here is some video that bemusedfella requested be included in the blog: Adam Gilchrist&apos;s This Is Your Life (he says part 5 is particularly moving, part 1 is pretty funny).

This is the essence of cricket, the ashes... I&apos;ve got tickets for Day 2 and Day 3 in Sydney, just wanted to wish the best of luck in the Ashes to you and England and that the game is played in the spirit of cricket (just as long as the ball is whizzing around the neck of Strauss and Cook come tomorrow morning around 10:30) and that you lot can keep awake until dawn like us over here did in 09 and 05.             Well, Thom, I always thought that young Richard could become a future Yorkshire captain. But as his batting improved, his bowling stagnated. He moved to Northants and then Gloucestershire, where he still plies his trade.  Why the Ashes Urn will never be Australia&apos;s 9 hours and 10 minutes to goIn response to Ricky&apos;s request for The Real Urn to go to Australia (whenever Australia win them back, as it were), the MCC tells me:  The Ashes Urn has never been a trophy, and has never been presented to the winning team and remains at Lord&apos;s because it was a private gift to MCC. In the 1990s, recognising the two teams&apos; desire to compete for an actual trophy, MCC commissioned - after discussions with the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Cricket Australia - an urn-shaped Waterford Crystal trophy.

I&apos;m sure with technology these days there&apos;s something to ensure that it&apos;s safe on a journey across the world.  Two reasons why not: a) the MCC says they are too fragile to be transported backwards and forwards, and, anyway, b) You haven&apos;t won them back yet, Ricky. Thanks to StandfreeFM below the line, who also suggests a possible third reason: &quot;I was under the impression it was only at Lords for safekeeping, it being the property of the descendents of Florance Morphy, Ivo Bligh&apos;s widow.

Ma B&apos;s Ashes 12 hours to goMy Mum texts from Brisbane:  I had a lovely last morning in Singapore in the Botanical Gardens. The orchid garden was stunning. Made a mess of timing on the way to the airport and got there far too early. Used time on bus to what I thought might be an interesting little town. I have never seen so many blocks of flats. No street names, just numbers. Have now arrived at the Yellow Submarine Hostel in Brisbane. The toilets are labelled Torpedo Tubes.  And, courtesy of karlinlondon, here is Ma B&apos;s blog from yesterday reimagined:  Singapore training camp going wellMa B is attending the Singapore training camp ahead of the gruelling ashes schedule. As with all professional sportspeople, Ma B appreciates the need for acclimatisation to the conditions. Having spent several long sessions in the spa at the Skipton municipal pool, she felt well-prepared for Brisbane, but the humidity training in Singapore will also prove its value deep into the 3rd and 4th days of the Brisbane test. First, some altitude training on the Suntec Flyer where a rotund tour guide advises Ma B on where to cast her eyes across the glistening Singapore skyline (\u00a9). Ma B picked up a couple of postcards at the gift shop. It&apos;s not yet clear who the cards will be sent to but Ma B could be seen to write &apos;Dear Ricky, thanks for the legacy,&apos; on one, while enjoying a cup of tea (Darjeeling) at the Museum&apos;s cafe. Ma B&apos;s afternoon training session was interrupted by an American man however. While she effortlessly diffused the situation with reminiscences of a fine Bradford Lamb Saag, Ma B is disappointed that her new American fan was unable to fathom the plan to put two men back behind square for Punter. A well earned Sing Sling with a mysterious stranger is of course causing the paparazzi lenses to click into overdrive. Staff at Raffles say Ma B was seen to be deep in conversation with a mysterious stranger, discussing the likely swing of the Kookaburra. Troy Cooley&apos;s movements in the days leading up to the start of the Ashes series have only increased speculation that Ma B is trying to find some of the magic from 2005 to inspire England to victory.

Hoggy&apos;s peculiar perspective on that first ball in 2006 12 hours and 45 minutes to goMatthew Hoggard remembers that first ball of the 2006/7 Ashes in today&apos;s Express:  For all that has been written about it, I don&apos;t think that ball decided those Ashes \u2013 our cricket just wasn&apos;t good enough, with nobody standing up to be counted. Quite apart from anything else, I thought it was the perfect start! Fielding at fine leg, I shot my arms up in the air and gave a big cheer thinking we had taken a wicket. That was the only reason I could think the ball would end up at second slip. The crowd behind me thought it was out as well, even if they soon let me know I had been a premature with my celebration.

(via @ashes_updates)  Michael Clarke WILL play but NOT Bollinger 13 hours and 50 minutes to goVic Marks reports that Australian vice captain Michael Clarke has been passed fit. But left arm bowler Doug Bollinger will miss out, with Peter Siddle preferred.  14 hours and 10 minutes to go... After all the build up, the Ashes 2010/11 are now just hours away. There&apos;s a wealth of final statements to be made: Lord Mike Selvey reports: &quot;England can count on Australian resistance at Gabba: The opening Test will show if England are ready to exploit Australia&apos;s problems at their favourite fortress.&quot;  When the teams arrive at The Gabba, none of this, not England&apos;s controlled build-up or Australia&apos;s flapping, will count for a hill of beans. In Australia, there is no such thing as an uncompetitive Australian cricket team. At The Gabba, that charmless, characterless concrete bowl, with its dressing\u2011room bunkers, they have been nigh on invincible. And they know that since Len Hutton&apos;s 1954-55 England side lost by an innings but won three Tests thereafter, no visiting side has come unstuck at The Gabba and recovered to win the series. They play here at this time of year for climatic reasons rather than to exert early authority, but the fact remains that this is their fortress.  Duncan Fletcher says: &quot;History awaits England \u2013 but only if they are fearless.&quot; After the former England coach&apos;s controversial Guardian piece last week, Fletcher adds:  England have to be careful. When I wrote last week that this was the most muddled Australia side in 30 years I was comparing them to some of the best teams the country has ever had. This team are not that good, but will still be very competitive. And I think they will enjoy being slight underdogs. And whatever everyone else says they will not be worrying about losing another Ashes series. They will just be concentrating on winning this match.  Barney Ronay on the importance of the first day at Brisbane, including contributions from Mike Gatting and Justin Langer.  It may be an increasingly well-thumbed Ashes truism, but like all the best cliches it is also based in hard fact. The trajectory-setting significance of the first day \u2013 and even the first ball \u2013 of any Ashes series remains undimmed, with recent history suggesting overwhelmingly that a good start in Brisbane on Thursday is likely to lead to a good middle and a good end for whichever side takes the lead.             However, Andrew Strauss is keen to play down the importance of the first session, reports David Hopps. Hopps also talks to the Australian captain: &quot;Ricky Ponting fit to fight for his legacy.&quot;  Ponting says he&apos;s not ready to retire, and so he must win the Ashes, for to lose would surely mean demotion and that is rare in Australian cricket. On a more whimsical note, Frank Keating writes: &quot;How the warm glow of the old wireless stoked the Ashes fire.&quot; (Worth reading to the very end).

It&apos;s similar to LinkedIn, but that&apos;s just for white-collar contacts.&quot;  \u2022 How important is Ireland as a market to you? &quot;Ireland&apos;s a very small market. The majority of users are in the UK, then in the east coast of the US, and then in Singapore. There&apos;s no particular reason why, but when people join and create a skills page then they share it on their networks, which tends to encourage other people to do the same, and we think it has the potential to go viral.

Sure, 12.5% is low, but it&apos;s what the economy needs. Full [corporation tax rate] harmonisation would have an adverse effect, but if it rose to 15.5% for a few years then I don&apos;t think there would be any negative effect. &quot;We were talking to one of the people from Facebook over here the other day and they said the best thing about Ireland is that the people speak English. So that&apos;s why they want to be here.&quot; \u2022 Do you think economic contraction will see graduates move abroad? &quot;Look, California as a state has been up the swanee for the past decade \u2013 its economy is in a real mess.

I don&apos;t think the narrow economy here will have an effect on individuals who want to do things in software and technology. &quot;One thing that might have an effect would be if personal tax rates went up to punitive levels, such as 60% to 70%, which they were until a few years ago.

But 42 years later Time Out, once a radical, co-operative listings magazine, has a new shareholder \u2013 a venture capital firm that aims to revive its fortunes. Tony Elliott, who set up Time Out with \u00a370 borrowed from his aunt, yesterday sold a half share of the publication named after a Dave Brubeck record, which allowed him to clear a \u00a33m emergency loan he had pumped into the magazine earlier this year to keep the company&apos;s bankers at bay. Although neither Elliott nor his new business partner \u2013 Oakley Capital, owned by Peter Dubens \u2013 would say how much he had received, the deal clears \u00a310m of debts run up by Time Out and Elliott in supporting Time Out through the economic downturn of the last two years. Elliott said that the deal has &quot;made me a millionaire, but then I always knew that I was&quot;. However, it has also safeguarded his fortune \u2013 the 63-year old was forced to remortgage his house in St John&apos;s Wood against many friends&apos; advice in order to satisfy Lloyds bank. &quot;People were advising me not to do it, but I thought I had to,&quot; Elliott said. &quot;Today, I feel justified. My wife said that I had always been telling her that the right partner would come along. Finally she said: &apos;You&apos;ve been proven right.&apos;&quot; The debt-free Time Out now plans to expand internationally \u2013 the publisher has long wanted to produce online guides to cities such as Paris and Madrid, but had been unable to afford them. Although there are editions of Time Outs printed from Abu Dhabi to Zagreb, many are not owned by Elliott, instead being licensed to wealthy locals. While the share sale may have safeguarded Time Out&apos;s future, it is a far cry from a magazine that was run as a co-operative until 1981. Elliott studied French at Keele University, where he edited the student arts newspaper, Unit, and quickly showed a flair for publishing by securing interviews with Yoko Ono and Jimi Hendrix. He was supposed to go to France as part of his course, but instead stopped over in London, where he had spotted there was no events magazine. Working with Bob Harris, the radio DJ, he produced the first Time Out in August 1968, selling some of the copies on Chelsea&apos;s Kings Road. The first issue, an A5 black and white fold-out, cost one shilling and featured a Ronald Reagan B-movie season, complete with large headshot of the future president, plus a &quot;Marches&quot; section where readers had the chance to &quot;meet the fuzz&quot; at events such as a march from Canterbury to St Paul&apos;s, with the British Council for Peace in Vietnam. Gradually the publication was run along more commercial lines, although the decision to abandon the co-operative principle where everybody was paid equally \u2013 from cleaners to editor \u2013 prompted journalists to go on strike, producing first Not Time Out and then City Limits, which lasted until 1993. With its only rival defeated, Time Out&apos;s more recent problems have been financial. The magazine has been hit by the decade-long decline in advertising, and the gradual migration of its print readership to digital listings. Ten years ago sales of the London title were over 90,000. They are now just below 60,000. Three years ago Elliott decided to make all his listings information freely available online. The owner began a long search to find an outside investor that lasted &quot;five or seven years&quot; but refused to cede control, until the magazine&apos;s financial position deteriorated. Yesterday Elliott said that Time Out&apos;s annual turnover is \u00a317m \u2013 down markedly from the \u00a325.7m it reported in 2007. Recent cost cutting means that the company is still profitable, earning \u00a31.7m before the costs of borrowing. The veteran founder will remain chairman of the Time Out company, and while Dubens and his Oakley Capital will get 50% representation on the board, the existing management of the company will remain unchanged. &quot;I&apos;m 63 going on 43. I&apos;ve had a great lifestyle, now why would I want to change it? I may be at home now, but I&apos;m going to spend the afternoon looking at ideas for magazine covers,&quot; said a buoyant Elliot. Listing landmarks 1968 The first edition of the magazine published on 12 August by Tony Elliott, partially funded with a \u00a370 birthday gift from an aunt. 1980 Elliott abandons running Time Out as a co-operative. Rival City Limits is published from 1981 to 1993. 1995 The London magazine hits a record circulation of 110,496, achieved in the first half of the year. 2003 Time Out Group Ltd reports revenues of \u00a325m and a profit of \u00a3228,000. 2007 Time Out continues international expansion, launching four editions in Sydney, Singapore, Delhi and Lisbon. 2008 The Sunday Times Rich List values the company at more than \u00a340m. Its UK website attracts almost two million unique users a month. December 2009 London Time Out launches a free iPhone application with a live location-based events map. January 2010 Elliott puts \u00a33m of his own money into the magazine to reduce its bank debts. Its &quot;liabilities exceeded its total assets&quot; by \u00a310.7m on 31 December 2008.

He wants investors &quot;who understand that companies need sustainable sourcing and sustainable growth.&quot; The 54-year-old Dutchman&apos;s grand green ambition is for Unilever, the world&apos;s second biggest food and personal goods group, to halve the environmental impact of its products by 2020. It is a particularly spectacular ambition because it applies not just to Unilever&apos;s own factories and offices, but to the Anglo-Dutch company&apos;s suppliers and its consumers. So when Polman says he intends to cut 50% off Unilever&apos;s water use, he doesn&apos;t just mean in manufacturing processes - but in the amount of water consumers use when they wash their hair with Dove shampoo and their clothes with Persil. The company candidly admits it has no idea how that might be achieved at the moment, but its scientists and marketing brains are on it. The same applies to carbon emissions. Unilever chucks out 3m tonnes of carbon from its factories and offices every year. But across the supply chain \u2013 from the raw materials that go into its foods, detergents and ice creams to the packaging that ends up in the bin \u2013 the carbon impact of its products is 300m tonnes. The aim is to cut that by 40%. &quot;It is a big ambition,&quot; acknowledges Polman. &quot;It scares us. But it is no good if you are comfortable about it. It scared the Americans when John Kennedy said he wanted to put a man on the moon within 10 years, but they did it.&quot; As if that wasn&apos;t enough of a challenge, Polman has many other aims \u2013 from ensuring children&apos;s ice creams do not contain more than 110 calories, to sourcing all agricultural materials sustainably within five years and bringing half a million small businesses in developing countries into the company&apos;s supply chain. And just to make the task even trickier he is also committed to doubling the group&apos;s \u00a330bn annual revenue in the next decade. He is &quot;decoupling&quot; growth from environmental concerns, he says. Big believer Polman, tall and lean with an interesting Dutch-American accent, reckons there is no alternative because that is what consumers want and they are starting to &quot;vote with their wallets on responsible products&quot;. The internet, he says, has made consumers extremely powerful. &quot;Look at social networks. They are used to seek information and make decisions. There is a tremendous force there to reward you if you do well and punish you if you do not. &quot;Facebook, with 500 million users, is the third biggest nation in the world after China and India, and it can mobilise millions of people. We are just listening to consumers, staying close to give them what they are asking for.&quot; Consumers, he believes, will reward those businesses that listen. &quot;Companies that do this will get a competitive advantage. Those that don&apos;t will put themselves at risk.&quot; In the process, he says, global corporations can help repair their battered image: &quot;Trust in business is low. But this is a unique opportunity to step up to the plate again and change the reputation of business&quot;. Polman is a man in a hurry: he talks fast \u2013 very fast \u2013 and perches on the edge of his armchair as though he might sprint off at any moment. He races classic cars, likes to climb mountains and doesn&apos;t recognise weekends. But sometimes he takes a day or two off in the week, depending on his schedule. Brought up in a large Dutch-Catholic family, the son of a white-collar factory worker and a teacher, Paulus Gerardus Josephus Maria Polman toyed with the idea of becoming a priest and trained at a Carmelite seminary before switching to the university of Groningen to study economics. He then paid his own way through an MBA course at the university of Cincinnati and joined Procter &amp; Gamble in 1979. He spent more than a quarter of a century climbing the P&amp;G ladder in the US and Europe before quitting to start his own charity. In 2006 he was lured back to corporate life by Nestl\u00e9, as the Swiss food group&apos;s chief financial officer, and was headhunted to take over the top job at Unilever, which sells its products in 170 countries, two years ago. The business had had a tough few years, missing growth targets, and Polman has made big changes, putting more money into marketing, changing pay structures and personnel. The shares have climbed from \u00a315.80 to \u00a318.45. Polman&apos;s faith remains an important part of his life and his regular reading includes the Christian Science Monitor, which he values for its liberal sprinkling of &quot;good news&quot;. He is also a big believer in a healthy mind and a healthy body, so fitness is another passion. He starts his day at Unilever&apos;s swish London HQ in the gym and never travels without his running shoes. This month he completed his 12th marathon, in New York (4hrs 20m), and next week will be pounding round another course in Singapore. &quot;That&apos;s a tough one,&quot; he says. &quot;It will be 28 degrees and it can be very humid.&quot; His enthusiasm is almost palpable. &quot;In New York there were blind people running, men in wheelchairs, guys with amputated legs, the Chilean miner ... I get a kick out of all those people. They are the world. You discover there is a lot of goodness in the world. I would recommend it to everybody. There is more to life than just one thing&quot;. Polman runs to raise cash for the Kilimanjaro Blind Trust, a New York-based charity that he founded to help educate blind children in East Africa by providing and repairing braille machines. Brave initiative Polman&apos;s green plan has gone down well with the environmental lobby. Sir Jonathon Porritt, one-time director of Friends of the Earth, Green Party candidate and now a corporate sustainability adviser, is a fan: &quot;To be honest, I&apos;ve never seen a process quite like this,&quot; he wrote on the Guardian Sustainable Business website. &quot;The targets are seriously ambitious.&quot; He called it a &quot;vast undertaking&quot; and added: &quot;Is it the best plan out there for big global companies? I believe it is.&quot; Environmentalist John Elkington has some reservations, but still called it &quot;a brave initiative&quot;. There are many, including Elkington, who believe that simply modifying consumption is not the answer to environmental concerns and that consuming less is the only truly sustainable future. Polman, unsurprisingly, is not among them. Part of his vision to cut childhood diarrhoea is to encourage handwashing \u2013 and sell more Lifebuoy soap. He wants to provide clean drinking water to millions \u2013 by selling more of Unilever&apos;s Pureit water filters and to encourage oral hygiene by selling more toothpaste. &quot;There are billions of people in the world who deserve the better quality of life that products such as soap, shampoo and clean drinking water can provide&quot; he says. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t be ashamed of growth.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/26/switzerland-tax-breaks-referendum", "sentences": ["&quot;Basically their options are Singapore and eastern Europe.&quot; He said the initiative had coincided with a growing swell of resentment towards Switzerland&apos;s &quot;tax tourism&quot;, which &quot;the normal earners of this country reject and find loathsome&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-26T16:24:47Z", "title": "Super rich in Switzerland could lose tax breaks under 'socialist' proposals", "tags": ["Switzerland", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "Switzerland&apos;s renown as a tax oasis for the world&apos;s rich will come under threat this weekend with a proposal to impose minimal income levies on the ultra wealthy. Business leaders have warned that the plan by the centre-left Social Democrats (SP), which the Swiss will vote on in a referendum on Sunday, will prompt an exodus of rich residents and leave a gaping hole in the nation&apos;s economy. But SP argues it will merely bring Switzerland into line with other countries&apos; tax regimes and create more fairness within the country. Switzerland&apos;s cantons, or states, attempt to attract the rich by undercutting each other on tax rates. It has made parts of the country magnets for the super rich, including business people, royals and about 5,000 celebrities. They include the singer Tina Turner, supermodel Karolina Kurkova and more recently the new Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel, who, as well as very low tax rates, typically enjoy high-end lifestyles in lakeside villas with spectacular mountain views and guaranteed privacy. Under SP&apos;s &quot;tax initiative&quot;, incomes of 250,000 Swiss francs (\u00a3159,000) would incur minimum levies of 22% while assets of more than two million francs (\u00a31.27m) would be liable to 0.5%. If passed, the rule would apply to cantons across the country. At stake for cantons such as Schwyz, Zug and Obwalden are their special statuses as tax oases that cosset the rich like hardly any other nation. Residents of Zurich with an income of 350,000 francs pay around 110,000 of it to the taxman, while in Schwyz the rate is just half that. But public support for the plan, whose campaigners have tapped into anger over bankers&apos; bonuses and political management of the financial crisis, has dropped from 58% to 46% in recent weeks, with Swiss business representatives warning it could drive thousands of executives and their businesses out of the country. A leading voice of the opponents is Alfred Schindler, the billionaire owner of the Schindler lift and escalator company, who has argued his personal tax rate will rise to a prohibitive 70% to 80% based on his earnings last year of 7.4 million francs (\u00a34.7m) and his assets. &quot;Switzerland is becoming a socialist land,&quot; Schindler said. &quot;While it means a lot to me, my tax rate would rise to over 70%, which is nothing less than expropriation and is not tolerable&quot;. He has repeatedly threatened he will leave the country if the referendum is passed. &quot;I can be out of here before you know it,&quot; he told a newspaper. In reaction, SP&apos;s youth wing, Juso, sent the businessman a one-way ticket to Bulgaria, arguing that is the only other country in Europe where his taxes would be lower than at present. &quot;Let him emigrate,&quot; said David Roth, president of Juso in Lucerne, who disputes Schindler&apos;s claim that his tax rate would rise to 70 to 80%. &quot;He&apos;s deliberately miscalculated it,&quot; he said. Rudolf Strahm, a former federal price regulator and supporter of the initiative, said he doubted the rich would carry out their threats to leave as nowhere would be as comfortable for them as Switzerland. &quot;Where do these super rich think they&apos;re going to go? &quot; he said. &quot;Basically their options are Singapore and eastern Europe.&quot; He said the initiative had coincided with a growing swell of resentment towards Switzerland&apos;s &quot;tax tourism&quot;, which &quot;the normal earners of this country reject and find loathsome&quot;. Estate agents have also entered the fray, arguing that the move would have a chaotic effect on the country&apos;s property prices. &quot;It would mean a huge devaluation of house prices in communities where taxes are lower,&quot; said Donato Scognamiglio, the head IAZI, a property consultancy in Zurich . If the initiative is passed, Roger Federer, the tennis star and Swiss native who resides in the tax-friendly town of Wollerau in Schwyz, can expect the value of his luxury villa to fall by as much as 27%. Also on the ballot on Sunday is a referendum that would allow the easier expulsion of foreigners who have committed crimes ranging from murder to benefit fraud, once they have served prison terms. The initiative, put forward by the rightwing Swiss People&apos;s Party, has underlined a growing anti-immigrant sentiment in Switzerland."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/nov/26/brisbane-travelfoodanddrink-ashes-queensland", "sentences": ["Best bakries in Oz, around-oz.com \u2022\u00a0Qantas (qantas.com.au/uk) flies London Heathrow to Brisbane via Singapore from \u00a3892 including all taxes and surcharges."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-26T18:01:09Z", "title": "Ashes fans' guide: Beyond Brisbane", "tags": ["Brisbane holidays", "Food and drink", "Australia holidays", "Travel"], "article": "This time four years ago at the opening Ashes Test in Brisbane, I was tempted to follow the trajectory of Steve Harmison&apos;s ludicrously wayward first delivery \u2013 and just keep going, all the way out of The Gabba stadium. As I closed my eyes in disbelief, I pictured a stretch of beach a hundred miles up the Sunshine Coast of Queensland. When I opened them again, all I could see was four ocker Aussies in the seats in front of me spraying beer around in sarcastic celebration. It was only 10.01am and it was all over. I wanted out \u2013 but not because I don&apos;t like Brisbane. I do. I like the soupy warm embrace its subtropical climate extends to a wintery Pom. I like the unpretentious Queensland pubs, the villagey neighbourhoods, the Moreton Bay Bugs, and the pies. I like it all the more because it has laboured with the uncool underdog tag for so long in comparison with Sydney and Melbourne. &quot;Brisbane is so sleepy, so slatternly, so sprawlingly unlovely\u2026 It is simply the most ordinary place in the world,&quot; said author David Malouf in his semi-autobiographical novel Johnno. And he&apos;s one of their own. That said, I wouldn&apos;t go as far as the Sydney Morning Herald writer who in a recent report grudgingly staked Brisbane&apos;s claim to &quot;cool&quot;, referring to it as &quot;Brisvegas&quot;. Then he got a bit carried away: &quot;I go back there and it&apos;s like turning up at a wedding and realising that your boring ex has morphed into an intelligent, urbane supermodel.&quot; But I like it. Except when England play cricket there and are routinely beaten. The upside to that, of course, is that it gives you more time to explore other avenues. Streets Beach Not beyond Brisbane, I know, but it&apos;s such an exotic concept for a so-called &quot;provincial backwater&quot;, it might as well be. As you drift away from The Gabba(ttoir) and walk down Vulture Street (preferably rockin&apos; out to native band Powderfinger&apos;s eponymous album), you&apos;ll eventually come to the splendidly lush South Bank Parklands and\u2026 a beach. Well, almost. The aptly-named Streets Beach is a man-made urban oasis that banks the Brisbane River and stretches lazily out beneath the slick glass and steel skyscrapers of the Central Business District. Complete with palm trees, a lagoon, and the iconic Australian lifeguard tower, it&apos;s pretty convincing. But what I love about it \u2013 and why I tip my hat to the city&apos;s planning department \u2013 is that Australia is a country in which roughly eight out of 10 people live within 50km of the beach. Brisbane, in particular, is spoilt for choice for littoral lounging, sandwiched as it is between the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast, and with the world&apos;s third largest sand island, Moreton Island, just offshore. Despite this, they felt the need to build another one for good measure \u2013 more slackers&apos; paradise than Surfers Paradise. Noosa Heads     Photograph: alamy.com    For the real thing, drive up to Noosa Heads \u2013 a laid-back but exclusive little town only a couple of hours up the Sunshine Coast. It encapsulates everything that Australians hold dear: good, clean beach fun and a main drag that offers plenty of opportunity for casual but quality al fresco dining. Places like Berardos and Bistro C serve top drawer tucker, such as succulent Moreton Bay Bugs, Coffin Bay oysters with sweet chilli, and Hervey Bay scallops. They share Hastings Street with high end galleries and clothes shops with names such as Pearls for Girls, but also with that all-Aussie staple, the surf shop. Because this is where modern-day Noosa really began \u2013 out the back of a camper van. In his book The Noosa Heads Affair, Mike Davis describes how the town \u2013 sandwiched between the base of an old growth rainforest and the Pacific Ocean, and surrounded by rivers and lakes offering cool relief in the intensely hot Queensland summers \u2013 has changed from being a sacred and spiritual place since &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, to a logging station in the late 19th century, to a surfers&apos; paradise by the 1960s. Since the 60s \u2013 when there was only a single dirt road in with a caravan and camping site for the surfers at the end of it \u2013 it has become an upmarket version of the Australian dream. \u2022 You can rent holiday apartments on the Noosa beachfront from Au$1,260 (\u00a3778) a week at rwnoosaholidays.com.au Australia Zoo     Photograph: Dave Hunt/Corbis    The late Steve Irwin&apos;s zoo on the Sunshine Coast celebrates its 40th anniversary this year and was the winner of best tourist attraction at last year&apos;s Qantas Australian Tourism Awards.

Despite this, and despite them serving up their no-nonsense fillers for 130 years - using traditional ceramic ovens to cook them - there have been rumblings of late on internet forums and review sites that Yatala has gotten a bit fat and complacent on the back of its success (it sells around 1.5 million pies a year) and that its pies are getting a bit sloppy.

A Field Guide to the Reptiles of South-East Asia. 2010. New Holland. Hardbound: 376 pages. Price: GBP 35.00 (about $56.00 U.S.) [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: South-East Asia is one of the richest parts of the world in terms of reptiles. The first comprehensive guide to the reptiles of this region, A Field Guide to the Reptiles of South-East Asia covers all the reptiles recorded from mainland South-East Asia, from Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia to Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia, as well as the islands of the Great Sundas (including Sumatra, Java, Borneo and Bali). A detailed account with key identification characteristics, habitat and behaviour is included for each species, from crocodiles, tortoises and turtles, to lizards and snakes. Every recognized species is described, and 74 magnificent specially commissioned colour plates by top wildlife artists depict nearly 700 major species in meticulous detail. Where useful, details such as plastrons (for turtles and tortoises), juveniles, variants and head patterns are also shown on the plates.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: A very nice field guide, but it does lack range maps though!   Kennerley, Peter and David Pearson. Reed and Bush Warblers. 2010. Helm Identification Guides. Hardbound: 712 pages. Price: 65 GBP (about $105.00 U.S.) [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: This detailed and comprehensive identification guide follows in the mould of Sylvia Warblers and Pipits and Wagtails. It primarily covers the genera Acrocephalus, Locustella, Cettia and Bradypterus, together with a few smaller related genera. To the uninitiated, these are the archetypal &apos;little brown jobs&apos; and as if they weren&apos;t hard enough to identify anyway, many of them are hard to see as well! This authoritative handbook covers their identification in breathtaking detail, illustrated with line drawings, sonograms, wonderful colour plates and photographs. It is destined to become the ultimate reference for these challenging birds.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: Brian Small&apos;s artwork highlights this book! A must-have for all World twitchers and birders!   New and Recent Titles:   Chandler, David and Ian Llewellyn. Kingfisher. 2010. New Holland. Hardbound:128 pages. Price: GBP 12.99 (about $21 U.S.). [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: Usually encountered as a flash of blue or orange seen from the riverbank, most people are aware of the (Common) Kingfisher, but few are familiar with the intricacies of its day-to-day life.In this book, its remarkable existence is celebrated through a series of stunning chapters with images depicting courtship, nesting, fishing, winter survival and other important events in the lives of Kingfishers, which are further brought to life through the eloquent accompanying text which is enlivened by personal anecdotes from the author and photographer.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: The color photography highlights this book!   Ballance, Alison. Kakapo: Rescued From the Brink of Extinction. 2010. Craig Potton Publishing. Hardbound: 215 pages. Price: $49.99 NZ (about $38.13 U.S. plus shipping). [Craig Potton Publishing]. SUMMARY: The Kakapo is one of New Zealand&apos;s most charismatic yet mysterious birds. It is also one of the world&apos;s most threatened species and yet, it&apos;s a New Zealand conservation success story. Kakapo is a book that embraces science, conservation, ingenuity and personal dedication. Through an informative and entertaining mix of hard facts, history and accounts of the daily and seasonal routines of the kakapo and their minders, Alison Ballance brings together these threads to tell the inspiring story of this remarkably eccentric bird.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: For anyone interested in parrots, endangered species and the birds of New Zealand!   Donald, Paul F. et al. Facing Extinction: The World&apos;s Rarest Birds and the Race to Save Them. 2010. T &amp; A D Poyser. Hardbound: 312 pages. Price: 45.00 GBP (about $72.50 U.S.). [Amazon UK]. SUMMARY: Almost two hundred species of birds have become extinct in the past 400 years, and a similar number today are in imminent danger of following them. The world&apos;s conservationists are leading the fight to prevent the demise of these remaining critically endangered birds, with a fair degree of success. This new book examines the process and issues concerning extinction -- how and why it happens and what can be done about it. Whilst man is to blame for many of the causes, such as persecution and habitat loss, species have become extinct on a regular basis since life began. After several thought-provoking introductory chapters, the book showcases about 20 species on the brink of extinction from around the world and describes the work that is being undertaken to save them. Some are success stories, but a few are not. This is a subject close to the hearts of all birders and ornithologists and this book, written by a team of leading conservationists, will strike a chord in most of them.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: For those with an interest in bird conservation.   Colwell, Mark A. Shorebird Ecology, Conservation, and Management. 2010. University of California Press. Hardbound: 328 pages. Price: $60.00 U.S. [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: Shorebirds are model organisms for illustrating the principles of ecology and excellent subjects for research. Their mating systems are as diverse as any avian group, their migrations push the limits of endurance, and their foraging is easily studied in the open habitats of estuaries and freshwater wetlands. This comprehensive text explores the ecology, conservation, and management of these fascinating birds. Beginning chapters examine phylogenetic relationships between shorebirds and other birds, and cover shorebird morphology, anatomy, and physiology. A section on breeding biology looks in detail at their reproductive biology. Because shorebirds spend much of their time away from breeding areas, a substantial section on non-breeding biology covers migration, foraging ecology, and social behavior. The text also covers shorebird demography, population size, and management issues related to habitat, predators, and human disturbances. Throughout, it emphasizes applying scientific knowledge to the conservation of shorebird populations, many of which are unfortunately in decline.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: For those with a technical interest in shorebird biology.   Harrap, Simon and Nigel Redman. Where to Watch Birds in Britain (second edition). 2010. Helm. Paperback: 671 pages. Price: 19.99 GBP (about $32.00 U.S.). [Amazon UK: \u00a3 price; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: This guide covers the very best birding sites in Britain. In a format familiar to readers of this popular series, each site is considered in terms of &apos;Habitat&apos;, &apos;Access&apos; and &apos;Birds&apos;, allowing birders of all levels to plan successful birding trips anywhere in Britain, and to maximise the chances of getting the best out of each site and each region. The book includes detailed maps of the larger sites, plus general maps of the regions covered, and it is illustrated with attractive line drawings. This book has been extensively revised, with several new sites added for this edition, together with information on disabled access for most sites.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: A must have for those birding in Britain!   Davies, Alan and Ruth Miller. The Biggest Twitch: Around the World in 4,000 birds. 2010. Helm. Paperback: 301 pages. Price: 12.99 GBP (about $21.00 U.S.). [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: Most people dream of packing in their humdrum city life, selling up and heading off into the unknown for a life of adventure. For Ruth Miller and Alan Davies this dream became a reality, albeit with a twist; they decided to pack in their jobs, sell their house and take on the ultimate birder&apos;s challenge -- to smash the world record for the number of species seen in one calendar year. This book is the story of their great expedition, searching for birds from Ecuador to Ethiopia via Argentina, Australia and Arizona. We follow this birding odyssey as they rachet up the species and the stamps in their passports, sharing in amazing birding experiences such as monkey-hunting Harpy Eagles in the Brazilian rain forest, seedsnipes in the Peruvian highlands and lekking bustards in South Africa, all leading to the ultimate question -- will they break the magic 4,000? Written in an accessible style, this book will be of great interest to birders, readers of travel literature, and to people who simply enjoy a good adventure!IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: Birders and eco-tourists will enjoy this book!   Laurin, Michel. How Vertebrates Left the Water. 2010. University of California Press. Hardbound:199 pages. Price: $34.95 U.S. [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: More than three hundred million years ago -- a relatively recent date in the two billion years since life first appeared -- vertebrate animals first ventured onto land. This illustrated book describes how some finned vertebrates acquired limbs, giving rise to more than 25,000 extant tetrapod species. Michel Laurin uses paleontological, geological, physiological, and comparative anatomical data to describe this monumental event. He summarizes key concepts of modern paleontological research, including biological nomenclature, paleontological and molecular dating, and the methods used to infer phylogeny and character evolution. Along with a discussion of the evolutionary pressures that may have led vertebrates onto dry land, the book also shows how extant vertebrates yield clues about the conquest of land and how scientists uncover evolutionary history.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: For those with an interest in vertebrate paleontology.   Ash, Patricia J. and David J. Robinson. The Emergence of Humans: An Exploration of the Evolutionary Timeline. 2010. Wiley-Blackwell. Paperback: 324 pages. Price: $65.00 U.S. [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: The Emergence of Humans is an accessible, informative introduction to the scientific study of human evolution. It takes the reader through time following the emergence of the modern human species Homo sapiens from primate roots. Acknowledging the controversy surrounding the interpretation of the fossil record, the authors present a balanced approach in an effort to do justice to different views. Each chapter covers a significant time period of evolutionary history and includes relevant techniques from other disciplines that have applications to the field of human evolution. Self-assessment questions linked to learning outcomes are provided for each chapter, together with further reading and reference to key sources in the primary literature.The book will thus be effective both as a conventional textbook and for independent study. Written by two authors with a wealth of teaching experience, The Emergence of Humans will prove invaluable to students in the biological and natural sciences needing a clear, balanced introduction to the study of human evolution.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: Would make a good undergraduate level textbook.   Holldobler, Bert and Edward O. Wilson. The Leafcutter Ants: Civilization by Instinct. 2010. W.W. Norton. Paperback: 160 pages. Price:$19.95 U.S. [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: From the Pulitzer Prize-winning authors of The Ants comes this dynamic and visually spectacular portrait of Earth&apos;s ultimate superorganism. The Leafcutter Ants is the most detailed and authoritative description of any ant species ever produced. With a text suitable for both a lay and a scientific audience, the book provides an unforgettable tour of Earth&apos;s most evolved animal societies. Each colony of leafcutters contains as many as five million workers, all the daughters of a single queen that can live over a decade. A gigantic nest can stretch thirty feet across, rise five feet or more above the ground, and consist of hundreds of chambers that reach twenty-five feet below the ground surface. Indeed, the leafcutters have parlayed their instinctive civilization into a virtual domination of forest, grassland, and croplandfrom Louisiana to Patagonia. Inspired by a section of the authors&apos; acclaimed The Superorganism, this brilliantly illustrated work provides the ultimate explanation of what a social order with a half-billion years of animal evolution has achieved.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: Fans of the authors&apos; earlier works will want this book!

They are perhaps unsurprising obsessions when the 69-year-old&apos;s succession is the factor most likely to determine North Korea&apos;s future relationship with the rest of the world. Without an embassy in Pyongyang, the Americans hoover up any fragment of intelligence from foreign contacts. The &quot;Dear Leader&quot; variously emerges as &quot;a flabby old chap&quot;, &quot;quite a good drinker&quot; and &quot;increasingly indecisive since his stroke and other health problems&quot;. A leading Chinese official who met him in December 2009, the most recent face-to-face encounter recorded in the cables, reported that as a result of his worsening health Kim had developed a tendency to &quot;reverse policies&quot;, and that &quot;officials also chart their own course as different factions competing for Kim&apos;s attention, making it difficult for Kim to set a firm, clear direction&quot;. As an example of his loosening grip the Chinese official pointed to his reversal of a decision to recall students, scholars and scientists working or studying in China as a result of a single student&apos;s defection in Beijing, under pressure from business and trade groups with interests in north-east China. After an earlier October meeting with a Chinese state councillor, Dai Bingguo, &quot;Kim told Dai that he had hoped to invite the Chinese official to share some liquor and wine, but that because of scheduling problems he would have to defer the offer to Dai&apos;s next visit ...

In a meeting in Seoul in February, assistant secretary of state Kurt Campbell sought the views of a group of North Korea experts. A confidential cable reports a consensus that Kim Jong-un will face a moment of high danger when his father dies. &quot;There were many reasons to doubt that Kim Jong-un would be able to successfully fend off challenges to his control after his father died,&quot; one expert is quoted as saying. &quot;He [the expert] noted that Kim Jong-il had 20 years of experience as an official of the Korean Workers&apos; party before his father died. Furthermore, Kim Jong-il had the benefit of years of guidance from his father after he had been officially anointed in 1980 to eventually succeed him.

China and North Korea --------------------- 4. (S) Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on May 30 on the margins of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual international security forum held in Singapore. The Deputy Secretary used the meeting with MM Lee to stress the importance of Chinese cooperation in addressing the North Korea nuclear issue and to elicit MM Lee&apos;s views on China and North Korea. MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Chinese do not want North Korea, which China sees as a buffer state, to collapse. The ROK would take over in the North and China would face a U.S. presence at its border. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad for China than a North Korea that has collapsed, he stated. 5. (S) MM Lee said he asked Deputy Chief of the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma&apos;s Delphic answer was that &quot;they can survive on their own.&quot; MM Lee said he interpreted this as meaning that even if China cut off aid, the DPRK leadership would survive. This is a leadership that has already taken actions like killing ROK Cabinet Members in Burma and shooting down a KAL flight. If they lose power, they will end up facing justice at The Hague, like Milosevic. They have been so isolated for so long that they have no friends, not even Russia. They have not trusted China since the Chinese began cultivating ties with the ROK, given China&apos;s interest in attracting foreign investment, he said. The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee expressed worry about the effect on Iran if the DPRK persists. MM Lee said he believes the DPRK can be contained and will not proliferate, but Iran has very high ambitions, ties to Shiite communities outside Iran, and oil wealth. 6. (S) The Deputy Secretary noted that North Korea&apos;s decisions will have an impact in Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well &quot;go nuclear.&quot; The Chinese must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of Japan with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing North Korea as a buffer state. The Chinese take a long-term view and must think that within a few years the DPRK&apos;s current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership, with new thinking. But there will still be a North Korea, he said. 7. (S) MM Lee said he wishes the USG well in its efforts on North Korea, but he would be surprised if the North Koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons. They might give up a first-strike capacity, but they want nuclear weapons in case the USG decides to seek regime change. They are psychopathic types, with a &quot;flabby old chap&quot; for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation. MM Lee noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of Japanese occupation in Singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food, clothing and medicine. 8. (S) MM Lee said the ROK, after seeing what had happened with German unification, does not want immediate unification with the DPRK. There is &quot;nothing there&quot; in the DPRK, other than a military organization. Kim Jong-Il has already had a stroke. It is just a matter of time before he has another stroke. The next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather. He may not be prepared to see people die like flies. China is calculating all this. They have their best men on the job. They want to help the United States to advance common objectives. But they do not want the South to take over the North, MM Lee said. Chinese Economy --------------- 9. (C) Regarding the Chinese economy, MM Lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries, but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place. The Chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums, but when MM Lee visited Jiangsu Province on May 24, his impression was one of continued prosperity. Shanghai has been harder hit, with container port traffic down 30-35 percent, similar to the situation in Singapore. There is no sign of deep unrest in China. The Chinese are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth. The government is pumping resources into the economy, with a focus on developing Western China. Whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear, but China can certainly sustain these policies for at least a year, he said. 10. (C) MM Lee stated that in the absence of a social safety net in China, the Chinese savings rate is 55 percent, exceeding even Singapore&apos;s 50 percent level. Consumption accounts for only 35 percent of Chinese GDP, as opposed to 70 percent of U.S. GDP. The Chinese leadership may be loath to shift permanently to a more consumption-oriented economy, but the leadership will do so temporarily, if only to avoid unrest. 20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations. The government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition. The pragmatists are in charge. There is nothing Communist about it. They just want to preserve one party rule. The Deputy Secretary expressed concern that current Chinese policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform. MM Lee said this cannot be helped. China wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in Guangzhou in March when Hong Kong-connected enterprises suddenly shut down, he said. Taiwan ------ 11. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked MM Lee for his assessment of Taiwan. MM Lee said former President Chen Shui-bian had left Taiwan in a weak economic position, which had enabled President Ma Ying-Jeou to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with China. In Beijing, former President Jiang Zemin was wedded to his eight-point approach, but President Hu Jintao was more flexible. Jiang wanted to show he was a great man by solving the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, but Hu is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline. In Chinese domestic politics, Hu had wanted Vice Premier Li Keqiang from the Communist Youth League to emerge as his successor, not Vice President Xi Jinping, but Hu did his calculations and accepted Xi when it became clear that Xi had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership. Similarly, on Taiwan, Hu will be pragmatic. It does not matter to Hu if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30. The key is building links with Taiwan. As in the case of Hong Kong, if necessary the tap could be turned off, he said. 12. (C) In this context, MM Lee said, Hu could live with Ma&apos;s positions on the &apos;92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office. What mattered to Hu was that Taiwan not seek independence. If that happened, China has 1,000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the U.S. fleet at a distance. The implicit question for Taiwan&apos;s leaders is if that is what they want, MM Lee said. 13. (C) MM Lee stated that the alternative is Mainland investment in Taiwan stocks and property. The Mainland has already assured Hong Kong that it will help out economically. The Mainland has not said this to Taiwan, but the Mainland&apos;s Taiwan Affairs Director, Wang Yi, did urge Chinese companies to invest in Taiwan. In four years Taiwan&apos;s economy will pick up and Ma will win re-election. The DPP lacks strong potential candidates. Su Zhen-chang is promising, but seems unlikely to be able to win. Meanwhile, even the traditionally DPP-supporting farmers in Taiwan&apos;s South need China&apos;s market for vegetables and other products. Taiwan&apos;s continued participation in the World Health Assembly depends on Beijing. Beijing&apos;s calculation seems to be to prevent Taiwan independence in the near term, then bring Taiwan &quot;back to China,&quot; even if it takes 40 or 50 years. MM Lee said he is looking forward to visiting Fujian Province, where preparations are underway for a new southern economic area linked with Taiwan. Xi Jinping ---------- 14. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked if in the future a leader like Xi Jinping would continue the policies on Taiwan followed by Hu Jintao. MM Lee responded affirmatively. Xi is a princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated. When the party needed his talents, Xi was brought in as Shanghai Party Secretary. Xi is seen as a Jiang Zemin protege, but in another three and a half years Jiang&apos;s influence will be gone. The focus now is on maintaining the system. There are no more strongmen like Deng Xiaoping. Jiang did not like Hu, but could not stop him, because Hu had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes. Wang Qishan ----------- 15. (C) MM Lee said Vice Premier Wang Qishan, whom the MM saw in connection with celebrations in May of the 15th anniversary of Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park, is an exceptional talent, very assured and efficient. Wang handled SARS superbly when he was in Hainan. He excelled in coordinating the Beijing Olympics. Li Keqiang may not get the Premiership and the Party is looking for a way to keep Wang on past his 65th birthday until he is 70. MM Lee said he had met first Wang back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting. This time when they met, Wang told Lee he had reviewed the records of all Lee&apos;s meeting with Chinese leaders going back to the days of Deng Xiaoping to see how Lee&apos;s thinking had developed. Wang told Lee he respects him as a consistent man. China&apos;s Rise ------------ 16. (C) MM Lee said China is following an approach consistent with ideas in the Chinese television series &quot;The Rise of Great Powers.&quot; The mistake of Germany and Japan had been their effort to challenge the existing order. The Chinese are not stupid; they have avoided this mistake. China&apos;s economy has surpassed other countries, with the exceptions of Japan and the United States. Even with those two countries, the gap is closing, with China growing at seven-nine percent annually, versus two-three percent in the United States and Japan. Overall GDP, not GDP per capita, is what matters in terms of power. China has four times the population of the United States. China is active in Latin America, Africa, and in the Gulf. Within hours, everything that is discussed in ASEAN meetings is known in Beijing, given China&apos;s close ties with Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, he stated. 17. (C) MM Lee said China will not reach the American level in terms of military capabilities any time soon, but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter U.S. military power. China understands that its growth depends on imports, including energy, raw materials, and food. This is why China is working with South Africa on the China-Africa Development Fund. China also needs open sea lanes. Beijing is worried about its dependence on the Strait of Malacca and is moving to ease the dependence by means like a pipeline through Burma. Build Ties with Young Chinese ----------------------------- 18. (C) MM Lee said the best course for the United States on China is to build ties with China&apos;s young people. China&apos;s best and brightest want to study in the United States, with the UK as the next option, then Japan. While they are there, it is important that they be treated as equals, with the cultural support they may need as foreigners. Why not have International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs for China? Why not have Chinese cadets at West Point alongside Vietnamese cadets and Indian cadets? America&apos;s advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world, as in Silicon Valley. China still tends to try to keep the foreigners in Beijing and Shanghai. MM Lee noted that his own experience as a student in the UK had left him with an enduring fondness for the UK. When he spent two months at Harvard in 1968, an American professor had invited him home for Thanksgiving. This was not the sort of thing that happened in the UK, and Lee had realized he was dealing with a different civilization. In the future, China&apos;s leaders will have PhDs and MBAs from American universities, he predicted. 19. (U) The Deputy Secretary has cleared this message.

Prince Andrew does brusque, blunt and boorish, but very rarely charming, especially to those in inferior social positions to himself and to journalists \u2013 even those who go to interview him about his mission as Britain&apos;s special representative for international trade. It is an occupation that takes the Duke of York around the world at taxpayers&apos; expense and often by the most expensive form of transport. Not that public criticism, or the nickname Airmiles Andy, ever deters him from taking the next privately chartered jet, or helicopter to lift him over the traffic to a golf club. &quot;It&apos;s not the quickest way \u2013 it&apos;s the most cost-effective and sensible way to use the time I have available. I probably use the helicopter less than other members of the royal family,&quot; he told the Daily Telegraph last year after taking a \u00a32,000 helicopter flight from Windsor to Deal and back so he could spend an hour at a golf club party. Not that such jaunts are the most expensive. Last year, according to the royal public finances annual report, which details the costs of official journeys costing \u00a310,000 or more, there was the chartered jet for the four-day trade visit to Algeria and Tunisia that cost \u00a354,869, and the seven-day round trip that took in Canada and Baku for \u00a394,500, or the return trip to Jeddah costing \u00a328,767, or the Singapore-Hanoi-Bangkok charter for \u00a346,264, or the trip to Moscow for \u00a320,083, or the \u00a362,092 for a four-day charter flight to Mexico and Panama, not to mention the \u00a343,989 it cost to get him from Mumbai to Delhi and Kolkata. Or for that matter, the \u00a311,148 to whisk him from Prestwick airport to Inverness and then down to the golf links at Dundonald in Ayrshire to attend the Duke of York&apos;s Young Champions trophy. He was batting for Britain again last week, accompanying his parents on their official visit to the Gulf. In September he was in China, and he has also been to Australia, central Asia, Malaysia, South America, the US and Italy this year. &quot;If you are a public figure you have to accept the rough with the smooth. The trouble with that particular tag [Airmiles Andy] is that, personally, I would not choose to do as many of these [foreign visits] but I am doing them because over the nine years in the job, the number of people who wish to be helped has increased, almost exponentially, through the recognition by businesses of where I can deliver,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not only about increasing the opportunities for British businesses overseas. It is also about [supporting] business generally within the UK.&quot; The prince, fourth in line to the throne, who passed his 50th birthday in February and spent 22 years in the Royal Navy, some of that time as a helicopter pilot, has been dogged by controversy and scathing headlines from a media which clearly does not appreciate his worth. Once he was known as Randy Andy (&quot;the press want something that rhymes \u2026 if you are in a public position, as I am, you are going to get stones thrown&quot;); then there was the short-lived but ill-starred marriage to Sarah Ferguson. She at least remains loyal: &quot;Andrew is a great man and a thoroughly good person ... he&apos;s a model boy. He doesn&apos;t drink, he goes to bed early,&quot; she told the Belfast Telegraph in December 2008. Business organisations like him too. His official website bears testimony to their encomiums. They say he is diligent and well-briefed, although \u2013 more privately \u2013 some speak of a tendency to harangue them about things he has only just found out, but which they have known for years. Andy Scott, the CBI&apos;s director of international and UK operations, said: &quot;He is a good ambassador representing the UK. The royal family connection is very helpful. In a market such as China the presence of someone of his stature really counts.&quot; And yet, in recent years, the repeated, graceless remarks. He probably thinks of them as an attempt to emulate his father, although he lacks the Duke of Edinburgh&apos;s frustrated intelligence, wit or strange ethereal charm. Thus, there was the attempt to lecture America on its imperial shortcomings \u2013 &quot;those in responsible positions in the US should have listened to the British and learned from our experiences as a colonial power&quot;, he said in 2008, shortly before embarking on a trade tour (by private jet) to woo Republican businessmen in the deep south. And then there was his assertion last year that bankers should not be demonised because &quot;bonuses in the scheme of things are minute&quot;. Or, just a few weeks ago, castigating the Ministry of Defence for &quot;sitting on their fat backsides&quot; by insisting on additional safety checks on the armoured vehicles made by a Dorset firm he was visiting. So his remarks in Kyrgyzstan are just par for the course. &quot;You have to take the bashes with the good bits and I&apos;ve got a thick skin,&quot; he told CNN. Palace observers believe that the duke may be embarrassed by his lack of wealth compared with those he visits in the Middle East and former Soviet republics in the hope of boosting trade with Britain. Andrew receives an annuity of about \u00a3250,000 a year from the Queen and the cost of his official trips is borne by the taxpayer. There were more than 600 trade-related engagements in Britain and abroad in 2008 and he visited more than 20 countries. Expenses averaged \u00a34,000 a week. &quot;I&apos;d love to be able to say I&apos;ve been responsible for \u00a310bn of business or for another 250 jobs coming to the UK [but sometimes] the companies themselves don&apos;t know,&quot; he told the Financial Times last year. &quot;I get paid nothing ... That&apos;s my life. That&apos;s what I expect, right? That is because of who I am ... &quot;So to me this state of affairs is not extraordinary. To anybody else who looks in, they think I&apos;m bloody mad. But that&apos;s what we do.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/nov/30/broadband-world-map-point-topic", "sentences": ["The next in the top ten are Japan, Romania, Sweden, Latvia, China, Singapore, Russia, Germany and Finland.", "Even in relatively mature markets, like Singapore or Italy, there is room for improvement.&quot; Faster downstream speeds usually mean a lower price per megabit but the bandwidth has to be used for those savings to be achieved."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-30T07:17:10Z", "title": "The cheapest place on the planet to get broadband?

No - it turns out to be Hong Kong, according to a study by the broadband consultancy Point Topic.  The data, which is collected on a quarterly basis by the company, showcases the best deals on offer to consumers around the world. &quot;Consumers in different countries are faced with very different broadband tariffs, dependent on geography, market and network maturity, local competition and various levels and sources of subsidy,&quot; said Fiona Vanier, senior analyst at Point Topic. The map above shows an adjusted measure of the cost - specifically, the logarithm of the cost, subtracted from the largest value of cost. This means that larger numbers actually match to lower, rather than higher prices: in Hong Kong the provider, HKBN, offers fibre to the home, with a 1Gbps connection, which costs the equivalent of $0.028 per megabit. The next in the top ten are Japan, Romania, Sweden, Latvia, China, Singapore, Russia, Germany and Finland. The UK finally appears at No.24, ahead of the US which is at No.30. In the standalone tariffs that Point Topic tracks, bandwidth can vary from 150kbps (which arguably isn&apos;t broadband, though it tends to be the continuous state of the connection rather than the speed that most focus on) up to 1Gbps.  Many come with data limits, email addresses or static IPs, and that is before accounting for &quot;special offers&quot;.  To help comparison, Point Topic analysed the amount a consumer pays for a megabit of bandwidth, and analysed the cost over a year. &quot;Nine of the ten best value tariffs are either pure fibre or hybrid offerings where fibre is a significant part of the local loop. The exception is Germany where Unity Media offer a cable service that is very competitive,&quot; said Vanier. &quot;Prices are stabilising in many markets around the world and overall in the last quarter there was an average increase globally. However there are plenty of countries that are still rolling out new networks and ISPs that are announcing new tariffs. Even in relatively mature markets, like Singapore or Italy, there is room for improvement.&quot; Faster downstream speeds usually mean a lower price per megabit but the bandwidth has to be used for those savings to be achieved. &quot;Bandwidth will continue to increase as fibre edges closer to the consumer. Higher speeds generally mean better value for the consumer. All that remains is to work out how best to use it,&quot; concluded Vanier."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/nov/30/weekly-notes-queries-3-dec", "sentences": ["Gareth Morgan, Singapore Any answers?"], "publicationDate": "2010-11-30T13:59:01Z", "title": "We're great, but we're not perfect", "tags": [], "article": "What and when was the Guardian&apos;s first Correction/Clarification? &quot;The Proprietors regret that their compositors&apos; inexperience produced an unfortunate (and inexcusable) infelicity in last Saturday&apos;s edition of this organ \u2013 that edition which, of course, began what we remain confident will mature into an illustrious career.

Cameron arrived today ahead of Thursday&apos;s vote to decide the hosts of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments and immediately travelled to Fifa House to see the president, Sepp Blatter. Asked whether he was concerned that some of the 23 members of the Fifa executive committee who will make the decision &quot;weren&apos;t straight&quot; in the wake of last night&apos;s Panorama allegations he said his only concern was to win the vote. &quot;I&apos;ve only got one focus here and that&apos;s trying to bring the World Cup home for England,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s going to be my focus, talking to the decision-makers and pressing them on the brilliance of English football and what we can bring for this bid. That&apos;s going to be my concern, nothing else.&quot; Fifa today said it would not reopen investigations into the ISL affair, in which the now defunct sports marketing company is alleged to have paid around $100m (\u00a364.2m) to senior sports officials in bribes between 1989 and 1999, despite new allegations by the BBC and two European newspapers against three of those who will vote on Thursday. The BBC programme also contained allegations against Jack Warner, whose three votes are seen as crucial to England&apos;s chances. Cameron was due to meet Warner this afternoon, as well as other executive committee members. Amid speculation about whether the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, will make the trip to press the case of the bookmakers&apos; favourite, Cameron repeated the key messages that England 2018 executives hope will consolidate existing support and give momentum to those who they hope will switch in later rounds. &quot;I think we have got a very strong team here \u2013 Prince William, David Beckham and myself and we are going to be making the arguments for England 2018,&quot; he said. &quot;We think we have got an incredibly strong case, the best technical bid, and I think we can make the biggest commercial success of the World Cup.&quot; Beckham and the prince are also arriving today and will be strategically deployed to lobby different executive committee members and deliver key messages. The Russian bid chief, Vitaly Mutko, today echoed the Spain/Portugal camp when he said he believed that all of the voters had made up their mind, but the England team continue to believe their final push could be crucial in swaying opinion in the latter rounds. Cameron is hoping to repeat the feat of the former prime minister Tony Blair, whose intense lobbying in Singapore in 2005 was seen as a key factor in helping London win the 2012 games. The England bid team are hoping the findings of a confidential McKinsey report into the economic benefits of each bid, which ranked England ahead of their rivals, will help frame their pitch that they could deliver the best atmosphere for players and fans as well as the biggest financial boost to Fifa and the global game. &quot;If we want to enlarge the audience for football worldwide I think England 2018 is the best way to do that, so I think we&apos;ll be making all of those arguments,&quot; said Cameron. &quot;Britain is passionate about football and we can put on a really great show, we can have full stadiums, we have got everything that is necessary to make this work and we are going to give this 110% over the next couple of days.&quot; Cameron, who will be joined in Zurich by the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, and the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said it was right that the government should back the bid. &quot;What governments should do and what I&apos;m doing is to get behind the bid. We have got a great bid, it&apos;s independent of government and it&apos;s a really well put together bid and it involves football clubs and football enthusiasts right across the country,&quot; he said. &quot;What the government can do is get behind that and help assist, come here, talk to people and explain the passion that people in the United Kingdom have for football and how we can put on a great show in England, and that&apos;s what I&apos;ll be doing.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/30/england-2018-world-cup-hopes-rise", "sentences": ["Beckham acknowledged England were underdogs and likened the late push to the final 72 hours in Singapore in 2005, when he joined a London Olympic delegation that was helped over the line by the then prime minister, Tony Blair.", "That was the case in Singapore as well."], "publicationDate": "2010-11-30T21:25:17Z", "title": "England's 2018 hopes rise as Vladimir Putin hints he will not turn up", "tags": ["Fifa", "World Cup 2018", "Football politics", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "article": "England&apos;s bid team raised hopes of a late surge to land the 2018 World Cup as the prime minister, David Cameron, led a final lobbying push and Russian rivals appeared to be preparing the ground for his counterpart, Vladimir Putin, not to travel. On a day when Fifa refused to reopen an investigation into bribery allegations involving some of its executive committee members despite the International Olympic Committee doing so, hopes were raised that England could secure enough votes to make it to the final round and a possible showdown against Spain/Portugal. While the final, frantic few days of lobbying involving Hollywood stars, iconic footballers and heads of state are unlikely to change the first-choice votes of the 22 Fifa executives who will decide the fate of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, they could affect the crucial second and third preferences of voters. Beckham, who visited a school in Zurich and met voters, was part of a coordinated effort designed to reduce the perceived negative impact of Monday&apos;s Panorama allegations against four of the voters. Three were accused of taking bribes and one, Jack Warner, of ordering World Cup tickets that were destined for touts before the deal fell through. Beckham acknowledged England were underdogs and likened the late push to the final 72 hours in Singapore in 2005, when he joined a London Olympic delegation that was helped over the line by the then prime minister, Tony Blair. &quot;The last few days and hours will be very critical. You know a friendly handshake or an important word to some of the members that aren&apos;t decided yet can make a difference,&quot; Beckham said. &quot;The similarities are with the 2012 bid that people are talking about us being the underdogs, maybe not favourites. That was the case in Singapore as well. Everybody expected France and Paris to win it.&quot; The Russian bid, long-time favourites, said Putin remained firmly behind it but indications that he would not travel before Thursday&apos;s vote will raise questions about his confidence in their chances. It has long been assumed that the Russian prime minister, who has hosted the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, and several committee members in Moscow, would travel to Zurich only if he was fairly certain they would win. His name was not believed to be on the list of delegates circulated by Fifa but the possibility remains that the Russians are planning for him to make a dramatic late appearance. Russia&apos;s 2018 chairman, Vitaly Mutko, who is also the country&apos;s sports minister, said Putin would clarify his intentions tomorrow. Meanwhile Cameron was forced to duck difficult questions about corruption allegations against four members of the Fifa executive committee, including two \u2013 Warner and Issa Hayatou \u2013 considered key to England&apos;s chances. The bid team believe they distanced themselves from a Fifa backlash about the British media, in the wake of a Sunday Times investigation that resulted in six officials being suspended and the BBC documentary. &quot;Basically me, David Dein, the prime minister and other members of the team sat down with president Blatter this morning and it was one of the topics that we spoke about and something that was cleared away,&quot; Beckham said. The strategy has opened them up to criticism but Cameron insisted he was concentrating only on winning the vote. &quot;I&apos;ve only got one focus here and that&apos;s trying to bring the World Cup home for England,&quot; he said. Cameron tonight met Hayatou and Jacques Anouma, two African executive committee members who could be pivotal to England&apos;s hopes. Fifa said it would not reopen an investigation into allegations that Hayatou, the South American confederation&apos;s president, Nicol\u00e1s L\u00e9oz, and the Brazilian Ricardo Teixeira were among officials who accepted a total of around $100m (\u00a364.2m) in bribes from the sports marketing company ISL between 1989 and 1999. In contrast the IOC reiterated its &quot;zero tolerance&quot; stance on corruption. It said it would ask the BBC to pass on all relevant evidence and refer the matter to its ethics commission. Hayatou is also an IOC member. Both Hayatou and Warner indicated that the Panorama allegations would not affect their vote. Warner, who met Cameron today at his hotel, said he was &quot;pleased&quot; with the talks but would not confirm that England definitely had the crucial three Concacaf votes. &quot;They were very constructive. Mr Cameron is a knowledgeable man. He knows about football but, not only that, he knows about the voting process as well,&quot; Warner said. Hayatou argued that the cash payment of 100,000 French francs highlighted by Panorama as being on a list of 175 sums paid by ISL over a 10-year period went to the Confederation of African Football for its 40th birthday celebrations and was passed through its books. He said he was considering legal action but that the allegations would not affect his deliberations over whether to vote for England."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/dec/01/world-cup-2018-world-cup-2022", "sentences": ["He recalls Tony Blair&apos;s role in Singapore (for the 2012 Olympics bid)."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-01T09:13:24Z", "title": "World Cup 2018 and 2022 bids - live! | Steve Busfield and Paul Doyle", "tags": ["World Cup 2018", "World Cup 2022", "Football", "Football politics", "Sepp Blatter", "Sport", "World Cup"], "article": " Thursday: how the action will unfold 5.43pm: Presentations for 2018 bidders8am GMT Belgium/Netherlands9am Spain/Portugal10am England11am Russia 1pm Fifa executive committee voting process* behind closed doors3pm 2018 and 2022 World Cup Host Nations Announcement * This is Fifa&apos;s &quot;Voting procedure at a glance&quot;:  \u00b7 The 2018 vote will take place first, then the 2022 one.

Current world population in the region of 5 billion people, I think)  5.08pm: Another video, another featuring lots of children, this time in the &quot;Dream Teacher&quot; project.  5.05pm: Kohzo Tashima (CEO, Japan 2022 Bid Committee): Dream Tour (&quot;invite 6,000 children to come to Japan to have a great time and take home a smile from our next generation World Cup&quot;). A video of children learning about friendship, peace, football.  5.02pm: She passes the ball on to an adult (Junji Ogura, FIFA ExCo, Chairman, Japan 2022 Bid Committee?) wearing a Japanese shirt (not many delegate presenters have done that) who says they have a passionate ambition for the next generation. We are talking about putting down giant flat screens in 400 stadia around the world. A FanFest for the world. (This explains why Sony boss Howard Stringer is on the Japanese panel). &quot;We are talking about a very big idea.&quot;  Japan presentation 5.00pm: A small girl is on stage, holding a football, talking in English and then Japanese, to launch the presentation. She has learnt her lines very well, speaking very quickly and I&apos;m presuming that it makes sense if you understand Japanese.  Japan next 4.45pm: Japan, who co-hosted in 2002 are up at 5pm GMT. You can watch live here at Fifa.com.  What the bookies think 4.41pm: Sean Ingle says:   Qatar still odds on favourites at 4-6 ... but the US&apos;s price to win 2022 has halved today into 5-2.   Clinton&apos;s charisma 4.39pm: Grant Wahl of Sports Illustrated tweets: &quot;If you think Bill Clinton is exuding charisma in this World Cup speech, imagine how much he is behind closed doors here w/ExCo members.&quot;  4.35pm: Clinton: There is &quot;something magical about the World Cup.&quot; Impressive from Bill, statesmanlike, generous to rivals, full of anecdotes and examples, flattering Fifa, and subtly promising lots of cash.  4.33pm: Clinton moves on to Haiti. And then moves onto the low-cost of an American World Cup (already have the facilities) and thus the large money-making opportunities for Fifa (so that they can spend it on giving water to Haiti and making the world a better place).  4.27pm: Clinton: On his charitable journeys around the world, he has seen the power of football to bring people together. &quot;A field in Zambia, where I saw several teams come together to bring greater awareness of HIV.&quot; My experience is seeing millions of children take to the fields playing soccer, building teamwork, fighting obesity. In South Africa I saw the dream of hosting a World Cup lift the esteem of a country. Clinton riffs on a quote from How Soccer Explains The World by Franklin Foer, which says that the game is like war. He says that actually football brings people together. &quot;The unifying power of this game, to reduce inequalities, shared responsibilities. Fifa is the main reason that soccer has become a unifying force in the world and not just an arena for tribal combat.&quot; He&apos;s doing a good job of bigging-up Fifa and the World Cup. But is he making the case for the US?  4.25pm: Clinton talking about the wide varieties of culture in America. No matter who makes the finals, we can fill stadia with supporters who root for the nations. Talking about &quot;Ghanaian Americans&quot; supporting their team in 2010. Other nations can come to US and feel like they are playing at home.  4.22pm: Clinton: good to see so many that I met in South Africa. &quot;A word of congratulations and respect to the rival bids. As a competitor i found them all rather persuasive.&quot; Impressive politician, generous to rivals, just by mentioning them makes him seem better than rivals who have studiously ignored the opposition. Now he&apos;s talking about watching Chelsea (Clinton) play when she was six years old. A sport that doesn&apos;t need a lot of expensive equipment. That generation has grown now.  4.20pm: Gulati shows huge graphic of growing TV income. &quot;Income for Fifa&quot;. Sponsorship, another area for growth - many of Fifa&apos;s partners come from our country. 30% increase in football sponsorship since 1993. A World Cup in the US will drive this figure higher. &quot;Provides extraordinary financial resources for us. And for Fifa driving the game forward.&quot; Definitely playing the cash card. And now it is Bill Clinton...  4.16pm: Gulati promises it can deliver the World Cup, already has vast number of 76,000+ seater stadia, hotel infrastructure to suit all budgets, good transport. I think his point might be that it will cost little for the US to host the World Cup, thus making the profits even bigger. &quot;The Games is in US.&quot; (Doh! I&apos;ve finally twigged to how that slogan works).  4.14pm: Sunil Gulati again: points out that Fifa&apos;s vision in awarding &apos;94 World Cup launched football in US. &quot;We are asking for your help to complete our 50 year plan,&quot; says Gulati. He is promising to vastly increase the footballing audience in the world&apos;s richest country.  4.11pm: Another video: MLS broke the 4m attendance this season. Huge interest among youth.  Oliver Kay of The Times tweets: &quot;Far more emphasis on football in USA presentation than rival 2022 bidders.&quot;  4.08pm: Another video - Landon Donovan scores against Algeria. (That led to that great post-match interview). And now Landon in the flesh. He says that the 1994 World Cup was the inspiration that led to his playing career.  4.07pm: Sunil Gulati (Chairman, USA Bid Committee) looking a lot slicker than some of his rivals, indeed, looking a bit like a chat show host as he prowls around the stage with his mic, refusing to hide behind the podium  4.05pm: Obama says 3.6m people attended the 94 World Cup - the biggest ever tournament attendance. I promise you that if we are successful, we will make the world proud. The Game is in us,&quot; says Obama.  4.05pm: And now Barack Obama is on video-link. So past and present Presidents.  4.03pm: Freeman looks confused and realises he has skipped a page of his dialogue.  4.00pm: And Morgan Freeman is first up: &quot;Ours is a nation founded on tolerance and freedom. A country of dreams and the right to pursue them. We have sometimes struggled to be true to our ideals. But we come together as a people. Our patchwork heritage is our strength. Lots of Americans. One America.&quot; &quot;Sport, as Nelson Mandela says, has the power to change the world.&quot; (Nod to his movie role as the political icon who made the 1995 Rugby World Cup such an iconic event).  3.58pm: A video, featuring a Morgan Freeman deep resonant voiceover. &quot;The game is in us,&quot; says the slogan repeated by men, women, children.  3.57pm: I&apos;m hoping that this one will be in English...  USA presentation 3.57pm: Sepp Blatter introduces the US team: Former president Bill Clinton will lead the USA performance. Blatter seems slightly bemused by &quot;the actor&quot; Morgan Freeman.  Images from Zurich 3.41pm: The BBC has a gallery of the action in Zurich, featuring a lot of David Beckham, plus John Barnes, Zinedine Zidane (an ambassador for Qatar) and Andrew Cole.  Twitter talk      3.37pm: Couple of tweets: @xanderkale says: &quot;why hasn&apos;t Sepp Blatter got his own chat show? with his warmth and charm and way with people he&apos;s a natural.&quot; @tim1webber tweets: &quot;Amazing that given the money spent on these bids, they seem to have got a 5 year old to knock up a powerpoint for them.&quot; Think that last one might have been before the Qatari presentation...  YouGov poll: England doesn&apos;t expect 3.34pm: A YouGov press release says:   Research in the past week reveals that just under a quarter (24%) of the English public think that England will win the right to host the 2018 FIFA football World Cup. Spain and Portugal were the most confident nations as almost three fifths (58%) of respondents in both countries believed that their joint bid would be successful.   3.29pm: And Sepp Blatter is back on the podium. He praises the Qatari bid for its &quot;emotional presentation&quot;. And he is going to present them with their &quot;certificate of participation&quot; for taking part in the bid. The next presentation will be USA at 4pm (GMT).  3.28pm: Still the video - waiting, waiting, waiting - i&apos;m guessing that this video might not end with Australia being awarded the World Cup 2022....  3.27pm: Another imagined video: the Qatari people are waiting with baited breath for Fifa&apos;s decision. There&apos;s a young child talking about Israel qualifying and fans watching side by side. &quot;We can change the image of the region,&quot; says the film.       3.20pm: Goal.com&apos;s Amar Singh tweets: &quot;Sheikha Moza bint Nasser on now. Putting forward the case that the Middle East is long overdue its first World Cup.&quot; Owen Gibson tweets: &quot;Patented Brazil 2016 map showing that World Cup has never been to the middle east.&quot; Telegraph&apos;s Paul Kelso adds: &quot;That worked for Rio too.&quot; And another video...  3.16pm: An Iraqi player is talking about Middle East conflicts. He talks about the positive impact of the Asian Cup. &quot;Bringing people together&quot; - this is why the entire region supports the Qatar bid.  3.12pm: Qatari government has history of delivering on its promises, they say. &quot;We can deliver. We will deliver.&quot; And now another video: imagining the 2022 world cup, with lots of happy fans getting off planes from a wide variety of countries, big screens in squares (will they have special cooling too?), &quot;The most compact world cup in history&quot;, &quot;zero carbon cooling technology&quot;.  3.10pm: After 2022 the Qataris say they will dismantle their stadia, and build 22 new stadia in developing nations - &quot;a true World Cup legacy&quot;. (They are thankfully now speaking in English). They say heat will not be an issue due to new cooling technology. &quot;A Fifa world cup in Qatar would provide an unrivalled commercial opportunity.&quot; Spread the game in the Middle East Three billion TV viewers in prime time reach of Qatar World Cup.  3.07pm: Bora Milutinovic says is it is a small country, easy to get around. And now they are highlighting the easy transportational links: two billion people within 4 hours flight.  They are promising $50bn investment in infrastructure. And a new metro system.  3.05pm: Bora Milutinovic (Bid Ambassador) is now speaking. Who, helpfully, is speaking in Spanish. How come Paul Doyle got Korea (speaking in English) and Australia?  3.04pm: After an opening image of some sand dunes, the rest of this video looks very little like a very hot, sand dominated country, and instead there are lots of images of a modern city, modern stadia, interspersed with the pre-match inspirational speech by a Qatari junior team coach.  3.02pm: &quot;An historic opportunity to bring the people of the Middle East together,&quot; he adds. And now it&apos;s time for the video.  2.58pm: Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Thani (Chairman of Qatar 2022 Bid Committee) is speaking in French (I remember during my O-Level French having to answer an oral question about the World Cup, but this is beyond my knowledge of the language) Main themes are flashing onto the main screen behind him: Reliability, Responsibility... &quot;This is an historic opportunity,&quot; he says (I could understand that!)  Qatar presentation 2.55pm: Sepp Blatter is introducing the Qatar presentation team. You can watch live on Fifa.com or you can follow an edited version here...       2.53pm:Paul Doyle is off and Steve Busfield is back on...  Matt Scott&apos;s guide to the 2018 bidding campaign           2:37pm: Here for your viewing pleasure is a video of the Guardian&apos;s Digger-in-chief, Matt Scott, explaining the lie of the land ahead of tomorrow&apos;s big decision.  2:30pm: So ends the Korean presentation, bang on time, as you might expect. &quot;Thank you for your very interesting presentation ... it was very interesting to see how small you were as a baby,&quot; blurts Blatter to one of the speakers, who had shown a family photo from man years ago while telling how his country has worked its way from poverty to prosperity within his lifetime.  2:26pm: Anoher chap is speaking and again they haven&apos;t bothered to identify which member of the party he is. He doesn&apos;t look like a ballerina, but you can&apos;t rule it out. Anyway, his theme is, like most of the others, &quot;peace and unification&quot;. &quot;I believe that bringing the 2022 World Cup to Korea will be a historical endeavour that will change the region for many years to come.&quot;  2:23pm: Maybe this, on the other hand, will be the clincher: The Koreans reveal that they plan to establish &quot;the Global Football Fund&quot;, which will be worth $777m, &quot;to be distributed to Fifa&apos;s confederations by 2022&quot;.  2:17pm: The Koreans have brought one simple prop with them: a ball. &quot;This ball is tight and ready, just like Korea,&quot; says the next speaker, who then vaunts his country&apos;s state-of-the-art technology. Among their many promises, they vow to &quot;screen 3D images of every match to every corner of the world&quot;, which sounds fun. Will they provide the glasses too? That could be the clincher. Or possibly not.  2:14pm: The next speaker gets no introduction but reveals that he is talking on behalf of his country&apos;s president, who, apparently, is &quot;very touched and inspired by the vision of Fifa to foster peace and prosperity through football ... the 2022 World Cup can be a celebration of peace in Korea.&quot; Getting ahead of themselves slightly but it&apos;s certainly a noble aspiration.  2:08pm: Park Ji-Sung is now at the podium and it turns out he&apos;s quite an impressive speaker, even if his message amounts to nothing more than &quot;I love football and so do children so please let the kids play in Korea.&quot; He gets generous applause when he&apos;s finished.  2:02pm: The former prime minister, Hwang Sik Kim, is emphasising the peace dividend of giving the World Cup to Korea. He compares the potential impact of such a decision to the 1980 Moscow Olympics and 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, which, he says, helped end the Cold War. So giving the 2022 jamboree to Korea would be &quot;a gateway for a new era for a united Korea.&quot; He&apos;s looking very wronged as he explains how painful it is that Korea is still divided and clearly wants Fifa to feel that they should take this opportunity to help put it back together again. He says that &quot;we Koreans have never given up our dream of seeing our united team play together again&quot;. He says &quot;football has a captivating power like no other ... please join us in this historic venture.&quot;  Korean presentation 2pm: &quot;A passion that unites ... dreaming of peace ... we believe in the power of football.&quot; So begins - and ends - Korea&apos;s first video. Brevity is a virtue.  Blatter is back 1:56pm: Again there&apos;s a surprising lack of smug grinning from the Fifa chief - it&apos;s almost as if hes&apos; a little chastened. He just introduces the Korean team, which includes one of the country&apos;s former prime minsters, Manchester United&apos;s Park Ji-Sung, a ballerina and assorted other luminaries.  Awaiting Korea ... Given Australia&apos;s all-out kangaroo attack, what do you think the Koreans are going to hit us with?  1:32pm: Next up will be the Korean presentation, slated for 2pm. You can watch it here while, of course, simultaneously enjoying it right here at guardian.co.uk. Please.  1:27pm: The Fifa website is currently showing the highlights of the Australian presentation. First time round I missed the bit where Lowy claimed that &quot;Australia is the most multi-cultural society in the world&quot;. Is that true? I wonder how many other bidders are going to make a similar claim over the next two days ...  1:23pm: Sepp Blatter first checks that the Australian presentation is in fact over - it kind of just stopped, five minutes ahead of schedule - and then presents their delegation with a &quot;diploma&quot; in recognition of the hard work they put into it. He might as well have given each of them a pat on the head. And then everyone files out of the room. A definite lack of smoothness about proceedings so far.  1:17pm: Here comes somebody. And not just anybody. The Body, apparently. Yes, it&apos;s Elle Macpherson. She gives Lowy a kiss and a cuddle, which brings giggles from the assembled dignataries. Then she introduces another little film, this one featuring an animated kangaroo bouncing around the nation before hurling himself off a cliff. Not too sure what the message is there ... oh hold on, he&apos;s still alive! And he&apos;s swimming under water, exploring the exotic fish and what not that they have down that way. And then, in a surprising twist, he re-emerges and eventually finds his way to a football stadium where he is presented with the World Cup ... before Paul Hogan nicks it and says &quot;I&apos;m taking it back to Fifa&quot;. This is going to be a box-office smash.  1:13pm: The Chairman of the Australian FA, Frank Lowy, is now explaining &quot;I am a businessman, business is in my blood, and I know a good investment when I see one.&quot; He&apos;s talking Fifa&apos;s language alright.  1:10pm: The CEO of the Australian FA, Ben Buckley, embarked on a lengthy ramble before summing it up conveniently by quipping: &quot;we give one simple promise: we will deliver Fifa a World Cup where you will have &apos;no worries&apos;.&quot;  1:05pm: Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce now bestrides the stage. From diligent reading of the world&apos;s media I gather that it is mandatory, when confronted with a female politician, to first and foremost discuss her clothes. Well, Australia&apos;s governor-general is wearing some and that&apos;s really all you need to know. As regards the issue to hand, she reckons Australia is both &quot;a new country and also an ancient land&quot; and that if Fifa were to give it the World Cup the whole of humanity could get a &quot;deeper appreciation of Australia&quot;, which would possibly be nice. The Aussies, in turn, would be happy to &quot;open their hearts and homes&quot; to us, which is decent of them. And, of course, they remind the esteemed voters that &quot;the Australian government has given Fifa every guarantee&quot; that is requires, so no tax for the lads.  Australia&apos;s presentation 1pm: The opening sequences suggests they&apos;re playing up the idea that to give the gig to Australia would be to truly break new ground. Lots of footage of kangaroos and billabongs and coral reefs and Ayers Rock and ... oh ... a man speaking through a very poor connection, meaning his words are inaudible. Ah, someone at Fifa has just turned the sound up ...  Something is actually happening 12:52pm: Blatter is at the podium, making some introductory remarks before ceding the platform to Australia, who will then make the official presentation of their bid to host the 2022 World Cup.  Football Idols 12:43pm: Tim Cahill has just been asked by Sky Sports News about Australia&apos;s chances of winning the nomination. &quot;It&apos;s in the hands of the gods,&quot; he shrugged. That is what Fifa&apos;s mandarins have become thanks to this absurd bidding process. No wonder they&apos;re milking the attention by holding this two-day Simon Cowell-esque shebang rather than simply announcing the winners with a functional press release.  Jet-boy Cameron 12:39pm: David Cameron has performed at PMQs today, having flown to Switzerland and back to Back The Bid. He will be jetting back again to Zurich later.  Owen Coyle for Arsenal? 12:29pm: Nothing to do with the World Cup obviously, nor even with Vladimir Putin&apos;s plans for the day, but intriguing nonetheless, no?  Russia to be given the cold shoulder? 12:18pm: It seems that Putin really won&apos;t be going to Zurich. What&apos;s more, it seems like he&apos;s getting in some pre-emptive excuses for Russia not winning the bid. For Reuters claims he won&apos;t attend today&apos;s swankfest because the Russian bid has had to &quot;contend with some unscrupulous behaviour&quot;. &quot;By whom?&quot; the world demands to know. &quot;And what now?&quot;, the world also demands to know. It&apos;s probably a reference to the alleged collusion between Spain and Qatar, about which the Russians grumbled yesterday.  Beckham charm-storm update 12:14pm: So far this morning the English lovely has sought to wow honest Issa Hayatou, Chuck Blazer, Jacques Anouma, Rafael Salguero and Mohamed Bin Hammam.  Putin watch 12:05pm: Owen Slot of the The Times tweets that &quot;Putin expected on Larry King Live on CNN tonight. More imperative than meeting Mr Blatter obviously.&quot; But couldn&apos;t he do both, what with all this new-fangled technology about?  Australia knows what time it is 11:55am: Those of you suggesting (rather oddly, in my opinion) that Australia are unlikely to get the 2022 nomination simply because of their time-zone need to consider &quot;the counter-argument to die for&quot;, as explained in today&apos;s Sydney Morning Herald. Fifa are likely to be particularly impressed by this point: &quot;Asia&apos;s GDP will double between 2005 and 2014 and that this will create massive commercial and sponsorship opportunities for major corporations ... India&apos;s and China&apos;s burgeoning middle classes will be four times larger than that of the United States by 2020 and ... there is a direct correlation between growth in a middle class and sponsorship, satellite TV subscriptions and purchasing power. By 2020 alone ... China will have a middle class of 700 million.&quot;  Breakfast of champions? 11.38am:According to PA&apos;s Martyn Ziegler &quot;Prince William has met four Fifa members in Zurich incl breakfast today with Nicolas Leoz, 1 of the 3 accused by Panorama of taking bribes.&quot; Does he actually eat at all these sittings?  It&apos;s not only Fifa fat cats who get to vote 11.25am: You too can be a decision-maker, albeit in a poll whose findings will have no bearing on anything other than some people&apos;s curiosity. Sold? Good. Now go here to declare whether you want England wo win the bid. Incidentally, someone has posted in an interesting article in the comments section below that - I don&apos;t know where it came from and can only hope it&apos;s genuine. It purports to explain that the the US House of Representatives has undermined the USA&apos;s bid to host the 2022 shindig by refusing to underwrite &quot;international sporting events, including the 2022 World Cup, until physical education programmes for children in public schools was fully funded&quot;. If that&apos;s true, sounds like the Americans have their pirorities right. Unlike the British government.       11.16am: Right, I&apos;m off, Paul Doyle is going to take over the hot seat, while I blog about some cricket.  2022: Who will win? 11.02am: The presentations for 2022 will begin at 1pm GMT. Here Grant Wahl of Sports Illustrated gives his verdicts on the bidders:  United States -- The 1994 World Cup host wouldn&apos;t need to build any new stadiums and says soccer could make a quantum leap in the world&apos;s biggest economy. Detractors point out that U.S. just hosted the World Cup 16 years ago. Odds: 4/5. Qatar - Upstart emirate has dropped millions on celebrity endorsements (Zin\u00e9dine Zidane) and promised to build air-conditioned stadiums and training sites. But tiny country the size of Connecticut promises logistical problems, and a recently released FIFA report says the overpowering heat poses &quot;a potential health risk for players, officials, the FIFA family and spectators.&quot; Odds: 9/4. Australia - Aussies have never hosted the World Cup and put on a successful 2000 Olympics in Sydney. But the time zone is bad for TV broadcasts in Europe and the Americas, and awarding the bid to any member of the Asian confederation (which includes Australia and the other non-U.S. bidders) would prevent FIFA favorite China from hosting the Cup until perhaps 2034. Odds: 5/2. South Korea - Longshot bid co-hosted &apos;02 Cup, but adds political angle by promising to include North Korean host city. Odds: 12/1. Japan - Longshot bid co-hosted 2002 World Cup, but proposing high-tech event. Odds: 20/1.   Putin latest      10.56am:BBC&apos;s James Pearce tweets: Vladimir Putin not on list of speakers announced by FIFA for Russian 2018 presentation tomorrow  Oceania won&apos;t get to vote 10.54am: The Oceania Football Confederation will not have a vote when Fifa&apos;s executive committee decides on the countries that will host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups because Reynald Temarii is appealing against his suspension.  The Question Beckham couldn&apos;t answer     So beautiful. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/POOL/PA Wire/PA    10.44am: &quot;Beckham floored by killer question: what is your beauty secret?&quot; tweets Owen Gibson  Some emails 10.36am: Andrew Sidford asks: &quot;Why is Spain and Portugal a joint bid? Surely Spain could host a WC on their own? European champions. World champions. Fantastic league with the best players in the world. Why didn&apos;t they just bid on their own?&quot; And then there is this curio from Rob Konway: Video: Is David Beckham related to East End anarchist Peter the Painter. Have a better look at Peter the Painter here. Doesn&apos;t look so much like Becks there.  How many votes will England 2018 get? 10.34am: Owen also reports on the difficulties of working out how many votes you will get:  An oft-heard maxim among those scrambling for the line in the final days of this scandal\u2013hit contest to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups is that you can trust only those who say they will not vote for you. And given that almost all the voters, bar obvious exceptions, are giving little away, uncertainty and paranoia reign in the bars, hotel lobbies and meeting rooms of Zurich. &quot;With the exception of one or two people who have said they&apos;re committed whether out of affinity to a person or a country, we&apos;ve not found people saying we cannot vote for you,&quot; the USA 2022 bid leader, Sunil Gulati, said. &quot;If everyone had the number of votes they thought they had there would be far more than 22.&quot; It is somehow emblematic of this opaque bidding race that only late last night came confirmation even on how many voters there will be, as Oceania accepted they could not replace the suspended Reynald Temarii with David Chung, leaving the decisions in the hands of 22 men.   The Three Lions 10.29am: Owen Gibson reports that 2018 chief executive, Andy Anson, has dubbed William, David and David the &quot;three lions&quot;.  Paul Hayward on England&apos;s three kings 10.16am: Paul Hayward asks this morning: &quot;Cameron, Beckham, Prince William - what could possibly go wrong now?&quot;  Tony Blair, urged by his culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, to support a London 2012 Olympic bid, asked her: &quot;Yes, but suppose we get beaten and, what&apos;s worse, we get beaten by the French and I end up humiliated?&quot; If the bookies are right, mortification stalks David Cameron here in Zurich. The prime minister zoomed in to woo the Fifa brotherhood with familiar Teflon bonhomie. Unlike Blair, a creature of more transparent calculation, Cameron looked undaunted by the political machinations engulfing England&apos;s wish to stage World Cup games in Plymouth, Bristol and Milton Keynes.   Beckham over, who next? 9.57am: No word yet whether we will get a David Cameron or Prince William press conference...  9.59am: So, that&apos;s it from David Beckham...  9.46am: Says he has not asked for an invitation to the Royal Wedding. But says he was brought up a traditionalist. &quot;A Royal Wedding will be a special time for our country.&quot; Asked if he will play in 2018, says he will be 43, but &quot;never say never&quot;. Says he will have a cappucinno with Capello when he sees him. &quot;I would love to bring the World Cup to England.&quot;  9.38am: Beckham says not underestimating Holland and Belgium bid. Says he will be seeing a few Ex-Co (Executive Committee) members in the hours before the bid presentations tomorrow. He declines to answer which other bidder is best. &quot;I&apos;m going to sit on the fence again. I am focussed on our bid.&quot; Says he has had a few messages from friends in Hollywood and East London.  9.37am: Beckham: Talking about 2022. USA is a very strong bid. Australia a great country renowned for &quot;passion and sport&quot;.  9.36am: Beckham: &quot;Having the future King of England behind this bid, along with the Prime Minister is huge.&quot; He says that William&apos;s engagement has come up a few times.  9.34am: Beckham: &quot;If and when we do get the World Cup in our country. There is no media like our media to get behind a big sporting event. Without a doubt, if we get this World Cup, the media will get right behind it.&quot; He says Spain/Portugal 2018 is a &quot;strong bid&quot;.  9.32am: Beckham: Jack Warner loves the Premiership and our country.  And then great change of direction when asked about whether Spain was main competitor now rather than Russia: &quot;We have to be worried by all the bidders. Actually, no we are not worried. We know that we&apos;ve got a great bid. We are confident of what we have done.&quot;  9.30am: Can minds be changed at this stage?&quot;Over the years, especially playing for Manchester United, have shown that the game goes right up until the last minute. I learned a lot from Sir Alex.&quot; (Not sure Fifa voting will include Fergie Time though)  9.28am: Beckham: Thinks that having Prince William and David Cameron in Zurich is important. He recalls Tony Blair&apos;s role in Singapore (for the 2012 Olympics bid). &quot;With the bid, we have done everything possible to put ourselves in the best position.&quot; All those years of football press conferences, and avoiding difficult questions with bland answers have paid off. Asked if Cameron being there and Putin not is an advantage: &quot;We are just focussing on our side of the bid.&quot;  David Beckham press conference 9.26am: Beckham says &quot;When you represent your country you do the best you can&quot;. Asked if he trusts 22-man Fifa committee not to go for revenge over media coverage &quot;I think we can trust every one of the members. At the end of the day they are football people and they want the best World Cup  Beckham up next 9.17am: England and LA Galaxy star David Beckham is due to give a press conference within the next few minutes. He is one of the &quot;stars&quot; supporting the England 2018 bid, alongside Prime Minister David Cameron and future monarch Prince William. Will he talk about Panorama? Will he talk about Fifa?

One day the former England captain decided he liked this world of schmoozing, top-table charm and carefully worked-out responses to awkward questions, such as, from a Swiss reporter here in Zurich: &quot;How do you keep your beauty?&quot; That was the only inquiry that threw the Los Angeles-based ambassador, who straightened his tie, took a sharp breath and marched into a packed media conference to declare himself &quot;a proud Englishman&quot; and promise a legacy for &quot;the whole world&quot;. Robertson and Lord Coe, veterans of political jab and parry, observed from the back. What did ambassador Beckham make of the Australia 2022 bid? Could he please share his thoughts on Japan&apos;s application for that tournament? And had Spain not filed an excellent case for staging the event he and England covet? These would be tough questions for anyone playing politics. From the WikiLeaks avalanche we see the chasm between publicly expressed diplomatic language and what is really said behind the scenes. In this overblown election, against a backdrop of alleged widespread corruption and with so much at stake for the dysfunctional English game, Beckham was obliged by the role he has taken on to avoid giving offence while stressing the endless virtues of England&apos;s bid. &quot;You&apos;ve got to remember this guy was born to do this,&quot; Coe said after Beckham had buttered up the room. &quot;He was born to do it on the football pitch. I saw it in Singapore [where London won the 2012 Olympic race, in 2005]. Why do you think we took him to Singapore? He didn&apos;t go to Singapore as an expensive calling card. He went because he&apos;s smart and does this really well. He instinctively knew how to play it. You don&apos;t need to tell David what to say.&quot; So what will Her Majesty&apos;s representative be saying to the inscrutable old men of the Fifa politburo? &quot;The importance of football in his life, the importance of football in his family, the way he came up through the game,&quot; Coe said. &quot;He&apos;s talking for millions and millions of kids. He came through a state-sponsored system. He learned his game in north-east London.&quot; Robertson said: &quot;I was amazed by how polished, professional, and informed he was. If you&apos;re used to doing it after England football matches I suppose you pick it up but he was incredibly polished. He dealt with the ridiculous questions about his make-up and the sensible ones about the football with equal ease. &quot;It&apos;s a great strength of England&apos;s bid that in the final stages you can turn out the prime minister for three days with a team of ministers behind him, a prominent member of the royal family and a footballer with the overall presence of David Beckham. No other bid has got that and people are noticing that.&quot; More objective observers will wonder whether the thrill of meeting LA Galaxy&apos;s No1 player is wearing off a bit by now. But Beckham is inescapable, and inexhaustible in his diplomatic studies. Fabio Capello, who will also be in town, retired him from the England team without warning, but naturally there is no bitterness on Beckham&apos;s side. If he sees the England coach, he said, they would probably have &quot;a cappuccino&quot;. Class. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 December 2010. The original referred to a Spanish reporter.

For all the attention on England&apos;s so-called &quot;three lions&quot;, the star of the show was arguably Eddie Afekafe, who opened the presentation by saying: &quot;Football changed my life.&quot; &quot;I grew up in one of the roughest parts of Manchester. Most of the guys I grew up with were in gangs \u2013 some still are, some are in prison,&quot; he said. &quot;What they didn&apos;t get but I got was an opportunity \u2013 and that was through football.&quot; As part of a slick and powerful pitch that Beckham offered in tribute to his late grandfather, who died a year ago today, David Cameron underlined the government&apos;s commitment to the bid. Prince William, who included a joke about his upcoming wedding, linked Afekafe&apos;s involvement in the Premier League&apos;s Kickz programme to 2018&apos;s pitch to create a legacy fund for football development around the world. &quot;What Eddie represents is a credit to Fifa, because it&apos;s your game that transformed his life. As exceptional as Eddie is, in 2018 Fifa has the opportunity to create more opportunities for people like Eddie the whole world over,&quot; said the prince. &quot;It is England&apos;s national game, a supremely powerful force for binding the country together. It&apos;s our passion. I love football, the English love football. That&apos;s why it would be such an honour to host the England 2018 World Cup.&quot; England&apos;s bid team will hope that the presentation can match the emotional punch of Lord Coe&apos;s final presentation in Singapore in 2005 that helped London over the line ahead of Paris. There was a stark contrast with the Spain-Portugal presentation, which amounted to a personal appeal from their executive committee member, Angel Mar\u00eda Villar Lllona, and included a pointed attack on the British media. &quot;Every club, from the highest Premier League club to the lowest village team, is backing this bid. I believe there are three groups of people we can really deliver for: for players, for fans and for Fifa,&quot; said Cameron, speaking without notes. &quot;Our dream is to stage a World Cup that is a spectacular tournament, benefits billions and makes you, your grandchildren and everyone in football truly proud.&quot; Three films were designed to highlight the themes outlined by Cameron. Focusing heavily on overseas Premier League stars including Didier Drogba, Fernando Torres and Michael Essien and managers including Sir Alex Ferguson, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Roberto Mancini, the bid chief executive Andy Anson unveiled a concept called &quot;Football Hosting Football&quot; that would see Premier League clubs hosting an international team. &quot;I&apos;ve played on every continent and everywhere I&apos;ve played, I&apos;ve seen the popularity of English football and I&apos;ve been proud to be part of the success of English football over the last 20 years,&quot; said Beckham, who referred to his trip to the World Cup draw in Cape Town a year ago in the wake of his grandad&apos;s death. &quot;A year ago today, he died. I was proud of him, as he was of me. Now I want to do something to make my grandchildren proud.&quot; Afekafe said: &quot;I&apos;m just one story. Choose England today and England will deliver many more stories like mine through Football United. It&apos;s a new idea, it&apos;s a big idea and it&apos;s one everyone supports \u2013 from the prime minister to the Football Association, from the Premier League to the players.&quot; The Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, praised England&apos;s &quot;excellent and remarkable presentation&quot;. It resulted in an avalanche of bets for England, who were immediately installed as favourites by bookmakers, despite the fact that the presentation in itself is unlikely to sway many voters. The lobbying effort continued late into last night, with Prince William, Cameron and Beckham between them meeting around 20 of the 22 Fifa executive committee members who will vote. Other members of the 30-strong delegation were deployed in the lobbying effort, including the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, the London mayor Boris Johnson, the England manager Fabio Capello and former captains such as Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer targeting individual exco members in the Baur au Lac lobby. It remains to be seen how much effect the high-profile lobbying effort, the subject of a veiled swipe from the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who also accused the British media of a smear campaign in the wake of investigations into Fifa corruption, and the impressive final presentation will have on the outcome. The hope is that it will have neutralised the lingering ill feeling against the England bid from the fallout from the Sunday Times investigation that led to the suspension of six senior Fifa officials and Monday&apos;s Panorama documentary, consolidated existing support and kept up the pressure on those who may back England as their second or third preference."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/dec/02/england-russia-win-2018-world-cup", "sentences": ["The presentation, overseen by the same marketing director who masterminded London&apos;s successful pitch to win the Olympics in Singapore in 2005, was designed to drive home those core themes."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-02T15:38:51Z", "title": "England beaten as Russia win 2018 World Cup bid", "tags": ["World Cup 2018", "Football", "Sport", "World Cup"], "article": "     Football will not be coming home in eight years&apos; time after it emerged England had crashed out in the first round of voting, securing just two votes, and Fifa instead awarded the tournament to Russia. Some members of a grim-faced England bid team, including the mayor of London Boris Johnson and former England captain Gary Lineker, retreated to the back of the hall as it emerged that England had been knocked out in the first round. England&apos;s representative on Fifa&apos;s executive committee, Geoff Thompson, counted for one vote, while Japan provided the other. A late final lobbying push led by the prime minister David Cameron, David Beckham and Prince William and a well-received final presentation was not enough to avoid a humiliating exit and spark huge recriminations. The final stages of the race have been marked by allegations of corruption and collusion that led to a backlash against the British media among some Fifa executives. The England bid team went into today&apos;s vote believing they had secured enough votes to make it through the first round and could see &quot;a path to victory&quot;. Instead, Russia - the long-time favourites backed by the Fifa president Sepp Blatter - won the race with their pitch to open up new markets. &quot;We can promise you a World Cup you will never forget. Let us make history together,&quot; said Vitaly Mutko, the Russian sports minister. But other contributory factors may have included the fact that England lack a dynamic political operator at the top level of the world game and the year lost at the beginning of the bid to internal infighting. The decision will come as a bitter blow to the Football Association, which has spent \u00a315m on the bid at a time when it is under financial pressure. &quot;We have had four bidders for 2018 and we can have only one winner. Three of the bidding associations must go home saying &apos;what a pity&apos;. But they must say football is not only by winning but football is also a school of life where you learn to lose. That&apos;s not easy,&quot; said Blatter, under pressure following a series of scandals. Immediately, there was speculation that Concacaf, the block of votes controlled by Jack Warner, may have switched his votes to Russia after hinting he would back England. This week&apos;s last-ditch lobbying effort marked the end of a rollercoaster campaign punctuated by bitter internal rows, boardroom upheaval, triumphant set pieces and corruption allegations. A Sunday Times investigation that led to the suspension of six senior Fifa officials, including two executive committee members, and a BBC Panorama documentary that implicated four more sparked a desperate damage limitation exercise from the England bid as they tried to contain a furious backlash from Fifa voters. Despite the impact of Monday&apos;s Panorama programme, which included fresh allegations against Jack Warner and the CAF president Issa Hayatou, both targeted by England, the bid team became more upbeat as the week wore on. England&apos;s compelling presentation this morning, in which a 27-year-old Manchester City community worker, Eddie Afekafe, arguably stole the thunder of the Cameron, Beckham and Prince William, condensed the pitch that England have been trying to sell for months amid the corruption and collusion claims. Aware that they could not offer to take the World Cup to new territories, they concentrated on the atmosphere and facilities of the English game, promised record profits for Fifa and attempted to articulate a vision for a global football development fund. The presentation, overseen by the same marketing director who masterminded London&apos;s successful pitch to win the Olympics in Singapore in 2005, was designed to drive home those core themes. 2018 Voting breakdown First round England 2, Holland/Belgium 4, Spain/Portugal 7 votes, Russia 9 votes Second round  Holland/Belgium 2, Spain/Portugal 7, Russia 13 Russia win"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/02/google-groupon-amazon-livingsocial", "sentences": ["Chicago-based Groupon bought uBuyiBuy, Beeconomic and Atlaspost to increase its reach in the Far Each; on Wednesday it also launched specialised services based in Honk Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-02T16:59:36Z", "title": "Amazon and Google eye voucher firm deals", "tags": ["E-commerce", "Technology startups", "Google", "Amazon.com", "Internet", "Technology", "Business", "Digital media", "Media business", "Media", "Daily deals", "Groupon"], "article": "Internet heavyweights Google and Amazon are reportedly moving closer to separately investing billions of dollars in the lucrative online voucher market.

But if those involved shake hands, both deals could be forestalled by antitrust investigations. Groupon, founded only in 2008, has more than 33m subscribers worldwide, while LivingSocial \u2013 No 2 in the online voucher market \u2013 has more than 10m. Both companies also offer UK-based deals.

The Chinese internet search behemoth Baidu launched its own Groupon-like voucher service yesterday. The product, which is part of its Youa e-commerce platform, was launched with little fanfare and limited offerings, suggesting it wanted to preempt any announcements from fellow international heavyweights. Amazon&apos;s reported $150m investment for a 7% stake in LivingSocial, meanwhile, would value it at about $1bn (\u00a3640m). According to the Wall Street Journal&apos;s All Things Digital, LivingSocial&apos;s revenue is poised to hit more than $500m (\u00a3320m) in 2011. Groupon sends its members \u2013 2.5m of whom are inside the UK \u2013 daily emails with about 200 discounts for goods and services, such as Abelli photo books. The deals are activated only when a minimum number of people agree to make a purchase, allowing Groupon to negotiate more lucrative group discounts on some products. Chris Muhr, UK and Ireland managing director of Groupon, told the Telegraph that the margins will only reduce as the market expands. &quot;It&apos;s a very high profit margin, especially for an online business,&quot; he said. &quot;In the long run you have to compare it with other forms of marketing. We are in that game. We are a marketing tool. &quot;Compare us with Google. You have to factor in the [search engine] optimisation work you have to undergo to benefit from [Google] Adwords, and if you do that we are very cheap. As the industry grows and ages the margins could come down.&quot; The news site Mashable, quoting sources familiar with the two companies&apos; advertising budgets, says LivingSocial and Groupon each spend more than $1m a month on advertising through Google. But this spend would presumably be wiped out for Groupon if it were to be enveloped inside Google, just as the cost of acquiring advertising for its video service YouTube is not broken out separately. &quot;The more Google acquires, the more antitrust issues they are opening themselves up to,&quot; a source said to be familiar with the situation told Reuters. &quot;That has to be considered.&quot; None of the companies would comment on the reports today."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/dec/02/cameron-pimping-world-cup-bid", "sentences": ["&quot;There was fierce debate over whether I should go to Singapore,&quot; Blair wrote about whether to get personally involved in London&apos;s Olympic bid."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-02T20:13:18Z", "title": "Cameron was 'pimping himself out' for World Cup bid, says Miliband aide", "tags": ["Ed Miliband", "Politics", "Twitter", "Media", "Internet", "Blogging", "Technology", "David Cameron", "Labour", "Conservatives", "World Cup 2018", "Football", "UK news", "World Cup"], "article": "An aide to Ed Miliband broke cross-party support for England&apos;s bid hours before the result was announced, accusing the prime minister of &quot;pimping himself out&quot; for his three-day Zurich push.

Cameron wouldn&apos;t deign to do anything as unseemly as publicly plead for something otherwise.&quot; She apologised soon afterwards. Cameron was given support across the board for the amount of effort put in by his government, continuing the work begun by Gordon Brown before him. Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, who speaks Japanese, went to Kuala Lumpur last week to lobby for the support of Junji Ogura, a Japanese Fifa delegate. Miliband wished Cameron luck on Wednesday in prime minister&apos;s questions, when Cameron broke off three days of football diplomacy in Zurich to return for the weekly Commons exchange. Cameron&apos;s meetings in Zurich included one with Jack Warner, one of those accused in the BBC Panorama documentary about the bid, who praised Cameron&apos;s knowledge of football after his meeting with the prime minister. As the news came through that Cameron&apos;s efforts had come to nothing, Miliband commented on Twitter: &quot;Really disappointed that England missed out on hosting World Cup 2018. It was a really great bid.

For all the false confidence engendered by the late lobbying push from Prince William, David Cameron and David Beckham and an inspirational presentation fronted by a 27-year-old Manchester City community worker, the desperately disappointing denouement was perhaps apt for a rollercoaster process that has continually endured more downs than ups. In the end, the analogy was not with Tony Blair&apos;s charismatic intervention in Singapore to win the Olympics for London but with Copenhagen last year, when the US president, Barack Obama, came to lobby for his home city of Chicago and rescue a troubled campaign but suffered a humiliating first\u2011round exit. Even before the campaign was launched at Wembley in April, England&apos;s bid team were battling against events. The bid was born against a backdrop of acrimony, with complaints about too many political appointees at the expense of &quot;football people&quot; and a divisive row with the Premier League. The former bid chairman Lord Triesman, against the backdrop of an incendiary but ultimately prescient speech about debt levels in the Premier League, was on a war footing with his top\u2011flight partners, who were considered the English game&apos;s biggest calling card abroad. That was eventually smoothed over by Andy Anson, the bid&apos;s chief executive, but perhaps more problematic was the fact that Geoff Thompson, criticised for his low\u2011key manner but England&apos;s only member of the executive committees at Fifa and Uefa, had been ostracised by Lord Triesman when he succeeded him as chairman of the Football Association. If set\u2011piece events being undermined by rows over ultimately petty matters was a recurring theme, so too was the presence of one man in the doomed narrative. Jack Warner \u2013 the Concacaf president who has held England&apos;s chances in his hands throughout the process and ultimately stabbed them in the back by taking his three votes to Russia \u2013 criticised the presence of a British National Party councillor at that Wembley launch. That autumn, England 2018 was caught in a storm when Warner cautioned that the &quot;lightweight&quot; bid was &quot;creeping along when it should be galloping&quot;. Another row at the Leaders in Football conference did not help. The sense of crisis deepened, with noises off all round and a constant drip, drip of damaging leaks as English football&apos;s parochial concerns were played out using the bid as a canvas. A year was essentially lost as the bid team, led by the capable Anson, struggled to construct a coherent message and instead were forced to deal with the fallout from internal rows. Led by advice from the board members Lord Coe and Sir Keith Mills, veterans of the London 2012 Olympics race, the board was successfully streamlined. Even that was not the end of the strife as the Premier League chairman, Sir Dave Richards, flounced out over a perceived slight and overshadowed the submission of the various bids from stadiums around the country. It was another key moment undermined. But Anson eventually successfully calmed the warring tribes and the recruitment of David Dein as international president appeared to signal a new determination to calibrate the fine margins required to navigate the apparently calm but ultimately cut-throat waters of international football politics. As the result ultimately proved, even Dein \u2013 a seasoned fixture on the world football circuit \u2013 was perhaps out of his depth. Anson insisted tonight that they were &quot;not naive&quot; but when it came to the crunch, as in the vote for the 2006 World Cup, England simply could not play the international politics. In April, there was the hammer blow of Triesman&apos;s resignation following a Mail on Sunday sting that still provokes fierce debate questioning its morality. Yet there are those on the bid who believe his departure galvanised the team and liberated it from some of the tensions that had dogged it from the start. England then appeared to enjoy a more successful period, as they repeated their trick from the World Cup draw in December and successfully parachuted Beckham and Princes William and Harry into Johannesburg to schmooze executive committee members before the tournament began. A well-received successful inspection visit followed in August, but if the result shows anything it highlights the extent to which those visits \u2013 the bid books, the technical reports that followed, the economic assessment and even the final presentations \u2013 were ultimately window dressing.All came second to deal-making and old prejudices. The three\u2011dimensional chess involved in constructing alliances and securing votes in a flawed parallel bidding process also worked against England. Anson admitted the \u00a33m spent on the bid book was ultimately &quot;wasted&quot; \u2013 money that could have been spent on grassroots football projects of the kind that Fifa is so keen to foster. Another factor in England&apos;s defeat were the so-called media &quot;smears&quot; that its rivals so successfully turned against it. Despite the Sunday Times investigation leading to six Fifa officials being suspended and the BBC&apos;s Panorama apparently implicating four more (including Warner), sending Fifa into a tailspin, a furious backlash coalesced against England&apos;s bid. In recent days, the bid team thought that the charm of a prince, a prime minister and former England captain had helped to placate them. They were wrong. A shell-shocked Anson paid tribute to his team but was candid in his belief that England would have to rethink its relationship with international football if it was ever to win the beauty parade. &quot;We don&apos;t have a [Michel] Platini and we don&apos;t have a [Franz] Beckenbauer, but we also don&apos;t integrate ourselves into the international community well,&quot; he said. &quot;That has been a problem all along. Geoff Thompson has done a good job and he is a solid guy but he is stuck out there in Fifa and Uefa on his own; he&apos;s not really integrated into the FA and the Premier League.&quot; What the past week and to an extent the past six months have done is largely insulate the bid team from criticism. The late lobbying effort has masked their earlier failings. The questions now will run deeper than whether England should have handed out carrier bags at a football conference and focus on the structural failings of English football and Fifa. As the shaken team looked for answers amid the wreckage of the failed bid, there was also a sense that Fifa&apos;s philosophy to take the World Cup to drive into new territories for commercial and philosophical reasons meant that they were always fighting an uphill battle. There was a lingering feeling throughout the race that with English football&apos;s riches and global reach, it just did not need Fifa&apos;s greatest prize and main cash cow enough. The backlash against the media gave those looking for an excuse not to back England the perfect opportunity. &quot;What was interesting was what the president said at the end about taking the World Cup to two new territories and, in Qatar&apos;s case, mentioning Arab countries. That was the driver. They have decided to take the World Cups to developing areas,&quot; said the Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, who belatedly came on board and backed the bid. &quot;What&apos;s gone against us is not having to build 20 new stadia. It almost feels as if we are on standby for when somebody can&apos;t host it. That&apos;s all very well but on that basis we will never get it.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/qantas-crew-praised-engine-failure", "sentences": ["&quot;The aircraft would not have arrived safely in Singapore without the focused and effective action of the flight crew,&quot; said Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.", "During an emergency landing in Singapore the autopilot system disengaged while the plane was still 1,000ft off the ground."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-03T18:32:13Z", "title": "Qantas crew praised over actions following mid-air engine explosion", "tags": ["Air transport", "Australia news", "World news", "Airline industry", "Business", "Rolls-Royce", "Asia Pacific", "Qantas"], "article": "The crew of the Qantas superjumbo whose Rolls-Royce engine exploded in mid-air last month have been praised for overcoming an almost overwhelming set of system failures to land the plane safely. The scale of the drama on board flight QF32 on 4 November was revealed for the first time today with the publication of an official investigation into the incident. Australian accident investigators said the A380 was left with only limited flight controls after one of its four Trent 900 engines ripped apart over Indonesia, five minutes after take-off. Hydraulic and electrical systems were damaged and fuel tanks were punctured. So many alarms were triggered that the crew had to fly a holding pattern for nearly an hour while they assessed the extent of the damage. &quot;The aircraft would not have arrived safely in Singapore without the focused and effective action of the flight crew,&quot; said Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. They were alerted to the extent of the damage by a Qantas pilot passenger, who saw fluid leaking from the wing. During an emergency landing in Singapore the autopilot system disengaged while the plane was still 1,000ft off the ground. The plane was 50 tonnes heavier than its top landing weight, because it could not risk shedding fuel, and the inflight computer had warned against applying maximum braking until the nose wheel was on the runway. This posed a serious danger that the plane would plough off the runway before stopping. Captain Richard de Crespigny completed the descent manually, throwing the jet into maximum reverse thrust to bring it to a halt \u2013 with 150 metres to spare, burning brake pads and four blown tyres. Even then, a second Trent 900 could not be closed down, so evacuation was delayed for an hour while fire crews fought the blaze. Dolan declined to say how close flight QF32 had come to crashing, but said when pieces of engine turbine rip into a wing &quot;consequences are very serious&quot;. ATSB said the explosion was probably caused by a crack in an incorrectly made oil stub pipe. Oil leaked within the engine and caught fire, causing a turbine disc to fly apart and send shrapnel slicing through a wing of the plane, and showering debris across Indonesia&apos;s Batam island. &quot;Essentially, it was a manufacturing defect, or potential manufacturing defect, in oil pipes in a number of Trent 900 series engines,&quot; said Dolan. Rolls-Royce said the report fitted with its own assessment. Last month it said the problem was caused by a single faulty part. It has already warned shareholders the Qantas incident will cut its profits for this year. The full bill remains uncertain though. On Thursday, Qantas filed a statement of claim against Rolls-Royce in an Australian federal court, paving the way to legal action if the two sides cannot agree a satisfactory settlement. The Australian airline has also claimed that engine-thrust restrictions imposed since the explosion mean it can only carry 80 passengers on flights between the US and Australia, instead of the usual 450."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/05/glencore-flotation-commodities", "sentences": ["The company has issued up to $2.2bn (\u00a31.4bn) in convertible bonds to investors in the US, Singapore and China."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-05T19:01:13Z", "title": "Commodities trader Glencore poised for \u00a330bn flotation", "tags": ["Commodities", "Business", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Stock markets"], "article": "Glencore, the world&apos;s biggest commodities trader, plans a flotation next year, although the company has yet to pick London for the listing, the Guardian has learned. Glencore, which could be valued at as much as \u00a330bn, is eyeing stock markets in Asia as an alternative to the London Stock Exchange, as investors favour the booming economies of China and India over moribund western markets. The company declined to comment but City chatter suggests a float may be on the cards. A partial flotation of the business, owned by more than 400 partners, would be aimed at raising cash for acquisitions. The Switzerland-based trader owns one third of UK miner Xstrata, raising speculation that a full bid for the business could be considered. Glencore&apos;s revenues have boomed over the past year as commodities such as gold or copper have rocketed, fuelled by strong demand from emerging markets. Investors have also flocked to metals such as gold, avoiding the volatile equity and credit markets in Europe and the US. The company has issued up to $2.2bn (\u00a31.4bn) in convertible bonds to investors in the US, Singapore and China. Revenues soared to $70bn in the first half, from $45bn last year, according to the company&apos;s latest accounts. Net profit rose to $1.5bn, from $1.0bn in 2009. The company was able to &quot;take advantage of the gradual recovery in the global economy and generally higher average commodity prices,&quot; it said this summer. Founded in 1974 by US trader Marc Rich, Glencore also owns and develops mining projects around the world, including oil exploration and development blocks in West Africa and a Gold mining operation in Kazakhstan. In 1983, former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, then a US prosecutor, indicted Rich for tax evasion who sought refuge in Switzerland. Rich was pardoned by president Bill Clinton in 2001. Initial public offerings (IPOs) and mergers and acquisitions are returning to the markets after two years of drought, caused by the global credit crunch. The last quarter of this year is on track to become the highest quarter on record for global public flotations (IPOs), according to Dealogic. At present, global IPO volumes stand at $99bn, via 289 deals, Dealogic said. Asia Pacific accounts for 60% of IPOs in the fourth quarter, including offerings from AIA Group or Petronas Chemicals. Morgan Stanley led the November global IPO manager ranking, with deals worth $5.4bn, followed by Goldman Sachs, which led 10 transactions worth $4.2bn, Dealogic reports."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/dec/06/formula-one-mark-webber-broken-shoulder", "sentences": ["The Australian sustained the injury after the Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-06T13:41:18Z", "title": "Mark Webber completed Formula One season with broken shoulder", "tags": ["Mark Webber", "Formula One", "Red Bull", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Mark Webber drove in the final four races of the Formula One season with a broken shoulder, the Red Bull driver has revealed in his new book.

The Australian sustained the injury after the Singapore grand prix. He had returned to Australia and was out riding with a friend, who fell off his bike in front of Webber, who went over his handlebars trying to avoid him. The fracture was so fine that it could not be treated. The incident was the second time in a little less than two years that Webber has suffered an injury while out training on a mountain bike. In November 2008 he was hit by a car while taking part in his own adventure challenge in Tasmania and suffered a fracture of his right leg as well as a broken shoulder.

It was good to see that Siegel recognizes that we&apos;ve invested a lot of time and effort in developing a world class water stewardship program to lead our operations around the globe. My team and I are focused intensely on doing the work that enables our global enterprise to manage water responsibly and sustainably. The Guardian asked me to share some of that work in my post for their new Sustainable Business Water Blog. Because of the nature of my job, I focused most of my comments on the work that my team and I lead. I appreciate Siegel&apos;s challenge to do even more to lend Coca-Cola&apos;s voice to raising awareness about the world&apos;s water challenges and the solutions that are already at hand if more of us are willing to embrace them. In fact, our water stewardship strategy, a direct output from our comprehensive and quantitative risk assessment, is four-fold: plant-level performance (which is largely focused on things like water use efficiency and wastewater treatment); watershed protection; community engagement; and increasing global awareness of the need for action and collaboration on water resource sustainability. Siegel seems to be particularly interested in the last element \u2013 our work to increase global awareness. Here are some examples of our efforts: Our chairman and CEO, Muhtar Kent, routinely speaks about water in his interviews with media and in his speeches to various audiences. This week he was in Canc\u00fan, where, in addition to lending his voice to the call for a fair and equitable global climate deal, he also talked about the important connections between climate change and water stress. Kent routinely works to build awareness of the need for better stewardship of water with a variety of audiences inside and outside our company. From a communications standpoint, we include information about our water stewardship efforts in multiple reports, including our Sustainability Review, our annual Replenish Report, our newly launched Product Water Footprint Report, and our annual WWF Partnership Review. Earlier this year we went a step further in transparency and awareness-raising by posting on our studies that seek to quantify the benefits of community safe water projects and watershed protection efforts, inviting readers to join in the debate to advance social and conservation science. We also participate in global and local forums like Stockholm World Water Week and Singapore International Water Week to bring our voice to water challenges and the role business must continue to play in being part of the solutions. Our global partnerships with WWF, USaid, UNDP and others provide robust opportunities to raise awareness about water and we work with our partners to communicate together about the importance of business working together with government and civil society to address the world&apos;s water challenges. While we don&apos;t (yet) have a global marketing campaign focused on water stewardship, I can tell you that we have certainly talked a lot about it inside our company. I look forward to sharing Siegel&apos;s opinion with my marketing colleagues.

Around 470,000 15-year-olds across the world sat a numeracy, literacy and science test last year, the results of which inform the latest Pisa study by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) is highly respected across the globe, and enables politicians and policy-makers to assess how different countries&apos; education systems compare. It shows the UK&apos;s reputation as one of the world&apos;s best for education is at risk, and has tumbled several places since 2006. The UK is ranked 25th for reading, 28th for maths and 16th for science. In 2006, when 57 countries were included in the study, it was placed 17th, 24th and 14th respectively. Poland has stretched ahead of the UK in maths, while Norway is now ranked higher in reading and maths. Andreas Shleicher, head of the Pisa programme, said the picture for the UK was &quot;stagnant at best&quot;. &quot;Many other countries have seen quite significant improvement,&quot; he added. The UK performs at about average in reading and maths for countries within the OECD. It is slightly above average in science. In reading, the UK&apos;s average score is 494, compared with an OECD average of 493. In maths, our score is 492 and in science 514. The OECD averages are 496 and 501 respectively. Countries and partnership economies outside the OECD are also included in the study. The highest performing region across all the tests is Shanghai-China, with a mean score of 556 \u2013 far higher than any other. The second highest scoring is Korea, with 539, with Finland coming third at 536. The UK government has made it clear it has been inspired by the Finnish education system in its proposed reforms of schools in England. The UK spends \u00a354,000 per student, while Germany and Hungary achieve a similar performance for \u00a340,000 and \u00a328,000, the study found. Only seven other OECD countries spend more per student than the UK. The UK spends an average sum on secondary school teachers, but our teachers work longer hours than the average across the OECD. The study found that in the UK, the gap between boys and girls was bigger in maths than it was for most other countries. Boys were 20 points ahead of girls. Within the UK, there is little difference in the performance of 15-year-olds who attend a school in a town or city and their peers who go to a school in the countryside. This is not the case in many countries, such as Hungary, where those living in rural areas are two years behind their urban peers. Students of Pakistani descent perform better in the UK than they do in many other countries, the researchers found, taking socio-economic factors into account. The UK has a greater variation in reading standards, which are attributed to class differences, than almost every other country in the OECD. The proportion of students from poor homes who achieve higher than expected scores is lower in the UK than across the OECD on average. Just 24% of UK students perform better than would be expected given their background. The OECD average is 31%. In Finland, Japan and China, 40% of students from poor homes exceed expectations. In reading, the UK score was similar to Hungary&apos;s but below that of Japan, the US, France and Germany \u2013 18% of UK teenagers did not reach the basic reading level, which is in line with the OECD average. In the UK, slightly higher than average proportions of students reach a very high level in science \u2013 1.9%, compared with an OECD average of 1.1%. The UK has the 14th highest share of students who were not born in the country, and is one of only a few countries where richer pupils have more teachers than poorer ones. Only in Israel, Slovenia, Turkey and the US is this also the case. Parental expectations are higher in the UK than in most OECD countries and our provision of after-school clubs is better. Michael Gove, the education secretary, said he was daunted &quot;by the scale of the challenge&quot;. &quot;Other countries have been improving rapidly and despite the massive investment over the last 13 years, we haven&apos;t been improving at the rate we should have been. We are not getting value for money and we&apos;ve got to ensure we do better.&quot; He said that other regions and nations had succeeded in &quot;closing the gap&quot;. &quot;They have made opportunity more equal, democratised access to knowledge and placed an uncompromised emphasis on higher standards all at the same time.&quot; Andy Burnham, Labour&apos;s shadow education secretary, said that English schools were better today than they were in the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;We should build on this strong foundation to keep driving up standards so they are on a par with the best in the world.&quot; Top countries in the Pisa study (Shanghai-China) Korea Finland Hong Kong-China Singapore Canada New Zealand Japan Australia Netherlands Belgium Norway Estonia Switzerland Poland Iceland United States Liechtenstein Sweden Germany Ireland France Chinese Taipei Denmark United Kingdom"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/dec/07/glaxo-china-miners-support-ftse", "sentences": ["Investec&apos;s Martin Deboo said a recent seminar in Singapore was used by Unilever to clarify its long term goals:  It&apos;s now clear that future growth is going to be led by household and personal care, and developing and emerging markets."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-07T18:02:42Z", "title": "Commodity companies fuel FTSE rise, while GlaxoSmithKline climbs on Chinese deal", "tags": ["Business", "GlaxoSmithKline", "African Barrick Gold", "Antofagasta", "Xstrata", "Wolseley", "J Sainsbury", "Tesco", "Kingfisher", "Icap", "Unilever", "Cobham", "IMI", "Hibu"], "article": "GlaxoSmithKline has expanded its presence in China with a $70m cash deal, but it suffered a setback in the US and also faced calls to hand back cash to its shareholders. In China the company is buying Nanjing MeiRui Pharma, a specialist in urology and allergy products, with the deal expected to be completed by the end of the year. But US regulators have delayed approval of Benlysta, the experimental lupus treatment Glaxo is developing in partnership with Human Genome. If it gets the green light - and the delay from December 9 to next March is to give the Food and Drug Administration time to study extra data - then it would be the first new lupus treatment in the US for 50 years. Panmure Gordon&apos;s US biotech analyst Brian Skorney said:  We believe that the agency&apos;s decision to extend the review time...indicates that any outstanding issues the FDA has with the filing are readily addressable. The majority of recent examples of...dates that were extended by 30 days have resulted in approval around the new ...date, giving us confidence that Benlysta will receive commercial clearance in the US at the end of the first quarter of 2011.  Meanwhile Credit Suisse raised its recommendation on the company from underperform to neutral, and lifted its price target from \u00a312.25 to \u00a313.10. But it believed there was little scope for real gains until Glaxo decided to return some of its cash pile. The bank said:  The operational outlook for Glaxo remains dull in 2011 with flat revenues and earnings. The medium-term outlook to 2012 is somewhat better (+1% sales) especially relative to key UK peer AstraZeneca (-3% sales).  Glaxo is entering a particularly cash generative period in its product lifecycle, delivering \u00a34bn-\u00a35bn annual free cash flow pre-dividends. Unfortunately management appears reticent about returning it to shareholders, preferring to keep it for potential acquisitions and legal liabilities. Recent Credit Suisse analysis demonstrates how mature companies with significant excess cash - like Glaxo - can underperform.  We believe that 2011 should be the year that management opt to return more to shareholders. We see little scope for outperformance until they do so.  Glaxo closed 5p better at \u00a312.42, while the rest of the market also moved higher. Despite some concerns about the Irish budget, markets took their cue from rising commodity prices. Demand for metals pushed copper and gold to new highs during the day, while President Obama&apos;s decision to extend existing tax breaks to help support the US economy in the short term has also been welcomed. On top of that, UK factory output reached a seven month high in October. So the FTSE 100 finished 38.17 points higher at 5808.45, a new three week high. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:  The markets remain content to rally despite the ongoing risks of further EU bailouts and possible rate rises in China. The underlying facts remain that stocks are still an attractive investment for a number of reasons. Firstly, companies are cash rich, certainly more so than any previous recovery from a recession and already we&apos;re seeing them look to spend that cash in the form of takeovers, share buy backs and dividend increases. Secondly, even if China does raise rates further and growth slows, which we are already seeing anyway, the economy will continue to grow rapidly. Thirdly, France and Germany will simply not allow the EU to be broken up and despite what they say about increasing the bailout fund, they will have to step up to the plate if needed.   Among the mining companies African Barrick Gold was the biggest riser in the leading index, up 34.5p at 600p. Antofagasta added 71p to \u00a315.28 while Xstrata rose 23.5p to 1460.5p as it announced plans to increase spending on new mines by around 50% to $6.8bn next year, and gave the go-ahead for the Ravensworth north coal mine in Australia. As part of an investor presentation the company said total spending on new mines would reach $23bn over the next six years. But that would not rule out &quot;opportunistic M&amp;A where we can extract value,&quot; according to chief executive Mick Davis. Charles Kernot of Evolution Securities issued a neutral recommendation on the business, saying:  Xstrata is continuing its change from an acquisitive powerhouse to an organic growth generator. Xstrata is pushing forwards with significant capital expenditure to pursue growth projects around the world. This represents a mixture of expansions and new developments. Associated with all of the positive and upbeat comments the group has also announced a decision to write down the carrying value of the Araguaia nickel project in Brazil. This will see a $440m impairment charge at the year-end, reflecting the project&apos;s position further along the development time-line.   Wolseley was 50p better at \u00a318.80 after a positive trading update from the building materials group. Retailers were in focus, with J Sainsbury up 15.3p at 372.8p following revived rumours of a Qatari bid, with a price of 450p a share mentioned. However traders said this tale seems to do the rounds every six months or so. Sainsbury also benefited from better than expected results from rival Tesco, up 10p at 430p. Meanwhile Kingfisher climbed 4.9p to 259p after Bernstein raised its price target for the B&amp;Q owner from 280p to 290p. Supergroup edged up 2p to \u00a315.83 despite Execution Noble starting coverage of the fashion company with a sell rating and a \u00a311.65 target. The broker said:  We have set our estimates at the higher end of consensus for 2011 and 2012 in the belief that sales growth momentum will be sustained by new store openings. Despite this, our detailed sensitivity and scenario analysis suggests that the shares are overvalued.  SuperGroup may well defy the sceptics. However, our analysis suggests that the current share price is factoring in flawless execution into the medium term and none of the risks associated with a rapidly evolving young fashion brand.  Elsewhere Icap, the interdealer broker, topped the FTSE 100 fallers, down 9p at 519p after founder and chief executive Michael Spencer&apos;s private company IPGL sold \u00a330.7m worth of shares in the firm, cutting his stake to just over 16%. The 6m shares were placed with a range of institutions by HSBC at 512p each. Most of the proceeds will be used to meet obligations under a renewed loan for IPGL, which owns spread betting business City Index, from HSBC. Spencer previously sold a chunk of shares in January this year, which was followed a few weeks later by a profit warning from Icap. At the time the company emphasised all procedures relating to Spencer&apos;s share sale had been followed correctly. Intertek lost 18p to \u00a319.71 after Deutsche Bank began coverage of the testing equipment business with a hold rating and \u00a319.27 price target, saying there would be a better time to buy. But Unilever was up 53p at \u00a319.06 after positive notes from Morgan Stanley and Investec. Morgan Stanley moved from underweight to overweight with a \u00a323 price target, saying:  We double upgrade Unilever to overweight as we see the risk/reward profile for the shares as more attractive now than at any point in the past three years. We think the likelihood of Unilever delivering more consistent 4%-6% sales growth and steady, mix-driven (not restructuring) margin improvement has improved considerably thanks to: (i) a renewed focus on the global and higher margin categories in which Unilever&apos;s emerging market footprint can be leveraged, (ii) potential for further portfolio changes in developed markets, (iii) tightening of management control procedures. If Unilever can execute on the model we see emerging, we think the shares have substantial potential to re-rate from currently 13.5-14.0 times to 15.5-16.0 times [earnings].  Investec&apos;s Martin Deboo said a recent seminar in Singapore was used by Unilever to clarify its long term goals:  It&apos;s now clear that future growth is going to be led by household and personal care, and developing and emerging markets. We welcome the direction and intent to make sharper choices. But the plan is fundamentally expansionist and investors are again being asked to remain patient. We keep choose to keep faith, but reduce our valuation expectations [from \u00a323 to \u00a322] in line with reduced forecasts.  The latest quarterly review of the UK indices, based on tonight&apos;s closing prices, showed Cobham, up 1.4p at 195.9p, in line to drop out of the FTSE 100, replaced by IMI, up 34p at 948p. Newly floated Betfair, up 62p to \u00a312.62, is one of those set to join the FTSE 250, while Yell, down 0.02p to 12.10p, moves in the opposite direction. The moves will be ratified at a FTSE committee meeting tomorrow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/dec/07/renault-nelson-piquet-jr-crashgate", "sentences": ["The World Motor Sport Council of the FIA last year found Renault, the team principal Flavio Briatore and the director of engineering Pat Symonds guilty of ordering Piquet Jr to drive into a wall on lap 14 of the 2008 Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-07T21:08:04Z", "title": "Renault apologise to Nelson Piquet and son over 'Crashgate' claims", "tags": ["Renault", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One"], "article": "The Renault Formula One team today apologised in the high court to Nelson Piquet and his son, Nelson Jr, over unfounded claims, made at the height of the &quot;Crashgate&quot; affair, that the pair had made up allegations against the team. Renault also paid a six-figure sum in costs and libel damages. Today, the lawyer acting for the Piquet family accused Renault of treating them &quot;appallingly&quot; and said Piquet Jr had been &quot;abused terribly&quot; during his short career in Formula One. The World Motor Sport Council of the FIA last year found Renault, the team principal Flavio Briatore and the director of engineering Pat Symonds guilty of ordering Piquet Jr to drive into a wall on lap 14 of the 2008 Singapore grand prix. In a press release issued in September 2009, and widely reported at the time, Renault accused Nelson Jr and his father of concocting the allegation that the driver had caused a deliberate accident in order to benefit his team-mate, Fernando Alonso. Today, the Piquets&apos; counsel, David Sherborne, told Mr Justice Eady: &quot;The defendant&apos;s press release also suggested that the claimants had not only lied in making these allegations but that they had deliberately invented them in order to blackmail the defendant into allowing Mr Piquet Jr to drive for the team for the remainder of the 2009 season, and they were therefore guilty of a serious criminal offence.&quot; Renault accepted that the allegations &quot;were wholly untrue and unfounded&quot; and withdrew them &quot;unequivocally&quot;. Following the reading of the apology in open court, Dominic Crossley of Collyer Bristow LLP, acting for the Piquets, said it marked &quot;the start rather than the end of the long journey they are both taking to correct many of the wrongs that took place during last year&apos;s Crashgate scandal&quot;. He added: &quot;They were both treated appallingly by Renault F1 when they dared to reveal the scandal to the governing body and Nelsinho was abused terribly throughout his absurdly short career in F1. It is to the immense credit of both of my clients that they refused to be deterred from righting the wrongs despite the ferocity of the attacks and the size of the opponents they have had to confront.&quot; After the FIA ruling in September 2009 that effectively banned Briatore from the sport for life, which was later overturned by a French court, Piquet accused the Italian of having &quot;driven me to the lowest point I had ever reached in my life&quot;. Meanwhile, iIt emerged today that the Formula One commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, has appointed David Campbell, the chief executive of AEG Europe who oversaw the transformation of the Millennium Dome into the hugely successfully O2 Arena, to run the sponsorship and commercial operations arm of Formula One. It was reported that Campbell would become managing director of Allsport Management, the commercial subsidiary of the Formula One Holdings empire that is owned by venture capital firm CVC and run by Ecclestone. Campbell is expected to take up the position in the first quarter of next year, making him a strong contender to succeed Ecclestone in controlling the sport. Campbell has overseen AEG&apos;s joint bid with Tottenham Hotspur to take control of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford after the 2012 Games. Their controversial plan would involve ripping out the track and providing an athletics legacy elsewhere, arguing that it would be the only way to deliver a commercially sustainable stadium.

Reasons 1.4 (b/d). 1. (C) Summary: China has made great efforts to improve the situation in Burma, stretching the boundaries of its policy of non-interference, MFA and Chinese think tank interlocutors told HFAC and SFRC staff members January 10-11. MFA says China is contemplating next steps to address the current &quot;standstill&quot; in Burma, but Chinese scholars said domestic events and other international issues will draw China&apos;s attention away from Burma. MFA officials and the scholars continue to encourage direct talks between the United States and the Burmese regime. End summary. 2. (SBU) MFA Asia Department Counselor Yang Jian and Ministry of State Security-affiliated China Institutes for Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) Asia scholars Zhai Kun and Zhang Xuegang met HFAC professional staff members Eric Richardson and Dennis Halpin and SFRC professional staff member Frank Januzzi on January 10-11. &quot;Bold Measures&quot; Necessary to Prevent Further Turmoil --------------------------------------------- ------- 3. (C) Counselor Yang Jian told the HFAC and SFRC staff members January 11 that China would like to see the Burmese Government take &quot;bold measures&quot; to improve the livelihood of the Burmese people and achieve national reconciliation through dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and democracy supporters as well as ethnic minority groups. Counselor Yang stated that the Chinese accept the Burmese regime&apos;s so-called &quot;roadmap&quot; to democracy as the best route to democracy and national reconciliation in Burma. CICIR scholar Zhai said the Burmese government exerts control over society only on the surface and the potential for &quot;lots of trouble&quot; persists. Zhai said the regime&apos;s inept handling of the economy costs it legitimacy. Even if the Burmese generals and Aung San Suu Kyi undertook a healthy dialogue, economic problems could throw the country into turmoil. Encouraging Signs but Current Standstill ---------------------------------------- 4. (C) Yang said despite the potential for further trouble, the Chinese government is encouraged by a number of developments since the disturbances in August and September, including the visits of UN Special Advisor Ibrahim Gambari, the appointment of Labor Minister Aung Kyi (who Yang believes is &quot;close to the core&quot; of the Burmese regime) as a liaison with Aung San Suu Kyi, and the release of detainees. Yang said that during VFM Wang Yi&apos;s November 2007 visit to Burma (reftel), Wang shared with senior Burmese leaders China&apos;s analysis, again suggesting more attention to the livelihood of the Burmese people, dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi, and more interaction with ASEAN. Yang said that, based on the regime&apos;s positive language about the dialogue, China had been optimistic it would succeed. In light of the current &quot;standstill&quot; in Burma, however, China is thinking about what other steps now to take with the regime. China&apos;s &quot;Extraordinary&quot; Efforts ------------------------------- 5. (C) Yang recounted China&apos;s efforts to improve the situation in Burma. She said that after China and Russia in January 2007 vetoed a UN Security Council resolution condemning Burma, State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan traveled to Burma in February to hold &quot;extraordinary&quot; discussions with the regime&apos;s senior leaders. Tang suggested that Senior General Than Shwe and other Burmese leaders improve Burma&apos;s domestic and international situation. Yang said lower level Burmese officials, hesitant to approach senior leaders with critical advice, were pleased with China&apos;s approach to Than Shwe. 6. (C) Scholars Zhai Kun and Zhang Xuegang January 10 separately echoed the view that China is making great efforts to influence Burma positively while adhering to its policy of non-interference. Zhai said China has delivered indirect but clear signals to Asian countries and the United States on the need for greater openness in Burma. Zhai highlighted Premier Wen Jiabao&apos;s November 19 speech at the National University of Singapore. (Note: Wen&apos;s speech included the following: &quot;Only an open and inclusive nation can be strong and BEIJING 00000125 002 OF 003 prosperous; cutting off contacts with the outside world can make a country backward.&quot;) Direct U.S.-Burma Dialogue -------------------------- 7. (C) During the Wang Yi visit, Burmese leaders expressed interest in more discussions with the United States. Noting that USG officials have suggested Burmese officials contact our Embassy in Rangoon, Yang said Burma preferred the format of the June 2007 talks in Beijing. China views the June meetings between the Burmese delegation and State Department officials as a &quot;bilateral confidence building measure,&quot; Yang said. Continued Support for Gambari ----------------------------- 8. (C) Yang said China will continue to support UN Special Advisor Gambari&apos;s mission, though she noted that the Burmese Government is unhappy with Gambari because Burmese leaders believe they followed Gambari&apos;s suggestions during his first visit but then received only further opprobrium. Yang said Burmese leaders are unhappy about the UN &quot;Group of Friends&quot; on Burma. While China is open to multilateral means to address the situation in Burma, China believes Burma&apos;s acceptance of these means is the key to success. For example, China would like ASEAN to play a more constructive role, Yang said, but ASEAN is divided over how to address Burma. Older ASEAN member countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, favor a hard-line approach. Newer ASEAN members, such as Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, support a more moderate stance towards Burma. No Sanctions ------------ 9. (C) MFA&apos;s Yang reiterated that China remains opposed to additional sanctions, which she said will not spur further dialogue, but instead make the regime look further inward and give it an excuse for hard-line polices. Despite China&apos;s opposition to sanctions, Yang stressed that the United States and China have similar goals for Burma, including stability, democracy and development. Therefore, China and the United States should show unity, particularly in the UN, in addressing the situation in Burma. CICIR scholar Zhai said that because China foremost values stability in Burma, China does not wish to see a sudden change in the Burmese regime. In that light, China fears the pressure of more sanctions may only bring further civil unrest. China&apos;s attention drawn away from Burma --------------------------------------- 10. (C) CICIR&apos;s Zhai said China would like to see ASEAN play a larger role on Burma partly because domestic events in China, including the National People&apos;s Congress in March and the Olympics in August, are increasingly consuming China&apos;s attention. Zhai said recent protests in Vietnam over the South China Sea and the turmoil in Pakistan have also drawn China&apos;s and international attention away from Burma. Including democracy supporters slows down roadmap --------------------------------------------- ---- 11. (C) Zhai said that including the democratic opposition and ethnic groups in the so-called roadmap to democracy at this stage would slow down the process, yet Zhai asserted that &quot;if Senior General Than Shwe is rational,&quot; he will include the democratic opposition to increase the legitimacy of the current regime. USG should assure safe future for Burmese generals --------------------------------------------- ----- 12. (C) CICIR&apos;s Zhang said that the United States should &quot;play two hands&quot; with the Burmese Government. Zhang said the United States has been sufficiently critical of the regime and now should send messages, via China if necessary, to reassure Burmese military leaders that their personal security would not be imperiled in a democratic transition. Zhang said that guaranteeing the safe future of the current military leadership is the key to &quot;unlocking the deadlock.&quot; 13.

Monroe for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) . ------- Summary ------- 1. (C) Crown Prince Shaikh Salman Al Khalifa told visiting Marine Corps Commandant General Conway April 5 that the &quot;tide needs to be turned&quot; in Iraq, and the Iraqi security forces need to find those perpetrating the violence to stop them. He advised coalition troop level reductions in urban areas and movements to outlying areas as soon as possible, with the exception of Baghdad, to force Iraqi forces to step up and handle the security situation. He admitted violence might rise for several months but would then settle down. The CP advocated for Iraq a strong civilian government backed by the military, similar to Turkey. Regarding Iran, Shaikh Salman expressed concern about Iran&apos;s continued support for extremist groups around the world, including attempts to build networks in Bahrain, which Bahraini security works to disrupt. Commenting on the release of the 15 British sailors, the CP said that Iran had benefited disproportionately in terms of public relations over the incident. Recently back from a trip to Singapore, the CP said that officials there are concerned about the Islamic threat and youth in the community who might cause trouble. End summary. -------------------------- Tide Needs Turning in Iraq -------------------------- 2. (C) On an April 5 visit, Commandant of the Marine Corps General James Conway met with Crown Prince Shaikh Salman Bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who said that he had been watching the situation in Iraq closely, especially the activities of Commander of the Multinational Force in Iraq General David Petraeus. He commended General Petraeus for his clear commitment to the mission in Iraq, including his &quot;Marhaba, shabab&quot; (Hello, youth) statement. The &quot;tide needs to be turned,&quot; the CP said, and security forces need to find those responsible for the violence and stop them. General Conway said that there has been incremental progress, including with some Sunni tribes in Anbar province, some of whom are turning away from Al Qaida in Iraq (AQI) because of its brutal tactics and abuse of some Sunni tribal leaders. 3. (C) Regarding U.S. troop levels in Iraq, the CP advised reducing troop levels as soon as possible in urban areas, with the exception of Baghdad, and moving the troops to outlying areas. He stressed the importance of keeping the borders secure, but counseled to let Iraqis begin to sort out the security situation. Admittedly there will be a rise in violence between people who want to &quot;settle scores,&quot; but after six months the situation will calm down. The Iraqi military needs to take over more responsibility, and it will grow to fill its role. Similarly Iraqi leaders need to increase their initiative and leadership over its people, demonstrating a sense of common purpose. When asked by General Conway whether he had expressed these ideas to U.S. Defense Secretary Gates, the CP said that he had and that Secretary Gates had listened carefully. The CP said that he SIPDIS had experienced difficulty previously trying to convince U.S. policy-makers who still believed Iraq could be a model of democracy in the region, but Secretary Gates had not dismissed his ideas. Shaikh Salman said, &quot;Iraq will not be a model of democracy, at least not in the next 10-15 years.&quot; 4. (C) The CP said that Iraq needs a strong federal government with 18 provinces. Splitting the country into three areas by sects is the wrong thing to do, because the country will eventually fall apart. He said Iraq needs a strong civilian government backed by the military, referring to Turkey as a model. He also said that total de-Baathification was the wrong approach, but that there needed to be efforts to root out militia members from the security forces. Shaikh Salman stated that Prime Minister Al Maliki may not be the right leader for the job in the long run, &quot;but he is the guy for now. It was unrealistic to expect that merely a single election cycle could take Iraq from Saddam to stability.&quot; The CP offered Bahrain&apos;s support in any way it could assist. ------------------ Concern About Iran ------------------ 5. (C) Shaikh Salman expressed his concern about domestic MANAMA 00000336 002 OF 002 problems in Iran, including the poor state of the economy, which increases desperation, and the corresponding danger, of the Iranian government. He said he was worried about a nuclear-armed Iran, as it would likely spark a nuclear arms race in the Gulf. The CP focused on Iran&apos;s consistent activity around the world spreading violence and unrest, including Iran&apos;s support of Hizbullah, Hamas, militias in Iraq, and extremists in Indonesia. Iran is also trying to build networks in Bahrain, so the Bahraini security services are working diligently to contain and disrupt their activities. Iran&apos;s policies to spread the revolution have nothing to do with being Shia, but everything to do with its Persian identity. The Iranians want to project their Persian identity across the entire Gulf. The CP noted that coverage of the release of the 15 British sailors and marines showed messages about the &quot;Persian Gulf&quot; prominently placed on signs in the background. 6. (C) The CP wondered aloud how the 15 British allowed themselves to be caught and why the British decided against immediate action. He surmised that they must have been too far from their support ship. General Conway added that the British seek to de-escalate tension in such incidents. The CP quipped that sometimes there is a need for quick, strong escalation (to send a message). He commented that Iran has benefited disproportionately from the incident in terms of public relations. The CP also said that he assumed the release of Jalal Sharafi, the Iranian official who had been abducted in Iraq, was connected to the release of the British sailors, mentioning that Iran has always used hostage-taking to their benefit. -------------------- Success in Singapore -------------------- 7. (C) When asked by the Ambassador about his recent trip to Singapore, the CP said that it was a productive visit. Bahrain is in a similar position in terms of development and economic growth that Singapore was in 20 years ago. Even though Singapore is not close to the Middle East, the CP said that officials he talked with were concerned about the Islamic threat. Singaporeans live with Muslims, and officials fear the ways extremist messages affect their youth. He had been told there are approximately 2,000 hardened, completely convinced &quot;psychopaths,&quot; who have the potential to cause serious problems in Singapore. The CP said these extremists need to be handled like a cult and stopped at their source. He said that extremist groups often cut off their recruits from their families and friends to break their support network. Consequently, officials in Singapore encourage parents and other family members to be heavily involved in their youths&apos; lives to be more in touch with their activities and prevent their mixing with extremists. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama&apos;s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/manama/ ********************************************* ******** MONROE"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/dec/11/job-hunting-cv-x-factor", "sentences": ["In October, Standard Chartered bank launched a competition called &quot;The World&apos;s Coolest Intern&quot; for its six-month internship in Singapore, with a \u00a314,500 salary."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-11T00:01:28Z", "title": "Job hunting: forget a CV, you need the X Factor", "tags": ["Job hunting", "Work & careers", "Money", "Guardian Careers", "CVs"], "article": "There were only hours before the deadline, but Ry Morgan, 22, was still desperately trying to fulfil the first task: a four-minute video presentation about one of his passions. He&apos;d chosen basketball, and was setting up his Mac to make PowerPoint slides so precisely timed to his presentation he could choreograph a routine that made it look like his waving hands were flicking up images. Next, Morgan, who was then studying management at St Andrews, borrowed one of the university&apos;s biggest lecture theatres, positioned his Mac in front of the big screen and recorded his video presentation. &quot;I did everything possible to make sure I stood out,&quot; he says. He sent it off to be judged and learned his work had paid off: he was through to the next round \u2013 a grilling by a panel of interviewers. Discovering that he was to be the first on the list, Morgan was so worried about being forgotten by the end of the day, he made stickers with his name on and stuck them on walls at the nearby tube station in a bid to subliminally influence the interviewers&apos; minds. It sounds like the experience of any reality TV wannabe, but Morgan&apos;s epic experience had nothing to do with seeking Z-list fame: it was just an application for a 10-week internship at an advertising agency \u2013 and it&apos;s part of a growing trend. Applying for a job used to involve spotting a newspaper ad, sending off a form with a spell-checked CV, dry-cleaning a suit and turning up for an interview. A big corporate might insist on a few rounds of interrogation, but you&apos;d know what to expect. No longer. The new way to recruit is to think like Simon Cowell, or do an Lord Sugar: turn a job interview into a reality TV-style set of tasks, ask for poems, songs, presentations or videos, and even encourage voting for the &quot;winner&quot;. Take &quot;The Eventice&quot;, a competition for final-year event management students with the &quot;prize&quot; (that&apos;s a quote from the organiser) being a job at exhibition centre ExCeL London. The whittling-down process might sound familiar. &quot;Those selected will be split into groups and given a brief to create an event. They will then come to London to present their ideas and take part in a number of challenging event management tasks which will be marked by industry experts over an entire weekend,&quot; runs the spiel. That&apos;s after applicants have already sent in a video of themselves answering questions such as &quot;Why should I be part of The Eventice?&quot;, which are uploaded on the web for anyone to watch. The Apprentice inspired The Eventice, says Jeremy King, editor of Event magazine, which is running the competition alongside recruitment consultancies and ExCeL. &quot;We wanted to tap into youths&apos; use of the internet in a bid to attract the highest number of candidates, to ensure up-and-coming talent is brought into the industry,&quot; he says. When I wonder whether candidates might become exhausted (as well as not having time to apply for other positions during the long assessment period), King counters that the process &quot;provides a realistic introduction into what actually happens in the event world and how it works. It&apos;s a tough industry to work in and even tougher to be a success.&quot; However, Tanya de Grunwald, founder of careers site Graduate Fog , thinks such tasks compel applicants to leave their dignity at the door. &quot;Employers are stupid to make applicants audition like reality TV show contestants,&quot; she says. &quot;It isn&apos;t the way to get the best out of people, and the last man standing isn&apos;t necessarily the best person for the job. &quot;Fantastic candidates will often drop out because they&apos;ll be working full-time while they job hunt and simply don&apos;t have time to complete a 20-page application form, especially if they&apos;re applying to lots of other jobs as well,&quot; she adds. &quot;At such an early stage in the recruitment process, I just don&apos;t think it&apos;s reasonable to ask for that kind of time investment.&quot; Morgan, whose basketball presentation did eventually nab him the advertising internship, thinks there are some benefits to companies taking a creative approach to recruitment. &quot;It worked for me. I like talking, and the video played to my strengths, and gives you the opportunity to show who you are,&quot; he says. &quot;That wouldn&apos;t have happened through online tests, which would just leave me as a score in a list. Although these kind of job interviews do take up a lot of time, the firm gets a sense of you as an individual. &quot;But I definitely don&apos;t think the trend for Apprentice-style tasks is good for everyone. The role I was going for, a junior account executive, didn&apos;t need you to be able to make flashy presentations or have the character to make it on camera, but that was required for the interview. People who might be good at a particular job, but don&apos;t like standing up in front of an audience, or aren&apos;t technologically confident, could get lost in the fray.&quot; That issue is becoming more important as hordes of firms jump aboard the trend for the reality TV-inspired makeover of recruitment. Take Red Letter Days, the gift experience company owned by Dragons&apos; Den entrepreneurs Peter Jones and Theo Paphitis. The company used to hire recruitment consultants or buy newspaper ads to fill jobs. This autumn, however, it put out a &quot;virtual casting call&quot; to find the &quot;dream&quot; candidate for a three-month paid internship. Applicants were asked to upload a video via the firm&apos;s YouTube channel, or send a letter or something else creative outlining why they wanted the post. Patrick McAleenan, Red Letter Days&apos; head of marketing, admits the post itself attracted publicity for the company, but adds: &quot;We wanted to tap into where graduates are talking, researching and sharing \u2013 online.&quot; The successful candidate, Alana Hutton-Shaw, 22, who graduated in English and drama from Cambridge this summer, opted to write a rhyming poem about a character called Fred to secure her place. &quot;When I heard about the internship I knew I had to make my application stand out, so I wrote a poem about Fred, this little guy who disappeared to be replaced by me,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ve got used to having to be imaginative for job applications; for another one, in advertising, I invented a cartoon worm. I think you&apos;ve got be willing to push the boundaries to get yourself noticed. &quot;In an ideal world you&apos;d print off a CV and that&apos;s it, but now companies want to see if you have &apos;the X Factor&apos;, as everyone&apos;s calling it. There&apos;s a fair amount of jumping through hoops. But since the job market is so tough I think we&apos;ve just got used to it.&quot; Even the blue-chips are getting involved in wacky recruitment. In October, Standard Chartered bank launched a competition called &quot;The World&apos;s Coolest Intern&quot; for its six-month internship in Singapore, with a \u00a314,500 salary. Entrants were &quot;audited&quot; according to how many people linked to their blogs, their &quot;Twitter influence&quot; and Facebook friends. The top 10 \u2013 out of 1,194 applications from more than 40 countries \u2013 were then granted video interviews. A spokesman said the bank avoided a traditional interview process because much of the job involved social media and &quot;we believe a stellar academic record would not necessarily indicate success in the future&quot;. A similar tack was taken by L&apos;Or\u00e9al, which this year recruited graduates via a virtual business game called Reveal. Applicants were given avatars as employees in &quot;a virtual L&apos;Or\u00e9al world&quot; and faced online tasks. The best were invited to its real offices for more business &quot;games&quot;. Isabelle Minneci, human resources director at L&apos;Or\u00e9al UK and Ireland, says: &quot;Adding realistic challenges to our recruitment process helps us to engage with students who will thrive in an environment like ours.&quot; That&apos;s also the view of Michael Rebelo, managing director of advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, perhaps one of the most demanding recruiters around. This year the company began filtering its graduate applicants by asking them to set up a Facebook group and encourage people to sign up. The top group amassed more than 237,000 members, but high-scoring candidates still faced another three months of assessments, including online tests, Skype interviews and creating video remakes of their favourite ads: someone baked a Skoda car cake, another recreated the Visa World Cup ad, shot by shot, in Lego. &quot;Those who made it through the rounds came in for further face-to-face challenges, with 10 making it on to the six-week scholarship programme,&quot; says Rebelo, who says the process proves whether candidates have &quot;the work ethic to survive in our industry&quot;. But Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters, warns recruiters may be going too far. &quot;In the graduate marketplace there is scope for using technology in attraction and selection processes \u2013 Generation Y are comfortable with it,&quot; he says. &quot;But employers should always ask themselves, is what we are doing appropriate, relevant and fair? There&apos;s nothing wrong with the traditional interview and there never has been. &quot;Businesses should also remember that the candidate experience should be positive even if they are unsuccessful. Someone who has a bad experience is likely to share it with their peers and this can damage the employer brand.&quot; That&apos;s been the experience of Guy Wakely, 34, a project manager. &quot;Earlier this year I turned down an interview for a role at an IT services company because of the company actually called the application process the &apos;X Factor&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;They wanted me to attend a full day at their offices, with interviews with HR, online testing, presentations, and more interviews. I&apos;m not a performing puppy.&quot; De Grunwald agrees: &quot;Employers say making applicants take part in this sort of lengthy talent show is necessary because they can&apos;t pick the best candidates otherwise. This is pure laziness. It&apos;s their job to spot potential, so why aren&apos;t they prepared to put more effort in and do what they&apos;re paid to do? A really good A&amp;R person can spot potential in a busker. Why can&apos;t recruiters do the same?&quot; Up close and personal Another recruitment trend cribbed from reality TV is the rise of Simon Cowell-style interviewer, who uses personal jibes and nasty criticism to grill candidates. Ranting Teacher, a thirtysomething anonymous blogger, went for an interview as head of department of a school last year. She revised her crib notes on questions like &quot;Why do you want this job?&quot; and &quot;What are your strengths and weaknesses?&quot; and was duly quizzed by a panel of sixth formers, but discovered that &quot;the headteacher obviously had an urge not to be running a school but to be Cowell, gloating with power and about to eliminate one or more of us&quot;.&quot; Around lunchtime, the head asked the candidates to line up and publicly told some \u2013 including the blogger \u2013 to go home. &quot;I didn&apos;t get the job, but was surprised to be told without any chance to set out my stall in the formal interview,&quot; she says. &quot;And nothing quite prepares you for the awkwardness of being told, in front of everyone else, that you are not worthy.

Snow Fairy, trained by Dunlop, ridden by Ryan Moore and looked after devotedly by Hanna, who rides the filly every day, had just landed the Hong Kong Cup, biggest of the four Cathay Pacific Hong Kong International Races at smog-shrouded Sha Tin, earlier today. But Hanna was right to be weeping, and Dunlop was quick to acknowledge that the credit for a sensational win went to his whole staff. As the filly&apos;s groom, Hanna has been a key figure in the horse&apos;s rapid rise to international racing fame. A year ago, Snow Fairy was little more than one for the notebook, with a single win \u2013 a humble Lingfield race \u2013 from six outings as a two-year-old. It was only when the daughter of Intikhab won impressively at Goodwood in May that her horizons were expanded, though at the time no one could have guessed just how far they would widen. Supplemented for the Oaks, she won that Classic and followed up with an eight-length victory in the Irish equivalent. After honourable defeats in the Yorkshire Oaks and St Leger, she went to Japan to land the hugely valuable Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup in Kyoto. With a first prize of over \u00a3900,000, the 10-furlong Hong Kong Cup is worth almost half as much again as the Japanese race, yet such has been the upward curve of Snow Fairy&apos;s achievements over the last few months that she went off hot favourite. Halfway round the home turn she was apparently going nowhere, but somehow Moore \u2013 who four days ago won the international jockeys&apos; tournament at Hong Kong&apos;s other racecourse, Happy Valley \u2013 conjured from her an astonishing late run, reaching the front a hundred yards out and holding on to beat Irian a neck, with Packing Winner third and last year&apos;s hero, Vision D&apos;Etat, fourth. The other two British challengers, Sri Putra and Glass Harmonium, both finished well in arrears. Churls convinced that the famously taciturn winning jockey would absent himself from the post-race interview podium were well wide of the mark. An almost chirpy Moore, who in addition to Snow Fairy has this year won the Derby and Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe on Workforce, waxed lyrical: &quot;She&apos;s very special \u2013 an absolute machine.&quot; Dunlop, who enjoyed major international success with another great filly, Ouija Board, confirmed that Snow Fairy \u2013 the winner this year of four Group 1 races in four countries \u2013 remains in training. &quot;She&apos;s not the biggest filly in the world,&quot; he said, &quot;but she&apos;s got the biggest heart in the world.&quot; First blood in the Cathay Pacific International Races had, in formal terms, gone to the United Arab Emirates. But it felt like a Newmarket victory, with Godolphin&apos;s 2009 St Leger winner, Mastery, racing home under Frankie Dettori to beat the Barry Hills-trained Redwood by 2\u00bd lengths, with the Melbourne Cup winner Americain third. The curious post-race choreography of Hong Kong racing allowed Dettori the rare chance of a double flying dismount, but the other British runners, the James Given-trained Indian Days and Michael Stoute&apos;s filly Crystal Capella, were both well back in the ruck. The trainer Saeed bin Suroor said that Mastery would continue to race in 2011, with the Sheema Classic in Dubai a probable early target. The prospect of Mastery and Snow Fairy facing each other in the desert, and then in races like the Coronation Cup and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, is one to warm followers of Flat racing through the winter. The Stoute stable fared better in the Sprint, with Kingsgate Native netting nearly \u00a323,000 for finishing sixth behind JJ The Jet Plane. A familiar sight in all the top British sprints in 2009 before returning to his native South Africa, JJ The Jet Plane is the first winner of the Cathay Pacific Sprint since 2001 to be trained outside Hong Kong. In a thrilling finish, he beat the Singapore sprinting phenomenon Rocket Man by a short head, with Sacred Kingdom, on whom the Hong Kong racing public dotes without reservation, three-quarters of a length back in third. The only local victory of the afternoon came via Beauty Flash, winner of the Mile, in which the Richard Hannon-trained Paco Boy \u2013 who started favourite after Able One was withdrawn at the start, on veterinary grounds \u2013 proved a bitter disappointment by finishing last, one place behind Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s 2009 Dewhurst Stakes winner, Beethoven. The Andrew Balding-trained Dream Eater finished a never-nearer eighth. With runners from 11 countries, the 2010 Cathay Pacific Hong Kong International Races was once again a glorious extravaganza of global racing. There was no doubt about the performance of the day: Snow Fairy, who provided a moment well worth crying over."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/dec/13/hope-climate-change-agenda", "sentences": ["When the trees are cut and peatlands drained, the carbon accumulated over millennia is exposed and oxidised \u2013 often in the form of fires that envelope neighboring Singapore and Malaysia in smoke."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-13T17:34:14Z", "title": "Grounds for hope for the climate change agenda | George Soros", "tags": ["Canc\u00fan climate change conference 2010 | COP16", "Climate change", "Global climate talks", "Environment"], "article": "The official communique from the Canc\u00fan climate change conference cannot disguise the fact that there will be no successor to the Kyoto protocol when it expires at the end of 2012. Japan, among others, has withdrawn its support for efforts simply to extend the Kyoto treaty. This sounds like bad news, because it means that there will be no international price on carbon, and, without a market price, it is difficult to see how the reduction of carbon emissions can be efficiently organised. But appearances can be deceiving. Even as the top-down approach to tackling climate change is breaking down, a new bottom-up approach is emerging. It holds out better prospects for success than the cumbersome United Nations negotiations. Instead of a single price for carbon, this bottom-up approach is likely to produce a multiplicity of prices for carbon emissions. This is more appropriate to the task of reducing carbon emissions than a single price, because there is a multiplicity of sectors and methods, each of which produces a different cost curve. The market price of anything is always equal to the marginal cost. When there is a single price, all the various cost curves are merged into one and low-cost projects enjoy large rents. This makes the cost of reducing carbon emissions much larger than it needs to be. This was amply demonstrated by the working of the Kyoto protocol in practice. The carbon-trading scheme that it established gave rise to many abuses. For example, formerly communist countries earned emission credits at zero cost on the heavy industries that they had to shut down and reaped windfall profits by selling them. So the demise of the Kyoto protocol will be no great loss. The same applies to the protracted negotiations between developed and developing nations. The developed nations promised to pay reparations for their past sins at the Rio de Janeiro summit in 1992 but kept deferring their obligations by negotiating. Meanwhile, conditions changed with the passage of time: China, following decades of booming growth, replaced the United States as the largest emitter. The negotiations have taken on an increasingly unreal air. The dispute revolves around how governments will deliver $100bn annually by 2020 to help developing countries confront climate change, given that even the $10bn fasttrack fund cannot be cobbled together without using smoke and mirrors. By failing to make any progress beyond keeping the talks alive, the Canc\u00fan summit has given the impression that nothing is happening, and that the situation is hopeless. That is not the case. Individual countries such as Germany are making binding unilateral commitments that are not conditional on what other countries do, and &quot;coalitions of the willing&quot; are being formed to tackle particular sectors. The Redd partnership (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), an effort to create financial value for the carbon stored in forests, is the prime example here. Indeed, the greatest progress is now being made where the problem is the most urgent: it is much easier to preserve forests than to restore them. The case of Indonesia deserves special attention. Indonesia has become the third largest polluter in the world, after China and the US, because much of its forest grows on peatlands. When the trees are cut and peatlands drained, the carbon accumulated over millennia is exposed and oxidised \u2013 often in the form of fires that envelope neighboring Singapore and Malaysia in smoke. Today, half of Indonesia&apos;s peatlands remain intact; if they were exposed, emissions would double. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is determined to prevent this, and he has received financial support for his efforts from Norway. Their partnership has already been joined by Australia, and others will soon follow. The partnership is path-breaking in several ways. Yudhoyono is introducing a moratorium on the exploitation of peatlands and virgin forests. A Redd agency will be charged with treating rainforests as a natural resource that is to be preserved and restored rather than exploited and destroyed. This will also transform governance and the delivery of official development assistance (ODA). The Redd agency will have a domestic governing board that will coordinate the activities of all the governmental units concerned with rain forests, and an international board that will authorise and monitor the spending of ODA funds. This means that ODA will support homegrown institutions instead of administering projects introduced from the outside. These efforts can serve as a prototype for assisting other countries such as Guyana, where the current forest-preservation scheme does not work so well. Eventually, it should lead to the establishment of a global fund for rainforests and agricultural adaptation because the benefits of carbon abatement accrue to humanity as a whole, not to individual countries. The global fund would introduce two prices: one for carbon saving by restoring forests and one for avoiding carbon emissions by preserving them. This in turn sets an example for other sectors. In this way, carbon pricing will be introduced and international cooperation established from the bottom up, on a sectoral basis rooted in demonstrated results. Thus, despite the widespread impression that the climate-change agenda has stalled, there are grounds for hope. But realising that hope requires keeping pace with global warming, and that means speeding up the process of putting a price \u2013 or prices \u2013 on carbon emissions. \u2022 George Soros is chairman of Soros Fund Management and of the Open Society Institute.

Six months before the world financial crisis reached its peak, forcing taxpayers to rescue collapsing financial institutions, King told US officials in London that the UK, US, Switzerland and Japan could jointly enable a multibillion-pound cash injection into global banks, overriding the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; G7 nations. The leak may allow King to claim that he \u2013 rather than Gordon Brown \u2013 was one of the brains behind the bailout of the banks, which took place in October 2008. According to the cable, King told Robert Tuttle, the US ambassador to Britain, and the treasury deputy secretary Robert Kimitt, who was visiting London, that there needed to be a &quot;coordinated effort to possibly recapitalise the global banking system&quot; as well as a way to rid the banks of the toxic loans on their balance sheets. The ambassador said in the cable, dated March 2008, that King&apos;s proposals &quot;were not casual ideas developed in the course of a luncheon conversation. It was clear that his principal objective in the meeting was to outline his outside-the-box thinking for Kimmitt. King suggested that the US, UK, Switzerland and perhaps Japan might form a temporary new group to jointly develop an effort to bring together sources of capital to recapitalise all major banks.&quot; The grouping of the four nations would have been in addition to the 35-year-old G7, which comprises the finance directors of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. King appeared concerned that the G7 did not include cash-rich China, Singapore and countries in the Middle East that might have been tapped for a global bank bailout. King said the G7 was &quot;almost dysfunctional on an economic level&quot; as key economies were not included. &quot;It could be a temporary group and he suggested that perhaps the central banks and finance ministers of the US, the UK and Switzerland could coordinate discussions with other countries that have large pools of capital, including sovereign wealth funds, about recycling dollars to recapitalise banks,&quot; the cable went on. &quot;King said Japan might not be included because it has little to offer. King noted though that including the Japanese might force their hand in finally marking to market impaired assets.&quot; King had spelt out to the US officials that he was certain the UK&apos;s banks would need fresh cash. &quot;He [King] said is it hard to look at the big four UK banks (Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds TSB) and not think they need more capital. A coordinated effort among central banks and finance ministers may be needed to develop a plan to recapitalise the banking system.&quot; It seems likely that the banks identified in the cable were provided as examples for Washington rather than named by the governor. Shortly after the meeting between King and the US officials, leading UK banks began trying to shore up their balance sheets by launching cash calls on their shareholders. RBS stunned the markets in April 2008 by preparing the ground for a \u00a312bn rights issue. HBOS, later rescued by Lloyds, tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to raise \u00a34bn from its shareholders, while Bradford &amp; Bingley, later part-nationalised, also tried to raise fresh funds. By October, RBS, Lloyds and HBOS had all been bailed out by the taxpayer, while Barclays raised funds from Middle Eastern investors and managed to avoid taking a direct injection of funds from taxpayers. HSBC launched a \u00a312.5bn cash call in March 2009 and also avoided any government bailout. King appeared before the Treasury select committee later in March 2008 and warned MPs that the financial crisis had &quot;moved into a new different phase&quot;. At the 28 March committee session, the governor raised his concerns about the need for fresh capital. He told the committee that the right response to the crisis was to &quot;think very, very deeply about the causes of this crisis and whether levels of bank capital and the sort of financial system that generated this crisis does not require some action&quot;. &quot;I would not be opposed to a process in which the banks would find more capital, I think most central banks would regard that as a very desirable development,&quot; King told the MPs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/governments-sustainability-entrepreneurs-innovators", "sentences": ["For me, 2011 begins with a rapid-fire trip from Hong Kong to Riyadh, via Beijing and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-14T10:30:57Z", "title": "Governments will follow entrepreneurs and innovators on sustainability | John Elkington", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business"], "article": "The chaos resulting from Britain&apos;s recent snow spell reminded me of those little Christmas snow globes that you used to hold in your hand and shake to send miniature blizzards swirling around the buildings and figures within. 2011 looks like being another of those swirling years, where the process of economic inversion begun by the Great Recession continues to play merry havoc with business (and government) as usual.  I agree with Tony Juniper that 2011 could be the worst year for environmentalists since 1993, but that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m pessimistic. Indeed, when we published our report The Phoenix Economy early in 2009, the central argument was that we needed - and would likely get - a prolonged period of economic disruption. And we needed that in order for the good old Schumpeterian processes of creative destruction to work their painful magic.  The problem is that when the economic dust settles, we will be in a very different world - and not necessarily the one that most environmentalists hoped to be in. Powerful tectonic forces are at work in the global economy, with a seemingly inexorable shift to Asia under way - with huge implications for the nature and scale of our collective environmental footprint. For me, 2011 begins with a rapid-fire trip from Hong Kong to Riyadh, via Beijing and Singapore. The focus of the Saudi Arabian summit will be on global competitiveness, with sustainability and environmental challenges now squarely on the agenda. But as we head towards 2012, with the 25th anniversary of the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future, the 20th anniversary of the Rio Earth Summit and the (sustainability-themed) London Olympics, are we in danger of ending up - as the Americans would say - &quot;breathing our own exhaust fumes&quot;? The WikiLeaks saga has revealed the realpolitik behind the public declarations of governments on issues like climate change. And the recent global survey of over 750 CEOs by Accenture for the UN Global Compact, titled A New Era of Sustainability, raises painful questions. While it&apos;s great news that 93% of CEOs say they understand sustainability&apos;s importance to their businesses - and significant numbers say they have already embedded the agenda in their organisations - you have to wonder whether most of them have any idea of the profound, transformative change that true sustainability will require of virtually every part of our global economy. One danger of the Rio+20 event, apart from the question whether leading politicians will turn up and engage, is that the focus will be on incremental steps at a time when we need disruptive, discontinuous change. But there are hopeful signs in the midst of the 24/7 media blizzard, including growing signs that innovators, entrepreneurs and leading edge investors are losing patience with governments and are aiming to go their own way.  One of the most interesting recent examples has been the Carbon War Room&apos;s new initiative to radically shrink the carbon footprint of the world shipping industry. This is one of 25 sectors the Carbon War Room aims to go after and is just one of the innovative initiatives driven by Sir Richard Branson, who was also behind the Gigaton Awards for carbon-footprint-shrinkage, launched in December at the Canc\u00fan climate conference. To tackle such challenges at the necessary scale, we will need engaged, coherent, courageous and sustained government action. Not much chance of that on environment in 2011, I agree with Tony, but I am hopeful that the year will see growing evidence of a new wave of innovators, entrepreneurs and investors pushing the envelope of possibility.  In parallel, I hope in the coming years to see an accelerating shift in the focus of our various movements from the work of heroic individuals and leading companies to the orchestration of &apos;multi-sector ecosystems&apos; of actors that collectively drive the evolution of Silicon-Valley-like clusters of sustainability-related technologies and skills. As their world slowly turns upside down, we can only hope that growing numbers of governments will follow Napoleon&apos;s line, when, if memory serves, he said something like: &quot;Leadership?

The games were awarded to London after a closely contested vote that saw both Tony Blair then French president Jacques Chirac fly to Singapore in July 2005 to make their case to delegates. A confidential cable dated 17 February 2006 from the US ambassador to Paris concerning a recent meeting with Royal said she had suggested, he wrote, a need &quot;to find France&apos;s place in the world&quot; with the French government showing less arrogance in how it speaks to the world. The latter factor, she suggested, had played a role in the defeat of France&apos;s 2012 Olympics candidacy, he wrote.  Royal, who has recently announced that she would like to stand again as the Socialist candidate in the upcoming 2012 French presidential elections was meeting Craig Stapleton, US ambassador to France, before the 2007 polls, which she lost to Nicolas Sarkozy from the centre-right UMP. Her criticisms of French government conduct were made to a backdrop of a deep malaise affecting the country, as it experienced political instability, high unemployment and having also lost the contest to host the 2008 Olympics to Beijing. Reports at the time said Chirac had said of the British bid: &quot;We can&apos;t trust people who have such bad food. After Finland, it&apos;s the country with the worst food.&quot; Jason Rodrigues \u2022 @Abracarioca asked for anything on Roman Polanski from the Bern or Paris embassies A secret October 2009 cable from Bern written, by the US ambassador Donald Beyer, reports that the September 2009 arrest of the director at Zurich airport on charges of fleeing sentencing for unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles was viewed by the Swiss foreign minister, MichelineCalmy-Rey, &quot;as putting a dent in Switzerland&apos;s international image&quot;, the ambassador to Bern wrote. He added: &quot;Nevertheless, she has limited her criticism to remarking that the arrest lacked &apos;finesse&apos;, and surely is aware that Swiss public opinion favours Polanski&apos;s extradition to the United States.&quot; A Swiss court refused the extradition request in July 2010. The Polanksi case also crops up in a classified cable sent in February 2010 from the US embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan, where US ambassador Richard Hoagland reports on a meeting between Richard Holbrooke, the US&apos;s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the Kazakh foreign minister, Kanat Saudabayev. When Holbrooke raised the imprisonment of human rights activist Yevgeniy Zhovtis, Saudabayev said that the &quot;only legitimate way out&quot; for Zhovtis would be via presidential pardon, Hoagland wrote. &quot;Attempting to draw a parallel, Saudabayev added that he admired the &apos;persistence&apos; of the US judicial system in its persistent attempts to get film director Roman Polanski, &quot;even though he was forgiven by the victim,&quot; he wrote, adding: &quot;Holbrooke took strong exception, noting that Polanski fled justice, escaped the law, and has been living free despite his conviction by a US court.&quot; Ben Quinn  \u2022 A user asked for mention of the Thai royals in connection with the 2006 coup The Queen of Thailand encouraged the 2006 ousting of former prime minister and Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra, US dispatches from October 2008 allege. Queen Sirikit was indirectly &quot;responsible for the 2006 coup d&apos;etat&quot;, according to Samak Sundaravej, one of Thaksin&apos;s successors as prime minister from January to September 2008, according to US diplomats. Samak also claimed, the cable writers add, that Sirikit had a hand in the &quot;ongoing turmoil generated by PAD protests&quot;, a reference to the mass protests by the royalist People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy which have contributed to the downfall of several Thaksin-associated governments since 2006. Sirikit is the wife of King Bhumibol, the world&apos;s longest-serving current monarch. As a member of the royal family she is in theory expected to be politically neutral. The cable appears to add to rumours of the scale of Sirikit&apos;s political involvement. While the queen had long been suspected of favouring the PAD, the only significant evidence of her support came when she attended the October 2008 funeral of a PAD protestor, Angkhana Radappanyawut. Samak alleged the queen &quot;operated through privy council president Prem Tinsulanonda who, along with others presenting themselves as royalists, worked with the PAD and other agitators&quot;, according to a report by US ambassador Eric John, within a cable from October 2008. There is no mention in the cables of any coup involvement by King Bhumibol himself. But an earlier dispatch written in the week following the coup states Bhumibol called the leaders of the coup to his palace for a meeting the evening after Thaksin was ousted and was &quot;happy, smiling throughout&quot;. A subsequent cable also claims Bhumibol explicitly ordered Anuphong Paochinda, commander-in-chief of the Thai armed forces, not to launch a coup in November 2008 against the then prime minister Somchai Wongsawat. Bhumibol also expressed irritation at PAD protests, the cable alleges.  Further reports on Thailand from the leaked cables will be published by the Guardian later in the week. Patrick Kingsley \u2022 @WallyHoest asked for Geert Wilders Geert Wilders is a far-right Dutch MP most notorious for his 2008 anti-Qur&apos;an film, Fitna \u2013 which juxtaposed verses from the Qur&apos;an besides images of the 9/11 attacks. One cable reveals that the Dutch government had been discussing strategies for what to do if one of its citizens carried out such a provocative act &quot;since the Danish cartoon crisis&quot; of 2005, a foreign ministry official told US diplomats. A security committee had been meeting &quot;intensively&quot; since October 2007, when the Dutch government first learned of Wilders&apos;s plans.  Violence was feared against Dutch interests abroad, and contingency plans were made for disorder in the Netherlands&apos; four largest cities, though the same official said it was thought &quot;Wilders fatigue&quot; might blunt reactions at home. He said the justice, foreign and interior ministers had met with Wilders to caution him against the film, but the Dutch government believed it &quot;critical to avoid the appearance [it] would try to censor the film&quot;.  There was no date for the release of Fitna but in the run-up to it being put on a video-sharing website in March 2008, the US embassy in The Hague sent the state department updates on when the film might emerge. In January 2008, the state department sent an advisory marked as &quot;secret&quot; to all consular and diplomatic posts warning of anti-Dutch demonstrations and the possibility the film could &quot;generate anti-European/anti-western protests&quot;. It gave the diplomatic and consular posts a pre-cleared message to issue to US citizens in the event of demonstrations. Wilders was evidently of some interest to US diplomats. His first mentions in the cables come after he was expelled from the centre-right VVD in 2004 and speculate that he might use the EU constitution referendum to build a political base. A later briefing on Dutch politics for Barack Obama notes Wilders&apos;s new Freedom party was the Netherlands&apos;s fastest growing and describes him as &quot;no friend of the US&quot;, especially in his opposition to Dutch military involvement in Afghanistan. It says the &quot;golden-pompadoured, maverick parliamentarian Geert Wilders, anti-Islam, nationalist Freedom party remains a thorn in the coalition&apos;s side, capitalising on the social stresses resulting from the failure to fully integrate almost a million Dutch Muslims.&quot; Simon Jeffery \u2022 @robertotail asked for Omar Khadr The Canadian government said its Washington-backed decision not to seek the repatriation of Guant\u00e1namo detainee Omar Khadr, (15 when US forces captured him in Afghanistan) made it &quot;politically impossible&quot; for the country to take in the Uighur former detainees the US was unable to return to China. The cables show strong US interest in Canadian reaction to Khadr&apos;s case \u2013 Ottawa&apos;s appeal against a court ruling that would force it to ask for Khadr&apos;s repatriation is well documented, and the director of Canada&apos;s intelligence agency is reported expressing his belief that the release of DVD footage of Khadr&apos;s interrogation, in which he is shown crying, would lead to &quot;knee-jerk anti-Americanism&quot; and &quot;paroxysms of moral outrage, a Canadian specialty&quot;.

Although a large number leave their homes in the developing world in search of work in industrialised countries, there is still significant movement between emerging economies, and from one part of the developed world to another.

Spain is a relative newcomer, having only become a big destination for immigration in the past 20 years, with a peak in 2002-07. Immigrants now account for 14% of the population. But in terms of the share of the total population these countries have fallen far behind the Gulf states, where immigrants sometimes outnumber the natives, as in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Europe has also been overtaken by Australia and Canada, where 21% of the population are immigrants. Lastly, the proportion of immigrants is particularly high in countries with an attractive tax system, such as Monaco (72%), Singapore (41%), or to a lesser extent Luxembourg (35%) and Switzerland (23%). So where do the migrants come from? The answers here are less precise, &quot;arrivals being more accurately registered than departures&quot;. Mexico ranks as the top source country (10\u00a0million migrants) with many of its citizens resident in the US. India is close behind (9 million), followed by Bangladesh (6.5 million). But as a percentage of total population the smaller countries rank highly for emigration. A third of the population of the Cape Verde islands live abroad. The same is true of Bosnia, with almost as many (27%) having left Albania. The UK stands out: in 2000, it had almost as many emigrants (4.2\u00a0million) as immigrants (4.9 million). In contrast, France is one of the countries with the smallest number of expatriates. Finally a word of caution: the national perspective underpinning the Ined study fails to reveal the full picture regarding migration. For example, proportionally only a very few Chinese move abroad (0.1%), but huge numbers of people have migrated from one province to another in recent years.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said with fixed costs remaining constant, improved passenger numbers and revenues have gone straight to the bottom line for the world&apos;s airlines. IATA had forecast profits of $8.9bn for the 2010 financial year back in September. &quot;Our profit projections increased for both 2010 and 2011 based on an exceptionally strong third quarter performance. But despite higher profit projections, we still see the recovery pausing next year after a strong post-recession rebound. And the two-speed nature of the recovery is unchanged, with European airlines continuing to underperform other regions,&quot; said Giovanni Bisignani, IATA&apos;s director general and chief executive. The global airline industry last made a profit in 2007, before the global downturn pushed many airlines into heavy losses. The five largest airlines in the world by market capitalisation are now based in Asia and South America, Bisignani said. The largest airline in the world is now Air China, worth $20bn at today&apos;s prices, followed by Singapore Airlines at $14bn, Cathay Pacific at $12bn, China Southern at $11bn, LATAM (the Latin American airline recently created from the merger of Chile&apos;s LAN and TAM of Brazil) at $11bn, and then Delta and Lufthansa at $10bn each. European carriers will make $400m profit in 2010, but that will probably shrink to $100m in 2011, IATA added. Any strengthening of European airlines comes from long-haul operations that take advantage of robust growth in other regions, the body said. IATA also revised its outlook for 2011, predicting a net industry profit of $9.1bn, up from the $5.3bn forecast in September. But it also warns that airlines still face tight margins, expected to be 2.7% in 2010 and 1.5% in 2011. &quot;The industry is fragile and balancing on a knife edge. Any shock could stunt the recovery, as we are seeing with the results of new or increased taxation on airlines and travellers in Europe,&quot; said Bisignani. A further blow came today when the trade union representing cabin crew at British Airways said it would ballot members next week over fresh strikes in a dispute that has cost the airline \u00a3150m. The ballot will begin on 21 December and end on 21 January, Unite said. The dispute, which began last year over proposed cuts to pay and staffing levels, now centres on five issues including the removal of travel concessions from crew members who took part in earlier strikes. &quot;BA must get serious and work with us to settle the issues before us,&quot; said Unite joint general secretary Tony Woodley. &quot;Industrial action would be a grossly disproportionate response to the issues that Unite continues to press,&quot; the airline said.

The\u00a0decision by Brian Lenihan to refuse to hand over any more cash to the stricken Allied Irish Banks if it pays out \u20ac40m in bonuses to 2,400 staff is the most decisive move yet by a finance minister to stamp out the bonus culture. No doubt motivated by the humiliation he faced by having to accept \u20ac85bn in aid from the IMF and the EU, Lenihan has gone further than Alistair Darling was prepared to when he was bailing out\u00a0RBS at the height of the banking crisis two years ago. Then Darling stopped bank bosses taking bonuses but allowed RBS to keep shelling out to the overpaid troops on trading floors on the basis that without the payments, they would walk out of the door \u2013 and take lucrative business with them. With his reputation in tatters and facing an election next month that is likely to sweep his Fianna F\u00e1il party out of government, Lenihan may be hoping to retain some dignity among his furious electorate by halting the bonus payouts at a bank that is likely to be nationalised in the coming weeks. The fact that AIB felt it needed to pay\u00a0bonuses at all demonstrates how badly broken the bonus system is. Logically it would seem implausible that anyone working at a bank needing a taxpayer bailout could be entitled to a bonus. Rationally it would seem any banker working in such an institution would be ashamed to take a payout. Rightly the bonus system should operate in such a way that they would not be in line for such a cash boost at all. However, such is the structure of these sorts of bonuses that they are paid regardless of performance. In\u00a0the case of AIB, the bonuses that have been stopped were deferred payments granted in 2008 \u2013 the year the wheels started to fall off the industry. The bank had decided to make the\u00a0payments after being taken to court\u00a0by a trader. John Foy won a ruling\u00a0that he should be paid the \u20ac161,000 he was awarded in 2008. Lenihan cannot override that judgment, but the bill to pay off the rest of Foy&apos;s colleagues could be \u20ac40m. When the Guardian and others reported this fact a fortnight ago, the outcry in Ireland made the embattled minister rethink his options. Last week he announced an amendment to his austerity budget that will slap a 90% tax on bankers&apos; bonuses in the future. After a weekend of thought, he came up with his latest plan to tie the IMF/EU bailout \u2013 likely to be \u20ac9bn at AIB \u2013 to a pledge from the bank not to pay the bonuses. The new management team at AIB will welcome Lenihan&apos;s tough stance. But, across the Irish sea, bankers in the City were today watching nervously, aghast even, that the Irish government could take such an extraordinary step. Bankers have warned time and again\u00a0that if their bonuses are curtailed, they will move to places where there are\u00a0no such restrictions \u2013 robbing the country of vital income. That cuts no ice with European commissioner Michel Barnier, who regards the threats as nothing more than &quot;blackmail&quot;. With the round of rewards just starting in the City, new bonus guidelines from Brussels have prompted fresh threats of an exodus; but policymakers around the world now have a chance to see what really happens when the plug gets pulled on bonuses entirely. Will 2,400 furious bankers walk out of the doors of AIB in Dublin and\u00a0pitch up in Hong Kong, Singapore or even London? Time will tell, but Lenihan&apos;s face-saving exercise could have repercussions far beyond Dublin\u00a0if\u00a0AIB&apos;s\u00a0doors fail to revolve, opening the\u00a0way for other governments to stop big bonuses."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/dec/15/ashes-holiday-guide-perth", "sentences": ["\u2022 Qantas: (qantas.com) flies from London Heathrow to Perth via Singapore from \u00a3805, including all taxes and surcharges."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-15T08:00:00Z", "title": "Ashes fans' guide: Dennis Lillee's Perth", "tags": ["Perth holidays", "Australia holidays", "Australasia holidays", "Travel", "City breaks", "The Ashes", "Cricket", "Sport", "Ashes 2010-11", "Western Australia holidays"], "article": "Dennis Lillee hasn&apos;t always been known for his hospitality. For years, he ruined the visits of Englishmen venturing to Australia with his ferocious fast bowling. By the time he retired from Test cricket, in 1984, he had taken more Test wickets - and more Ashes wickets - than anyone in history. Now, however, he has mellowed. &quot;We love the Poms,&quot; he says with a smile. &quot;Sure, there&apos;s fierce rivalry at the cricket, but the Brits are embraced with open arms.&quot; Here are his tips to enjoy his hometown in between sessions. The city     Dennis Lillee in his cricketing heyday. Photograph: Adrian Murrell/Getty     Perth has boomed in the last 10 years. I remember looking out across it a little while ago and counting 36 cranes on construction sites. They&apos;re building new offices and hotels all the time and the mining sector - which is particularly strong in Western Australia - has ensured that we haven&apos;t experienced the recession that has affected other parts of the world. There was a time when Perth was seen as the poor relation of Melbourne, but not any more. There are fantastic hotels and restaurants now and it&apos;s become a vibrant, multi-cultural, modern city. But it&apos;s still the most isolated city on the planet. There is a rugged beauty about Western Australia and I love the fact that you can drive for hours and hours and not see another person. It&apos;s the largest state in the country - taking up nearly a third of Australia - and though around 2.2 million people live here, about 85% of them live within a couple of hours of Perth. I hardly leave WA now. Why would I? We have an amazing climate, amazing countryside and incredible recreational opportunities. I even holiday here. The WACA     Photograph: Philip Brown/Corbis    I have to recommend the WACA (waca.com.au), don&apos;t I? I&apos;m President there now. Even if there isn&apos;t a game on, you can take a guided tour and visit the museum. It&apos;s a relatively intimate stadium; more like an English ground than some of the Australian ones. The tickets for this Ashes Test sold out in about 48 hours and there&apos;s certain to be a great atmosphere. We&apos;re redeveloping the ground straight after the Ashes. The competition for hosting international games just grows greater, so we&apos;re going to improve the facilities and make sure we retain cricket here. Pubs The Elephant and Wheelbarrow is a good bet for a night out. It stays open late and offers beers on tap. It&apos;s located in Northbridge, a district where you&apos;ll find many of the bars and clubs. If supporters want to go for a drink right after play - and I expect they will - they just head up the hill and visit Fenians, an Irish pub, or The Grosvenor Hotel (thegrosvenorperth.com.au). Elsewhere, in South Perth, The Windsor (windsorhotel.com.au) - one of the oldest pubs in Australia - is well worth a visit as is The Vic (the-vic.com.au) in Subiaco and The Subiaco Hotel (subiacohotel.com.au). Coffee There&apos;s been an explosion of great coffee shops in the last 10 years. There&apos;s a strip of really good ones alongside Victoria Park. Epic (epicespresso.com.au), on Hay Street, in West Perth, is very good. Zekka is exceptional, too. It&apos;s located on King Street in Perth&apos;s West End, where many of the boutique shops are. Zekka offers a wide variety of teas, too. Eating out     Fremantle for fresh fish. Photograph: Doug Pearson/JAI/Corbis    A few years ago, finding a great restaurant in Perth was pretty hard work. But not any more. You&apos;re spoiled for choice now. It may not be quite as good as Melbourne in that respect, but it&apos;s much improved. One that I like very much is In Contro (incontro.com.au). It&apos;s in South Perth and has superb views across the Swan River and the city. The chef - Peter Manifis - is developing a reputation as one of the best young chefs in the city and specialises in fresh, local produce. There&apos;s a huge Asian influence in Perth and that&apos;s reflected in the cuisine. Ten Ten Kitchen (tentenkitchen.com), a Chinese restaurant in East Victoria Park, is very good value, while Munch Delight, on Mends Street in South Perth, offers good Thai food. Frasers (frasersrestaurant.com.au) has wonderful views of the city skyline and the Swan River and is open for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The best sea food you&apos;ll ever taste can be found in Fremantle and it doesn&apos;t get any better than Kailis&apos; (kailis.com). I always have fish and chips, but their prawns and scallops are to die for. The fish is all brought in as fresh as can be from Fremantle harbour. The outdoors Perth has an outdoor lifestyle. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s part of the reason I became a successful sportsman. Like most Australian kids, I was outside all the time as I grew up. If I wasn&apos;t playing cricket, I was playing football or riding around on my bike. Perth made me. The Swan River is at the centre of everything. I&apos;d strongly recommend people go sailing (funcats.com.au), on river cruises or yachting (sopyc.com.au) if they get the chance. Charter fishing is also wonderful. For golfers, I&apos;d recommend The Vines (vines.com.au), which is a championship golf course in the Swan Valley. The beach     Cottesloe Beach. Photograph: Alamy    Cottesloe is a great family beach. It&apos;s just off Marine Parade, so there are loads of pubs and cafes overlooking the water and it&apos;s the perfect place to enjoy Perth&apos;s sunset. Scarborough is more open and expansive. It&apos;s great for surfing and has lovely, white sand. You can go anywhere in the world, but you won&apos;t find better. They have a big screen up for one day of the Test, too, so you can go to the beach and not miss any of the cricket. Should people worry about sharks? We&apos;ve had a few attacks recently. But bearing in mind how much coast we have and how many people swim, there really aren&apos;t many. You&apos;re much more likely to be knocked down by a car. Mandurah is worth a visit if you get the chance, too. It&apos;s about 40 minutes from Perth on the train and was the holiday destination of choice in the 1940s and 50s. It has been modernised a lot in recent years and has some excellent bars and restaurants, but the original accommodation survives and makes it a charming place. BBQ If you go to South Perth and walk around the Swan River, you&apos;ll probably find a coin-operated BBQ every 500m or so. Every Saturday and Sunday, you&apos;ll see hundreds of people using them and enjoying their food by the water. Matilda Bay, opposite the university, is another good spot for a barbie. Further afield     Diving at Ningaloo. Photograph: Jeffrey L Rotman/Corbis    Ningaloo Reef is amazing. In fact, I&apos;d go as far as to say it&apos;s the most stunning thing I&apos;ve ever seen. It&apos;s a couple of hours north of Perth, but well worth the flight. You can go snorkelling over the reef and see an amazing variety of fish. The colours are outstanding. I know David Gower was heading there between the Adelaide and Perth Tests. Sal Salis (salsalis.com.au) is the place to stay. It&apos;s eco-friendly and you stay in tents right on the beach. Rottnest is superb, too. It&apos;s a car-free island, a 30-minute ferry ride from Fremantle. Again, it&apos;s great for snorkelling and is very popular with anglers. Huge schools of samson (sambo as the locals call them) make the island one of the best metro fishing spots in Australia. Fishing gear can be hired or bought at Rottnest Adventure Centre, the General Store in Thomson Bay, and the Geordie Bay Store. My favourite holiday destination is Kimberley. It&apos;s in the northern part of the state and I like to drive for half a day and not see another person. It&apos;s a harsh, rugged place with very few settlements. It&apos;s about three times the size of England, but only 40,000 people live there. It&apos;s amazingly beautiful. The eco-resort at Broome (ecobeach.com.au) is also outstanding. You can watch turtles and whales and, like Ningaloo Reef, you can sleep right on the beach and watch the sun come up. Wine Western Australia only produces about 8% of the wine made in Australia, but the quality is exceptionally high. There are easily accessible wineries about 30 minutes from Perth in the Swan Valley, or you could make a day of it and go to Margaret River. outandabouttours.com.au. \u2022 Qantas: (qantas.com) flies from London Heathrow to Perth via Singapore from \u00a3805, including all taxes and surcharges.

But while its 60 million people enjoyed prosperity under the Pax Romana, the imperial system had a key weakness, argues Richard Miles: relying heavily on a non-doctrinaire brand of polytheism and giving its people bread and circuses (&quot;cheap food and cheap thrills&quot;), it wasn&apos;t big on the big questions. It was thus peculiarly ill-equipped to resist Christianity. Miles concludes an excellent series in upbeat style.

Opin Fyrir Mor\u00f0i is taken from their debut album, Er Einhver A\u00f0 Hlusta? (&quot;Is Anyone Listening?&quot;), which was released in early summer. INDIA       IndiecisionTempo Tantrick - Psychoblabber       Tempo Tantrick is a trip hop duo from Bangalore. Their sound palette ranges from downtempo to pulsing EDM that finds a likely home in clubs open to both electronica and experimental. Psychoblabber falls squarely in the latter end of the Tempo Tantrick soundscape. The track features an irresistible, throbbing refrain reminiscent of Shiny Toy Guns. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarKelelawar Malam - Suara Kegelapan       Kelelawar Malam means &quot;Night Bat&quot;; Suara Kegelapan means &quot;Voice of Darkness&quot;. The band name and song title already set a hint of horror, and their lyrics were written as though they were intended for horror B-movie scripts, with old Indonesian villages as the setting. The music is heavily influenced by The Misfits.  IRELAND       Nialler9James Vincent McMorrow - If I Had A Boat       Having captivated Ireland with his falsetto folk ballads, McMorrow has signed to Vagrant Records in the US. A self-titled EP is currently acquainting itself with international ears and here&apos;s your chance to do the same. If I Had A Boat is the first song from the EP and a perfect introduction to McMorrow&apos;s oaky timbre. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelWinterhorde - The Tenth Wave       Winterhorde is a blacker than the blackest black metal band from the north of Israel. Unfortunately, Israel&apos;s north is pretty black right now itself with hundreds of acres of forest destroyed by the largest fire in the country&apos;s history with a death toll of over 40. In any case, Winterhorde&apos;s sonic path twists from symphonic melodies to sheer straight-up metal intensity, melding these two extremes with elegance and professionalism. Winterhorde will freeze your soul with its echoes of longing, darkness and unrelenting desperation. Good stuff created in a classic vein. ITALY       Polaroid(m+a) - (we)       Michele and Alessandro (hence the name of the band) are two young, talented boys from the town of Forl\u00ec. That&apos;s more or less all I know about this project. But then there are these amazing sounds: gloomy glitch electronica with a warm acoustic heart and a cool touch of fresh pop which goes from Radiohead to Plaid via Hot Chip, if you need some kind of weird recipe. This is a song from their incoming second album but you can download their first one for free at their website. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaTroker - Planeta Terror       Guadalajara-based &apos;jazz vinyl&apos; band Troker was formed in 2005 by six conservative musicians and has developed into a powerful, danceable and naughty funk-rock sound - a groovy horn section, violent drums, a sexy piano and spicy scratches that make the turntables work as a roll &apos;n&apos; roll instrument through a jazz-based structure. Planeta Terror is one of the delightfully sour tracks from their second album El Rey Del Camino. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamThe Benelux - Pet Needs Friends (Bear remix)       This Amsterdam indie quartet are fresh, frisky and dancefloor flammable. There are certainly retro guitar-pop elements at play here, such as their saucy bursts of swaggering guitar jangle. But any hints of classic garage rock are mixed with quirky synths and fun, big beat grooves. So much so that their Girl Singer EP is topped off with remixes by NON Records labelmates Palmbomen and Bear. The tracks lend themselves perfectly to dance-friendly interpretations - Soulwax come to mind in this sense - which is why we&apos;ve chosen the Bear remix of Pet Needs Friends as a party-starting introduction. NEW ZEALAND       Counting The BeatPikachunes - Nervous       Miles Loveless&apos; commanding baritone strides atop his lofty synth lines and unrepentant drum machine tracks, riding a dance wave like that of LCD Soundsystem. On the bedroom producer&apos;s song Nervous, a Knight Rider-esque bassline cavorts with a floating, flutey synth that comes in with Loveless&apos;s emotionless, almost monotone voice providing a laconic environment for his social awkwardness to shine. Pikachunes released his debut self-titled album on Lil&apos; Chief Records last month, and he has a great video for the song Shout It Out. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceUno M\u00f8ller - Your Quiet Little House       Singer-songwriter Uno M\u00f8ller plays beautiful minimalistic pop with just the sound of his fragile voice coupled with the playful tones of an acoustic guitar. His debut album was released a few months ago on the British label Lazy Acre Records. He&apos;s also a part of Team Me, a promising band that has been praised both in and outside Norway. They&apos;ve been booked to play at \u00d8yafestivalen and by:Larm next year, but let&apos;s hope Uno has more time for his solo project too. PERU       SoTBKid Solano - Solano Swing       Think of a perfect party in a place where night is eternal and the collective dancing turns everyone into a jumping mass. Now imagine the perfect song to accompany those moments and the result would be something like Solano Swing. Make space in your record collection for the amazing lounge/breakbeat of Kid Solano. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Minta &amp; The Brook Trout - Large Amounts       Minta is Francisca Cortes\u00e3o - a talented singer, musician and composer who has been in other bands and works as a session and live musician. The Brook Trout are Mariana Ricardo, Manuel Dordio and Jos\u00e9 Vil\u00e3o, friends of Minta who collaborated on her first album, Minta &amp; The Brook Trout. Minta&apos;s sound will please fans of the likes of Beth Orton or Belle &amp; Sebastian. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseMakunouchi Bento - Anchorshaped Siren       Makunouchi Bento is an experimental project with influences from musique concr\u00e8te to IDM. Their lunchbox has many more surprises than anyone could imagine. There are two main directions in their sound - the use of electronic gadgets (Spectrum, C64, Amiga, Atari) and sampling as the key for a haunting cinematic atmosphere. This could easily be the soundtrack of a David Lynch film or a rainy, gray Romanian December afternoon. Their album, Swim\u00e9, can be downloaded for free from Bandcamp. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopRachel Sermanni - Eggshells       Rachel Sermanni is a talent worth swooning over. The 19-year-old from the Highlands cites her idols as Joni Mitchell and Eva Cassidy, which makes perfect sense when you find yourself enchanted by her pure, fragile vocals and poetic lyrics. A star in the making for sure. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...The Lard Brothers - Wish You&apos;ll Never Leave Time (Ownself Remix)       The Lard Brothers have carved a niche for themselves remixing and reworking songs by other Singaporean bands, sometimes roping in outside collaborators in the process. Their approach ensures their work isn&apos;t so much a rehash of existing material as it is a means of bringing the music community together, and giving us a fresh take on Singaporean music. Their latest release, the Bonsai Warriors EP, stays on the same track but fittingly leaves room at the end for a remix of themselves, a glorious uplifting on their 2008 original. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Reburn - Outta My Mind       Reburn is a five-piece alternative rock band whose mix of catchy beats and a quirky feel has seen them rise to the forefront of the local scene. Outta My Mind encompasses the band&apos;s sound, which is distinctly British-influenced with its polished tone and a slight indie edge. Reburn&apos;s motto is that the band was brought to life for no reason other than to make &quot;music for pleasure&quot; and that they do. Stylishly so. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKImage - Empty Universe       Female singer-songwriter Image has already been active for more than a decade, but it wasn&apos;t until fall this year that she presented her first digital EP, Metaphoricalizing. Determined to make music of veracity, Image combines both acoustic and electronic elements when giving life to the folk ethos she wishes to express. Empty Universe is the main track off Metaphoricalizing and will be recorded in an English version for her upcoming first CD album. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerOdio Par\u00eds - Ya No Existes       We don&apos;t have any reason to hate Paris, but apparently this five-piece band from Barcelona does. Odio Par\u00eds, who have supported The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, are influenced by shoegaze legends The Jesus And Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine, but they also take inspiration from Spain&apos;s biggest indie band, Los Planetas. Ya No Existes, their first single, is living proof of that as it recreates the characteristic distortion of the Andalusians&apos; early releases. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseLe Days - Ring Baby Ring       Le Days (aka Daniel Hedin) has announced the upcoming release of a debut album titled Dead People On Tape. The predominant instrument may be an acoustic guitar but this is by no means folk music. It&apos;s a disturbing blend of over the top emo and confessional rock \u00e0 la Jeff Buckley. The first single in all its tormented glory namedrops Judas, curses violently and lays its heart on its proverbial sleeve. SWITZERLAND       78sThe Bianca Story - Coming Home       You thought Switzerland was neutral? It&apos;s not. We&apos;re totally asking you to take sides with our quest to bring better music to the world. Our weapon of mass seduction: The Bianca Story, a five-piece from Basel. Their sound is best described as &quot;pop taken seriously&quot; - you get the catchy tunes but with added layers of depth. Their latest single, Coming Home, is an appetizer to their second album due for release in 2011. UNITED STATES     Flag of the USA     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingPainted Palms - All Of Us       San Francisco&apos;s Painted Palms aren&apos;t the first experimental pop band to take cues from Animal Collective, but they&apos;re perhaps the most unique of the bunch. Combining a wild assortment of genres from Afro-pop to krautrock to electro-pop, the tracks on their debut Canopy EP (free download here) are equally addictive as they are artful, bringing a smile to even the most jaded of listeners. VENEZUELA       BarquisimentoViniloversus - Ruleta Rusa       Viniloversus started rocking Caracas in 2004, both live and on record. One of the many reasons for their unique sound is the presence of two bassists in the band. Impeccable performances and sharp, strong notes hit the audience like thunder in their shows. Ruleta Rusa is taken from their Latin Grammy-nominated latest album Si No Nos Mata."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/dec/15/edinburgh-fringe-explosion-fame-1927", "sentences": ["They would later visit South Carolina, Australia, Sri Lanka, China, Singapore and Slovenia, before returning to the UK for a national tour."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-15T15:00:56Z", "title": "Theatre group 1927: 'We're still a little company'", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Festivals", "Culture", "Edinburgh festival"], "article": "There was a moment in August 2007 when theatremaker Suzanne Andrade almost threw her phone out of a window in frustration. 1927, the company she co-founded with animator Paul Barritt, were the surprise stars of the Edinburgh fringe. Their first full-length show, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, had five-star reviews. &quot;This,&quot; wrote Lyn Gardner at the time, &quot;is what Edinburgh should be all about: a devilishly good piece of work from a company you had never heard of before&quot;. Andrade&apos;s phone had barely stopped ringing. Each call brought another promoter desperate to secure a ticket. &quot;It was just ridiculous,&quot; says Andrade. &quot;We had opportunities thrown at us left, right and centre. Producers from all over the world were phoning up, saying: &apos;I have a 500-seat theatre in Germany; I promise you the best run of your life.&apos; We were used to doing odd gigs for \u00a350. We didn&apos;t know the first thing about touring.&quot; Such is the nature of the Edinburgh fringe. It is a festival hell-bent on discovery, with programmers, critics, award panels and audiences all out to unearth new talent. Young companies and emerging artists can have greatness thrust upon them, but when it happens suddenly and unexpectedly, it&apos;s not always welcome. &quot;If you make a little explosion in Edinburgh,&quot; says Andrade, &quot;it&apos;s a big explosion.&quot; For every young company enjoying attention, of course, there are dozens more struggling to be noticed. And even if you do get successful, it doesn&apos;t guarantee future stability. There is a challenging but reasonably straightforward formula to an Edinburgh run: find venue, raise funds, get reviews, flyer, build buzz. Real life isn&apos;t so neat. Catapulted into newfound prominence, emerging companies often lack the experience and expertise \u2013 let alone the infrastructure \u2013 to take the next step. Another young company, Analogue, a company born out of Royal Holloway University&apos;s contemporary theatre course, broke through that same year, in 2007. Their show, Mile End, began by selling only a single ticket for their first performance \u2013 which was interrupted, inauspiciously, by a fire alarm \u2013 and ended the month with packed houses and two awards. Ric Watts, who became Analogue&apos;s producer shortly afterwards, describes Edinburgh as &quot;the best shop window in the world for new companies. It&apos;s the one place emerging artists are actively sought out. But the hard bit is capitalising on that opportunity as a springboard for a more sustainable career.&quot; Beyond the Fringe, Watts believes it&apos;s much harder to entice venue representatives and critics to see emerging work. Even in Edinburgh, says James Wilkes of Belt Up Theatre, a company of recent York graduates who explode classic texts using interactive and immersive techniques, there is a readymade audience that disperses once August ends. &quot;Work that is exciting when in the festival spirit often isn&apos;t so enchanting in the real world, sort of like a holiday romance.&quot; So how does one set about converting summer success into sustainability? Just as Analogue began collaborating with Watts \u2013 a move director Liam Jarvis calls &quot;the best thing that happened for the company&quot; \u2013 1927 also found themselves a producer. Jo Crowley, who has worked with the BAC and Ridiculusmus amongst others, agreed to offer initial advice, then, after seeing the show in London, took on a bigger role. &quot;Since then,&quot; Andrade says with a hint of relief, &quot;she has become totally indispensable. At the very least we would have missed loads of flights without her. We can be quite cack-handed with organisational elements. Even organising train tickets can be a nightmare!&quot; With Crowley handling the organisation and administration, 1927 took their debut around the world, starting in New York with Crowley handling everything from tour management to fundraising, photocopying to strategic planning. They would later visit South Carolina, Australia, Sri Lanka, China, Singapore and Slovenia, before returning to the UK for a national tour. But they had a problem: what next? A second show had been co-commissioned by the Melbourne Malthouse and the BAC and was immediately scheduled to open at the Sydney Opera House. Not only was that a daunting prospect, but incessant touring left very little time to create. And when the process eventually started, it proved far harder than anticipated. They suffered, Andrade admits, from second-album syndrome. &quot;We started working on one idea after another. We were just wading around, saying, &apos;It could be this. Or it could be this.&apos;&quot; A possible collaboration with a New York-based clown was dismissed not long after being dreamt up. &quot;Rather than starting tiny and letting things grow organically, we started thinking about these enormous, completely impractical ideas. We really felt the pressure.&quot; After stuttering development processes in Slovenia and Australia, the company returned to their roots in late 2008, using free rehearsal space at the BAC and the Bethnal Green Working Men&apos;s Club, where their early cabaret turns had first been seen. Able to give the show the necessary time, working on it intensely for six months in a rented warehouse in Leyton, The Animals and Children Took to the Streets began to take shape. Establishing a support network is crucial. In these embryonic stages, young companies benefit immensely from relationships with larger organisations and venues. Analogue are now co-produced by the New Wolsey Theatre in Ipswich and are associates of Farnham Maltings. Belt Up have a residency with the York Theatre Royal. Such support offers more than a platform to perform or financial backing. It is about development, both structural and creative. All three companies are adamant that without Edinburgh, they would not be where they are today. But they have differing attitudes about returning. For Belt Up, says company member Alexander Wright, &quot;it&apos;s like a catapult that propels us for the next year&quot;. Analogue premiered Beachy Head, which tours nationally next year, at the 2009 Fringe. Watts admits to mixed feelings \u2013 not least about living up to the hype. Andrade says 1927 may return in the future, but only if the benefits become apparent. &quot;Edinburgh&apos;s great if you&apos;re using it. But to keep going back every year, churning out a show to try and make that explosion, I can&apos;t think of anything worse. You have to keep reinventing yourselves. That&apos;s not what we want to do.&quot; Instead, they plan to keep investigating animation and live action, with a large-scale opera scheduled to open in Berlin in 2012 and ambitions to make a film. This time, however, Andrade is determined not to succumb to external pressures. &quot;We&apos;re still a little company; it&apos;s still a little show.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/17/viewpoint-bank-england-financial-stability", "sentences": ["&quot;Market contacts report particular concerns regarding property prices in Hong Kong and Singapore and bond markets in Indonesia,&quot; says the report."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-17T07:02:00Z", "title": "Deep potholes on the road to financial recovery", "tags": ["Bank of England", "Business", "Economics", "Financial sector", "Financial crisis", "Banking", "Interest rates", "Regulators"], "article": "Here&apos;s something new to fret about, courtesy of today&apos;s financial stability report from the Bank of England. Which pieces of the financial jigsaw become dislodged when government bond yields, and thus the cost of borrowing, go up? It&apos;s not a surprise, of course, that this worry should pop up at some point. Everybody has known that ultra-low interest rates, and correspondingly low bond yields, would not last forever. But the question feels urgent because yields have started to rise sharply in the past fortnight, either because investors are worried about a surge of inflation or (more optimistically) because the US economy is improving. The point is that history says sudden reversals in bond yields can cause big trouble. Look at 1994, suggests the Bank \u2013 a year in which the US Federal Reserve doubled interest rates to 6% as it faced rising inflation: US 10-year treasury yields hit 8%. This came as a shock to those investors who had taken low rates for granted and had injected their portfolios with debt to spice up returns. The most spectacular casualty was Orange County, the well-heeled Californian county that filed for bankruptcy after losing more than $1.5bn by dabbling in derivatives. Derivatives are better understood today, says the Bank (maybe hopefully). Expectations for inflation are also &quot;better anchored&quot; than in 1994, it thinks (ditto). On the other hand, the global search for high-yielding assets may be being pursued more aggressively. &quot;Market contacts report particular concerns regarding property prices in Hong Kong and Singapore and bond markets in Indonesia,&quot; says the report. Then there&apos;s the worry that banks, encouraged by regulators, have stuffed their balance sheets with bonds to ensure liquidity at times of stress. The flip-side is increased exposure to interest rates. &quot;A yield spike may lead to trading losses for banks even if the assets involved are liquid,&quot; says the report. But the more scary effect of rising yields is the whack to over-stretched borrowers who are clinging on by their fingertips. As the report expresses it: &quot;Low yields may also be masking latent distress among over-extended borrowers, including some households, corporates and sovereigns.&quot; The most eye-catching statistic in the report is that 30% of UK companies made insufficient profits to cover their interest payments in 2009. That undermines the notion that the corporate sector is awash with cash. Many firms are comfortable but there is also a &quot;distressed tail&quot;. In other words, the UK economy is highly vulnerable to sharp interest rate rises: we&apos;re not ready. Adam Posen, a member of the Bank&apos;s rate-setting committee, continues to argue that deflation remains a risk and that policymakers should look beyond any inflation spike. He may be a popular chap in Threadneedle Street. The report is not meant to be relaxing: the aim is to identify vulnerabilities. The wider picture, it should be said, is that the UK banking system is in better health. But it is clear that the road to recovery is littered with potholes, some of which could be nasty if bond yields rise quickly. The Bank&apos;s advice to banks is good: preserve capital by trimming your bonuses; it&apos;s in your collective interest. It&apos;s just that it may have to break a few legs to get its message heard."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/20/jp-morgan-lehman-brothers-hq", "sentences": ["Yes, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore (especially) are growing in importance, and one assumes JP Morgan will be expanding at a greater pace in those cities."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-20T20:10:41Z", "title": "JP Morgan buys Lehman Brothers' former office in Canary Wharf", "tags": ["Business", "JP Morgan", "Banking", "Lehman Brothers", "Commercial property", "Real estate"], "article": "It is not clear whether JP Morgan was ever contemplating moving its European headquarters out of the UK.

It&apos;s hard to know how much significance to attach to that claim. Canary Wharf Group was clearly desperate to fill the building, so the purchase may represent part of JP Morgan&apos;s continued commitment to getting a bargain (yes, even at \u00a3495m). On the other hand, the US bank is also continuing work on the Riverside South site, also in Canary Wharf, that it had previously earmarked as its European headquarters. It may want the space for itself in the future or it may sell eventually. But, undeniably, JP Morgan is making a substantial bet that London office space is not about to plunge in value \u2013 that&apos;s some sort of commitment. The reality may be that London, whatever the scare-stories about deserting banks suggest, is not about to disappear as a financial centre. Yes, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore (especially) are growing in importance, and one assumes JP Morgan will be expanding at a greater pace in those cities. But a global bank also needs a large presence in wealthy western Europe.

That ought to have disqualified him from holding a board position or &quot;exercising control&quot; over QPR. The &quot;owners&apos; and directors&apos; test&quot; of the Football League says it is a &quot;disqualifying condition&quot; for a director of a League club to be &quot;subject to a suspension \u2026 from involvement in the administration of a sport by a sports governing body&quot;. Yet details at Companies House show the 60-year-old Briatore had been a director at Loftus Road since December 2007, his tenure unbroken despite the attentions of the World Motor Sports Council of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile. Last year it handed down a lifetime ban against Briatore following an investigation into the Piquet crash. The Italian challenged and the Football League did not pursue its own action against Briatore while a legal process was under way. The French high court overturned the lifetime ban but, in return for the FIA dropping its appeal of the court&apos;s decision, Briatore pledged in April &quot;to abstain from having any operational role in Formula One until 31 December, 2012&quot;. So he is serving a voluntary ban, but a ban it is. Still the League has failed to enact its rules over the past eight months, proving the test to be toothless. United deny Qatar link Talk of Qatar&apos;s \u00a31.5bn interest in a Manchester United takeover was yesterday dismissed by a spokesman for the Glazer family, the club&apos;s owners. &quot;There has been no bid for the club. Any such bid would be irrelevant anyway because the club is not for sale.&quot; So a full takeover is not on the cards, but that does not mean that a partial sell-off has not already happened. The Glazers&apos; \u00a3240m-plus payment-in-kind loans have been paid off, but no one knows how. They have facilitated the issue of new shares in the club, meaning stake sales are now possible \u2013 and intriguingly have been since 22 November, the date the Glazers informed their PIK lenders of their intention to pay off the loans. The Glazers could have issued new shares to themselves to capitalise the company with the funds to pay off the loans. But it is equally possible that the club has a new shareholder and is no longer wholly owned by the Florida-based family. There should not be a long wait to find out: the club&apos;s annual return, which should give details of any significant changes in the shareholders&apos; register over the previous 12 months, is due for release to Companies House next month. United fans will be interested to see if there is a new name added to that of Red Football Limited Partnership, the Glazers&apos; opaque Nevada investment vehicle. Townsend&apos;s not a tweeterAndy Townsend&apos;s Twitter impersonator almost contributed to putting Welling United out of business last week. The non-league club that was Townsend and Steve Finnan&apos;s alma mater last week faced a winding-up order in the high court following a petition by HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Dan Chapman, the Leathes Prior solicitor who successfully defeated that petition could only do so after a successful appeal to fans for contributions towards the \u00a360,000 needed to keep the club alive. Supporters forwarded the appeal message to Townsend, through &quot;his&quot; Twitter account, and Finnan, through his agent. Neither got back in touch. When Digger contacted Townsend to ask why he had not done so, he explained that there is an imposter pretending to be him on Twitter (and from reading the posts it is difficult to see how the fans did not immediately notice the satire). But Townsend said he will do anything he can to help the club in future. Finnan&apos;s reasons for not getting back are less clear. The agent did not get back to Digger, either.

There have been a few jokes about constituents having to bring ID to surgeries and expecting to be frisked. As I type, the Today programme is playing it for laughs with a couple of ex-MPs. It&apos;s actually not very funny since two attempts to murder MPs at their surgeries \u2013 in Cheltenham and East Ham \u2013 have been made in the past decade. But so far in this parochial mini-drama (sorry world, we&apos;re busy) the bulk of media analysis and commentary has gone along with the basic premise that it was a legitimate activity to target Lib Dem ministers \u2013 there&apos;s a third batch of bugged comments in today&apos;s edition \u2013 in order to prove what we already knew. Namely that the coalition for which the electorate appears to have voted on 6 May \u2013 Labour lost, but neither the Tories nor the Lib Dems won \u2013 is a compromise in which many participants have reservations about all sorts of things. Radio 4, which should know better, is leading its bulletins on batch three, just as it followed the Guardian&apos;s WikiLeaks series uncritically earlier this month. No surprise there, I&apos;d say. Norman Baker is reported as likening himself to anti-apartheid campaigner Helen Suzman (oh dear, Norman), but also saying more sensibly that Lib Dem ministers like himself are willing to get their hands dirty trying to improve life. Good. That&apos;s precisely it. Grown-ups know that. Imagine what Tory ministers think in private. But we all know compromise and collective responsibility \u2013 at least in public \u2013 are part of life, family life as well as work. The idea expressed by Christopher Choate MP yesterday that this requires Cable to be loyal even in private conversations is preposterous, one might even say Maoist. I&apos;m glad to see that some commentators are finally getting on the case. Jonathan Isaby, who used to work for the Telegraph, has questioned the sting as a breach of the Press Complaints Commission code \u2013 not justified by a public interest defence \u2013 here on his influential ConservativeHome website. The BBC&apos;s political editor, Nick Robinson, has raised an eyebrow on his blog. Letter writers to both the Times and Guardian today also challenge the sting. I&apos;m sure there are others I have missed. You&apos;ll find some of them protesting below the Telegraph&apos;s own self-justifying editorial here. Some readers share what I&apos;ll call the Gadarene Swine line \u2013 Cable is a pompous ass who deserves it \u2013 but others say the Telegraph has finally joined &quot;the gutter press&quot; \u2013 I expect he means the rest of us. Another says: &quot;I have finally reached the end with this great newspaper.&quot; (I bet he hasn&apos;t.) The Telegraph&apos;s blog sites seem eloquently silent, though I often miss things \u2013 missed transport secretary, Philip Hammond, all over the telly at the weekend, so posters remind me. But I did buy the Telegraph yesterday for the first time in ages (the Daily Mail is cheaper and better and the FT costs so much one must make economies) and had my first encounter in ages with my old chum, Simon von Heffer. As he would be the first to admit, Heffer is a clever chap whose book on Enoch Powell (I think I have this right) was judged good enough to get him a PhD from his old university \u2013 Cambridge \u2013 though his hands have been kept clear of the levers of media power by successive Fleet Street editors. In yesterday&apos;s column he takes the Gadarene Swine line as a given (whoops, over the cliff they go) and proceeds \u2013 being a clever chap and serious historian \u2013 to remind his more innocent readers that real Tories have been pimped by wicked Liberals for many generations, since the emergence of the modern party in the 1870s in fact. Remember those Liberal Unionist defectors in the 1880s? Of course you do. And the National Liberals of the 20th century whom Dr Heffer does not mention, though he identifies Harold Macmillan (a great hate figure on the right) as a Whig \u2013 ie an upper-class economic and social liberal elitist at heart, patrician and paternalistic. He has a point. Good old SuperMac! In other words, it&apos;s all a plot. Heffer hates David Cameron as another Etonian Whig. He calls George Osborne&apos;s critical remarks about bankers&apos; bonuses &quot;socialist&quot; with Dr Cable as his John the Baptist, keen to drive the rich off to Singapore or Geneva, something which is not actually happening much, as Heffer would know if he read the FT. But it&apos;s pink. Heffer clearly talks to the disaffected Tory MPs, 30 or 40 on the right, who know they have been marginalised by the coalition&apos;s acquisition of Lib Dem MPs and ministers. Some are disappointed office-seekers, he concedes, but others think the coalition is being dragged in a fundamentally wrong direction. It&apos;s a point of view. But does it justify bugging an MP&apos;s surgery in order to break up the coalition? One of nature&apos;s party splitters, his hero Enoch Powell, once remarked that politicians complaining about the press \u2013 we didn&apos;t say media then \u2013 are like sailors complaining about the weather; there&apos;s no point. But Powell was also a passionate defender of the rights of parliament and of the individual MP. I think he would have been horrified about the treatment of Cable, whose basic decency and seriousness of purpose he would have recognised. Who knows, Powell might have joined Cable&apos;s attack on excessive credit, corporate and personal, during the boom years. He was not afraid of the City. As I mentioned yesterday, David Howarth, the Liberal Democrat ex-MP and Cambridge University lawyer, thinks that the Fraud Act may be relevant here: deception practised for pecuniary gain. I&apos;m no lawyer, but I doubt it. Far more promising is breach of privilege. It&apos;s not often used any more because MPs have been cowed by successive defeats, government and media bullying and their own folly over their expenses \u2013 though buying them off through allowances rather than pay rises was originally a Tory government idea. Basically, a breach of privilege is something that impedes an MP from doing his or her parliamentary duties \u2013 this takes in freedom of speech and movement, and freedom from arrest in relation to their official duties (a move abused by those MPs who tried to use it in the expenses affair). All have been chipped away by regulation and judicial intrusion as elective politics have come into disrepute, not least thanks to the unelected media. Phil Woolas&apos;s loss of his Oldham seat on essentially political grounds was only the most recent example. In the old days, if someone, say a trade union leader, threatened an MP for what he said, the MP would raise it on the floor of the house \u2013 and an apology would be extracted. Interfering with constituency business might be deemed interference with the proceedings of the house. It has happened before. I consulted a couple of old parliamentary hands last night, older and wiser than me. Both agreed with me that MPs and Commons officials would do well to explore this avenue when they have finished with the Christmas turkey. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 December 2010.

And what, England must be asking themselves, have we done? A fortnight ago, before their batting collapsed like skittles under a wrecking ball, they were 1-0 up and dominant - and the retaining the Ashes looked a matter of five days and twenty wickets away. Then came Perth. Suddenly Andrew Strauss&apos;s men arrive at the MCG with the series all-square, the team as underdogs, and with 90,000 (mostly) Australians crowing, braying and smelling blood. But, just as most people over-reacted to Adelaide, have we all over-reacted to Perth? We&apos;ll soon find out.  A few pointers: According to David Saker, England&apos;s bowling coach, the MCG is &quot;more of an English-type pitch. It is harder to drive, especially on day one and two. You need success with the new ball. Then once the shine goes off you need to get it to reverse because if you don&apos;t it&apos;s really not a bad place to bat ... It&apos;s not a big spinners pitch but they have had reasonable success. It may be harder to score as quickly there as other grounds because the pitch is a bit slower Once the shine goes it is hard work for the bowlers.&quot; * However the first match-innings average in the last 10 Tests is 360, which suggests the MCG is not quite the belter many assume. And there may be something in the pitch for everyone: when Australia beat Pakistan last year, for instance, both Mohammad Aamir and Nathan Hauritz got five wicket hauls. * Australia&apos;s recent record at Melbourne is excellent: in the last 15 Tests they have only been bowled out twice on three occasions.* Ricky Ponting&apos;s Test batting average at the MCG. Only four players have scored more than his 1,186 runs at this venue.  The pitch: Paul Collingwood has looked at it four or five times already and England are unsure whether to bowl or bat if they win the toss. However Shane Warne reckons we shouldn&apos;t be fooled by the grass on the wicket; he believes it looks a pretty good wicket and he wants Australia to play a spinner. No team news yet.  10.40pm GMT The word from the Guardian&apos;s cricket correspondent Mike Selvey is that Australia are unchanged. &quot;Nothing witty to say, but I&apos;d guess I reflect a majority of England fans when I say I&apos;m now as nervous again as I was at the beginning of the series,&quot; says Indy Neogy. &quot;All the old questions are back. Are we going to get mullered? Was all the optimism just a mirage? Will we be watching another England batting collapse? Should Finn really be playing in this game, or is he going to run out of steam after 5 overs? Will Tremlett be any use on this pitch?&quot; No. I hope not. No. Yes. Yes.  10.45pm GMT: Still no official news on the teams, although many commentators - including Jonathan Agnew - are predicting that Bresnan is in for Finn. Meanwhile lots of you are emailing in about Christmas presents. I hope you got everything you wanted - and that some of you were given Golden Boy: Kim Hughes and the bad old days of Australian cricket by Chris Ryan, formerly of this parish. A lovely bloke and a very nice writer too.  The toss: Ponting flicks, Strauss calls heads - correctly - and England will bowl. Moments later England&apos;s captain confirms that Bresnan is in for Finn, as broken by the Guardian last Tuesday. That&apos;s a huge call ...  11.02pm GMT: Ponting confirms he would have &quot;had a bowl&quot;, but he&apos;s not too concerned about batting as it was such a difficult decision, and that his finger is OK. &quot;I&apos;ve been pulling a bit sore after training, but I&apos;ll be fine,&quot; he claims.  11.04pm GMT: Australia&apos;s team is unchanged by the way. Meanwhile, spare a thought for Tim Hill. &quot;My mate Neil and I had tickets for today and also the Sydney Test match,&quot; he writes. &quot;After four days of being messed around by our airline at Heathrow due to the bad weather we were not able to make our trip. Instead of shrimps on the barbie and the MCG I am now seeking legal advice and spending Christmas in -6 degree England. There must be other people out there who have suffered the same fate - we met three lads at the airport who were going to miss out on eight days worth of tickets. Real tragedy aside, I have never been more gutted about anything.&quot;  11.15pm GMT: While we wait for play to begin, Kevin Pietersen is talking about how he&apos;s changed his mentality and wants to be less carefree and more clinical - so he converts 80s and 90s into big scores. Speaking of KP, an important message from Keith Flett of the Beard Liberation Front. &quot;Kevin Pietersen&apos;s performance in the 4th Ashes Test from Boxing Day will be crucial to his chances in one of the year&apos;s most coveted trophies, the Annual Beard of the Year award,&quot; he writes. &quot;The winner is announced on Wednesday and with Pietersen on the shortlist his performance during the Test could sway, or otherwise, crucial last minute votes. The Award is designed to highlight those who have given beards a positive image in the public eye during the year.&quot; I&apos;d hardly call KP&apos;s half-moustache and three days of growth a beard but happy to be persuaded otherwise ...  11.20pm GMT: So, your thoughts on the Bresnan decision? Gary Naylor, for one, is strongly in favour: &quot;I like Straussy&apos;s decision. There&apos;s a reason the bowlers are called an attack (unlike in baseball where pitchers defend) and this means that we can get at Hughes early and then at Punter and Clarke too with any luck. Bresnan is quite sharp, matches up Harris well with the ball and is a proper No8 (Swanny is a nine-and-a-half these days).&quot; I&apos;m not as confident as you are Gary, but it clearly helps that England have won the toss - they should have the best of the conditions to bowl in. However Bresnan&apos;s record in Tests against Bangladesh and West Indies is steady-as-she-goes: 14 wickets for 492 runs at an average of 35.14. Agree that he will strengthen the batting, mind.  11.25pm: A knee-trembling version of God Save The Queen - rather out of place at 10am Melbourne time - is impeccably observed and applauded afterwards, as is Advance Australia Fair. &quot;Beard of the Year is not simply about how magnificent the beard is [we&apos;ll leave that to the hirsute topiarists of the World Beard &amp; Moustache Championships],&quot; splutters Keith Flett, &quot;but whether it is making a positive impact in the public arena.&quot; If KP scores the winning runs off his five-o-clock shadow I&apos;ll vote for him myself Keith.  1st over: Australia 0-0 (Watson 0, Hughes 0) Anderson opens to Watson, and immediately there&apos;s a hint of swing. And from his fifth delivery, Watson nervously paws it towards Collingwood ... who drops it at third slip! It was a difficult chance, low to his left, but Collingwood would take that nine times out of ten. &quot;Would it be fair to say that Ricky Ponting now thinks that there isn&apos;t a spinner in Australia worth picking?&quot; says Chris Langmead. &quot;The Waca is one thing, but surely a spinner is needed in Melbourne and Sydney?&quot; It certainly looks that way ...  2nd over: Australia 10-0 (Watson 0, Hughes 10) Runs for Hughes! First he rocks back before chopping Tremlett through the covers, then he picks up another couple off his legs, then he drives another to the boundary. &quot;I feel Tim (no relation) Hill&apos;s pain, and cheer the happy few who made it over,&quot; says Peter Hell. &quot;Can anyone beat the 11-stage, 53-hour journey from Shepherd&apos;s Bush to Melbourne via Dieppe, Rouen, Paris and Singapore, as taken by my friends Sam Michel and his wife Claire? They&apos;re in the Great Southern Stand right now, and I salute them.&quot; Well?  3rd over: Australia 15-0 (Watson 5, Hughes 10) Oh dear oh dear oh dear. Watson chases after a wide one, and swings at the ball like a man trying to chop down a great elm in one hefty blow. It flies to Pietersen at gully, at a nice height, only to pop out of his hands. That really should have been taken. Meanwhile Andy Niven isn&apos;t happy with the selection of Bresnan. &quot;The day we bottled it and blew the Ashes,&quot; he says. &quot;It better swing. Never has so much been trusted in so few bowlers. Aaarrrggghhhh.&quot; Er, aren&apos;t England playing four bowlers ... like they have been all series? And it&apos;s certainly swinging at the moment - the problem is that England aren&apos;t taking their catches.  WICKET! Watson c Pietersen b Tremlett 5 (Australia 15-1) England strike! Watson is surprised by the unexpected bounce Tremlett is able to generate, and his top edge loops from bat to helmet to Pietersen&apos;s grateful hands.  4th over: Australia 15-1 (Hughes 10, Ponting 0) England immediately implement one of their familiar plans to Ponting: and a delivery deliberately down leg side is nearly brushed to Prior. Wicket maiden. &quot;Here I am in Sydney and unable to watch the Boxing Day Test because my kids are watching Scooby Doo,&quot; says a cheery Ben Pobjie. &quot;So thanks for picking up the slack there. Also, can any fellow readers explain to me why on earth people have kids?&quot; Merry Christmas to you too, Ben.  5th over: Australia 16-1 (Hughes 11, Ponting 0) Just a single off the over from Hughes who, so far at least isn&apos;t looking as flimsy as he did in Perth. &quot;In response to Peter Hell (1st over) my girlfriend and I have also travelled to Melbourne from Shepherds Bush taking in Egypt, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore and Perth over 8 weeks and 14 flights,&quot; says Jamie Jermain. &quot;The OBO kept us going in Thailand where there wasn&apos;t a sniff of televised cricket and just the ramblings of Bull and Smyth and a patchy internet stream to follow the action.&quot;  6th over: Australia 18-1 (Hughes 12, Ponting 1) So close to a run out! Ponting chops one around the corner and Hughes, who I assume called, would have been run out by two metres if Cook (who had scrambled round from short leg) had hit. Impressive, muscular, bowling from Tremlett this. Meanwhile more Bresnan debate. &quot;The problem with the four-bowlers option is that there&apos;s no margin for error,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;Injury or loss of form mean we&apos;re stuffed, which is why the five-bowlers, keeper batting at six option became the standard and lasted so long. You can get away with four bowlers only if one of the batsmen is good enough to take more than the occasional wickets, but neither Collingwood nor KP are up to this role, not even as a reliable partnership-breaker. The fifth bowler has to either do this often enough to be recognised for it, like D&apos;Oliviera was, or steady enough to become a workhouse if another player breaks down. This really seems to be Bresnan&apos;s role.&quot;  7th over: Australia 18-1 (Hughes 12, Ponting 1) More good bowling, this time from Anderson (4-1-7-0), who nearly had Hughes edging behind there. So far it looks a good toss to win. &quot;I have an answer for Ben Pobjie (third over),&quot; says Dave Young. &quot;It&apos;s usually because a man&apos;s semen enters a woman&apos;s uterus and meets an egg. There are other ways but they&apos;re less common.&quot;  8th over: Australia 19-1 (Hughes 12, Ponting 2) Ponting is often a twitchy starter, but he&apos;s looking particularly nervous out there right now. There are lots of unconvincing stabs and clunks off the side of the bat. Meanwhile more Bresnan talk. &quot;I can&apos;t agree with Gary Naylor, I&apos;m afraid,&quot; says Tom King. &quot;I like Tim Bresnan but to me he is a fourth seamer at this level, and the only way we can fit someone like that in is if he is a good enough batsman to bat in the top six (like Watson for Australia). The argument in favour of picking him seems to be that he offers control but I haven&apos;t seen any real parsimony from him. I&apos;d have been inclined to stick with Finn if he was fit - he is expensive but he takes wickets.&quot; He does average 2.99 in Tests - but those Tests have come against Bangladesh and West Indies.  9th over: Australia 26-1 (Hughes 13, Ponting 2) This continues to be a difficult opening session for Australia - Anderson has got it to swing and Tremlett is getting extra bounce - and both batsmen are looking as uncomfortable as a Business Secretary in front of a pack of News International journalists. &quot;In response to the &apos;why do we have kids question&apos; - surely the answer is on the off chance you get see them open the batting or bowling for England at the MCG or Lords?&quot; suggests Lizzy Ammon, not unreasonably.  10th over: Australia 26-1 (Hughes 13, Ponting 2) Ponting is scratching around horribly here, and there&apos;s a heart-in-mouth moment when he&apos;s late to another Tremlett lifter: the ball pinballs from bat to thigh pad to leg, and dribbles past the Australian captain&apos;s leg stump by this much. &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; says my colleague Emma John. &quot;I hear you and Smyth are the only two people in the country still sober.&quot; That&apos;s the professionalism you get with the Guardian&apos;s OBO team, Emma.  11th over: Australia 26-1 (Hughes 13, Ponting 2) Huge appeal from Anderson and, particularly, Prior, who think they have Hughes caught behind. The umpire isn&apos;t buying it, England refer it ... and the umpire is right: the ball only flicked Hughes&apos; shirt and he is NOT OUT Anderson has bowled very well here, to little reward. &quot;Could you tell Ben Pobjie (4th over) that he should have planned Christmas better,&quot; sighs Sara Torvalds. &quot;The thing with combining children with the Boxing Day Test is to make sure they get something for Christmas that will keep the occupied away from the TV - unless you can train them to think that the best thing on TV is cricket, which should be easy enough to do beforehand with a DVD and lots of candy.&quot;  12th over: Australia 26-1 (Hughes 13, Ponting 2) A change in the bowling as Bresnan comes on for Tremlett. It&apos;s a range-finding opener, with a one down legside and couple too wide of off-stump. &quot;I&apos;m a junior doctor half way through my week of nights, and I wondered if you could give a shout out to all my glum patients stuck in hospital on orthopaedic wards 26 and 27,&quot; says Dave Hogg. &quot;Each time we take a wicket I shout &apos;Howzat!&apos; and they give a little cheer, albeit somewhat diminished as we get into the early hours. They appreciate my providing top-class entertainment whilst meeting their medical needs I&apos;m sure.&quot;  13th over: Australia 37-1 (Hughes 16, Ponting 10) Runs - and plenty of them. After Hughes takes three from a clip of his legs, Ponting finally finds his mojo - twice pulling his legs for four. Meanwhile Sarah Cox is dismissive of Jamie Jermain&apos;s eight-week, 14-flight trip, via Egypt, Jordan, Abu Dhabi, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore to Perth (over 5). &quot;This isn&apos;t a tortured, painful effort like that of Peter Hill&apos;s friends. This is a holiday.&quot;  WICKET! Hughes c Pietersen b Bresnan 16 (Australia 37-2) Horrible shot from Hughes, who drives a fullish delivery straight at Pietersen at gully. He&apos;d batted reasonably well for an hour in tricky conditions, then he just threw his wicket away. &quot;Re: Sara Torvalds (over 11). I&apos;m not so sure that candy + children + cricket is really the best medicine to keep kids quiet,&quot; says Sarah Bacon. &quot;I&apos;d be stuffing all small fry full of brandy-soaked Christmas pud instead, the better for the silence that should reign after they&apos;ve passed out in a stupor. THEN you can enjoy the cricket.&quot;  14th over: Australia 37-2 (Ponting 10, Clarke 0) Clarke is watchful as he sees off the rest of Bresnan&apos;s over. &quot;One of the features of Bresnan&apos;s first over was that he mixed up his pace,&quot; says Toby Joy. &quot;Hughes then promptly tries to hit his first ball from Bres on the up - perhaps not the smartest guy around?&quot; Certainly it wasn&apos;t a very good shot.  WICKET! Ponting c Swann b Tremlett 10 (Australia 37-3) Ponting goes! Tremlett replaces Anderson and the switch immediately pays off. There was a little extra lift, a little extra back in the delivery, and the Australian captain flicked one behind as he tried to draw his bat inside. It looked to be going straight to Strauss at first slip, but Swann - at second - went across and took a decent catch.  15th over: Australia 37-3 (Clarke 0, Hussey 0) So, here we go again. Mike Hussey v England - round seven. And three deliveries in, Tremlett has a huge appeal for lbw and, after the umpire shakes his head, England review the decision. First impressions were it was too high - the ball hit Hussey above the roll, and the Virtual Eye supports it. England have now lost all their reviews for this innings after just 14 overs, which seems a little ridiculous.  16th over: Australia 39-3 (Clarke 1, Hussey 1) Bresnan has bowled well so far and Hussey has to be pretty smart to get some bat on one that nips back sharply. &quot;I&apos;m following the OBO from the Cayman Islands,&quot; says Annemarie Elson, who seems to be having it tough. &quot;It&apos;s been a fairly normal Christmas... turkey, stuffing, roast potatoes, lots of wine and the odd glass of rum punch in the 30 degree sunshine by the sea. The best bit, though, is that I am able to show my Daily-Mail-reading-Dad the benefits of switching to the Guardian. Not only does it have THE BEST over-by-over Ashes coverage but it is also infused with topical political humour. Guardian 1-0 Daily Mail.&quot;  17th over: Australia 43-3 (Clarke 1, Hussey 5) Shot of the day from Hussey, who steers an overpitched Tremlett delivery straight down the ground for four in an otherwise uneventful over. &quot;I&apos;m also a junior doctor, and I&apos;m also sober after a long day in Neonatal intensive care,&quot; says Rossa Brugha. &quot;Have to be back tomorrow at 8am. How late is it safe to stay up? We keep taking wickets, and I can&apos;t help myself.&quot; As someone whose daughter spent Christmas 2008 in a neo-natal ward I&apos;m full of admiration for all you types; I&apos;d say get some sleep but you probably get by on about two hours a night anyway ...  18th over: Australia 46-3 (Clarke 4, Hussey 5) Bresnan continues to hassle and harry. &quot;Am sure this has been done to death in previous OBOs, but why do bowling teams still refer LBWs?&quot; asks Chris Bowden. &quot;No one is ever certain if it is out, so it is always a 50:50 chance, and you risk missing the opportunity to reverse a umpiring howler (the true reason for the review system) later in the innings.&quot; Yes it&apos;s been discussed before and, yes, you&apos;re absolutely right. England really should know better.  19th over: Australia 49-3 (Clarke 4, Hussey 7) Hussey continues to provide a masterclass in defensive batting: ignoring deliveries that others would poke at, offering meaty resistance to anything on stumps, and choosing his moments to score. That said, it was a decent over from Tremlett (8-3-23-2), who is still offering plenty of spite, even though he&apos;s barely had a rest this session. Meanwhile this from James Pemberton in Sydney. &quot;Not being wise after fact as have said before this match: selection must be holistic (balancing team as a whole) as well as individual. With a misfiring middle order, Australia selects an state-underperforming, chancy young opener; a talented all-rounder too high at vital six and the best batsman (two recent state centuries) of the clutch of modest spinners. The rocks, Watson (now has), Hussey and Haddon, have to fail sometime. Why this implicit absolute ooverlooking of older, experienced state performers?&quot;  20th over: Australia 53-3 (Clarke 8, Hussey 7) A boundary off Bresnan&apos;s final delivery takes Australia past 50. But they have crawled to it, almost as uncertainly as an eight-month old scratching around on the living room carpet &quot;What&apos;s with the rampant bottom tapping in the England team?&quot; asks Alex in London. &quot;Even a half-decent stop in the field leads to five sets of players rushing over to pad the player on the cheeks. Is this motivational?&quot; Well, it works in the office when Rob Smyth has written a particularly fine entry*, so I&apos;d say yes. [* Disclaimer: not actually true, but I&apos;d be interested in your thoughts on the subject]  21st over: Australia 53-3 (Clarke 8, Hussey 7) Another excellent maiden from Tremlett (9-4-23-2), and it was nearly even better: Hussey played and missed at his final delivery. Meanwhile more tales about how you&apos;re celebrating Christmas around the world. &quot;At the beach in Brazil and internet connection is too slow for dubious p2p feeds so following you on the Blackberry,&quot; sighs Martin Perrie. Sorry Martin. &quot;Wife and baby in bed, so confined to the free bar for the rest of the evening, or at least till lunch. Hard life, eh? Saw Santa arrive on waterskis this morning, preceded by a reindeer on an inflatable - hadn&apos;t even had any caipirinhas by that stage so am pretty sure it happened.&quot;  22nd over: Australia 57-3 (Clarke 12, Hussey 7) Clarke has been scratching around for form all series, but that was more like it: a crushing on-drive down the ground for four. Still Bresnan has bowled well so far today. Meanwhile I am starting to worry that a legion of junior doctors across the UK are stabbing away on their BlackBerry&apos;s while all sorts of frantic beeps are being sounded from their patients&apos; machines. Speaking of which ... &quot;Another junior doctor weighing in,&quot; says Rebecca Heller. &quot;I stayed up til at least two for the nights of the second Test, having to be in at 8am to work 12-hour days on a gastro-intestinal ward. So I&apos;d say you&apos;ve got another hour in you at least. Don&apos;t forget though, to factor in how long it will take you to get to sleep when you&apos;re taut with excitement about how well we&apos;re doing.&quot;  23rd over: Australia 58-3 (Clarke 12, Hussey 8) Twenty minutes before lunch, Strauss opts for Swann, who finds himself up against Hussey again. It&apos;s a feeling-out sort of over, with just a single from the final ball. This partnership is now 21 from 52 deliveries. &quot;Am loving the coverage in between songs of the Sound of Music,&quot; says John Harrison from a &apos;snow-bound Swiss farmhouse&apos;. &quot;Yes I know. Say nothing.&quot;  24th over: Australia 58-3 (Clarke 12, Hussey 8) Another thrifty over from Bresnan (7-3-13-1) and another maiden. &quot;Not sure on the analogy about the uncertainty of eight month-old babies on carpet,&quot; says Dave Adams. &quot;My son is just past that age, and whenever placed on the floor, crawls off with great determination directly towards the nearest available source of danger. Like Phil Hughes batting, I guess.&quot;  25th over: Australia 58-3 (Clarke 12, Hussey 8) Not much turn for Swann so far, not that you&apos;d expect any on the opening morning. Clarke is using his feet plenty here, repeatedly stepping forward to get to the pitch of the ball. Maiden. &quot;I could be wrong, but I have a feeling England would not have referred that decision if Clarke had been the batsman,&quot; says Paul Illecho. &quot;There was a chance to get Australia at 37-4 with Hussey gone and a very real chance of a complete collapse. I think that was worth the risk in this case, even though it would normally be a poor choice.&quot;  WICKET! Hussey c Prior b Anderson 8 (Australia 58-4) Australia&apos;s Berlin wall finally comes down! Anderson returns to the attack and strikes with a slanting delivery that moved a fraction and got the slightest brush of Hussey&apos;s bat; the sort of faint, did-I-did-he brush you might get passing a stranger down the Tube escalator. Hussey goes - and for single figures! &quot;Momentum eh?&quot; says Gary Naylor.  LUNCH Smith faces just one delivery before the clouds open and the players sprint off the pitch. The rain doesn&apos;t look serious, mind, so imagine Rob Smyth will be kept busy describing events this afternoon. Thanks for all your emails - sorry I couldn&apos;t use them all - and see you tomorrow. Thanks, Sean  Postman! Tell the neighbourhood! Michael Hussey has failed! He made just eight, and his dismissal on the stroke of lunch turned a promising morning for England into an exceptional one. To get Mr Cricket \u2013 or Sir Cricket, as we should really call him after his performance in this series \u2013 was, as a cricket commentator once said, massive. It was also a deserved reward for the brilliant James Anderson. Before the series we wondered whether Good Jimmy or Bad Jimmy would turn up; turns out England sent Unlucky Jimmy. His first, wicketless spell this morning was almost as good as his wicketless spell on the third morning at Brisbane, but he switched ends and got Hussey with a beauty. As a rule, I&apos;ve never really liked  you  England bowling first. In the last 20 years, they have done so in 28 Tests, and have taken a first-innings lead in only 11 of them (although, contrary to the last, they&apos;ve actually won 12 of those games). It&apos;s not just about the result, though; it&apos;s the principle of the thing. Bowling first carries a latent aggression that is just not very English. Like walking into a bar and going straight over to schmooze the most attractive person. Test matches (and true love) are not won by smooth, confident demonstrations of talent; they&apos;re won by sitting in and waiting for the other party to make a costly mistake! All that said, England definitely made the right decision in bowling first \u2013 and it was a brave one, too, given what happened at Perth. They knew they had to bowl well and they did so: the three seamers had combined figures of 23.3-9-55-4. The only disappointment was two really dumb reviews. England need to learn that the UDRS, unlike ABV product, must be used responsibly.  Charity department &quot;I&apos;m tired, I&apos;m living in a foreign country, and I&apos;m beginning to lose my grasp of the English language,&quot; says Melanie Clegg.&quot; However... &quot;I think after the lack of sleep that OBO offers both you and the public at large, you could now qualify for long-distance dog-sledding. Not many sports require a state of consciousness and awareness over several consecutive days, but I&apos;m now seeing the similarities between a long race and Test-match cricket. Here I sit, nearly as far north as you can get in Norway, diligently following OBO while I repair dog harnesses. Difficult to share either joy or despair with a Norwegian, when they don&apos;t have the faintest idea about cricket. Here it&apos;s all handball. Why make a sport out of a foul? &quot;How many OBO readers do you think there are? I&apos;m training and racing my sled dogs to raise money for The Christie Charity. The main race (300 miles) is in March, so I haven&apos;t yet done much to publicise things. I&apos;ve already covered over 600 miles in training. If every OBO reader donated 60p (10p per 100 miles) to my JustGiving page, we could find out how many of them are awake just now. &quot;Oh, well. Worth a shot. Meanwhile, good to see another wicket. Can you not produce two version of OBO - the real one plus an alternative, that includes the word WICKET a little more often?&quot; Fantasy OBO. What a great idea. WICKET! Australia 0-2 (Bradman c Marsh b Igglesden 0). And come on, you clowns, give generously.  It&apos;s Chri  It&apos;s Boxing Day!  Plea for cricket department &quot;I&apos;m doing the dutiful daughter thing for the holidays,&quot; says Kat Petersen. &quot;Maybe you could be lovely and ask the OBO if there&apos;s anywhere I can watch it in Berlin? Someone&apos;s house would be perfectly acceptable.&quot; I&apos;ve heard some excuses in my time\u2026  It&apos;s still raining, fairly heavily in fact, so the resumption will be delayed. England will have time to dwell on Perth, where they let Australia off the hook from 69 for five, but equally they will think that the Aussies could be rolled for 150 here, especially as the rain will freshen up a wicket that didn&apos;t really need much freshening.  England will certainly hope and expect to get Steve Smith early. He has had a touch of the Liebenbergs since coming into the side in Perth but, although his technique is idiosyncratic to say the least, he does have a bit of ticker. And on the same ground four years ago, Australia had a No6 who appeared to be a walking wicket. Andrew Symonds went into that match with an average of 18 from 11 Tests. I forget how he got on. All this talk of walking wickets has made me come over a nostalgic one. Who else has there been in Tests against England? Vikram Rathore was one. Time to get jiggy with Statsguru.  Walking wickets of the world unite Here&apos;s a list of top six batsmen with the lowest averages against England in Test series in the last 20 years (in which they played at least two Tests). I&apos;d forgotten about a couple of big ones: Michael Bevan getting roughed up in 1997 and Andrew Hudson in 1994. I&apos;d also forgotten about Azha in 1996, although that&apos;s understandable given the beauty and volume of runs scored by the Holy Trinity in that series. Poor old Min Patel.  2.30am GMT Sky are killing time by showing highlights of the 1986-87 series. It was just before my time, so I&apos;ve only recently realised quite how monstrous an innings Ian Botham played in the first innings of the first Test. To set the tone so decisively \u2013 and with such a mullet \u2013 was very special indeed; 138 from 174 balls was a daft rate of scoring in those days, even more so in view of England&apos;s form (&quot;Can&apos;t bat, can&apos;t bowl, can&apos;t field&quot;) and the fact they hadn&apos;t won a Test for 15 months. You can watch highlights of that innings here. And here are highlights of Beefy&apos;s filthy five-for at the MCG on the same tour.  2.35am GMT It&apos;s still raining. Weatherman&apos;s job please!  2.38am It&apos;s no longer raining, and the covers are coming off. Thanks for all the information re: Berlin&apos;s little-known cricket subculture, which I&apos;ve forwarded on to Kat Petersen. Belushi&apos;s seems to be the best/sole option.  2.42am GMT &quot;Howsabout, now the rain seems to be stopping, we can have the teams published,&quot; says Math Scott. &quot;Please. Thanks, sport-news site.&quot; I&apos;ve been upbraided by a man called Math. Merry Christmas folks! Actually, I&apos;ve never understand why people abbreviate their name to Math (especially if they&apos;re called Suzie, honk): you&apos;re just inviting diabolical nicknames like &apos;Youdothe&apos;. Australia Watson, Hughes, Ponting (c), Clarke, Hussey, Smith, Haddin (wk), Johnson, Harris, Siddle, Hilfenhaus. England Strauss (c), Cook, Trott, Pietersen, Collingwood, Bell, Prior (wk), Bresnan, Swann, Tremlett, Anderson.  2.43am Play will start in 12 minutes&apos; time. So. That&apos;s a nice little break for England. As well as possibly livening up the pitch, it means England&apos;s seamers will be able to bowl through to tea and beyond.  2.45am &quot;Re: Sean Ingle&apos;s comment in the 20th over,&quot; begins Sarah Cox. &quot;Come on then Mr Smyth - tell us about your arse. (Sorry, I&apos;m a bit over-excited.)&quot; My arse? To misquote Greg Thomas: it&apos;s red, it&apos;s round and it weighs a bit more than five ounces.  26th over: Australia 63-4 (Clarke 14, Smith 3) Anderson has three balls left of his eighth over, which he started before lunch. Smith punches the second confidently through the covers for three to get off the mark. Tea has been pushed back to 4.40am English time \u2013 just under two hours \u2013 with the close of play sometime in 2011. &quot;After England were strangled in Perth, the press here went mad talking about how Australia now had the &apos;momentum&apos;,&quot; says Brendan Jones. &quot;Has there ever been such a ridiculous concept in sport? England had a solid draw in Brisbane then smashed Australia by an innings and plenty in Adelaide. England had &apos;momentum&apos; aplenty but a fat lot of good that did them in Perth. Can we make banal, clich\u00e9-ridden sports journalism illegal?&quot; Only if I get an exemption from any punishment on the grounds that, er, I meant well.  27th over: Australia 66-4 (Clarke 14, Smith 6) Tim Bresnan replaces Graeme Swann from the other end. He&apos;s a fascinating case, Bresnan. No matter how many boxes he ticks \u2014 and he ticked a few more during a good spell this morning \u2014 he will always be Bressie lad, or the big lad, or not bad for a stout lad. His second ball is forced through the covers for three more by Smith. That was a good over, with everything to Clarke just fractionally back of a good length. &quot;Pitch might be tickled but the damp outfield might hinder reverse,&quot; says Lord Selvey.  28th over: Australia 66-4 (Clarke 14, Smith 6) Smith plays all around Anderson&apos;s first delivery, which jags back to rap him on the pad. Too high. Then he leaves a delivery that swerves back and just goes over the top. &quot;Has that gone through the stumps?&quot; says Bumble. Extraordinary. Smith really is kinda funny-lookin at the crease. An excellent maiden from Anderson, who in a parallel universe already has 20 wickets in the series. &quot;Your arse,&quot; begins Prahalad Bhat, promisingly. &quot;If I remember right Greg Thomas said those words to Viv Richards, sledging him. The ball was promptly smashed out of the ground the next over. So who is the Guardian&apos;s Sir Viv to your Thomas? Or was that a subtle pass at Ms. Cox? If it was, no wonder you need luck to get the pretty girls, as you state in your preamble.&quot; I wasn&apos;t talking about myself in the premable. It was a general example. Put general example.  29th over: Australia 66-4 (Clarke 14, Smith 6) A maiden from Bresnan to Clarke. England are &apos;bowling dry&apos;, to use the vogue phrase, building pressure through maidens. Am I the only person who had never heard the phrase &apos;bowling dry&apos; until Perth, and now keep hearing it every 12 seconds? Also, am I the only one who finds the phrase a little uncomfortable? What next: bowling moist? &quot;I too have an eight month old, and I agree with Dave Adams he is a far quicker crawler than this run rate at the moment, says Andy Wilson. &quot; This morning he is attempting to walk with one of those &apos;zimmerframe-on-wheels-and-annoying-talking-buttons&apos; first-walker he got for Christmas, and has managed to wipe-out exactly four times, each one coinciding with a fall of a wicket...is it because Daddy has his attention elsewhere perhaps?&quot; Who is this Daddy fellow?  WICKET! Australia 66-5 (Smith c Prior b Anderson 6) Bowling dry brings its reward. Anderson has a huge shout for LBW against Smith rightly turned down by Aleem Dar, but he gets his man two balls later with a fine delivery: pretty full and moving away off the seam as Smith pushes unconvincingly away from his body. The ball took a thin edge and went straight through to Matt Prior. Smith didn&apos;t need to play at that, and he does look out of his depth at No6.  30th over: Australia 71-5 (Clarke 14, Haddin 5) Haddin is turned round by his first ball and edges it low and through the cordon for four. This is a huge partnership in the context of the match, the series and indeed the entire known universe.  31st over: Australia 71-5 (Clarke 14, Haddin 5) Bresnan curves a cracker past the groping Haddin. His length has been superb today. Haddin is beaten again next ball, this time after the windiest of woofs well wide of off stump. Another maiden from Bresnan, whose figures are exceptional: 10-5-16-1. &quot;I seem to recall a wager between two denizens of GU Towers as to whether Bresnan would take 50 Test match wickets in his England career,&quot; says Marie Meyer. &quot;I think you were the one backing him. Any of this ringing any bells?&quot; None whatsoever. But then I assume this took place during the Bangladesh series earlier in the year, and I paid a helluva lot of money to have that entire series, Tamim Iqbal&apos;s innings excepted, professionally erased from my memory bank.  32nd over: Australia 72-5 (Clarke 15, Haddin 5) Anderson tries a surprise yorker and Clarke works it off his toe for a single. That&apos;s the only run of the over, and Australia are going nowhere fast. &quot;As far as I&apos;ve been able to tell in my (admittedly short) life, the most effective way to win the beautiful people over is with the element of surprise, which probably holds true here,&quot; says Natasha Salwan. &quot;That, or with a lot of drink. Hmm.&quot;  33rd over: Australia 77-5 (Clarke 20, Haddin 5) That was nearly another wicket. Clarke drove very loosely at an awayswinger from Bresnan and the ball just cleared the substitute Morgan, leaping spectacularly to his left at point. &quot;I&apos;m actually in favour of having Bressie in the team, due to the frankly despicable sight of teams filled with metrosexual manbag modellers trying to sledge each other,&quot; says Gareth Fitzgerald. &quot;If KP, Johnson, Anderson or Watson with his waxed body sledged me, I&apos;d break out in hysterics. Someone like Bresnan has a bit more authority and menace when he tells you you&apos;re effing ess.&quot;  WICKET! Australia 77-6 (Clarke c Prior b Anderson 20) Postman! Tell the neighbourhood! Australia are 77 for six! Clarke lunges desperately at another good delivery from Anderson that moves just enough to take the edge on its way through to Prior. Very similar to the Smith dismissal \u2013 Clarke didn&apos;t need to play \u2013 and England are in a stunning position. They have denied the Aussies the oxygen of runs, and that has made their batsmen do silly things.  34th over: Australia 77-6 (Haddin 5, Johnson 0) &quot;Who could question Bresnan&apos;s metronomic line and length at the moment?&quot; says Piers Adamson. &quot;He looks born for this Test, just adding simple ball by ball pressure that Boycott would thoroughly approve of and not just because he&apos;s a Yorkshireman. Pressure, steady steady pressure. What a fantastic response to the Aussie braggadocio after Perth. Real steel in this England team. Clarke must score big or Aus are in deep, deep trouble.&quot; You said it.  WICKET! Australia 77-7 (Haddin c Strauss b Bresnan 5) Now this is what I call a Christmas present. England are running riot! Bresnan draws Haddin into a huge drive \u2014 another very loose stroke, it has to be said \u2014 and it flies off the edge to Strauss at first slip. England have bowled extremely well, but Australia&apos;s batting has been shocking. Disgraceful in fact.  35th over: Australia 77-7 (Johnson 0, Harris 0) That&apos;s back-to-back wicket maidens, and Bresnan&apos;s figures are quite outstanding: 12-6-21-2. &quot;My son is learning a tough lesson in self-reliance today,&quot; says Andy Wilson. &quot;He&apos;s just going to have to walk on his own.&quot; At this rate he&apos;ll be changing his own nappies, running marathons and cooking dinner by teatime.  WICKET! Australia 77-8 (Johnson c Prior b Anderson 0) And to think some people say familiarity breeds contempt! It&apos;s yet another catch behind the wicket, with Johnson thin-edging a fine legcutter angled across him from over the wicket. Unlike so many before, Johnson was fairly blameless, but Australia are 77 for eight. Postman!  36th over: Australia 78-8 (Harris 0, Siddle 1) The scoreline needs no further comment from me.  37th over: Australia 82-8 (Harris 0, Siddle 5) Siddle edges Bresnan towards third slip, where Swann dives forward to grab the ball and then signals that he&apos;s not sure whether it carried. Once those go upstairs they are always given not out, and that&apos;s the case here, even though David Gower in the Sky box reckons it was probably a clean catch. Anyway, let&apos;s remember Perth, remember that England have to bat in these tricky (though far from 82-8) conditions, and most of all let&apos;s remember that England have just unwrapped a parcel named Momentum. &quot;Breserotica,&quot; phrase-coins Gareth Fitzgerald. &quot;Who can doubt this man now? The wimminfolk of Ilkley Moor Bah Tat will have to dance round their handbags for a while to attract this man-gods attention. He&apos;ll be skittling batting line-ups, biffing an agricultural century, working on t&apos;coalface, drinking his own (considerable) body weight in stout and lathering the effing ess out of Mike Tyson with his other hand. Malt Whisky and cricket? Marvellous.&quot;  38th over: Australia 86-8 (Harris 4, Siddle 5) Harris top-edges an attempted pull off Anderson over the slips for four. He seems to add four more to the total when an errant delivery flies to fine leg off his rump, but Aleem Dar signals dead ball because Harris was not playing a shot. A bit harsh, that. &quot;Is this the worst Australia side ever?&quot; honks Rob Shine.  39th over: Australia 89-8 (Harris 4, Siddle 8) Tremlett replaces Bresnan, and his first ball is pinged through the covers for three by Siddle. Harris then fresh-airs a windy woof. The lower order might as well play their shots here. It&apos;s the best approach, as we saw at Perth, but it also means they&apos;ll have more time to bowl at England today. Ryan Harris in particular could be a real threat in these conditions. &quot;Is this what you asked Santa to bring you?&quot; says Ben Hendy. &quot;It seems to be meeting my Christmas wishes. As a fan of a good statting, I thought you might be interested in this little list I have conjured.&quot; A fan of good statting? That&apos;s like saying I&apos;m a fan of oxygen.  40th over: Australia 92-8 (Harris 4, Siddle 11) Okay, joke&apos;s over: I made it all up. Australia are 172 for none and Phil Hughes is on 169, having been dropped 17 times. Merry Christmas!  WICKET! Australia 92-9 (Siddle c Prior b Tremlett 11) Is it still deja vu if it happens again and again and again? This is like so many other dismissals today: in the slot, loose drive, thin edge to Prior. That&apos;s Prior&apos;s fifth catch of the innings. What was it David Saker said about driving on this pitch on the first two days?  41st over: Australia 92-9 (Harris 4, Hilfenhaus 0) &quot;Christmas Day in New Delhi: tried Indian port,&quot; says John Butler. Oh that sounds nice, I guess you&apos;d recomm- &quot;Absolutely disgusting. Tasted like off Vimto. Crawled to the TV at five holding off the urge to vomit - a few hours later I&apos;ve made the perfect poached eggs. Deep saucepan, water simmering, splash of vinegar, spin the water, as the vortex slows gently drop the egg in, leave for three minutes then pick it out with a spatula and check white is hard yolk is soft. Slam it on toast cracked pepper, a grating of cheese and a generous helping of Aussie wickets. Absolutely divine.&quot; I still like the sound of that port.  42nd over: Australia 98-9 (Harris 10, Hilfenhaus 0) Harris back cuts Anderson for four to take Australia closer to 100. The last time they were bowled out in double figures against England was in 1968. I thought it was 1956 but I misused Statsguru. The shame. They&apos;ll be talking about it in the village for years!  WICKET! Australia 98 all out (Hilfenhaus c Prior b Tremlett 0) You might want to sit down before you hear this: England have bowled Australia out in double figures. Hilfenhaus edges Tremlett through to \u2014 yep \u2014 Matt Prior, who takes his sixth catch, and I honestly don&apos;t know what to say. 98 all out. Four for Tremlett, four for Anderson and two for Bresnan. At times like these, when words cannot do justice to what we have seen, it&apos;s best to get knee deep in statistics and try to make sense of it all that way. England&apos;s batsmen were the Statsguru-botherers in the first two Tests, and now the bowlers have had their turn. This is what they have just achieved.  TEA &quot;I see ,&quot; says Dan Smith, &quot;that Australia have successfully removed Graeme Swann from the equation again.&quot;  Andrew Ward wins bet to shoehorn Spanish Tempranillo into OBO department &quot;It&apos;s instructive to compare this England performance - studied, good concentration and good purpose - with the shenanigans against India at home a couple of years ago - schoolboy, gung-ho and aimless - and any manner of Tempranillo reds from Spain, be it the 2006 Alion or the Pintia of the same vintage. What I was about to say is that some things (Spanish Tempranillos) are ever the same and others - the England cricket team - have been reinvented.&quot;  1st over: England 1-0 (Strauss 1, Cook 0) The sun has come out for the start of this marathon evening session \u2014 47 overs remain \u2014 and that is good news for England. Australia are in so much trouble here that their heads will hurt just thinking about it. If they don&apos;t take at least four wickets tonight they will be right on the brink. I think Ryan Harris could do some damage for them. Anyway, Ben Hilfenhaus&apos;s first over contains some promising swing, and Strauss gets off the mark with a quick single into the covers.  2nd over: England 1-0 (Strauss 1, Cook 0) Harris angles a good one across Strauss, who pulls his bat inside the line at the last minute. A maiden. England will just bat time against the new ball, as they should in these conditions. &quot;House of Fraser vouchers great, new socks lovely, daughter&apos;s train set great fun (she won&apos;t get a look in) but who needs Father Christmas when you&apos;ve got Jimmy and Chris...&quot; says Dave Forrest. &quot;Time for the batsmen to grind it out though.&quot; Which is something they struggled to do against the moving ball in the summer. But if they get through today relatively unscathed they will surely put this series beyond Australia.  3rd over: England 4-0 (Strauss 3, Cook 1) Cook gets off the mark with a work to leg, and then Strauss pulls a couple into the wide open spaces on the leg side. The first three overs have been very comfortable for England. The ball hasn&apos;t swung at all in the last two. &quot;Clutching at straws department - 1977 Centenary Test,&quot; says Andrew Pinkerton. &quot;We were all out for 138 and still won the Test. But then, in those days, we had a guy called Dennis Keith Lillee...&quot; Ah but now you&apos;ve got the man DK Lillee called a &quot;once-in-a-generation bowler&quot;.  4th over: England 12-0 (Strauss 4, Cook 8) Cook pushes Harris through extra cover for a couple and then, later in the over, edges a push along the ground to third man for four. The MCG is silent. You could hear a tinnie drop. &quot;Would love to be basking in the sunshine of the great Boycott&apos;s smiles right now,&quot; says Martin Cunning, who at least has the next best thing, &quot;but sitting in a hotel room in South Beach, Miami, sipping Napa Valley&apos;s finest whilst glued to the OBO will do for now when the Australian batting order implodes like this. I&apos;m a Celtic-supporting Glaswegian, for what its worth, but I&apos;d be lying if I said I wasn&apos;t absolutely thrilled to bits with the way things are looking right now for Bresnan and the boys - and all in front of the Boxing Day MCG crowd as well, heh heh, what larks! Poor old Punter must be putting on the panties....... Peace &amp; turkey grease x.&quot; Am I the only sober person in the entire world?  5th over: England 14-0 (Strauss 6, Cook 8) Strauss clunks a full delivery from Hilfenhaus through the covers for two. He didn&apos;t really get hold of it, and the outfield is very slow. It&apos;s not swinging at all for Hilfenhaus, so Strauss is able to defend comfortably. Johnson is getting loose, and Australia need a second once-in-a-generation spell from him in as many Tests. I can&apos;t believe it has come to this already. &quot;The advantage about following today&apos;s OBO in the US is that today&apos;s play is an extra, long-lasting, Christmas present,&quot; says Stefan Llewellyn Smith. &quot;My sister-in-law has asked to be taken to a cricket game. Not sure where we&apos;ll find one in Boulder or in San Diego. I used to see people practice cricket on a UCSD playing field, but the field has since been paved over and replaced by more engineering buildings. That&apos;s progress for you.&quot;  6th over: England 25-0 (Strauss 11, Cook 13) It will be Mitchell Johnson to replace Ryan Harris. His first over is a hodgepodge of line and length that includes a cut for three by Strauss, a deliberate uppercut for four by Cook and, more importantly for England, no swing. Eleven from the over. &quot;Well I&apos;m sure you&apos;re enjoying this!&quot; says Terry Baucher. &quot;Here in beautiful sunny Auckland it&apos;s been extremely entertaining hearing the Channel 9 commentators slide steadily from confidence to clutching at any straw available. There is nothing sweeter to these ears than Australians trying to talk up a fiasco. (And believe me they are trying.)&quot;  8th over: England 31-0 (Strauss 17, Cook 13) Having a few technical problems; that&apos;s not a euphemism for me falling asleep in a pool of my own disbelief. You haven&apos;t missed much. Strauss cut Harris, who has switched ends, just over the leaping Hussey at gully and away for four. But otherwise England look extremely comfortable and are already almost a third of the way towards a first-innings lead.  9th over: England 33-0 (Strauss 18, Cook 14) A couple of singles from Harris&apos;s over. The sun is out, the ball is not moving sideways in the air or off the pitch, and even hardened English cricket vets are struggling to see how this can go wrong. &quot;Drop-in pitch, they say,&quot; says Alistair. &quot;Looks like it was dropped in straight from Headingley.&quot; Where, of course, Australia were rolled for 88 in the summer. England could hardly have chosen a more perfect wicket. But thank goodness they won the toss, or we could all be sat here weeping furiously right now.  10th over: England 42-0 (Strauss 22, Cook 15) Johnson gets one to lift from a length at Strauss, who softens the hands just enough to edge it short of the slips and through for four. A lovely delivery, but the next ball is utter garbage, speared down the leg side for four byes. I&apos;ve no idea why it wasn&apos;t given as wides. &quot;Am feeling a little bit sorry for myself as my shoes I bought for this hike are too small, bloody Malaysian feet,&quot; says John. &quot;My blisters have miraculously disappeared and the shoes now fit after hearing the Australian score.&quot; Medical research would be a doddle if everyone supported the England cricket team.  11th over: England 44-0 (Strauss 22, Cook 17) This series is daft. 517 for one. 623 for five. 98 all out. And it&apos;s still only 1-1. &quot;It was ten days ago we begged fellow OBO fans for an appropriate watermelon cocktail recipe,&quot; says Kevin Bowman. &quot;As no help was forthcoming in our search for satisfying beachly drinkies, we can only assume that our plea was taken in the wrong spirit. That we were bragging; rubbing it in as it were. Let us set the record straight by pointing out the problems involved in watching this engrossing series from a beach in the Siamese Gulf. Firstly, we have to wake at NINE in the morning to catch the start........we are on holiday after all. Yesterday the temperature dropped to 24 degrees and we had to put on shirts. Either a Flip or a Flop was lost. (Do people with two left feet wear Flip Flips?) The crashing surf sometimes makes it hard to hear the commentary. Also, one of the lads got slightly sunburned. On a brighter note, after much experimentation, vodka and a teaspoon of honey has been agreed by all to be Absolutly the perfect watermelon accompaniment.&quot; I would hate you, but negative emotion is, like, so yesterday. World peace would be a doddle if everyone supported the England cricket team.  12th over: England 46-0 (Strauss 24, Cook 17) Peter Siddle replaces Mitchell Johnson (3-0-17-0). That gets the crowd going a wee bit, with him being the only Victorian in the side. His first ball lifts sharply past Strauss, who responds by pushing the next ball down the ground for two. England are cruising. Thanks, by the way, for all the responses to Stefan Llewellyn Smith&apos;s email in the fifth over. I&apos;ll forward them on to him at the close of play.  13th over: England 46-0 (Strauss 24, Cook 17) A maiden from Harris to Cook. England have left the ball well so far. Apart from Michael Hussey, Australia had no idea \u2014 or did not care \u2014 where their off stump was. The more their innings marinates, the more it stinks. There were some appalling strokes. &quot;I&apos;ve now sort of got sober and checked the scores on your scorecard, the BBC and cricinfo and so unless someone is playing a monumental joke on me, we do seem to be in the box seats,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;All seems a bit Through the Looking Glass-ish and it seems that Mitchell &quot;Fragile, handle with care&quot; Johnson is not doing so well at the G. In fact, the Aussies aren&apos;t having much fun at all, are they? Please tell me it&apos;s all true and that Cookie and Straussie are indeed still there in the middle and I am not imagining this Boxing Day start.&quot;  14th over: England 52-0 (Strauss 30, Cook 17) Strauss pings Siddle wide of mid on for four to bring up the fifty partnership. They are now just 46 runs behind. I&apos;m still not convinced this is actually happening. &quot;Sat in front of the computer, listening to TMS for the first time since getting back from Vietnam last week,&quot; says Dan Hatfield. &quot;Aussies out for 98, could things get any better? Yes actually, I could be at the MCG like 10 of my friends are. All of them wearing T-shirts gently mocking my absence. It&apos;s ok though, because they won&apos;t get to go to Wolves v Wigan later today. In their faces.&quot; If that game gets called off you&apos;ll look a right plonker.  15th over: England 52-0 (Strauss 30, Cook 17) Hilfenhaus replaces Harris, and it&apos;s a maiden to Cook. Australia look very flat in the field. It&apos;s time for drinks. &quot;What a huge crowd,&quot; says David Thomas. &quot;Yet another world record for Australian sport! Makes one wonder just how many red-blooded, macho Aussies will be able to tell their grandchildren in years to come, &apos;Yep, I was part of it - I was there Boxing Day, 2010!&apos;&quot;  16th over: England 52-0 (Strauss 30, Cook 17) Strauss leaves almost everything in that Siddle over, which is a maiden. This has been a very methodical partnership. England are much better when they play cold, disciplined, almost emotionless cricket. They got sucked in a little during that hot-blooded affair at Perth, but today they have returned to their best. &quot;I love you all,&quot; weeps Ian Rose.  17th over: England 57-0 (Strauss 34, Cook 18) Strauss tucks two more off his pads. Sky show an excellent Hawkeye graphic of the ten dismissals today: only one was anyway near hitting the stumps. &quot;What is undoubtedly superior to the combination of vodka, honey and watermelon is a largeish cube of watermelon in a glass of chilled, undiluted Hendrick&apos;s gin,&quot; hics Josh Robinson. &quot;For best results keep the gin and the glasses in the freezer. However, I&apos;ll be sticking with the Macallan for the rest of the night.&quot;  18th over: England 57-0 (Strauss 34, Cook 18) A maiden from Siddle. So how do Australia get out of this? Realistically, the best they can hope for is a deficit of around 200. Then they have to summon the spirit of Colombo 1992 and hope that England panic in the fourth innings. &quot;In Thailand and surrounds I always found that the local firewater, Mekhong whisky, went very well with juices extracted from the local luscious fruits,&quot; says Jeffrey Feim. &quot;Especially nice was the fresh mandarine juice well spiked with Mekhong. Mekhong whisky is really more akin to rum, given that it is principally distilled from sugar cane extract. Is the Ashes series over yet?&quot; Ssssh. We thought that when England were 60-odd for none at Perth.  19th over: England 57-0 (Strauss 34, Cook 18) Australia are bowling wide of off stump, trying to bore the batsmen out, but you&apos;ll do well to do that with Strauss and Cook. Strauss ignores everything he doesn&apos;t have to play at, so it&apos;s another maiden. You have to feel for the Australian bowlers: their batting teammates have given them a sow&apos;s ear and said, &apos;Silk purse please!&apos;  20th over: England 58-0 (Strauss 34, Cook 19) Siddle has a huge shout for LBW against Cook turned down by Aleem Dar. Cook planted his front leg and was in big trouble when the ball straightened, but it looked too high and replays confirmed it. Excellent umpiring from Aleem Dar - and from Brad Haddin, who advised his captain not to review the decision. &quot;I get the impression that over the past few hours Nasser has decided to mount a one-man campaign to bring back the leave,&quot; says Marie Meyer. &quot;So he has put more time and effort into analyzing the leaves than the shots. Kind of interesting, actually.&quot;  21st over: England 58-0 (Strauss 34, Cook 19) &quot;I think you&apos;re absolutely right about emotionless cricket,&quot; says Gavin Phillipson. &quot;Watching England batting this innings, they&apos;re palpably relaxed, feeling no need to force the scoring, happy to leave, leave, leave, then tuck the slightly straighter one away; watch the bowlers tire gradually; expand the range of slots slowly. They seem to have recaptured the Adelaide mindset. And is there significance in the Perth/Headingley match-up - a big loss coming straight after a big victory, followed by a sharp return to form and dominance? (Oval/Melbourne? (tempting fate).)&quot; I think people have been too harsh on momentum recently. Poor old momentum; it only meant well. It didn&apos;t want to hurt nobody. And I still think it is a very relevant sporting concept - just not where these two little girls with their little curls are concerned.  22nd over: England 58-0 (Strauss 34, Cook 19) Having tried to bore Strauss out, Siddle now decides to try to beat him up. One very good bouncer whistles past his nose in the course of a very good maiden. &quot;Statsguru couldn&apos;t answer this one,&quot; says Brendan Jones, who will next be telling us that Santa Claus doesn&apos;t exist. &quot;Has England ever got a lead on the first innings with no wickets down? Someone out there might know, or at least know how to write the Statsguru query that produces the answer.&quot; Didn&apos;t they do it against Bangladesh in 2005?  23rd over: England 66-0 (Strauss 34, Cook 27) After just one run in five overs, Cook releases what pressure there was with two boundaries in three balls off Hilfenhaus: a push down the ground and a withering cut stroke. &quot;Rob, CMJ has just welcomed any listeners, joining TMS at 6.00, with the line &apos;It&apos;s been a very good day for England&apos;,&quot; says Tim Woollias. &quot;Exactly what would have to have happened for it to be &apos;magnificent&apos; or &apos;extraordinary&apos;?&quot; Well, Australia did reach double figures.  23rd over: England 70-0 (Strauss 34, Cook 27) Ryan Harris replaces Peter Siddle, and his first ball swings down the leg side for four byes. As with Johnson&apos;s earlier, they should surely have been given as wides. Strauss plays a lazy flap-hook later in the over and is lucky not to get a touch on the ball as it zips through to Haddin. &quot;You have to feel for the Australian bowlers?&quot; sniffs Bob Bain. &quot;Up your medication.&quot;  Sorry about this folks. All sorts of technical tomfoolery going on. England have gone into the lead, with the score 103 for none, and Alastair Cook has had an LBW decision overturned on review.  32nd over: England 109-0 (Strauss 44, Cook 54) I think our tools might be working again, just in time for the return of Mitchell Johnson (3-0-17-0). His second ball is short, wide and slapped for four by Cook. That brings up a very good half-century, from 93 balls with eight fours. He was given out LBW to Ben Hilfenhaus on 27, but he asked for the review straight away and replays showed a big inside-edge. Since then he has rattled along, with the cut stroke in very good order. &quot;Are you guys alright?&quot; says Bob Bain. &quot;You haven&apos;t had a seizure or anything have you?&quot;  33rd over: England 109-0 (Strauss 44, Cook 54) A maiden from Watson, most of which I missed when the computer crashed again. Is provocation a legitimate defence if you assault a computer?  34th over: England 112-0 (Strauss 46, Cook 55) Strauss works Johnson off the pads for two, which takes him past 6000 Test runs. Not bad for a bloke who made his debut at 27.  35th over: England 115-0 (Strauss 47, Cook 57) Watson is lumbering in reluctantly, with a man at silly mid-on for Cook. Nothing happens. These are almost free runs for England, and Australia must be dying to get off the field and start again tomorrow. &quot;On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me: an Australian batting collapse and an unbroken England opening stand,&quot; says Emma John, dispensing with niceties such as rhyme in order to make a pretty undeniable point.  36th over: England 124-0 (Strauss 48, Cook 64) Johnson is wided for a very short delivery to Cook. who cuts the next ball for three. This is a rout. On Sky, Shane Warne says that Australia have to bring on a spinner, either Steve Smith or Michael Clarke. They could bring on Warne and Clarrie Grimmett; it doesn&apos;t matter. If Australia get out of this and win the Ashes, it&apos;ll make 1981 seem like an everyday tale by comparison.  37th over: England 128-0 (Strauss 50, Cook 66) Steven Smith comes on to bowl for the first time in the series, and Strauss takes a quick single to mid-on to reach his 23rd Test fifty. Well played. Four singles from the over. &quot;Okay we&apos;ve had our fun, but enough is enough,&quot; says Chris Pearce. &quot;Time to tell Clare Davies that yes, it really is just a big joke on her. Did Ponting reach 150 yet?&quot;  38th over: England 135-0 (Strauss 54, Cook 69) Strauss flashes a cut behind square for four off Johnson. He&apos;s going at a run a ball. England are collecting runs at will. This is preposterous. England are 134 for nought in reply to Australia&apos;s 98. In Australia. At the MCG. On Boxing Day. In front of 90  ,000  Australian fans. Poor old Mo Mentum. After this series, nobody will ever trust a word he says again.  39th over: England 138-0 (Strauss 55, Cook 71) Strauss dances down the track to Smith and screams the ball back whence it came. It was a bump ball, and Smith managed to take most of the pace off the ball, so it was only a single. &quot;Dare I try to improve on Emma John&apos;s ditty?&quot; says David Toze. &quot;&apos;On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me/Eleven wilting Aussies and Strauss &apos;n&apos; Cook each with fifty\u2026&apos;&quot;  40th over: England 138-0 (Strauss 55, Cook 71) Siddle replaces Johnson (7-0-42-0). He&apos;s been Australia&apos;s best bowler today and that&apos;s another tight over to Cook. A maiden. &quot;Chris Pearce (37th over), I don&apos;t think Punter has 150 runs in total in this series,&quot; says Sara Torvalds. &quot;Which, frankly, is stunning.&quot; Before today he had the highest strike-rate on either side in the series, which is a wee bit odd.  41st over: England 147-0 (Strauss 56, Cook 79) England are playing Smith very comfortably for now, and Cook pulls consecutive boundaries - the first wide of mid-on and the second high over midwicket. &quot;Just got up in an eerily quiet Jo&apos;burg and checked cricinfo for team news before the start of BIG TEST in Durban... saw Aus bundled out for 98 and almost collapsed myself,&quot; says Jan Wessels. &quot;Well done is in order I guess!&quot; Thanks, but to be honest I just tried to put the words in the right areas and let the wickets take care of themselves.  42nd over: England 148-0 (Strauss 57, Cook 79) One from Siddle&apos;s over. How the hell do Australia get out of this? If the pitch dies, as drop-in pitches often do, maybe they could bat two-and-a-bit days to save it, but I don&apos;t fancy theirs much. It&apos;s staggering that they are in such a mess before the end of the first day.  43rd over: England 151-0 (Strauss 60, Cook 79) Strauss, driving at Smith, edges wide of slip for a couple to bring up the 150 partnership. It&apos;s been clinical stuff. &quot;Not that I&apos;m a sucker for hyperbole, but quite possibly the best day in the history of English cricket, if not the universe?&quot; says Andy Seaman. &quot;Discuss!&quot; I still have a soft spot for the first day at Lord&apos;s in 1993.  44th over: England 153-0 (Strauss 62, Cook 79) Strauss pulls Siddle for two. I don&apos;t know about you, but I am very tired, and very happy.  45th over: England 156-0 (Strauss 64, Cook 80) Strauss edges Smith again, and this time it falls a fraction short of Clarke at slip. Strauss played for turn that wasn&apos;t there.  47th over: England 157-0 (Strauss 64, Cook 80) More technical problems. Bah! Anyway, that&apos;s the end of one of England&apos;s greatest ever days in Test cricket, a day we&apos;ll be talking about for as long as we can flap our gums. They are 59 runs ahead with ten first-innings wickets remaining; they have four whole days to seal the deal and retain the Ashes. Sleep on it; it might make more sense then. Thanks for all your emails and sorry for the technical problems. See you tonight."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/26/bp-rolls-royce-public-relations-record-comment", "sentences": ["Rolls has been under the spotlight since one of its Trent 900 engines exploded on one of the new Airbus A380 superjumbos (thankfully without injury or loss of life) operated by Qantas, shortly after take-off from Singapore in November."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-26T00:01:05Z", "title": "Rolls-Royce and BP need to learn to say 'sorry'", "tags": ["BP", "Business", "BP oil spill", "Rolls-Royce"], "article": "This has been an annus horribilis for two of British industry&apos;s best-known brands: BP and Rolls-Royce. BP was responsible for the worst accidental oil spill in US history following an explosion on a rig in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 and injured 17. It took months to plug the leak that saw 5m barrels of oil pour into the ocean in one of the world&apos;s biggest environmental disasters. Rolls has been under the spotlight since one of its Trent 900 engines exploded on one of the new Airbus A380 superjumbos (thankfully without injury or loss of life) operated by Qantas, shortly after take-off from Singapore in November. In themselves these events have little in common. They were different in nature, with the fall-out from the Trent engine failure altogether less severe than the BP conflagration. But the thread that links the two is the hash that both firms made of their public relations afterwards. Their response undermined confidence in management and, in BP&apos;s case, to such a degree that it led to the departure of chief executive Tony Hayward. In fact BP&apos;s reaction amounts to a textbook example of how not to do things and will be studied by students of PR for years to come. Given that about half of BP&apos;s business and 40% of its shareholders are in the US, there was a need from the outset for Hayward to address US public opinion. The last thing the Americans wanted was aloofness, wry smiles and a stiff upper lip that were hallmarks of the Hayward riposte. In the period immediately after the explosion, BP needed to be out there engaging with its stakeholders. But it retreated into itself and was reluctant to admit to shortcomings. Hayward&apos;s memorable comment that he &quot;wanted his life back&quot; midway through the crisis was like throwing petrol onto the fire. Sir John Rose, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, also played things badly. The company has never been good at communicating with the outside word. As the Ministry of Defence is one of its biggest customers, perhaps that should come as no surprise, but when its engine failed last month, Rolls should have been quick to open up lines to investors to explain how it planned to fix things. Instead, there was an almost deafening silence. Shareholders were left to fret about how much the accident would cost in lost orders or litigation. Rolls folded into itself, pulling up the communications drawbridge and only belatedly answering phone calls. It has refused to expand on an early statement in which the company said it had isolated a problem &quot;component&quot; and that a programme was in hand to rectify the situation. Is this really the way to run a public company? Early Qantas checks on engines fitted to the A380s indicate the problems may not be as widespread as first feared. But no one can say for sure how much this is going to cost the company, as investigations are ongoing. Perhaps Rose has learned something from BP. During the height of the crisis, the oil company consistently put a rosy gloss on the potential damage of the disaster. One of Hayward&apos;s biggest clangers was suggesting the environmental impact on the gulf would be &quot;very, very modest&quot;. Worse, the cost estimates for investors kept heading north, from a &quot;conservative&quot; $200m to the current $40bn. But even that figure could be out by as much as $20bn, following the announcement that the US government is suing the company for unspecified damages. Rose may have drawn from all of this the lesson that it&apos;s better to keep your mouth shut. But what Rolls and BP really should have learned by now is that the road to redemption lies neither in burying your head in the sand or playing down bad news. The key is to put your head above the parapet and engage via straight, honest talking, even if it means saying &quot;sorry, everyone, we screwed up&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/26/scientists-invisibility-cloaks", "sentences": ["Now the journal Nature has revealed that two separate groups \u2013 one based in Singapore and the other at the University of Birmingham and Imperial College London \u2013 have made objects each a few centimetres in diameter invisible.", "The team at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) has built a calcite carpet cloak that can shield a small steel wedge measuring 38mm by 2mm from red, green and blue visible light.", "Hopes of developing fully functional invisibility cloaks in the near future have been further boosted by the fact that both the Singapore and London devices turned out to be much cheaper to make than earlier attempts."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-26T00:02:04Z", "title": "Invisibility cloaks: Now you see me, but for how much longer?", "tags": ["Science"], "article": "They won&apos;t help you sneak around Hogwarts unobserved. Nor will they help a Klingon spaceship attack the USS Enterprise without being detected. Nonetheless, scientists are getting ever closer to fabricating the first practical invisibility cloaks. In the past, scientists have experimented with different metamaterials that can direct and control the propagation and transmission of specified parts of the light spectrum \u2013 and could be used to render an object seemingly invisible. Last month, scientists at the University of St Andrews in Scotland led by Dr Andrea Di Falco reported the creation of a flexible cloaking material they call &quot;Metaflex&quot;, which may bring commercial and industrial applications significantly closer. Now the journal Nature has revealed that two separate groups \u2013 one based in Singapore and the other at the University of Birmingham and Imperial College London \u2013 have made objects each a few centimetres in diameter invisible. They credit the special properties of calcite crystals \u2013 and calcite is a cheap and common mineral made of calcium carbonate. &quot;Carpet cloaks&quot; \u2013 scientists&apos; preferred term \u2013 render covered objects invisible by bending light rays as they enter the cloak and then when they exit it. Calcite has special optical properties and in this instance light is bent in such a way that the rays seem to have been reflected directly from the ground below the object \u2013 as though it was not there, in other words. The team at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) has built a calcite carpet cloak that can shield a small steel wedge measuring 38mm by 2mm from red, green and blue visible light. It is designed to work under water. &quot;I think governments could make a lot of use out of a cloak that can hide objects on the seabed, although I won&apos;t speculate on exactly what they may want to hide,&quot; George Barbastathis, a mechanical engineer who helped develop the Smart cloak, told Nature. Cloaking devices are keenly awaited and coveted by the military. Defence chiefs believe such devices will usher in a new age of stealth technology and allow them to hide planes, ships, spacecraft, tanks and other vehicles from radar. More advanced versions could ultimately be good enough to make objects or troops invisible to observers, it is believed. The Birmingham and Imperial team, led by theoretical physicist Sir John Pendry, a pioneer in this field, has constructed a calcite cloak that manages to hide objects that are several centimetres in height. Their cloak only works in the air. Hopes of developing fully functional invisibility cloaks in the near future have been further boosted by the fact that both the Singapore and London devices turned out to be much cheaper to make than earlier attempts. Those first versions were built using intricately fabricated and highly expensive silicon microstructures. By contrast, the materials needed to make the Smart team&apos;s cloak cost less than \u00a31,000, according to Baile Zhang, another member of the team, because calcite is inexpensive. &quot;It&apos;s not quite easy enough to make at home, but it&apos;s not too far off,&quot; Zhang said. One of the concerns about cloaking used to be that people would only be able to cloak microsize objects. But according to physicist Michal Lipson of Cornell University, New York, these new breakthroughs point to an exciting future. &quot;We are close to cloaking objects that we are familiar with in everyday life,&quot; Lipson said.

It was a victory for perennial underdogs and, more importantly, a city that has suffered terribly in recent years. 25 Dustin Johnson&apos;s club Johnson took a one-shot lead on to the 18th tee of the final round of the USPGA Championship at Whistling Straits but bogeyed the hole and was set for a three-man play\u2011off. Eagle-eyed officials, however, had other plans, penalising him two strokes for grounding his club in a bunker that had about as much sand in it as a six-inch square of glasspaper. Johnson had not realised he was in a sand trap but his descent to fifth meant he would not risk grounding his club within a mile of a cat litter box in future. 26 Dutch fans&apos; orange dresses Looking this foxy shouldn&apos;t be a crime, unless Fifa are in town and you&apos;ve been arrested and incarcerated for the heinous crime of wearing an orange mini-dress deemed to be \u2013 shock, horror \u2013 advertising a non-designated Fifa-unfriendly lager.

The player, nicknamed &quot;Brain Dead&quot;, was dropped, fined and banned from driving. 36 A Jabulani The official match ball for South Africa 2010, the Jabulani was subjected to almost universal criticism from those forced to play with it, the surprise exceptions being footballers on lucrative sponsorship deals with its manufacturer. 37 Jessica Ennis&apos;s javelin The reigning heptathlon world champion was under pressure at the European Championships and needed a good performance in one of her weaker events.

For makan is to eat; and eat (and eat) you will, about seven times a day if you follow local customs. Chances are, though, you&apos;ll still leave with that niggling feeling that you&apos;ve missed some great eating experiences, such is the range and quality of food on offer. The unsung culinary hero of Asia, Malaysia is surely the most gastronomically diverse country in the region. Its position on the spice run meant it attracted Chinese traders and labourers and Indians who came to work the land - today the population includes around two-thirds Malays, just under a third Chinese, and an Indian community of around 15%. A time under Portugese rule in the 1500s (before the Dutch came, and subsequently, the British, who invaded in the 18th Century), brought cooking techniques and ingredients such as tamarind and chilli, and the Arabic recipes that accompanied traders joined numerous Chinese and Indian regional cuisines - and the original Malay cooking style - to create a gloriously heady mix. Throw in influences from nearby Thailand and Indonesia and it&apos;s easy to see why there&apos;s a huge variety of cuisines across the country, with many states boasting their own specialities and classic dishes. Terengganu     Keropok lekor vendor. Photograph: Susan Smillie for the Guardian    Some 400km from Kuala Lumpur, Terengganu is perched on the east coast state of Peninsular Malaysia facing nearby Thailand, and the latter&apos;s culinary presence is keenly felt here in dishes such as nasi dagang with its mix of Thai jasmine rice and glutinous rice, and in the numerous Thai stalls and restaurants dotted around. The regional speciality is keropok lekor, a ubiquitous dense sausage made from sago flour dough and pounded fish. Though it can be served boiled, I&apos;d recommend you try it fried and smothered in spicy sauce. Skip your hotel&apos;s offerings in the morning and head straight to Central Market. You&apos;ll find a dizzying array of sweet breakfast treats, such as a gorgeous custard-like akok (eggs, palm sugar, and coconut), delicious tarts pimped with pandam leaf, a speciality of the east coast, that tastes a lot nicer than the lurid green appearance suggests.  Other traditional breakfast offerings are Pulut lepa, banana leaf containing boiled fish, onion, chillies and coconut, barbecued and rolled in rice. My favourite was paung goreng: glutinous rice balls with fish cooked in creamy coconut milk and reduced down - sticky balls of savoury sweet deliciousness. If the sweet rice dishes are a bit much, try some interesting fruits - salak (snakeskin), reminiscient of lychee and pineapple; dokong, like a mini sweet grapefruit; khadeh, an unusually furry berry that melts on the tongue; or the lovely sweet/sharp manggis, which opens to expose garlic-like segments. It&apos;s also worth trying jering rebus, a boiled fruit with the look and texture - though unfortunately not the taste - of chestnuts. I would best describe them as challenging, though they were as nothing compared to the infamous durian fruit, spiky on the outside, creamy within, loved by thousands, hated - and banned - by most Malaysian hotels, for its pungent smell. In fact it doesn&apos;t taste bad, though I preferred it cooked. Where to stay: Felda Residence, Kuala Terengganu, from \u00a350 a night Melaka Resting where the Indian and Pacific oceans meet, and strategically sat between the capitals of Malaysia and Singapore, the city was always a significant port and a magnet for Arab and Chinese traders and there&apos;s a large Chinese population here today. A marriage between princess Hang Li Po and the Sultan of Malacca formed the first permanent Chinese settlement, and gave rise to Nyonya cooking - a distinctive marriage of Chinese and Malaysian styles. Melaka Nyonyas, with their proximity to Indonesia, have a liking for sweet flavours and classic, crowd pleasing dishes such as lemak nenas - prawns and pineapple cooked in coconut milk, reflect this. Ayam pong the, a braised chicken dish made with fermented soy bean paste, and palm sugar, is another staple. The version we tried was fairly mild, but that&apos;s not to say Melakans don&apos;t like heat - we enjoyed a fabulously spicy okra salad and cincalok omelette, with prawn and chilli paste at Kenny Chan&apos;s Peranakan cookery school, (well worth attending for Kenny&apos;s enthusiasm and knowledge of Nyonya history as well as the cooking). Down river, at a little restaurant called Tarragon (42A &amp; 44A Lorong Hang Jebat), came a dish I still occasionally dream about - ikan chuan chuan, deep fried red snapper in preserved bean curd with ginger and lime: here was moist white flesh encased in perfect crispy skin atop a sticky sweet sour sauce with a suggestion of chilli heat. I&apos;d go back for that dish alone. Afterwards, you can always head for street market Jonker Walk, for a heart stopping fix of deep fried ice cream from one of the stalls - not, I should add, a Malaysian speciality. Where to stay: Hotel Puri Melaka from \u00a355 a night Kota Kinabalu/Sabah Fish and seafood hauled from the South China sea are the stars in hot and steamy Malaysian Borneo, supported by freshwater fish and prawns from inland rivers. Try kam heong la la (stir-fried fragrant clams), or perhaps some soft shell crab in Kampung Nelayan, a floating restaurant where you choose your dinner from the tank in which it forlornly stares back out at you. I was unconvinced by the entertainment on stage, but that&apos;s probably because it distracted from the excellent food. Another Sabah must-try is sayur manis (&apos;Sabah vegetable&apos;): ferns that only grow locally, often cooked with shrimp paste, they&apos;re terrifically crunchy and slightly sweet. In Kota Kinabalu, stop at a kedai kopi (coffee shop) and ask for the chefs&apos; speciality (most don&apos;t offer menus, specialising in few dishes) before heading for the local market, Tamu Donggongon. It&apos;s vibrant and busy, loud with music and chatter between stallholders who camp until they&apos;ve sold their wares. And with its piles of glistening fresh and dried fish and colourful spice mountains, it&apos;s a great spot for those who love pointing a camera at ingredients. The caged squirrels and bagged live frogs and turtles might distress some; the latter are apparently sold for release, bringing good karma to the buyer; the squirrels&apos; fate is presumably less rosy. Where to stay: Pacific Sutera Hotel, Sutera Harbour, suteraharbour.com from \u00a3112 a night Penang     Georgetown, Penang Island. Photograph: Bob Krist/Corbis    When I asked Eating Asia bloggers Dave Hagerman and Robyn Eckhardt where in Penang Chinatown was, I was gently corrected. &quot;Penang is Chinatown&quot;, they smiled patiently. Like Melaka, there&apos;s a large Chinese population - Nyonya cooking is common here, too, though more influenced by Thailand&apos;s sour notes and hot chilies than in Melaka - and days are easily whiled away slurping delicious wan tan mee, with its glorious combination of noodles, submerged dumplings and slivers of scarlet edged pork, or enjoying a little laksa on Love Lane, where the rich men&apos;s mistresses were kept. As everyone will tell you, the thing to do is to lose yourself among the bustling hawker stands in Gurney Drive or New Lane for some blistering sambals or char kway teow, served sizzling from woks, but try to squeeze in a visit to Teik Seng on Lebuh Carnarvon, for a fix of double cooked pork and long beans, especially joyful if you&apos;ve eschewed the glorious pig while travelling in much of Malaysia. As is the case elsewhere in Malaysia, there&apos;s a sizeable Indian population in Penang and we feasted happily on sidewalks from morning to night on wonderful steaming idli, cashew rawa tosia, masala uthapam. Penang really is a city for food lovers - I joined dozens of obsessives queuing for nasi kandar, a local speciality of rice with fried chicken, curried spleen, cubed beef and fish roe, flooded with a mix of curry sauces. It was at 1am and there were whole families there. Where to stay: Yeng Keng Hotel, yengkenghotel.com.my. Heritage boutique hotel in heart of George Town, from \u00a378 a night Langkawi     Ais Kacang. Photograph: Susan Smillie for the Guardian    If you&apos;re indecisive of a morning, you may be torn between two classic Malaysian breakfast staples - roti canai, the delicious flaky pancakes (spun to great effect here), or nasi lemak, rice steamed in coconut water, typically served with anchovies, eggs and sauce and wrapped in banana leaves (or in newspaper parcels as I had it in Langkawi). Pair one of these dishes with the sweet frothiness of a teh tarik (pulled tea), especially if you&apos;ve overindulged the night before and need an energy shot. Also good for this purpose is ais kacang, a slightly baffling mix of beans, shaved ice, perhaps some sweetcorn, and flavoured syrup and jelly, (to be frank, this was an experience I only really wanted once). For dinner, pass the many tourist restaurants on Patai Cenang and head for the small diners. I found a great little place called Okay Boss! behind the market in Pantai Cenang, run by the incredibly genial Mr Bakaruddin from Melaka, who&apos;s very proud of his native fiery fish dish, asam pedas, as well he should be. On the slightly higher end, the Bon Ton resort&apos;s restaurant, The Nam, comes recommended by Rick Stein, no less, for its excellent offerings of Malay and Western dishes, as does Siti Fatimah&apos;s Malay-style buffet. But rest assured, you don&apos;t really need to go armed with tips from top chefs, for wherever you are in Malaysia, you won&apos;t struggle to find good food, you may just struggle to eat it all.

The European project has a sturdiness of its own developed over years of meticulous construction; it pours balm over the tensions and sensitivities that lie beneath. The current juncture is a critical one, not because the economy is in trouble, but because being together has lost its lustre. Though it might remain the perfectly rational option, that spark of excitement is gone. The problem is both psychological and real. Psychological because Europe is in relative decline and its politics geared towards decline management and cushioning the blow. The mode is a defensive one. For a mortal in the throes of a mid-life crisis, there are usually two recommendations \u2013 find better ways of tackling stress, forsake alcohol, take up yoga or, alternatively \u2013 concede that you are no longer young and see this as an opportunity to take stock and maybe change the way your life&apos;s going: broaden your interests, travel, go back to school, try a new sport. Watch your kids or grandchildren grow. Up until now, Europe has always avoided the above options and keeps undergoing rejuvenation therapy, playing the eternal youngster on the block. This was the logic behind the Lisbon treaty and the climate agenda. And once it overhauls its system of macroeconomic governance towards closer fiscal co-ordination, it will have to tackle structural challenges like those of the continent&apos;s changing demographics. Though it&apos;s never a bad idea to exercise, the Europe that I dream about is one at ease with itself. We should be under no illusions. Barring major disasters, Europe is going to have to make place at the table for China, India and other emerging powers. Sliding from a 25% share in the world population in 1900 to a projected 5% in 2050, it simply can&apos;t have the same scale of influence. It would also help if we realised that there is an awful lot that we can learn from the outside world. Consensus is strong in Europe that growth will have to come from innovation and entrepreneurship. In terms of improving our &quot;growth&quot; infrastructures, especially universities, and making progress on the commercialisation of knowledge, there is a lot that countries like Singapore, Australia or the US can teach us. This doesn&apos;t mean we should sit idle and look on as others leap into the limelight. It&apos;s more about preparing ourselves for a long march during which the strength and stamina of our political, economic and social model will come to the fore as others overstretch themselves and run aground. Europe has some of the best governance models when it comes to healthcare and social policy: these will become our strongest hand as others in the world begin to face growing expectations from their own peoples and electorates as well as evolving demographic trends. Europe should go back to basics \u2013 grow the core. Domestically, this means first of all exploiting the single market to the hilt. When we look back, this is clearly one of the big European success stories. Nevertheless, it&apos;s shocking the number of obstacles and barriers erected that prevent it from reaching cruising altitude. Over half of Europe&apos;s entrepreneurs report they encounter difficulties in selling goods to other member states, not to say anything about services or capital flows. It&apos;s time to fight back. The core agenda also means remaining faithful to our values and working on improving European political systems. In times of crisis, the state of democracy is usually the last thing people worry about. And yet, there&apos;s a lot that should be done to modernise the world of public accountability and responsibility in Europe. Out of many ways for Europe to exercise its influence, being an attractive model of governance is one of the most durable and effective. We should embrace it. Finally, going back to basics is about turning our attention first to our neighbours and candidates for membership. The impressive progress made by countries like Turkey is an opportunity for the union to consolidate its sway with its neighbour. EU membership is still the biggest game in town in Ankara, although clearly not the only one. The EU will very soon run out of chapters to open in its accession talks with the Muslim power. The moment of truth is coming, and we have everything to regret if we miss it. There is nothing wrong with living in an increasingly diverse world. While based in London for several years, I was reminded of the remark by Dean Acheson that Britain&apos;s loss of empire left it without a role. This remark, which continues to resonate in Britain, could now be applied to Europe, also. Just as Britain is doing pretty well without an empire, so too will Europe without a realm of grand ideas. \u2022 For this collaborative series Comment is free and Presseurop have asked several writers to share their thoughts on Europe"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/31/uk-business-review-2010", "sentences": ["In November, a Rolls-Royce engine blew up on a Qantas A380 and Qantas subsequently grounded its entire fleet of A380s and threatened to sue Rolls-Royce, while Singapore Airlines recalled three of its superjumbos."], "publicationDate": "2010-12-31T07:00:03Z", "title": "Golden goodbyes, silver linings, bankers' cash and Icelandic ash", "tags": ["Business", "BP", "Reckitt Benckiser", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Marks & Spencer", "Marc Bolland", "Retail industry", "Morrisons", "Michael Geoghegan", "HSBC", "Banco Santander", "Barclays", "Bob Diamond", "Sir Stuart Rose", "Sir Terry Leahy", "Tesco", "Betfair", "Ocado", "Connaught", "Cadbury", "Mondel\u0113z", "General Motors", "ITV", "EMI", "Toyota", "Prudential", "Rolls-Royce", "Asil Nadir", "Media", "Adam Crozier", "BBC", "Archie Norman", "Iceland Foods"], "article": "A volcanic ash cloud shut down airspace over Britain for six days; an oil-rig explosion knocked \u00a320bn off the value of the UK&apos;s largest company, and the eurozone finished the year on the brink of collapse. Whatever other ups and downs 2010 has offered corporate Britain, disasters have loomed large. But while Tony Hayward no doubt believes this year has been one to forget, others are having a very good recession. There has been an almost complete overhaul at the top at the UK&apos;s biggest banks, and significant changes at retailers, too. Meanwhile, some features of the corporate landscape have disappeared, including well-known brands, and others have made unexpected comebacks. Still making a packet Any chief executive worth his or her salt has been adopting the mantra of the chancellor, George Osborne, and insisting to staff that we all share the burden in these straitened times. For some, that is a hard argument to make. Bart Becht, chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, for instance, took home \u00a390m last year, it was revealed in April. To be fair, most of it came in shares awarded more than 10 years ago, but it was still a reminder that some have bigger nest eggs to tide them over in tough times. Becht&apos;s pay package was the standout corporate excess story of the year. However, it was not a freakish occurrence. Analysis from Incomes Data Services, out in October, revealed that the pay of FTSE 100 directors went up by 55% in the year to June. A lot of that came from share options \u2013 but even after stripping that out, FTSE 100 board salaries rose 3.6%. &quot;It is as though the recession never happened,&quot; said Steve Tatton, director of IDS. Others toasting 2010 include Adam Crozier, who took home \u00a33.5m from Royal Mail when he left to join ITV in April; Mark Byford, who is due to leave the BBC with a payoff of as much as two years&apos; salary after being made redundant in October; Marc Bolland, lured from Morrisons to Marks &amp; Spencer with the promise of \u00a315m; and Mike Geoghegan, who leaves HSBC with a package worth \u00a317m in cash and shares. Tough times, indeed. Headhunters busy Many of the UK&apos;s biggest companies have seen a change at the top in 2010. Geoghegan&apos;s departure grabbed the attention: with his finance director, Douglas Flint, being elevated above him in the pecking order and prompting an unseemly media dispute over who said what and when, and who threatened or did not threaten to resign. HSBC failed to shed much light on the exact turn of events but regardless, Geoghegan has gone, former chairman Stephen Green has joined the government, the finance director is now the chairman and former investment banking head Stuart Gulliver becomes the bank&apos;s chief executive at the start of 2011. It was a busy year for all top financial services headhunters. Lloyds surprised everyone by plucking Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio from Santander to replace the longstanding boss Eric Daniels, and Barclays appointed Bob Diamond, the already well-remunerated Barclays Capital chief executive, as its new boss. In the retail world, Sir Stuart Rose left M&amp;S and gave way to Bolland. But perhaps more significantly, Tesco said farewell to Sir Terry Leahy and hello to Philip Clarke. When Leahy took over in 1997, Tesco was worth \u00a34bn. It is worth more than \u00a331bn today. No pressure there, then. Floats that sank The FTSE 100 ended 2009 at 5411, and had risen to 5971 yesterday. But it has not all been plain sailing on the markets. Despite surging equities, a few flotations fell distinctly flat in 2010. Betfair and Ocado were both firms that flopped after they floated: Betfair is down below \u00a310 after launching at \u00a313 and rising above \u00a316 after trading began, while Ocado has lost about 10% of its flotation price of 180p. Neither, though, were quite as spectacular as the performance of Promethean World \u2013 a maker of interactive whiteboard technology which says its purpose is &quot;lighting the flame of learning&quot;. The company floated at \u00a32, and was down to almost 50p in December, a scarcely believable 75% drop in value. Disappearing acts &quot;How will the Santander rebrand affect you?&quot; a personal finance magazine asked in January as the Spanish bank began removing the Bradford &amp; Bingley, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Abbey brands from our high streets. &quot;Not very much&quot; was the likely answer, though some may shed a tear at the loss of B&amp;B&apos;s bowler-hatted insignia. Another famous name disappearing from UK corporate life \u2013 but maybe not for long \u2013 was Pontin&apos;s. The holiday company went into administration in November, and at the time of writing is still seeking a buyer. Construction and support services were also in upheaval: Connaught sank into administration in September, followed by Rok in November. And it was a farewell of a different sort in January as chocolate maker Cadbury&apos;s ownership fell into the hands of the US food group Kraft: a move that meant waving goodbye to some British corporate tax revenue too, as it emerged in December that the company was relocating some of its key functions to Switzerland. Comebacks For some, 2010 was a year of renewal, and of re-emergence after long hibernation \u2013 including Archie Norman. After a political career of limited success and a series of small deals since he stepped down as chairman of Asda in 2000, Norman took on the chairman&apos;s job at ITV on 1 January. He set about trying to revive the ailing broadcaster, bringing in Adam Crozier as chief executive. Another great comeback of 2010 was the revival of General Motors. The maker of Buicks and Cadillacs and owner of Vauxhall went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009, but came storming back on to the market in November of 2010. It even declared a profit, for the first time in three years, in May. Prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office were toasting a very different sort of comeback: the return to Britain of former Polly Peck chief executive Asil Nadir. Nadir said in August that he was coming back to get a fair trial. Polly Peck folded in 1990 and Nadir was charged with theft and false accounting but fled to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus rather than go to court; he will complete his full comeback in October 2011, assuming prosecutors can get near the 20-year-old paperwork involved. Corporate crises 2010 has, above all, been a year of disasters, natural and otherwise. Snow has disrupted businesses across retail, aviation and sectors further afield not once but twice. Toyota said in February it would recall almost half a million hybrid cars worldwide, including 8,500 of its Prius model in the UK, following a string of safety scares. In April, an explosion on BP&apos;s Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers, with the Macondo well blowout going on to become the biggest accidental marine oil spill in history (see box below). In June, the insurance group Prudential was in the spotlight after dropping its takeover approach to AIG, having incurred \u00a3450m in costs. In November, a Rolls-Royce engine blew up on a Qantas A380 and Qantas subsequently grounded its entire fleet of A380s and threatened to sue Rolls-Royce, while Singapore Airlines recalled three of its superjumbos. As investigations continue, the engineering company has issued a profits warning. It was a disastrous year for EMI and Guy Hands. Not only did the music group reveal a \u00a31.75bn loss in February, but Hands was then humbled in a New York court as he tried to blame his advisers, Citigroup, for him overpaying for EMI. But perhaps the most unexpected crisis of the year was one which happened earlier, and which encouraged many to brush up their Icelandic pronunciation. Those in the airline industry are still likely to remember how to say Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. The volcano&apos;s explosion in April and subsequent ash cloud caused flights to be grounded across Britain as well as elsewhere in northern Europe, leading to significant losses for the airline industry. &quot;Perhaps this is nature&apos;s way of telling us all to slow down a little,&quot; said a contributor to the BBC&apos;s website. With mergers and acquisitions activity starting to grow, however, the eurozone crisis unresolved and a host of new chief executives eager to make their mark, slowing down looks likely to be the last thing to happen in 2011. BP&apos;s hard year BP entered 2010 in a state of enormous optimism. Tony Hayward was showing himself to be an astute chief executive, who was concentrating on the core business, and eschewing the grand gestures enjoyed by his predecessor John Browne. The commercial environment was looking encouraging. The oil price had bounced back from $40 ber barrel lows and demand was beginning to recover nicely allong with global economic growth. the company was beginning to benefit from internal cost-cutting and a wide range of exploration and production opportunities \u2013 not least in the Gulf of Mexico, where it had already established a dominant position. But an explosion on 20 April changed everything for Hayward, BP and the wider oil industry. The blowout on board the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers and caused the worst oil spill in American history. The ensuing environmental damage to the southern coast of the US created a political firestorm that embroiled Barack Obama, eventually cost Hayward his job and torched the reputation of his company. Unfortunate comments by the BP boss at the height of the crisis, such as &quot;I want my life back&quot;, are likely to live in the public mind for decades to come \u2013 longer perhaps than the company itself as an independent force. While BP had begun the year looking for potential takeover targets, it ended 2010 the butt of stock market rumours that it could soon be on the end of a bid from its arch-rival Shell. Over the past 12 months, BP&apos;s share price has fallen from a high of 658p to a low of 296p and now stands at about 469p under the new leadership of Bob Dudley, its first American boss. And with $20bn (\u00a313bn) put aside to deal with future liabilities from the Gulf spill, the oil company has been looking to sell off at least an equal value of assets. There has been speculation that Riverstone Holdings, the New York-based private equity house that Lord Browne, BP&apos;s former chief executive, is involved with, is among the potential bidders for its liquefied natural gas assets in Canada.
