The jungle camp harks back to the days of 19th-century explorer Paul Neis, who led expeditions into the region for the French government. The location chosen for Shangri-Lao is believed to be the exact spot where Neis camped in 1883, a couple of miles downstream from Xieng Lom village, and it will resemble his camp, with period-style furniture, hardwood floors and a bathtub. Adventurers can take guided hikes into the beautiful Huay Sae River Valley, which leads to the Tad Sae Falls, go bamboo rafting, elephant- and horse-riding, then chill out and listen to the jungle from the sun terrace, Jacuzzi or spa pool before dinner. Shangri-Lao is the only company allowed to operate treks in the area: it takes its conservation responsibilities seriously, and works closely with the indigenous people. \u2022 +856 71 252417, shangri-lao.com. Buffalo Tours (020-8545 2830, buffalotours.co.uk) offers the experience from \u00a31,439pp for four nights at the new camp, including international flights, transfers and treks.  Ski chalet with style We&apos;d love to sneak in an early January ski weekend, and La Clusaz, a sweet little French resort just an hour from Geneva, was already tempting. It&apos;s handy for the airport, with enough terrain to keep skiers busy for a few days, despite being petite. Now the Au Coeur du Village Hotel &amp; Spa has opened, we&apos;re convinced. Pine-panelled rooms with furry throws and cushions, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the slopes, open fires, good nosh and a spa ... a star-quality hotel in a little-known resort, just a few hours from home. \u2022 Au Coeur du Village (+33 4 5001 5001, hotel-aucoeurduvillage.fr/en) has doubles from \u20ac170 half-board  New Oz rail route Australia&apos;s Great Southern Rail company, which operates luxury trains on routes including the famous Ghan from north to south, the Indian-Pacific, and the Overland, from Adelaide to Melbourne, is launching a new route, the Southern Spirit, next month. The train will travel through the Great Dividing Range and Australia&apos;s south-east, between Brisbane and Adelaide (six days) or Melbourne (five days), calling at the Grampians, Albury-Wodonga on the Murray River, Taronga Western Plains Zoo, the Hunter Valley, Port Macquarie and Byron Bay. \u2022 There will be two Southern Spirit departures in each direction from February (thesouthernspirit.com.au). Austravel (0800 988 4834, austravel.com) has a new Adelaide, Southern Spirit and Brisbane tour, departing 22 February for nine nights, including Singapore Airlines flights from Heathrow to Adelaide and Brisbane to Heathrow, two nights&apos; four-star hotel accommodation in both Adelaide and Brisbane, five nights on the Southern Spirit in traditional twin cabins, meals and all off-train tours, for \u00a33,259pp Snowshoeing in Lebanon Lebanon&apos;s appeal just grows in leaps and bounds, but we tend to hear more about the food and Beirut&apos;s nightlife than winter sports, even though the country has stupendous mountains. Explore&apos;s new five-day holiday will mean leaps and bounds for you, too: it includes a two-day snowshoe adventure in the Shouf Cedar reserve, plus a visit to the monasteries of the Qadisha valley and time in the capital. \u2022 \u00a3549pp without flights, \u00a31,017 with, January and February departures, explore.co.uk SPRING Buenos Aires culture Described as one of the world&apos;s best cities, Buenos Aires should be on every traveller&apos;s wishlist. Wood-grilled parrillas (barbecues); sultry tango clubs; streets teeming with galleries, cafes, fleamarkets and jazz clubs; riverboat rides into the Tigre delta ... it would be easy to spend weeks here, or you could push out of the city and stay on a rural ranch. There&apos;s an extra reason to visit this year with the launch of new direct British Airways flights (they used to go via S\u00e3o Paulo), from 27 March, from \u00a3749 return if you book by 25 January. You&apos;ll probably want to save as much money as possible for pampas-fed steak and Malbec (or eat in on of the city&apos;s &quot;secret&quot; restaurants if you&apos;re on a budget), while still staying somewhere stylish. The Cocker is the perfect compromise: an affordable art nouveau townhouse with roof garden and tango studio, in the bohemian San Telmo district. \u2022 Doubles at the Cocker cost \u00a365 per night B&amp;B (i-escape.com) Middle East mini-adventure     Amman, Jordan. Photograph: Alison Wright/CORBIS    Hurrah! We love Jordan, but flying there is usually expensive. From March, new Easyjet flights from Gatwick to the capital Amman mean this captivating city will now be a viable low-cost option for a magical Middle East break. There are several Roman sites and museums to visit, fantastic restaurants at both ends of the scale, authentic hammams, and even an arty neighbourhood, Rainbow Street, where you can potter around bookshops and cafes. Those staying longer than a couple of days could visit the mosaics in Madaba, 35km away, or the public hot springs at Ma&apos;In on the road to the Dead Sea. There are no boutique hotels to speak of in Amman yet, though there are exciting plans afoot for one from Wild Jordan, a branch of the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature, which intends to convert an old house above its visitor centre by 2012. Until then the Alqasr Metropole (+962 6 568 9671, alqasrmetropole.com, doubles from \u00a390, book through rscn.org.jo to get 10% off) in residential Shmeisani has 70 smart simple rooms, local artworks and a rooftop restaurant. The friendly Shepherd Hotel (+962 6 463 9197, shepherd-hotel.com, \u00a355) is popular with British travellers, or splash out on the Grand Hyatt Amman (amman.grand.hyatt.com, \u00a3168). \u2022 Flights (easyjet.com) from around \u00a3112 return, available from 27 March. More info from visitjordan.com  SUMMER Lodge-to-lodge kayaking on Lake Tahoe It&apos;s January now, so our thoughts are turning towards doing something active later in the year. Maybe we&apos;re not quite ready to sign away our evenings to a rowing machine, but a kayaking adventure around Lake Tahoe in California? Hell, yeah! This is the largest mountain lake in North American (22 miles by 12), and though better known here for ski resorts, in summer it is a stunning spot for a paddle-powered pootle. White sand beaches ring its shores, and paths thread off into the wilds for hiking, biking, and do-what-you-liking. The water is so clear \u2013 99.9% \u2013 that it&apos;s possible to see a 10 inch white dinner plate 23m below the surface (somebody tested that we&apos;re sure). The best way to explore it all is by kayak of course, and a new trip with the Tahoe Adventure Company (+1 530 913 9212, tahoeadventurecompany.com) lets you do it at length, and in style, paddling from lodge to lodge for between two and four days in May, June and September from $520pp. \u2022 Virgin Holidays (0844 557 3859, virginholidays.co.uk) has a 10-night fly-drive trip including flights from Heathrow to San Francisco and car hire from \u00a3694pp  Luxury wine break in Porto This gorgeous Portuguese city has lots to recommend it: fantastic wine and port cellars; Rem Koolhaas&apos;s architectural masterpiece, the Casa da Musica; the crumbling medieval streets, cafes and bars of the Cais de Ribeira riverfront area. Now there is a new luxury accommodation option too, the Yeatman wine hotel, which opened late last year in Vila Nova de Gaia on the south bank of the Douro, beside one of the city&apos;s grand old port houses. We expect bon vivants and wine-buffs to flock there for the 25,000-bottle wine cellar (tours available), as well as the wine-themed Caudalie Vinoth\u00e9rapie Spa. The rooms are elegant and colourfully painted, with generous balconies looking over to the old town. Some rooms have statement beds made from wine barrels. Start here then add a few days on the beach. \u2022 The Yeatman (+351 22 013 3100, the-yeatman-hotel.com) has doubles from about \u00a3273. More info from gooporto.com Beach escape     Meganissi, Greece    A Greek island hideaway would do the trick come summer, and CV Travel has three new villas on the teeny Ionian island of Meganissi, which used to have very little quality accommodation. The Muses Villas \u2013 Erato and Clio sleeping four, and Urania sleeping two \u2013 are close to two quiet beaches, with private pools. \u2022 Villas from \u00a31,560 a week sleeping two, \u00a32,180 sleeping four, including car hire (020-7401 1026, cvtravel.co.uk)   Camping in Bolivia     Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Photograph: John Warburton-Lee/Corbis    How about a holiday under canvas near one of the world&apos;s most astounding natural attractions? A new tented camp opens this year in Jirira, at the northern edge of the Salar de Uyuni, the world&apos;s largest salt flat, where guests will be able to watch the sun setting over the spectacular expanse of white. A stay there is included in a nine-night high-altitude adventure with Bales. Guests arrive to find fancy (heated!) tents already set up, with proper beds, private bathrooms in adjacent tents, and a chef cooking dinner. The adventure begins in Lima, Peru, and also takes in Lake Titicaca and La Paz. \u2022 From \u00a32,145pp, daily departures April-November, including flights, transfers, sightseeing, English-speaking guide, accommodation and some meals (0845 057 1819, balesworldwide.com) AUTUMN New York, new hotels     Yotel, New York    There&apos;s nothing special about 2011, we always want to go to New York, but this year it should be slightly easier to stick to a budget with the opening of several new low-end but high-style hotels. By way of sushi and airport hotels, Yotel (from the group behind Yo! Sushi) is due to open in Manhattan \u2013 its first outside the usual airport locations \u2013 with 669 cabins on Times Square, at 42nd Street and 10th Avenue, in a massive complex that will also contain residential properties and the Signature Theatre, designed by Frank Gehry. The 170sq ft cabins have rain showers, mood lighting, flatscreen TVs and Wi-Fi, and will cost from $150 per night, opening this spring (yotel.com). Aloft (starwoodhotels.com/alofthotels, doubles from $209 a night) has opened a loft-apartment-style hotel in Harlem, now one of the city&apos;s hottest areas for food and music. It claims to be the district&apos;s first new hotel in 40 years, and is handy for Columbia University and the Apollo Theatre. The hippest new option, however, could be the Nolitan (nolitanhotel.com, doubles from $323 a night), the first luxury boutique hotel in Nolita (an abbreviation for the downtown district that sits just North of Little Italy), an area that may be one to watch this year \u2013 it borders SoHo, Chinatown, the Bowery and the Lower East Side. The hotel has skateboards and bikes to borrow, a rooftop sundeck, flatscreen TVs, iPods and rain showers, and is targeting a hipster crowd, but the look is refined, with 55 simple oak-floored rooms and floor to ceiling windows, some with freestanding baths. Meteor shower in Turkey Looking at the stars and trying to comprehend the universe isn&apos;t a bad way to escape normal life, and we&apos;d love to witness the Draconid meteor shower, due on 8 October, and set to be one of the best meteor showers for years. These dust filaments, left by a comet called the 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, may be visible at a rate of a few hundred an hour as they hit the earth&apos;s atmosphere, and are sure to look dazzling, especially when witnessed in the spectacular setting of Cappadocia in Turkey. One of a series of astronomy tours being introduced by adventure operator Explorers takes in the event, in a package called the Rain of Shooting Stars. It departs on 4 October, accompanied by a &quot;galactic ranger&quot;, astronomer Dr John Mason. \u2022 An eight-day trip with Explorers (0845 609 1591, astronomytours.co.uk) costs \u00a31,299 inlcuding flights  NEXT WINTER Private island in Cambodia With rooms at $700 a night, we suspect this one will remain unticked on the wishlist forever, but if you got a bundle for Christmas, check out the Song Saa private island (songsaa.com) in the Koh Rong archipelago, opening in November. With 25 villas on two pristine islands (over the water, in the rainforest or on the beach), plus thatched roof lounges and sundecks with circular day beds and a spa, it&apos;s the one to lust after. Northern lights We still haven&apos;t seen the Aurora Borealis. If you haven&apos;t either, now is the time. The lights are about to enter the most active period of their 11-year cycle. Plenty of places boast high-frequency sightings, including Iceland, Kiruna in Sweden, and Yellowknife in Canada. Discover the World (discover-the-world.co.uk) has a three-night self-drive aurora-hunting trip to Iceland from September from \u00a3320pp including accommodation at the fantastic Hotel Ranga and 4WD hire (excludes flights). Flights start from around \u00a3224.  Paris like a prince If we wanted to show off to someone we liked this year, we&apos;d whisk them away to one of the super-swanky hotels set to open in Paris. We&apos;d consider fashion house Maison Martin Margiela&apos;s redesign of the Maison Champs-Elys\u00e9es (lamaisonchampselysees.com, doubles from \u20ac225), with 10 rooms and seven suites, plus a haute cuisine restaurant (due to reopen on 1 February). But we might prefer to stay out at Versailles, where, at the end of the year, the 23-room Hotel du Grand Contr\u00f4le will open in the palace grounds in a building that used to house its treasurers

The 16-year-old, who scored seven perfect 10s \u2013 for the second time in his career \u2013 to take individual gold at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi last year, says he would not even contemplate stepping on to the diving board at the aquatics centre in the Olympic Park unless he was confident he could score a 10. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t like to compete a dive unless I know I can get a 10 on it,&quot; said Daley, reflecting on his approach to winning a medal in 2012. &quot;That&apos;s what my theory is. Sometimes in a competition you know that you have to score a 10 to win, but if you&apos;ve never scored it or done it in training then you would stand on the end of the board thinking that you can&apos;t do it. You have to go into it believing that you can score a 10 on every dive that you do.&quot; Daley, who for many years was unable to practise some of the more difficult dives because of his age, instead developed a reputation for a high level of execution. He will hope to rely on this strength while expanding his dive list in 2011 to include two new dives in preparation for 2012. These new moves he plans to road test at the national championships before working them into his routine to defend his world title in Shanghai in July. The world championships will form part of the qualification process for the Olympics. &quot;It&apos;s a massive year,&quot; Daley said. &quot;This\u00a0is where I&apos;m going to get my experience from. I have to use my new dives as much as possible because next year I&apos;ll only have a few competitions before the\u00a0Olympics.&quot; If he does manage to perfect the two new dives, Daley will be able to rival the best in the world not just in terms of execution, but also difficulty. &quot;As far as I know it will be the equal hardest that anyone will be doing, though this year you could well see some Chinese diver coming out and doing the most insane list. The way diving has come on \u2013 in the last five years even \u2013 is insane. The winning score at the Beijing Olympics was 538, at the world championships in Rome [2009] it was 539 but then to go into the World Cup it went up to 567. Everyone is really whacking out massive degrees of difficulty.&quot; Daley was presented with a BMW car yesterday, one of the perks of being chosen to be a part of the 25-athlete strong BMW London 2012 Performance Programme, despite not yet being old enough to drive. The Plymouth-based world champion will be given special under\u201117 driving lessons by a world champion rally driver to gear him up for passing his test. &quot;I can&apos;t wait to be driving because it gives you so much more freedom. I can get to training myself and give my dad a rest.&quot; Daley&apos;s father, Rob, who ferries his son to and from each training session, missed the double gold medal-winning performance at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in October as he was undergoing chemotherapy for a brain tumour. &quot;He&apos;s finished his fourth round of chemo and has got two more to go,&quot; Daley said. &quot;He always carries a bowl around with him, just in case, but he&apos;s fine. He was only ill on the first two cycles of chemo but he&apos;s doing really well and the tumour is shrinking. &quot;The good thing is that I haven&apos;t seen him when he is really ill because I was in Singapore when he had his first treatment and then the second time he had treatment I was at the Commonwealth Games. Those were the ones where he was ill but I didn&apos;t see him then. By the time I got home, I think his body must have got used to the tablets he had to take.&quot; Asked whether the London Olympics are constantly on his mind, he smiled. &quot;It&apos;s hard to put it to the back of your mind,&quot; he said, &quot;but I&apos;m just going to be taking it one step at a time. The next thing I&apos;ve got to think about is my maths exam in six days&apos; time, my first module at A level. &quot;I know there is going to be a lot of expectation. But people who know sport know that it doesn&apos;t just happen and it&apos;s not a totally foregone conclusion that I&apos;m going to win gold in 2012. No way is that the case. Any of the top eight divers in the world could win the gold medal if they dive well on the day. It&apos;s just about who has got the\u00a0mentality.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/07/ireland-foreign-investment-barry-oleary", "sentences": ["Before that it was Singapore and last week we had a team from the IDA out in the gulf states,&quot; he says."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-07T07:01:01Z", "title": "Barry O'Leary: Resurrecting the Celtic Tiger \u2013 the man selling Ireland to the world", "tags": ["Ireland bailout", "Ireland", "World news", "Eurozone crisis", "Business", "Financial crisis", "Global recession", "Northern Ireland", "Banking", "Europe"], "article": "Selling Ireland to the world is not easy. Just ask Barry O&apos;Leary. He is head of the republic&apos;s Industrial Development Authority (IDA) and spends a lot of his year flying across the planet to woo multinationals to Irish shores. A softly spoken, mild-mannered man, O&apos;Leary has been driven to frustration by Ireland&apos;s banks, whose reckless lending he has to explain away to would-be investors in the emerald isle. His anger reached a high pitch before Christmas when Allied Irish Banks announced that it would be paying \u20ac40m (\u00a334m) to its top staff in bonuses. Although the Irish government later forced AIB to back down amid an outburst of collective national anger, O&apos;Leary blew his top on the radio. &quot;I was on RT\u00c9 to talk about a new investment by the American bank Citi, which has brought its workforce up to around 2,000 in Ireland. But very quickly on in the interview the presenter got on to the subject of bankers&apos; bonuses. My immediate reaction was &apos;Where is this coming from? It&apos;s at an inappropriate time when we have just had the budget and when clearly the austerity measures were going to bite.&apos; At least things have moved on and the majority of those bonuses will not be paid.&quot; Despite the problems, he does see chinks of light in the economic gloom. In a quiet and measured way he makes a passionate case for the fundamentals of the Irish economy, which he insists will enable Ireland to trade its way out of the recession. Key role The IDA, where he has worked for 30 years, has a central role in Ireland&apos;s economic development. Since its inception has been one of Ireland&apos;s major success stories. Founded in 1949, it played a key role in the industrialisation of the republic during the 1960s when the then taoiseach Se\u00e1n Lemass abandoned the autarchic nationalist policy of protectionism and turned Ireland into an open economy. Some of the biggest companies, including many on Forbes top 200, now have their foreign base in Ireland, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Pfizer, Microsoft and recently Facebook \u2013 many directly the result of work by the IDA. The multinational hi-tech sector, with its emphasis on innovation and exports, is absolutely crucial to the republic&apos;s economy. O&apos;Leary points out that 80% of tax revenue in the state is raised from foreign direct investment (FDI) firms. &quot;If you look at the multinational community that are heavily invested in Ireland, historically what they looked for were four core things: the talent pool; the corporation tax rate of 12.5%; the English language and our track record. They all remain intact,&quot; he says. &quot;If anything, foreign direct investment has become even more attractive because the costs of labour and other things are falling. If, for example, you want to set up a 200-person technology development centre, a prime office building in Dublin today costs \u20ac16 per square foot, whereas before the recession the rent would have been \u20ac40 per square foot. &quot;So the property crash in a way has some positive knock-on effect. At one stage during the boom we were up in the top five of occupancy costs in the developed world, whereas now we are around 33 in terms of those costs.&quot; The recession, he says, has killed off &quot;rip-off Ireland&quot; and put a strong focus on competitiveness in every sector from rentals to retail. &quot;You even see it in simple things around Dublin like walking up towards St Stephen&apos;s Green with a colleague yesterday and we were just remarking that two places had an offer on for coffee and a scone for \u20ac2. In the boom years you&apos;d have paid \u20ac2.50 for your coffee alone.&quot; There was a huge sigh of relief at the IDA headquarters overlooking the city&apos;s grand canal when the government kept corporation tax at 12.5% \u2013 one of the lowest rates for companies in the industrialised world \u2013 in last month&apos;s budget. &quot;It is the cornerstone for us,&quot; O&apos;Leary says, &quot;the absolute cornerstone of attracting foreign direct investment.&quot; When the Irish economy started to expand in the 1990s, IDA projects and financial inducements to bring in foreign direct investment were making a net contribution of 3,000 to 4,000 extra jobs every year. &quot;If you take it from the early to mid-1990s as the economy took off, the IDA was active in bringing Fruit of the Loom T-shirts to Co Donegal, which eventually employed about 4,000 people. At that time too we were bringing in Intel, who were doing very basic manufacturing in Ireland. &quot;On average every year we were bringing \u2013 and are still bringing in \u2013 on average 11,000 to 12,000 jobs from FDI while the economy in other areas was losing 7,000 to 8,000 jobs. The aim continues to be to maintain that level of FDI jobs to around 11,000 to 12,000.&quot; There had been fears in Dublin that the price of the multibillion-euro handout to Ireland from the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank could have been a forced rise in the corporation tax. Those fears have now receded, although many of Ireland&apos;s European Union partners still regard the rate as giving the republic an unfair advantage over other states. Diplomacy Economists advising the power-sharing regional government north of the border in Belfast have urged the unionist/nationalist coalition to replicate the republic&apos;s corporation tax. The UK&apos;s rate is currently double that of the republic&apos;s but the Stormont government wants Northern Ireland to be treated as a special case and have its rate slashed to 12.5%. Would such a move, if the UK Treasury allowed it, unnerve the IDA? &quot;No, no, not at all,&quot; O&apos;Leary replies with characteristic diplomacy, emphasising that Ireland&apos;s attractiveness is more than just the corporation tax rate. It is about 8am when we meet and the sun is still not up over the Dublin skyline as O&apos;Leary explains a typical day. It means being in the IDA HQ by 7.30am and a long day of meetings, visits to the factories of multinationals and perhaps a drinks reception later at a foreign embassy. In effect, he operates as one of Ireland&apos;s most senior economic diplomats. However, half of O&apos;Leary&apos;s time is spent travelling across the globe in search of new opportunities for Ireland. To borrow a phrase from Victorian imperialism, the sun seems never to set on the IDA and Ireland&apos;s mission. &quot;My most recent trip was to Munich and the week before that I was in Shenzhen in China and then Hong Kong for four days.

Earlier that year I had been given the Somerset Maugham Award for my first novel At the Jerusalem, and one of the conditions I had to honour was to spend the prize money by travelling abroad. My original intention was to go to Rome, but two new friends I had made in London persuaded me that Florence would be of more interest to someone who loved Renaissance art. Vanni was a Florentine and Paolo came from Siena, where the most refined and elegant Italian is spoken, and they convinced me that Tuscany was certain to captivate a romantic Englishman. They were to be proved right. In preparation for my trip, I took lessons in the language from an elderly man in his basement flat near Baker Street. He refused to speak English with me once our initial introductions were over. He was a\u00a0brilliant, fastidious teacher who expected the best from me. He was a stickler where grammar was concerned, and I am grateful to him now that he paid so much attention to the construction of sentences. I visited him regularly for three months. He wished me good luck when we said goodbye. He told me he had confidence in my ability to communicate with Italians. I\u00a0thanked him for being such a hard and demanding taskmaster. I flew to Pisa in early September. My friends were there to greet me. We waited and waited for my suitcase to appear, but it never did. An official working for Alitalia told us it had gone to Singapore. I bought some basic necessities and we set off for Florence. This was an ominous beginning, and I remember feeling saddened that a holiday I had anticipated with the prospect of pleasure in mind should have started so unpleasantly. The hotel Paolo had chosen for me was called Hotel Paris in Via dei Banchi, a side street only minutes away from the central railway station near the great church of Santa Maria Novella. Today Hotel Paris is very chic, exuding luxurious comfort, but four decades ago it gave off an air of faded grandeur. It had known better days, and that suited me fine. To my great delight, Paolo had managed to secure an attic room for me at an amazingly cheap price \u2013 the equivalent in lire of roughly \u00a31 per night. There was a\u00a0comfortable bed and a desk at which I\u00a0could write and on the landing a\u00a0small bathroom with a shower. No mini bar, no television \u2013 it had none of the things up there under the roof that guests take for granted now. It was to be my very own little eyrie. I was awakened the next morning by a medley of noises \u2013 car horns honking, people talking at the tops of their voices and the bells of Santa Maria Novella summoning the faithful and unfaithful to Mass. This was, I came to recognise, the unique, orchestrated sound of Italy, to be heard with only slight variations in cities and towns alike. It touched and stirred my heart then and it does so still. I told myself nothing less than the truth that far-off morning when I said aloud: &quot;I&apos;m going to be happy here&quot; as I gazed down on the teeming street. It was a moment of the most intense contentment. I\u00a0am smiling even as I\u00a0think of it. On that sunny day, I\u00a0wandered in the city, marvelling at its beauty. I\u00a0decided to buy underpants and socks, because I didn&apos;t know when, or if, my suitcase would be leaving Singapore. I knew that the word for underpants is mutande, but seta, meaning &quot;silk&quot;, was not then in my vocabulary. Thus it was that I\u00a0purchased two pairs of silk Y-fronts which felt good against the skin but failed to survive a single visit to the hotel&apos;s laundry. They were returned to me in shreds. I was sitting in the lobby the following evening when a call came from Alitalia. I was informed, rather loftily, that I could pick up my case from the airport in Pisa. Paolo seized the phone and shouted at the official that Alitalia should deliver the case to the hotel, as it was due to their incompetence that it was lost. It duly appeared late at night, and I never wore silk inside my trousers again. One of my happiest rituals was to visit the Brancacci Chapel and look with wonder at Masaccio&apos;s depiction of Adam and Eve&apos;s expulsion from paradise. In 1968 their private parts were covered with leaves that some prude had painted over them in, I\u00a0think, the 18th century. Thanks to several years of restoration, Adam&apos;s penis and Eve&apos;s vagina can now be seen as the young genius, dead at 26, intended them to be seen \u2013 as necessary to their human vulnerability as the anguish etched on their faces. I would leave the chapel and walk to Angiolino&apos;s. You could see the food being prepared if you sat at a\u00a0table near the open kitchen, and there was a line on the walls showing the height the water had reached in the terrible flood of 1966. It was very close to the ceiling. On Thursdays it was possible to order a great Florentine dish, the incomparable zuppa di fagioli, the finest of all bean soups. After lunch I would make my lonely way up the steep paths and roads leading to the Piazzale Michelangelo and, higher still, to Forte Belvedere, with its view of the pink and green splendour of Giotto&apos;s Campanile and the Duomo and the Uffizi. My progress upwards was accompanied by the occasional fart, courtesy of the white beans I&apos;d recently consumed. I was not to meet Paolo&apos;s family, though he told me about his ancient father, a forbiddingly conservative Catholic who was constantly warning his only son (he had five daughters) that he would deprive Paolo of his inheritance if he didn&apos;t find himself a wife. Well, Paolo did marry, in the 1970s, a very attractive and intelligent Frenchwoman, but the romance was to end in tragedy towards the end of the decade when he killed himself suddenly, inexplicably. But that was in the future, and Paolo was a\u00a0sweet-natured and kindly presence throughout my stay in Italy. Vanni&apos;s family life was altogether different. I have forgotten how many times I was invited to the apartment in Via Falcucci, on the outskirts of Florence. Vanni&apos;s paternal grandmother was alive then. She was a\u00a0wonderful cook from whom I\u00a0learned a great deal. I was also a guest that autumn of the aesthete and historian of the Bourbons of Naples, Harold Acton, who lived in style in his grand villa, La Pietra, on Via Bolognese. &quot;Do tell me all the delicious London gossip,&quot; he said as he showed me round the gardens. On my second visit, he pointed out a &quot;very interesting little Della Robbia&quot;. As I bent over to examine the ceramic in detail, he goosed me \u2013 an action that passed without comment from either of us. From the moment I woke up for the first time in my eyrie to the day of my departure for England in December I had amassed enough experience to last me forever. I read Italian poetry in earnest and saw paintings and sculpture and listened to music in churches and concert halls and ate the cuisine I admire above all others \u2013 of such, for me, was the kingdom of heaven on earth. If there were dark days, as there must have been, they have vanished into that convenient nowhere that keeps us going against the odds. What remains is a lasting sense of joy, of discovery, of my life being lived to the full. I see myself at the Forte Belvedere, high above Florence, alone on the ramparts, cheerfully farting, without a care in the world.

More than half of world trade passes, at least on paper, through tax havens. More than half of all banking assets and a third of foreign direct investment by multinational corporations are routed offshore. An impression has been created in sections of the world&apos;s media, since a series of stirring denunciations of tax havens by world leaders in 2008 and 2009, that the offshore system has been dismantled, or at least tamed. In fact quite the opposite has happened. The offshore system is in very rude health \u2014 and growing fast. It is no coincidence that London, once the capital of the greatest empire the world has known, is the centre of the most important part of the global offshore system. The City&apos;s offshore network has three main parts. Two inner rings \u2013 Britain&apos;s crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man; and its overseas territories, such as the Cayman Islands \u2013 are substantially controlled by Britain, and combine futuristic offshore finance with medieval politics. The outer ring comprises a more diverse array of havens, such as Hong Kong, which are outside Britain&apos;s direct control but have strong links. This network of offshore satellites does several things. First, it gives the City a truly global reach. The British havens scattered all around the world&apos;s time zones attract and catch mobile international capital flowing to and from nearby jurisdictions, just as a spider&apos;s web catches passing insects. Much of the money attracted to these places, and the business of handling that money, is then funnelled through to London. Second, this British spider&apos;s web lets the City get involved in business that might be forbidden in Britain, providing sufficient distance to allow financiers in London plausible deniability of wrongdoing. Much (but not all) of the financial activity hosted in these places breaks laws and avoids regulation elsewhere. The three crown dependencies in the inner ring are substantially controlled and supported by Britain but have enough independence to allow Britain to say &quot;there is nothing we can do&quot; when other countries complain of abuses run out of these havens. They channel very large amounts of finance up to the City of London: in the second quarter of 2009 the UK received net financing of $332.5bn (\u00a3215bn) just from its three crown dependencies. Jersey Finance promotional literature makes the point plainly. &quot;Jersey,&quot; it says, &quot;represents an extension of the City of London.&quot; The 14 overseas territories, the next ring in the spider&apos;s web, are the last surviving outposts of Britain&apos;s formal empire. With just a quarter of a million inhabitants between them they include some of the world&apos;s top secrecy jurisdictions: the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos islands and Gibraltar. Just like the crown dependencies, the overseas territories have close but ambiguous political relationships with Britain. In the Caymans the most powerful person is the governor, appointed by the Queen. The governor handles defence, internal security and foreign relations; he appoints the police commissioner, the complaints commissioner, the auditor general, the attorney general, the judiciary and other top officials. The final appeal court is the privy council in London. It is the world&apos;s fifth largest financial centre, hosting 80,000 registered companies, more than three-quarters of the world&apos;s hedge funds, and $1.9tn (\u00a31.2tn) on deposit \u2013 four times as much as in New York City banks. The third, outer ring of the British spider&apos;s web includes Hong Kong, Singapore, the Bahamas, Dubai and Ireland, which are fully independent though deeply connected to the City of London. In the Caribbean, the modern offshore system traces its origins back to the time when organised crime took an interest in the US tax code. When Al Capone was convicted of tax evasion in 1931, his associate Meyer Lansky became fascinated with developing schemes to get mob money out of the US in order to bring it back, drycleaned. A slick mafia operator, Lansky would beat every criminal charge against him until the day he died in 1983. Lansky began with Swiss banking in 1932, where he perfected the loan-back technique. First he moved money out of the US in suitcases, diamonds, airline tickets, cashiers&apos; cheques, untraceable bearer shares or whatever. He would put the money in secret Swiss accounts, perhaps via a Liechtenstein Anstalt (an anonymous company with a single secret shareholder) for extra secrecy. The Swiss bank would then loan the money back to a mobster in the United States and the money would return home, clean. By 1937 Lansky had started casino operations in Cuba, outside the reach of the US tax authorities, and he and his friends built up gambling, racetrack and drugs businesses there. It was, effectively, an offshore money-laundering centre for the mob. Lansky then moved to Miami and plotted to find his next Cuba, small enough and corrupt enough to be able to buy the political leadership, and close enough to the United States for the gamblers to come and go at will. The Bahamas, the old staging post for British gun-running to the southern US slave states of the Confederacy, was perfect. Lansky set about making this British colony, now dominated by an oligarchy of corrupt white merchants known as the Bay Street Boys, the top secrecy jurisdiction for north and south American dirty money. A quaint memo from a Mr WG Hulland of the Colonial Office to a Bank of England official in 1961, just as Lansky began major operations there, illustrates the uneasy nature of this encounter between the British upper classes and American organised crime: &quot;We feel that this [lack of provision of an effective regulatory system] might be a grave omission, since it is notorious that this particular territory, in common with Bermuda, attracts all sorts of financial wizards, some of whose activities we can well believe should be controlled in the public interest.&quot; London did nothing, and Lansky built his empire. Yet many locals were unhappy. In 1965 Lynden Pindling, a populist Bahamas politician, threw the ceremonial speaker&apos;s mace out of a parliament window in a dramatic power-to-the-people gesture. He was elected prime minister in 1967 on a platform that included hostility to gambling, corruption and the Bay Street Boys&apos; mob connections. Yet as it happened there was a reassuringly British place just next door, where the locals were far more friendly: the Cayman Islands. Milton Grundy, an influential Caribbean offshore lawyer and author of several books on offshore finance, remembers first arriving in the Caymans. Cows wandered through the town centre, there was one bank, one paved road and no telephone system. In 1967 the Caymans published its first trust law, which Grundy drafted, and which a British Inland Revenue official subsequently said &quot;blatantly seeks to frustrate our own law for dealing with our own taxpayers&quot;. Within just a few months Grand Cayman was connected to the international phone network and the airport was expanded to take jet aircraft. Some have argued that Britain set up the offshore networks simply out of a short-sighted desire to find a way for its overseas territories to pay their way in the world. After the second world war, an exhausted Britain found that its empire, once a source of great profits, was becoming more expensive and difficult to run, as locals began to agitate for independence. But the evidence points to a different, more troubling explanation for Britain&apos;s decision to turn its semi-colonies into secrecy jurisdictions. The archives tell a consistent story about how the tax havens grew: private sector operators working in a zone of extreme freedom began to call the shots, with little opposition from Britain and its inexperienced emissaries. In the archives, two schools of opinion emerge within the British civil service. On one side sits the Treasury, and especially its tax collectors in the Inland Revenue, who virulently opposed tax havenry and found the Cayman Islands especially obnoxious. The US authorities were clearly highly vexed too, and the British Foreign Office broadly opposed havenry, though its position was more nuanced. On the other side sits the Bank of England, the most vociferous cheerleader for the new arrangements, and its far less influential supporter, the British overseas development ministry, which seems unperturbed by the possibility that local tax haven activities might foster massive capital flight from developing countries elsewhere. Battle lines were drawn; the exchanges become vigorous and even acrimonious. The Inland Revenue was especially alarmed, while their mandarin bosses in the Treasury showed some, but rather less, concern. They put together a working party, whose report in 1971 said Britain should, in effect, stop encouraging tax havenry in its overseas territories, which in the case of the Caymans had become, as one internal memo in London put it, &quot;quite uncivilised&quot;. A letter marked secret from the Bank of England dated 11 April 1969 gives a better sense of the forces driving the changes in the Caribbean. &quot;We need to be quite sure that the possible proliferation of trust companies, banks, etc, which in most cases would be no more than brass plates manipulating assets outside the islands, does not get out of hand. There is of course no objection to their providing bolt holes for non-residents but we need to be sure that in so doing opportunities are not created for the transfer of UK capital to the non-sterling area outside UK rules.&quot; The Bank of England&apos;s main concern at this time was that the new Caribbean centres were weak points: sources of financial leakage outside the sterling area. So in 1972 Britain shrank the area to Britain, Ireland and the crown dependencies, excluding the new havens. The year the sterling area shrank, the British officials working against tax havens disappeared from the archive files. Their replacements seemed unaware of the 1971 report and only discovered it in 1977, sitting on the shelf, unimplemented. Again they expressed concerns \u2013 and again nothing was done. History repeated itself within and between the departments, all in less than 10 years. And, each time, the Bank of England fought the tax haven corner. &quot;This is no tropical paradise,&quot; said Kenneth Crook, the newly arrived British governor of the Cayman Islands in 1972. &quot;I could enlarge, in terms of a magnificent but mosquito-ridden beach; of a fairly new but rather ill-designed and sadly neglected house; of a pleasant but very untidy little town; of swamp clearance schemes which generate smells strong enough to kill a horse; of an office which will one day ere long collapse in a shower of termite-ridden dust.&quot; But on politics, and the strange relationship between Britain and its little quasi-colony, his tone hardens. &quot;Caymanians don&apos;t want independence,&quot; Crook wrote. &quot;They don&apos;t want internal self-government either \u2013 they are very unwilling to trust each other with effective power \u2026 they quite well understand that the British connection gives them a status which they would otherwise not command.&quot; Nothing of substance seems to have changed, as a senior Caymanian politician, who asked not to be named, explained to me in 2009. &quot;The UK wants to have a significant degree of control,&quot; he said, &quot;but at the same time it does not want to be seen to have that control. Like any boss, it wants influence without responsibility; they can turn around when things go wrong and say &apos;it&apos;s all your fault&apos; \u2013 but in the meantime they are pulling all the strings.&quot; This attitude of the locals towards Britain reassures investors, but the political bedrock underpinning the world&apos;s fifth biggest financial centre is Britain&apos;s role. If Caymanians gained full control, most of the money would flee. While these changes were happening in the Caribbean, something similar was under way far closer to the City of London, in the crown dependencies. A constituent&apos;s letter forwarded and endorsed by Tony Benn, then an MP, to the then chancellor, Denis Healey, about a tax conference in Jersey, gives a flavour: &quot;I am somewhat surprised to see a Mr Gent from the Bank of England giving advice on how to avoid paying tax. I wonder if this is really part of the Bank of England&apos;s duties? Mr Gent suggests that the Bank of England will not be prepared to pass on information required by the Inland Revenue! Does the UK Treasury have no control over the Bank of England? Surely Bank employees should not be working against government policy? And just what sort of arrangements and deals are made at these events &apos;behind the scenes&apos;? &quot;It really is just a bit too sordid to be true.&quot; As in the Caribbean, offshore banking blossomed here from the 1960s, when merchant banks such as Hambros and Hill Samuel opened for deposits. Foreign travel was getting easier and more British expatriates opened accounts in Jersey, where the banks were reliable and comfortingly British, but where bank interest was untaxed and secret. Many did not declare their income to their countries of residence, often poverty-racked African nations, knowing they would not be caught. Martyn Scriven, secretary to the Jersey Bankers&apos; Association, described how Jersey&apos;s network grew. &quot;The biggest business developer is client recommendation,&quot; he said. &quot;The client will say, &apos;I&apos;m happy, and I&apos;d like to introduce you to my friend&apos; \u2013 and you build it up like that. You get some seriously interesting people \u2026 someone who goes abroad as a rigger 20 years ago for Shell may now be in charge of the company&apos;s west Africa operations \u2026 We gather deposits from wealthy folk all around the world, and the bulk of those deposits are sent to London. Great dollops of money go into London from here.&quot; As in the Caymans, Jersey has carefully protected the ambiguous relationship with Britain. Jersey&apos;s most senior public sector officials are appointed in London; its laws are all approved by the privy council in London, and Britain handles Jersey&apos;s foreign relations and defence, and the lieutenant governor represents the Queen. As in the Caymans, Britain goes to great lengths to hide its control. And, as with the Cayman Islands, the relationship with the mother country reassures the wealthy and the financial services industry that Britain will step in if needs be, to protect the tax haven from external attacks. Their money is safe in Jersey.

More of these below ... \u2022 A US court&apos;s subpoena for information on WikiLeaks members&apos; Twitter activity has raised objections in Iceland, where Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, an MP, is one of those named in the document. Iceland&apos;s foreign ministry has demanded a meeting with Luis Arreaga, the US ambassador to Reykjav\u00edk, while the interior minister, Ogmundur Jonasson, has spelled out what it is the country finds so objectionable:   [It is] very serious that a foreign state, the United States, demands such personal information of an Icelandic person, an elected official. This is even more serious when put [in] perspective and concerns freedom of speech and people&apos;s freedom in general  \u2022 Hillary Clinton has likened her recent diplomatic activity to a post-WikiLeaks &quot;apology tour&quot;. She told reporters at the beginning of a five-day visit to Arab countries (many of whom were revealed to be asking the US to take a harder line against Iran) that she believes she &quot;will be answering concerns about WikiLeaks for the rest of my life, not just the rest of my tenure as secretary of state.&quot; From the Washington Post:  Clinton said she had quipped to one of her aides that she needed a tour jacket, similar to the ones used by rock bands, that would have a &quot;big picture of the world and would say &apos;The Apology Tour&apos; &quot; on it. Although the intensity has abated somewhat, the fallout from the WikiLeaks affair &quot;is still in the atmosphere,&quot; she said  \u2022 Singapore, for one, is a little more wary now of US diplomats and has told its officials to be &quot;more guarded in our communications ... If it happened once, it can happen again.&quot; Its home affairs minister meanwhile warned against trying anything like WikiLeaks in Singapore, saying anyone caught leaking any official government documents will be &quot;dealt with firmly&quot;. \u2022 Mark Borkowski&apos;s firm is in talks on handling Julian Assange&apos;s PR. \u2022 WikiLeaks has been losing more than \u00a3400,000 a week since the publication of the embassy cables, Assange said in an interview with two Swiss newspapers. He also discussed moving WikiLeaks to the country. &quot;Switzerland is a possibility; and our main domain name is a .ch,&quot; he told Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve and 24 Heures. &quot;Despite strong pressure, the Switch company, which manages domain names [in Switzerland] has held out,&quot; he said. \u2022 Bloomberg has another line from the interview: WikiLeaks won&apos;t publish its bank documents - believed to concern Bank of America - just yet.  12.15pm: Press release on the Guardian&apos;s WikiLeaks book. The title is WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange&apos;s war on secrecy.  2pm: Greg Mitchell&apos;s WikiLeaks blog links to what he calls a &quot;suprisingly tough&quot; Los Angeles Times editorial on the treatment of Bradley Manning, who has spent 23 hours a day for the last five months locked in a miltary jail cell.  The 23-year-old army intelligence analyst suspected of providing documents to WikiLeaks, can&apos;t reasonably complain that the military has him in custody. But the conditions under which he is being held at the Marine detention center at Quantico, Virginia, are so harsh as to suggest he is being punished for conduct of which he hasn&apos;t been convicted    2.30pm: Irish political party Fine Gael has put out a statement on the Anonymous-claimed hacking of its website. Anonymous had previously carried out distributed denial of service attacks on the Mastercard and Paypal websites in retaliation for the companies&apos; refusal to process donations to WikiLeaks. There doesn&apos;t immediately appear to be a WikiLeaks link to Fine Gael, though I may be wrong. The statement said the hackers had got access to its database and the details of 2,000 subscribers.  3.30pm: Assange is planning to appear at a London press conference on 17 January in support of Rudolf Elmer, who will face charges in a Swiss court two days later on posting confidential banking documents to WikiLeaks, Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv reports.  Elmer was the former head of Swiss private bank Julius B\u00e4r&apos;s Caribbean operations when he decided to send the documents on its Cayman Islands activities to WikiLeaks.  4.45pm: Assange&apos;s lawyer, Mark Stephens, has told Bloomberg News that the Twitter supoena violates the US constitution&apos;s fourth amendment prohibiting unreasonable government searches and amounts to harassment:  &quot;The Department of Justice is turning into an agent of harassment rather than an agent of law,&quot; Stephens, of the firm Finers Stephens Innocent LLP, said. &quot;They&apos;re shaking the tree to see if anything drops out, but more important they are shaking down people who are supporters of WikiLeaks.&quot;   5.40pm: Some more on the Guardian WikiLeaks book from our investigations editor, David Leigh:  The real story of WikiLeaks has yet to be told and this book will lift the lid on the Guardian&apos;s unique partnership with Julian Assange, one of the world&apos;s most controversial figures. Readers will have a ringside seat as the extraordinary twists and turns of the WikiLeaks story unfold.

We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy&apos;s own insights. Here are this week&apos;s dilemmas \u2013 what are your thoughts? Problem one: The royal wedding public holiday is a managerial headache for our charity I serve a board of management (all of whom are volunteers) for a small charity, and am responsible for HR.\u00a0The board employs 14 part-time staff (who work between 2.5 and 30 hours a week) in an organisation which functions 365 days a year. Present paid holiday entitlement is &quot;six working weeks inclusive of all bank and public holidays&quot;.\u00a0How can we best, and fairly, manage the extra public holiday for the royal wedding? I have studied many articles, blogs and employment law websites, but opinion is polarised and vague! Problem two: I have taken charge of a new team \u2013 and earn less than all of them I lead a small global writing team in a City firm. I have been with this organisation for two years and was promoted to team leader three months ago. This was a new role, which I proposed to my manager myself. I was not awarded a pay rise and thought it wise to wait until &quot;pay review season&quot;. In the meantime I wanted to really show what I could do with the new role. I have already succeeded in improving the team&apos;s performance significantly and have great plans for the future. I have been awarded unusually high marks in my performance appraisal and have received excellent feedback. My dilemma is that now I am in charge of awarding pay rises to my team I have realised I earn 12% less than the lowest-earning team member and 40% less than the highest-earning. The situation is complicated because no one else works in the UK and I am comparing my salary to those in the US and Singapore. Perhaps the fact I am three years younger than the youngest team member should also be taken into consideration. I have twice brought this issue up with my manager, but she argues that the company only awards small pay rises, even on promotion. She wants to award me slightly higher pay rises over many years and even the situation out this way. But in that case we are looking at about 40 years before I can catch up with my highest-earning team member! Eventually she agreed to send my case to HR to see whether my pay matches that of most people doing a similar job in the UK, but I have heard nothing. I also think that is not really as relevant as the gaps in the team&apos;s pay. I am beginning to feel I am being taken for granted and would ordinarily leave to look for another job, but I am going on a six-month maternity leave in late spring. I have made it clear I will stay in touch with the team and am committed to coming back. I have been tasked with finding a replacement so I feel I am trusted with this. If nothing satisfactory materialises at this pay review, should I take my case to HR? Or perhaps my manager&apos;s manager? Or should I take another route? I am beginning to feel uncharacteristically demotivated and annoyed.

Instead he slipped up in a different way by telling the MPs and their constituents that the time for &quot;remorse and apology&quot; from bankers is over. Not in what MPs called &quot;the real world&quot; it isn&apos;t. That much was evident later in the day when George Osborne faced a grilling of his own over the coalition&apos;s failure to live up to its glib pre-election promises to cap bonuses. The chancellor tried to blame the whole mess on the legacy he inherited from Labour \u2013 a formula which gets weaker by the day. But only about half the Tory MPs who questioned him, the toadying half, agreed. The majority in all parties remain cross both about the scale of unwarranted bonuses and the unloved banks&apos; collective failure to lend enough to stimulate recovery in both the housing market and the wider economy, not to mention excessive bank charges and other familiar moans. The response was the same when Diamond faced the Treasury select committee. Apart from earning \u00a375m in the past five years, the Barclays boss&apos;s problem was twofold. First, he was smug about his bank&apos;s performance during the ongoing crisis, insisting \u2013 quite wrongly, MPs pointed out \u2013 that prudent management had allowed it to avoid a taxpayer bailout. Actually no. The taxpayer&apos;s guarantee, as well as Arab oil money, is still propping it up. In addition the &quot;Houdini bank&quot; was lucky not to beat RBS in a 2007 bidding war to buy the Dutch bank, ABN Amro (RBS&apos;s fatal error), and would have bought Lehman Brothers in 2008 if Alistair Darling hadn&apos;t blocked it. &quot;Little England,&quot; sneered Diamond Bob in a leaked email. But it allowed him to buy the best of Lehman for peanuts after it crashed a few days later. Second, he defended the banking status quo in the face of awkward facts. Break them up? No, the &quot;integrated universal model&quot; of bank (ie Barclays) is safest. At Baring Brothers&apos; freestanding subsidiary in Singapore, rogue banker Nick Leeson had crashed the bank, he said. Nonsense. London had been pouring money into Singapore, said Andrea Leadsom, a sharp Tory ex-banker. It was the same over bonuses (no, he would not promise to give up his own again) and tax havens, part of the Barclays Capital investment banking arm which Diamond ran before his latest promotion. How many subsidiaries had BarCap set up in the Isle of Man, asked Labour&apos;s Chuka Umunna? &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot; Thirty. Jersey? &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot; Thirty-eight. The Cayman Islands. &quot;Same answer.&quot; 181. This committee, under its cool-headed chairman, Tory Andrew Tyrie, is able to catch out slippery bankers. On TV and in the City press, pundits said that Diamond gave a &quot;masterclass in deflation&quot; but it wasn&apos;t so. He was unimpressively vague about who gets most of the bonuses. The investment bank elite, it seems. Where Diamond scores over the politicians is that he and his kind hold most of the cards. As Osborne reminded MPs, the financial service sector pays 20% of all UK taxes and can take themselves abroad if pushed too hard. That was why the chancellor&apos;s combative retreat from his pre-6 May rhetoric won him catcalls. Yes, Labour made mistakes, though most were endorsed by the Tories at the time. Yes, curbing the banks will be difficult. The coalition&apos;s crime was to pretend it would be easy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2011/jan/12/ireland-freer-than-uk-index-economic-freedom", "sentences": ["Hong Kong was deemed the most free place in the world to do business, followed by Singapore (whose corporation tax incidentally competes well with Ireland&apos;s 12.5%) and Australia."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-12T13:18:35Z", "title": "Ireland 'freer' than UK for business", "tags": ["Ireland", "Business", "Europe"], "article": "   2011 Index of Economic Freedom as calculated by the Heritage Foundation    An IMF-EU bailout, four of the seven major banks in the country nationalised and a swingeing budget that will mean hardship for some of the population for years to come \u2026 But that hasn&apos;t stopped Ireland being rated as one of the top countries in the world to do business \u2013 ahead of the UK, the US and the powerhouse of Europe, Germany.

Tottenham also unveiled plans to refurbish Crystal Palace as a 25,000-capacity athletics stadium to compensate for ripping out the track from the Olympic Stadium to knock down the venue and rebuild it as a dedicated football ground. Spurs, who estimate that moving to Stratford would be roughly \u00a3200m cheaper than an alternative plan to rebuild White Hart Lane, will also create an athletics &quot;legacy fund&quot; that they claim would fulfil the commitments made to the sport when London won the Games in 2005. The plan was immediately labelled &quot;woefully inadequate&quot; by Ed Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics, which is backing West Ham&apos;s joint bid with Newham Council. It would retain the track, reducing the 80,000-capacity stadium to 60,000 seats and promising a multi-sport solution with football in the winter and athletics and cricket in the summer. The Olympic Park Legacy Company is expected to announce a preferred bidder by 28 January, although that could still slip into next month, with a final decision made in conjunction with the government and the mayor by the end of March. David Keirle, the chairman of Spurs&apos; architects KSS, said today that the Olympic Stadium was not compatible with modern football. West Ham would have to spend up to \u00a3100m adding hospitality suites, toilets and other facilities. &quot;It&apos;s a sophisticated Meccano set. It does what it&apos;s meant to do \u2013 provides a great experience for athletics. But football is different,&quot; Keirle said. &quot;Our whole design is based on bringing fans closer to the pitch.&quot; He said that retaining the athletics track would damage the experience for football fans. Instead, Spurs will offer to rebuild Crystal Palace as a 25,000-seat venue with the potential to raise its capacity to 40,000 if London wins the right to stage the 2017 World Athletics Championships. &quot;Our first seat is eight metres from the goalline, their first seat is 45 metres from the goalline,&quot; Keirle said. &quot;Our first hospitality is 20 metres in, theirs is 60 metres. The vast majority of our stand is within the distance to their first seat. The further you get away, the less you see, the less connection you have with the sport. Once you get over 190 metres you can&apos;t see the ball.&quot; According to Spurs&apos; studies of the Olympic Stadium, around 18% of the seats will be more than 190 metres from the action. &quot;I would suggest a large number of fans wouldn&apos;t go,&quot; Keirle said. &quot;These aren&apos;t just stadium design issues, they go to the heart of commercial viability. Filling 60,000 in an athletics facility is a fantastic challenge.&quot; Tottenham, facing a backlash from some fans and local politicians, will also point out the economic benefits of their bid, believing that questions remain over whether West Ham will be able to fill a 60,000-capacity stadium on a regular basis. They are hopeful the relative league positions of the teams will play in their favour, although West Ham are confident they have offered sufficient reassurance over the finances to secure the 200-year lease on offer. Lord Coe, the chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games, has vociferously backed the West Ham option as the only one that meets the promise he made in Singapore to deliver an athletics legacy. Spurs had planned to develop their White Hart Lane site and have spent millions over three years gaining the necessary planning approval. But frustration over demands made by Haringey Council, Transport for London and English Heritage led them to pursue an alternative option at Stratford in conjunction with the O2 Arena&apos;s operator, AEG, which has proposed a series of concerts and other events that will see the stadium in use all year round. It is believed that it will cost Spurs around \u00a3250m to tear down the Olympic Stadium, build a new one and refurbish Crystal Palace. Rebuilding White Hart Lane is costed at around \u00a3450m. West Ham are confident their proposal, which would use around \u00a340m raised from the sale of Upton Park and \u00a340m borrowed by Newham but underwritten by the club, stacks up financially even if they are relegated. &quot;Ours is a viable and sustainable solution that fulfils all the commitments made in Singapore and more,&quot; said Ian Tompkins, West Ham&apos;s Olympic Project director. &quot;It turns the Olympic venue into a busy, multi-use stadium for many different people to benefit from.&quot; Warner described the Spurs alternative as &quot;completely unacceptable&quot;. He said: &quot;It&apos;s clear to me that a refurbished Crystal Palace is woefully inadequate. Having an Olympic track in an Olympic Stadium is an inspirational factor. That&apos;s the legacy London deserves, not a refurb of a fading facility in the wrong part of town. &quot;It will be a dereliction of duty by those considering the bids if they choose to write off half a billion pounds of public investment and go with a football-only solution rather than the multiuse facility that was promised.&quot; He added: &quot;There&apos;s a groundswell of opinion that spending over half a billion of public money on an athletics stadium and only to raze it to the ground at the behest of a Premier League football club is completely unacceptable and doesn&apos;t fit with the vision of bringing the games to London.&quot; The Tottenham MP David Lammy criticised Spurs&apos;s plans to leave his constituency. &quot;It would be astonishing in these hard pressed times if the government and [London mayor] Boris Johnson will approve a bid that sees over half a billion pounds of public money down the drain after just a month,&quot; Lammy said. &quot;Now we know the full details of the Tottenham bid, I will be writing to the Public Accounts Committee and National Audit Office to demand an investigation if they are named the preferred bidder. &quot;I fully support the money spent on the Olympic Stadium, but for it to be only used for a month before being demolished is a diabolical waste of public money.&quot; How the bids compare WEST HAM Will retain existing structure but cut 80,000 capacity to 60,000 Partners Newham Council, UK Athletics and concert promoters Live Nation Local outreach Schools and health professionals to be included in community access Athletics legacy Will retain track, hosting meetings in the summer alongside occasional Twenty20 cricket matches Economics Has proved deal stacks up even if club are relegated.

Itching to get his controversial free schools programme under way, he used new data yesterday \u2013 which showed most institutions improving \u2013 to highlight a new target which five in six pupils miss. Passing the &quot;English baccalaureate&quot;, as the latest metric is grandly badged, involves securing good GCSEs in English, maths, science, a language and history or geography. As such it represents a half-way house in the perennial debate about how far Whitehall should shape school timetables, somewhere between the narrow core once proposed by Mrs Thatcher and the all-encompassing curriculum eventually driven through by her education secretary, Kenneth Baker. On Tuesday Mr Gove argued perfectly plausibly for striking this balance, citing the breadth of high-school certificates everywhere from Alberta to Singapore in support of his conviction that humanities have to be part of the mix. That balance will not satisfy everyone, and particularly not supporters of artistic and musical study. It also fits decidedly oddly with the government&apos;s savaging of humanities funding in higher education. A deeper problem for this particular education secretary, however, is reconciling a new central target \u2013 a diktat that 35% of pupils ought to achieve five good GCSE grades including English and maths \u2013 with his much-vaunted desire to set schools free. He also needs to deal with the rage of headteachers who are cross that this measure, first floated only a couple of months ago, has been retrofitted on to results that reflect several years&apos; work. This grumbling about moving goalposts rumbled throughout yesterday. Had Mr Gove not been brandishing a new target, he might have reminded schools that they should always seek to do as well as they can for every pupil, regardless of the changing ways in which performance is measured. Instead, he talked up the release of the underlying data from which school tables are compiled. While too obscure a move to grab attention, this could prove important. For two decades now, the selective statistics used in league tables have distorted the true performance of schools. Successive attempts to refine them by gauging &quot;value-added&quot; or factoring in social conditions have produced numbers parents cannot understand. And yet the informational genie cannot plausibly be put back into the bottle, and so perhaps the best that can be done is to allow experts, journalists and schools themselves to create tables, highlighting progress for slow-starters, results in (say) music, or any other criterion they see as important. The statistics will still be selective, but at least everybody will have their own chance to do the selecting. The other unanswered question is where, if anywhere, the newly defined core of study up to the age of 16 leaves vocational qualifications. Mr Gove&apos;s department was yesterday rubbishing the allegedly soft GCSE subjects that schools had encouraged in order to flatter their standing in the previous system of tables. No doubt some are flimsy, but no amount of schooling in kings, queens and the world&apos;s rivers will make good Britain&apos;s great weakness in technical training. Mr Gove understands that, which is no doubt why there are simultaneous reports that 14-year-olds will soon be free to ditch academic work to enrol in new colleges sponsored by Lord Baker. Labour discerns confusion on the part of a government that has backed away from the development of 14-18 diplomas that integrate academic and vocational elements. It is only through such integration that vocational training will achieve the parity of esteem it sorely requires. Vocational education is being reviewed by the redoubtable professor Alison Wolf. To stand any chance of harmonising his mixed messages on what teenagers should study, Mr Gove will need to make full use of her formidable brain. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2011. The original said that the 35% target was for the minimum pupil proportion who ought to achieve the English baccalaureate in each school. This has been corrected.

Any surviving suspicions that Spurs were only playing at bidding for the Stratford bowl in order to concentrate minds in Haringey Town Hall on helping them rebuild at home were surely crushed yesterday when the club went on the attack, tellingly damning the rival proposals of West Ham as commercially unviable.  Tottenham know that their strength lies in their bank account: they&apos;ve got the big bucks of AEG behind them and play in the Champions League. West Ham are staring relegation in the face and their main partner is Newham Council. The Olympic Park Legacy Company, which will decide between the bids, and Boris Johnson, who with the government will make the final decision, both live in fear of bequeathing London a stadium that&apos;s never filled. Could the Hammers draw a regular 60,000 even if they stay in the Premier League? That&apos;s the cold hard business case coming out of White Hart Lane, no doubt refined and barbed by public relations man Mike Lee, who was communications director for the 2012 Olympic bid and was once a Hammers club director to boot.  But the East Enders have their weapons too. Vice chair Karren Brady has told the North Londoners that they should keep off her patch and even claimed that the David Beckham loan deal (or not) is just a ploy to further their dastardly colonial ambitions. The athletics world has weighed in on her side with Frankie Fredericks, chair of the International Olympic Committee&apos;s Athletes&apos; Commission, UK Athletics chair Ed Warner and a veritable firmament of native Olympians supporting the team in claret and blue. Seb Coe his very self has more or less done the same. For the athletes, of course, the key issue is the future of the athletics track. West Ham would retain it, Spurs would tear it up and tear down the stadium in its present form, replacing it with one dedicated to football. The Hammers and Newham envisage a multi-sports venue which the community could also use. They argue that their proposal honours both the text and the spirit of the bid that prevailed on that momentous day in Singapore in 2005. Spurs say they&apos;d keep the promise to maintain an international standard athletics stadium in London post-2012 by revamping the old one at Crystal Palace. Would that qualify?  Meanwhile, Tottenham MP David Lammy has spoken of his constituency becoming a &quot;dustbowl&quot; if it&apos;s local club re-locates. A brand new White Hart Line ground would be central to a larger urban regeneration scheme which Lammy and his local Council say is desperately needed if the area&apos;s poverty and unemployment aren&apos;t to deepen. What would do if you were in charge? The West Ham package looks the more natural fit, not least geographically: it&apos;s just a spit from Upton Park whereas the view of many a Spurs fan is that any part of the capital with a postcode that starts with &quot;E&quot; is a foreign land. Could the club feasibly retain the first part of its name if it headed east? Yet several observers feel that Tottenham are on the charge and that the longer Avram Grant&apos;s team stays adjacent to the relegation trap door, the worse West Ham&apos;s chances become. And Boris sees himself as a value-for-money Mayor. The big choice will be finalised before the end of March, though a &quot;preferred bidder&quot; is expected to be identified in the next few weeks."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/14/tottenham-olympic-stadium-bid", "sentences": ["Coe&apos;s insistence that the athletics legacy must be delivered on the Park is partly personal \u2013 he made the promise in Singapore and deeply believes it could reinvigorate the sport in the UK \u2013 and partly political given his ambitions in global sports politics beyond the Games."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-14T07:00:04Z", "title": "Tottenham Olympic Stadium bid has economic certainty at its core", "tags": ["Olympic Stadium", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Football", "Sport", "Olympic Games 2012", "UK news", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Tottenham Hotspur&apos;s late bid to take control of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford was not taken seriously at first by fans, politicians or the Olympic community. It is now. Originally dismissed as a stalking horse to improve their chances of getting planning permission for a new stadium at White Hart Lane and put pressure on those \u2013 Transport for London, English Heritage and Haringey council \u2013 making what the club saw as onerous demands, plan B has become plan A. If Spurs are granted preferred bidder status when the Olympic Park Legacy Company makes its decision on 28 January, they must hand over a sizeable bond to underline that fact. The seriousness of their intent became clear in October when Tim Leiweke, the president of the US sports and entertainment company AEG, flew to London and tossed a hand grenade into the debate. Revealing that the plan was to demolish the existing stadium, remove the track and rebuild the ground as a purpose-built football stadium lit the touchpaper on a fiery debate that will not end with the OPLC&apos;s decision. This week&apos;s salvo from David Keirle, the head of the firm of architects drawing up Spurs&apos; plans for a new stadium that they claim will be the best in Europe, raised the stakes further. It was a high-risk strategy. On the one hand it risked fixing in the public imagination that their pitch involved tearing down a stadium built using \u00a3496m of taxpayers&apos; money just a few months after it hosts the Games. On the other it enabled Spurs to make a pitch directly to their fans and plant doubts in the minds of their West Ham counterparts. Just as there is unrest among some Spurs fans about moving east, so there are a growing number of West Ham fans questioning whether Stratford would really be a better option. Most of all it was aimed at raising doubts about West Ham&apos;s ability to make the economics work. The argument about knocking down the stadium is more subtle than it first appears. In many ways the real surprise is that there was not more outrage in 2005 at the fact that around half a billion pounds is being spent on building a temporary structure. Then, the default plan was to reduce it from 80,000 to 25,000 seats after the Games. Given that it will cost around \u00a31m a year to maintain, Spurs say it is better to simply knock it down and build a state-of-the-art football stadium that can support itself for decades. The Spurs pitch is based on economic certainty. Trust us, it is saying to the government, the legacy company and the mayor, and we will not come back with a begging bowl in years to come. They point to a strong supporter base and a growing global brand as evidence that they can be relied upon to deliver the return that will be promised to the OPLC under the terms of the lease agreement. They can point across the Thames to AEG&apos;s success in turning the abject Millennium Dome into the hugely successful O2 and their ability to programme a calendar of sports and entertainment events that will keep the site busy for 365 days a year. In October, AEG Europe president David Campbell pushed those buttons: &quot;We went into a big white elephant and made it work for the government and work for us. We hope we can do the same here.&quot; More difficult will be winning over Seb Coe and the athletics lobby. Spurs are adamant that the two sports cannot coexist and claim their plans offer a better legacy for athletics in any case. But UK Athletics, and an ever-growing list of athletes, are convinced the offer to refurbish Crystal Palace and establish a &quot;legacy fund&quot; for the sport is nothing more than window dressing. Ed Warner, the UK Athletics chairman, believes the inspirational effect of giving British athletes the goal of competing on the same track where the 2012 Games took place cannot be measured in pounds and pence. The International Olympic Committee said yesterday it would prefer the track to stay but would not intervene. Coe&apos;s insistence that the athletics legacy must be delivered on the Park is partly personal \u2013 he made the promise in Singapore and deeply believes it could reinvigorate the sport in the UK \u2013 and partly political given his ambitions in global sports politics beyond the Games. But Coe does not perhaps have the leverage he once did. For the club there are 200 million other good reasons for the move. It estimates building the 60,000-capacity football stadium and renovating Crystal Palace will cost \u00a3250m, and they could potentially recoup a considerable sum of that by selling the naming rights for the ground. By contrast, the plan to rebuild White Hart Lane has been costed at nearer \u00a3450m. The club reason that, with fans travelling an average of 40 miles to White Hart Lane and a high proportion coming from Hertfordshire and Essex, the benefits to the club and supporters of the new location will outweigh their historical attachment to N17. They believe they can argue that the design of the new stadium, fusing a traditional &quot;English&quot; football atmosphere with comfort and innovation, shows they put supporters first. Although there is a vocal campaign against the move, the club believe the majority of fans would follow them east. With the looming introduction of Uefa&apos;s Financial Fair Play rules that will force clubs to maximise revenues to compete and the lure of a new stadium, they believe supporters will ultimately follow their heads rather than their hearts. For Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman and representative of the club&apos;s majority shareholder who has shrewdly plotted their course to the Champions League despite the limitations of White Hart Lane, there might be another motivation. Those opposing the Tottenham plan are convinced there must be more to it than meets the eye. If Levy has got an eye on a sale - whether to AEG, the Qataris or some other suitor - then winning the race to occupy a purpose built stadium in a very well connected part of London that will soon have the eyes of the world on it will increase the value of his asset exponentially. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 January 2011. The original stated that Daniel Levy is the club&apos;s majority shareholder. This has been corrected."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jan/15/dear-jeremy-work-advice", "sentences": ["The situation is complicated because no one else works in the UK and I am comparing my salary with those in the US and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-15T00:01:07Z", "title": "Dear Jeremy", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money"], "article": "The royal wedding is a public holiday \u2013 but we can&apos;t close   I serve a board of management (all volunteers) for a small charity and am responsible for HR. The board employs 14 staff, all of whom work part-time (from 2.5 to 30 hours per week) in an organisation that functions 365 days a year. Present paid holiday entitlement is &quot;six working weeks inclusive of all bank and public holidays&quot;.\u00a0  How can we best, and fairly, manage the extra public holiday for the royal wedding? I have studied articles, blogs and employment law websites, but opinion is polarised and vague. Jeremy says This seems a perfect question to open up to readers. Meanwhile, some thoughts from me. I&apos;m not altogether surprised that the advice you&apos;ve gleaned so far has been vague and contradictory. All workplaces are different, and yours \u2013 with an all part-time payroll working such a wide diversity of hours per week \u2013 isn&apos;t going to fall into any neat and conventional pattern. But it just could be that the fair solution you&apos;re quite properly looking for lies in that very fact. By the sound of it, those 14 people of yours are likely to be of different ages, with different interests and family obligations. Rather than apply some set of objective criteria, such as seniority or length of service \u2013 which, although it might appear to be fair and rational, would be bound to ignore the particular circumstances of certain individuals \u2013 I suggest you invite them all to help you solve this conundrum. Put the problem to them absolutely openly, and almost as a game. Start with two facts: they&apos;re all entitled to a day&apos;s holiday to mark the royal wedding but, as on every other day of the year, the charity needs to be staffed. So first question: are there any members of staff who would prefer to take their extra day at some other time? If that fails to identify enough volunteers, ask them each to write down on a scrap of paper, from 0 to 10, just how important it is for them to be with friends and relations on that day. Then ask those with the lowest numbers if they would be happy to volunteer. And if that fails, ask if they would prefer to have names drawn out of a hat. By involving them in this way you&apos;ll help them see the impossibility of keeping everyone happy \u2013 and have the best chance of a least-worst solution. Readers say \u2022 You don&apos;t say what kind of charity, but the 365 days comment makes me think you offer telephone support? Presumably, on any one day, not all 14 staff are working? What&apos;s the minimum number of staff required to operate your service on that day? I&apos;d start by asking for volunteers and see if you can cover it that way, and let them have the extra day off later on in the year. AnonIPs \u2022 Give your staff the extra bank holiday on a pro-rata basis. The extra day equates to a fifth of a &quot;normal&quot; five-day working week, so if they work 2.5 hours per week they&apos;re entitled to an extra half-hour&apos;s leave, and if they work 30 hours per week they&apos;re entitled to an extra six hours&apos; leave, to be booked and taken in accordance with your normal procedures. locolomo I&apos;ve taken over only to find that everyone else is paid more than me I lead a small, internationally based writing team at a City firm. I have been with this organisation for two years and was promoted to team leader three months ago. This was a new role, which I proposed to my manager myself. I was not awarded a pay rise at the time and thought it wise to wait until &quot;pay review season&quot;.  In the meantime, I have already succeeded in improving the team&apos;s performance significantly. I have been awarded unusually high marks in my own performance appraisal and have received excellent feedback. My dilemma is that now that I am in charge of awarding pay rises to my team I have realised that I earn 12% less than my lowest-earning team member and 40% less than the highest earner. The situation is complicated because no one else works in the UK and I am comparing my salary with those in the US and Singapore. Perhaps the fact that I am three years younger than the youngest team member should also be taken into consideration.  I have twice brought this issue up with my manager but she argues that the company never awards more than small pay rises, even on promotion. She suggested awarding me slightly higher pay rises over many years to even the situation out. But, in that case, we are looking at about 40 years before I can catch up with my highest-earning team member! Eventually she agreed to send my case to HR to see whether my pay matches that of other people doing a similar job in the UK but I have heard nothing. I also think that issue is not as relevant as the gaps between the pay of individual team members. I am beginning to feel that I am being taken for granted and would ordinarily look for another job, but I am going on maternity leave in late spring. I have made it clear that I will stay in touch with the team and am committed to coming back.  If nothing satisfactory materialises at this pay review, should I take my case directly to HR? Or perhaps my manager&apos;s manager? I am beginning to feel uncharacteristically demotivated and annoyed. Jeremy says I can quite understand your frustration \u2013 but you must do all you humanly can not to let it warp your judgment. Start by doing a little mental audit of what&apos;s good about your working life. You have a job you enjoy and do well. You&apos;re highly regarded and well trusted. You&apos;re unusually young for the position you&apos;ve reached. And you can confidently look forward to being welcomed back on your return from maternity leave. With the single significant exception of salary, that&apos;s a pretty hefty credit balance and one you&apos;d be extremely short-sighted to jeopardise. Next: be careful not to become hypnotised by the discrepancy between your salary and that of the highest-paid member of your team. There are always anomalies, particularly in multinational companies, and if you set your sights on closing this gap immediately you&apos;ll probably doom all negotiation to failure. Neither should you bypass your manager. Rather you should put a reasoned case, based on your promotion, your new responsibilities and your excellent appraisals, for a stated increase that still leaves you behind your highest-paid colleague but significantly ahead of your lowest. Put this case to your manager, in writing and with an open copy to HR. Do your best not to let your pent-up annoyance show through. If that doesn&apos;t do the trick, I&apos;d begin to suspect that there was some flaw in your own analysis. Readers say \u2022 Firstly, do you know what your market rate actually is? What would a competitor pay you, with your level of experience? You need to do some research. Cold, hard facts are hard to ignore, whereas emotional arguments undermine your case. There is no reason for a company to pay you more than those in your team, who operate in different markets and have different skills, demotivating though this is. Secondly there is no doubt in my mind (I work in HR) that they are dragging their heels waiting for you to go on maternity leave. So don&apos;t waste time. Research a good strong case and present it to your manager. And then chase until you get a response. I doubt you&apos;ll get the 40% hike you are after (there is a recession on), but you might see some movement. ExBrightonBelle \u2022 I wonder if the issue is that you&apos;re about to go on maternity leave? Wrong as it is, could you use this as a bargaining chip by negotiating a pay rise that would start on your return to work? You get the pay rise, they get the reassurance that you&apos;ll return. PlinkyPlonky \u2022 Why don&apos;t you view your promotion from a long-term perspective and drop the salary issue for the moment. You were promoted over your older, more experienced colleagues and you now have a better title and position to put on your CV. Raise the issue after your return from maternity leave. If your company is not prepared to increase your salary then, walk. custardicecream \u2022 You&apos;ve achieved a title and role that you can take with you. Resign after you&apos;ve returned from maternity leave and join a company that will reward seniority and level of responsibility. londonsupergirl \u2022 With regards to leaving your job, unless you need the additional money, do consider the other elements of your current position \u2013 the culture/values, your colleagues, how you&apos;re perceived. There are worse things in a job than having a slightly lower salary than you feel entitled to.

Her influences \u2013 from Morricone soundtracks to doomy goth and opera \u2013 suggest her music could be preposterously overblown, yet Calvi is clearly an expert when it comes to dynamics and restraint.

Her self-titled debut album is out on Domino on January 17.  ARGENTINA     The flag of Argentina     ZonaindieLes Mentettes Orchestra - Cosmic Sidewalks       Les Mentettes Orchestra is the augmented version of Les Mentettes, a psychedelic pop band from Buenos Aires that features more than 20 musicians live on stage. A couple of years ago we featured one of their early recordings, but now it&apos;s time to unveil a great song from their first and self-titled album. It was recorded live at ION, a legendary studio that still works with tape and analog equipment. The album is available on iTunes and there&apos;s also a video of Cosmic Sidewalks. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Spartak - Nightshift (Version)       Spartak were one of many great bands I discovered on the recently released compilation, The Sound of Young Canberra, which is full of exciting music from the oft-forgotten titular city. Spartak&apos;s tune stands out amongst a very strong set that makes a solid case for reevaluating Australia&apos;s capital as something of an emerging cultural hub. Nightshift (Version) reminds me of a Spoon demo, bringing together Spoon&apos;s knack for effortless songs draped in subtle studio trickery. I look forward to more from these guys. BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoApanhador S\u00f3 - Maria Augusta       Contagious and catchy, Maria Augusta is an indie semi-hit from Apanhador S\u00f3, a band from the cold south of Brazil who released a good album last year that can be downloaded for free via their website. They&apos;re part of a new scene of bands who sing in Portuguese, of which they are considered one of the greatest revelations. Maria Augusta quietly shows a group that do not take the easy route - they explore alternative ways of making music, such as using a bicycle wheel as an instrument. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicHooded Fang - Laughing       Think of The Strokes. Now think of The Strokes if they slowed things down considerably, but still managed to retain all their cool and catchiness. Got a picture/sound in your head? Then, as Laughing shows, you&apos;ve got a good idea of what Hooded Fang sounds like. CHILE       Super 45Elefante Mec\u00e1nico - G\u00e9nesis       G\u00e9nesis heralds the comeback of Elefante Mec\u00e1nico after their celebrated Memorias De Un Elefante album, self-released in 2008. In this record, Bame, Jota and DJ Antioch pick up on old school hip-hop sounds, throwing inspired rhymes about cosmos, love and eternity. CHINA       WooozyPet Conspiracy  - Beyond       Beijing-based Pet Conspiracy plays funky, danceable electronic music that takes influences from punk-rock, new wave and disco. The band consists of two female singers, a guitar/synthesizer player and a drummer. Lead guitarist Hu Zi is already an established artist in the Beijing underground scene as an electronic musician. Pet Conspiracy is known for their high-energy live performances and the array of toys and costumes they bring on stage. They have just returned from a successful tour of Europe. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaThe Colombian Party Cartel - La Murga De Colombia       Two Colombians and one gringo make up The Colombian Party Cartel. The crew resides in the United States, where every weekend they mix the best Colombian music. Carey James is the lead vocalist and principal producer of CPC. La Murga De Colombia samples a Willie Col\u00f3n song and creates a new fusion of Colombian cumbia and urban style. DENMARK       All ScandinavianCODY - The Light       The vessel for frontman Kaspar Kaae&apos;s musical output, alternative country and americana seven-piece CODY hit it big in Denmark in 2009 with their excellent debut album Songs from which The Light is taken. Come March they&apos;ll play both Canadian Music Fest and SXSW, and if you&apos;re around Toronto March 9-13 and/or Austin March 16-20 (no specific dates or venues yet) be sure to check out CODY - they&apos;re really a great live band as well. ESTONIA       PopopGalvanic Elephants - Rum Rumble       Galvanic Elephants hail from Tartu. They came together in August 2010 and have released only one single so far, but that one song has earned them praise from critics and music bloggers and created anticipation for new material that should be released soon. With no concerts announced so far either, Rum Rumble is the only chance to enjoy the rough sound of Galvanic Elephants right now, but it definitely makes you want more. FINLAND       GlueOn Volcano - Acceleration Of Heartbeat       On Volcano is one of the best underground bands in the Finnish indie scene. They play obscure post-rock songs with long instrumental movements and intense dynamics and atmospherics. Their latest EP is available for free on their website. GERMANY       BlogparteiSizarr - Fake Foxes       Sizarr are lucky guys. Yet to finish school, they have already played big festivals in Germany such as the renowned Melt! without being signed to a label yet. These three guys from Landau have a very distinctive style, especially singer Fabian Altst\u00f6tter, whose voice is very dark and uses a memorable stretching technique. Together they create modern electonica landscapes inspired by many other genres. They plan to record their debut album this year. GREECE       Mouxlalouloudadrog_A_tek - In_No_Sense       The movie Homeland, directed by Syllas Tzoumerkas, is an explosive parable of Greece coming apart at the seams, shown through the spectrum of a dysfunctional family, which decides to give up one of its members for adoption to a richer relative. The original music score, a compelling concoction of styles that continually surprises, reflects precisely those feelings. drog_A_tek, a band that records moments in real-time and produces temporary audiovisual environments, uses objects, analogue and digital musical instruments, typewriters, frequencies, recording archives/waste and technology landscapes to depict the film&apos;s mood. As a result of this, no moment of Homeland is left unfilled with sparkling music ideas. Listen to In_No_Sense, where their ingenuity shines. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaMiri - G\u00f3\u00f0a Konan       Miri began at the LungA festival in the east fjords of Iceland in 2003. The debut EP, Fallegt \u00deorp, was recorded live one night during this festival in 2005, produced by Curver Thoroddsen. The band plays almost wordless, progressive noise mixed with beautiful guitar work. G\u00f3\u00f0a Konan is featured on their 2010 full album Okkar. INDIA       IndiecisionAdam And The Fish Eyed Poets - Little Monkeys       Adam And The Fish Eyed Poets is the solo project of Kishore Krishna from Chennai. His music finds a place between the lush industrial sound of Nine Inch Nails and rootsy American rockabilly. Little Monkeys comes from his debut album, Snakeism. Featuring several clinky electronica bells and whistles, it is a resounding tune that is over almost as quickly as it starts. It&apos;s a builder in a hurry; a chorus-heavy singalong that&apos;s emphatic and imminently memorable. INDONESIA       Deathrockstar((Auman)) - W.K.G.G.       Auman means &quot;animal&apos;s roar&quot;, and their music is wild, dirty and full of energy - like a tiger deep in the Sumatra jungle that is ready to eat its prey. ((Auman)) is the latest group worth hearing in the local headbanger scene. IRELAND       Nialler9Retarded Cop - Copvan       Formerly of Dublin punk rockers Moutpiece, Gaz Le Rock has expanded his repertoire into an amazing 30-minute radio show called The Loving Room Floor and is now releasing tunes at a blistering pace as Retarded Cop, a project which has the catchiest pop-punk tunes you&apos;ll hear all year. A debut LP is forthcoming. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelYerachmiel - Yom Shekulo       Yerachmiel &quot;Rocky&quot; Ziegler is an international musician who owns Little Apple Studios in the trendy Jerusalem artists&apos; enclave Nachlaot. He is an authentically indie artist, though his work is distributed worldwide and features on several albums. Yerachmiel&apos;s music spans several genres but this specific song, Yom Shekulo, is a trance-rock rendition of ancient Passover liturgy that speaks of Messianic times (and it really picks up quite nicely in the middle). ITALY       PolaroidYoung Wrists - I Want You To Disappear       Alberto and Letizia come from the coastal town of Pesaro and there is definitely a breezy, summery shade in their jangly, noisy pop. Behind their C86 abrasive guitars and shining melodies you can hear a bright ode to adolescence and nostalgia, in the vein of The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart or Dum Dum Girls. Well, you can decide not to trust me because I am too involved and helped them release their debut 7&apos;&apos; (on We Were Never Being Boring), but just listen to this bittersweet bonus track and fall in love right now. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaDisco Ruido! - Amorfos       Although Disco Ruido! has made its name in Mexico City&apos;s hipster nightlife as a non-stop party combo, their debut album delves into a neon-blurred nostalgia from lost childhood afternoons watching pop stars miming on TV. Mercedes sings like a doll high on ephedrine (no doubt this song&apos;s title is translated as &quot;amorphous&quot;), while the band explores the enormous legacy of harmonies that dwell in the Mexican collective memory. I wish Thal\u00eda and Paulina Rubio (the glamour-pusses from seminal 80s teenybopper group Timbiriche) could be doing this kind of sophisti-pop. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamLola Kite - Everything&apos;s Better       At times pop trio Lola Kite can&apos;t resist the playfulness of lo-fi, losing themselves to retro electro-pop tech and washes of hazy, melodic psychedelia - which undoubtedly reminds you of Animal Collective when combined. However, their debut album Lights, finally released this month following loads of gigging promise, shows they&apos;re more than a quirky and charming proposition, upping their game with upbeat and snappy dance-pop gems such as Everything&apos;s Better.  This Amsterdam indie quartet are fresh, frisky and dancefloor flammable. There are certainly retro guitar-pop elements at play here, such as their saucy bursts of swaggering guitar jangle. But any hints of classic garage rock are mixed with quirky synths and fun, big beat grooves. So much so that their Girl Singer EP is topped off with remixes by NON Records labelmates Palmbomen and Bear. The tracks lend themselves perfectly to dance-friendly interpretations - Soulwax come to mind in this sense - which is why we&apos;ve chosen the Bear remix of Pet Needs Friends as a party-starting introduction. NEW ZEALAND       Einstein Music JournalGolden Axe - Telephone       There&apos;s nothing like the enthusiastic waveform tones of Golden Axe. Named after the Sega game, Chris Cudby and Daif Kent&apos;s keyboard-based band has been making party-friendly psychedelic music since late 2001. True to their fun and eccentric form, the July release party for their latest album, Fantasy Footwork, saw them play inside a giant paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 igloo that they made themselves. Download the Telephone EP and buy Fantasy Footwork from their Bandcamp. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceAristillus - Dying, Keep Dying       The members of Aristillus are aged 17 and 18 but, in spite of their youth, they sound much more mature than many other hardcore bands. With heavy drums, sharp guitars and lyrics as dark as their sound, I believe they&apos;ll soon get a lot more attention. Their influences are Norwegian hardcore bands such as Sn\u00f6ras, JR Ewing, Kollwitz and Rumble In Rhodos, and they&apos;re releasing their debut album, Devoured Trees &amp; Crystal Skies, on January 24 on the Norwegian indie label Fysisk Format. Aristillus is playing at by:Larm 2011 and I&apos;m quite sure that won&apos;t be the last you&apos;ll hear from them this year. PERU       SoTBVoz Propia - Lentes Amarillos       With a career spanning more than 20 years, Voz Propia is still current, their sound having been renewed to the demands of each time. El Manifesto is their eighth production and it could be the definitive work of this mature band. Post-punk is the essence in their sound again so hold on, Voz Propia is back. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Balla - Equil\u00edbrio?       Armando Teixeira, who has been playing in bands and as a solo artist for more than 25 years, is one of the most talented contemporary musicians and producers of modern Portuguese music. He is a creative multi-instrumentist and sought-after producer for labels and studios. Balla is one of his solo projects and we wish to thank Armando for letting MAP make Equil\u00edbrio? the first free, worldwide downloadable track from latest album Equil\u00edbrio. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseNebulosa - Trains       Nebulosa is the music space child of three people living on different continents: Noamme, Andrei and Vladimir. The sound is dreamy and sincere, using very simple chord structures and lyrics. Their debut EP, Chimes, can be downloaded from their website, a free ticket to the stars. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopAaron Wright &amp; The Aprils - Go On Yer Self       Aaron Wright &amp; The Aprils&apos; self-titled debut album, due out conveniently enough in April, features guest vocal contributions from Camera Obscura&apos;s Tracyanne Campbell and Teenage Fanclub&apos;s Norman Blake as well as instrumental ones from Belle &amp; Sebastian duo Stevie Jackson and Mick Cooke. Those influences certainly makes themselves heard on Go On Yer Self, which mixes a classic Scottish folk-rock sound with a strong helping of Beatles-esque melody-making. The 24-year-old shaggy-haired Edinburgh singer and his band will be heading out on tour in March as support to The Charlatans. The ingenious video for their new single, Trampoline, is also worth a look. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...Kevin Lester - Rockstar 2.0 feat Vanessa Fernandez       Hip hop isn&apos;t something one associates with Singapore&apos;s music scene, but it exists, usually even more underground than rock, metal or hardcore. Ironically, it&apos;s in response to rampant commercial radio that the local music community, regardless of style, has become a close-knit family. In his debut, Kevin Lester brings out the collaborative and experimental strengths of hip hop, forging a sound with slashes of rock and soul, and working with some of the country&apos;s best singers to put out a record with incredible heart and talent. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Thieve - Champion       Thieve are a trio hailing from the hub of Cape Town, whose motto and reason for picking the band name comes from the fact that &quot;nothing is original - everybody steals&quot;. While you can hear that sentiment heavily influences their song, Champion, they maintain a unique feel with their melding of swirling pop rhythms, a soft rock sound and a nostalgic lovestruck feel to their lyrics. With the experience of all the members being involved in previous well-known bands, they&apos;ve turned Thieve into a tight-knit group that is set to take over the rock &apos;n&apos; roll scene.  SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKSwimmingdoll - Last Take       After a year in the making, experimental shoegaze band Swimmingdoll were finally ready to present their first album, 8wimmingdoll, in the last weeks of 2010. Last Take is a gorgeous layered production with a sound well suited for &quot;the infinite world of the spacewalk&quot; the band wish to portray. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerOblique - Without Making Noise       Oblique&apos;s music and aesthetic could remind us of 80s electro-industrial music (or even EBM) bands and, certainly, their biggest inspiration comes from dark synthpop acts such as The Human League or Ladytron. Without Making Noise, the second single taken from the eponymous album of this trio from Barcelona, features dark atmospherics and, of course, a catchy chorus. It&apos;s got what it takes to be a perfect futurepop track. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseKlifton Filente - It Takes A Thorn To Remove A Thorn       Klifton Filente is one of the underappreciated, unsigned and relatively unknown artists from Sweden that I am keeping my eye on. On the song It Takes A Thorn To Remove A Thorn, taken from their Common Ground album, you can hear echoes of Crosby, Stills and Nash as well as the lilting folk-pop of early Paul Simon. SWITZERLAND       78sAie \u00e7a Gicle - Whisper Jet       Sonic Youth is the keyword when it comes to Aie \u00e7a Gicle&apos;s musical universe. But the band&apos;s debut album S.Y.R.U.P. offers more than just a blueprint. Their influences range from post-punk to grunge to post-rock. They pile guitar layer upon guitar layer, interlace some catchy refrains and try to be as laid-back as possible. UNITED STATES     The flag of the United States of America     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingSmith Westerns - Weekend       Chicago&apos;s Smith Westerns break out of the relatively dull and dispassionate tunes of their first record and, in the upcoming Dye It Blonde LP, give us 2011&apos;s first truly great album. It&apos;s a wonderful construction upon the flashy glam rock that gave careers to David Bowie and T-Rex, endlessly listenable and replayable, particularly opening track Weekend.

How the West Was Lost is a dyspeptic account of what this might imply. The rosy scenario that most economists would suggest (if they dared to tackle such a large issue) would be that the convergence of the emerging market economies on the west is mutually beneficial: we can all prosper together. Dambisa Moyo, author of the bestselling Dead Aid, is having none of this. She argues that the west has become mired in complacency: each of the drivers of growth \u2013 capital accumulation, skill accumulation, and technical innovation \u2013 have stalled, and there is no political will to salvage the situation. The market for capital has failed in its core task of finding investment opportunities that offer good returns at acceptable risk. Moyo is a former employee of Goldman Sachs, and her diagnosis of the recent disasters in financial markets is succinct and sophisticated: &quot;Debt claimants failed in their fiduciary duty to police the equity holders because they were hedged by public policy.&quot; Not only did the prospect of bailouts generate moral hazard, but the generous subsidies for home ownership diverted investment into housing, squeezing more productive alternative uses such as infrastructure and innovation. Above all, in the west, both households and governments got into debt to finance consumption at levels that will prove unsustainable: in contrast, China, both people and government, has been saving at rates without historical precedent. As to skills, Moyo sees complacency in government in the face of declining schooling standards relative to those in the emerging societies. Among parents she sees folly as they collude in their children&apos;s fantasies of becoming sporting or entertainment celebrities rather than getting down to the hard grind of learning how to be productive: in east Asia children spend many more hours doing schoolwork than they do in the west. In the face of these daunting challenges, she sees public policy in the west hamstrung by an obsession with individual rights and a reluctance to face reality. In a telling example from 2009, she contrasts the decisive Chinese response to an outbreak of pneumonic plague with the spineless British response to swine flu. The Chinese government instantly sealed off the affected city and placed it in quarantine, an action almost inconceivable in the west. In contrast, the British government feared a popular backlash and doled out anti-flu drugs, despite the scientific evidence that not only were they unnecessary, but that profligate distribution would help the virus to\u00a0mutate. Moyo sees all this ending in tears. The west will lose out in the scramble for finite resources, and so as &quot;the rest&quot; rise &quot;the west&quot; will decline, not just relatively but absolutely. China has evolved an economic model in which the government guides development, accumulating capital, investing in state-of-the-art productive infrastructure, encouraging science, and buying up global resources. This may not be efficient, in the sense of maximising living standards at any particular moment, but it is effective in driving them relentlessly upwards. The other emerging economies see that this is successful. They have no love for the west, and so will follow China both as a model and as a political leader. Meanwhile, the west, and in particular the US, is stuck with an excessive faith in market mechanisms, combined with a political system that will push it increasingly into the most dysfunctional aspects of social welfare: dependency of the poor on government handouts, financed by public debt. Her proposed solution for the US is as radical as is her diagnosis: trade protectionism and debt default. She argues that were America to retreat into autarky and default it would fare much better than the devastation it would impose on China as an exporter and creditor. Moyo is not, I think, seriously advocating these policies; rather, her point is that as a credible threat they would improve American bargaining power vis-a-vis China. What are we to make of the Moyo thesis? Inevitably, in a short book of such a sweeping nature, there are many hostages to critics. I will let these pass. I do not share Moyo&apos;s pessimism, but I applaud her brave alarum against our economic and social complacency: her core concerns are sufficiently close to painful truths to warrant our attention. She is right that the rise of &quot;the rest&quot; will widen inequalities within the west: it has already. To respond effectively, governments need to reskill our population, combining carrots and sticks so as to get everyone into productive work. She is also right that the psychological shock as the west realises that it is no longer top dog could lead to demoralisation. Britain pioneered western disillusion: famously, having lost an empire, we floundered for two decades struggling to &quot;find a role&quot;. Americans are in for an analogous shock as other economies become dominant, and as other societies offer higher living standards: if you want to see the future visit Singapore, not New York. The divisive and dysfunctional politics of America may become increasingly reminiscent of Britain in the 1970s. To respond effectively may well require a vision that is both tougher and simpler than the principles of market efficiency that have guided economic policy in recent decades: investment needs to be prioritised over consumption. The difference in vision is well illustrated by infrastructure. The consensus among western economists is that infrastructure offers only low returns and so substantial investment is not worthwhile. American and British infrastructure policies over recent decades have reflected this consensus. Yet a distinguished minority argues that the conventional approach to the measuring of benefits misses all the strategic gains. In contrast to the lousy infrastructure of the US and Britain, China is building high-speed railways. As a result of our investment parsimony and Chinese investment profligacy, the current generation of westerners can consume at a level far above that of the Chinese. But will our grandchildren congratulate us on being so smart?

As a trainee city planner in 1972, one of my professors forcefully disputed my belief that cities are cancers in the body ecological, but it&apos;s still true. Radically new forms of urbanism are key to unlocking a lower-ecological-footprint future. I travel back through Beijing, Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, but there is no question that London is one of the world&apos;s urban crown jewels. That said, how can our 2012 Olympics possibly match, never mind trump, the Australians with their Sydney Harbour fireworks for the first &apos;Green Olympics&apos; in 2004\u2014let alone Beijing&apos;s 7-years-in-the-planning, 10,000-performers-in-unison spectacular in 2008?  Charged with conjuring up London&apos;s launch ceremony, filmmaker Danny Boyle has decided to play another game entirely. I haven&apos;t the faintest notion of what he&apos;s planning, but let&apos;s hope that the event makes the world feel genuinely welcome in this city - and helps us all embrace that wider world.  So here&apos;s an idea. Rather like the West End switching on the lights in the run-up to Christmas, we plan to illuminate London&apos;s extraordinary cluster of sustainability-focused organisations in time for 2012 and what are now billed as the &apos;One Planet Olympics&apos;. You might even say, though we won&apos;t, that London is now the &apos;SustainAbility Capital of the World&apos;. What we do have is a world-class cluster of organisations working on &apos;One Planet&apos; solutions.  We&apos;ve all heard the mantra: if everyone in the world consumed like the average European, we would need three planets\u2014and five if they consumed like the average American. But if you were visiting London in 2012, how would you find One Planet London? Adding further urgency, next year will also mark the 20th anniversary of the UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, and the 25th anniversary of the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future, which launched sustainable development into the political mainstream. So here&apos;s an invitation. Volans is taking the initiative in convening, mapping, celebrating and co-evolving One Planet London, our extraordinary cluster of solution providers. We have just begun reaching out for help, but already have interest from the Guardian Sustainable Business team, from companies like SAP and Virgin, from NGOs like the Carbon Disclosure Project, the Global Footprint Network and Forum for the Future, from catalytic institutions like the Clinton Foundation, from service providers like Futerra and SustainAbility, and from educators like Imperial College and the Royal College of Art.  Interested in joining us in opening up One Planet London to the rest of the world and in developing a guide format that cities around the world could use? What can you bring to the party?

Tessa Jowell, the former Olympic minister who retains a place on the London 2012 board, said that only West Ham United&apos;s joint bid with Newham council fulfilled the promises made in the bid book. &quot;When we won the Olympics we made a clear promise to the international community and the people of this country, that the stadium would have athletics at its core,&quot; she said. &quot;This wasn&apos;t a promise we made to win the bid, but a clear statement of intent about the future of sport in our country.&quot; &quot;The Olympic Park Legacy Company will make its decision about the legacy tenant for the stadium in just over a week&apos;s time and there are now only two bids on the table. Only one of these, the joint bid from West Ham and Newham Council, fulfils the promises we made and the criteria we set out when we were in government.&quot; In 2005 Jowell told the International Olympic Committee before the vote: &quot;The stadium will be a purpose-built home for athletics for generations to come.&quot; And the UK Athletics&apos; head coach, Charles van Commenee, claimed today the sport would be less well off than it is in Lithuania or Estonia, despite hosting the Olympics, if the track is removed. &quot;If London doesn&apos;t have a stadium where we can organise major championships in athletics, that puts you in a category in Europe that I can&apos;t even think of,&quot; he said. &quot;Is there any capital in Europe that can&apos;t do this? Even Vilnius or Tallinn [in Lithuania and Estonia] can do that.&quot; Jowell said the promise to provide an athletics legacy within the Olympic Park was very clear. &quot;It&apos;s in the bid book. It says the stadium will have athletics at its core. That&apos;s not an ambiguous promise. It was very clear.&quot; The Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) has promised to try to reach a decision on a preferred bidder by 28 January, but it looks increasingly as though it will miss that deadline. Jowell said she was not privy to the financial details of the West Ham bid but believed it was commercially sustainable. &quot;The commercial strength of West Ham&apos;s bid is not just based on its ability to get large crowds to football matches, although that is an important part. It is for the use of the stadium all year round in many different guises, with regular athletics fixtures, showcases for rugby, cricket and American football as well as regular entertainment events,&quot; she told the Guardian. &quot;As the bid is partnered with Newham Council, we can be assured that there will be real community involvement. They will have school community education projects, all sorts of community mass participation events. They have partnered with Live Nation, the world&apos;s largest live entertainment company, and Westfield, the world&apos;s largest listed retail property group. This isn&apos;t West Ham on their own, you&apos;ve got some very serious players who will add to the revenues streams.&quot; As part of what appeared to be a co-ordinated attempt to influence the OPLC, the British International Olympic Committee member Sir Craig Reedie \u2013 who also played a key role in landing the Games in Singapore in 2005 \u2013 said it would be &quot;regretful in the extreme&quot; and the country would lose &quot;all credibility&quot; in international sporting circles if it reneged on the promise to retain an athletics track. Reedie said that if the stadium was knocked by Spurs, who have promised to instead refurbish Crystal Palace to provide the 25,000 seat athletics stadium originally proposed, it would risk repeating the fiasco that surrounded London&apos;s botched staging of the 2005 athletics World Championships. &quot;If you have made mistakes and you then recover from that, you better not make them again,&quot; Reedie said. &quot;It seems to me at the moment this argument over who would become a tenant in the Olympic Stadium is in danger of repeating all of the previous mistakes. Spurs argue that the revamped Crystal Palace would be capable of being upgraded from 25,000 to 40,000 seats to make a bid for the 2017 World Championships viable. But Van Commenee added: &quot;I&apos;m astonished when I see all these articles, that there&apos;s even a discussion, when a promise is made at the time that we made the bid.&quot; But But Simon Clegg, who was the chief executive of the British Olympic Association when London won the Games but now the chief executive of Ipswich Town football club, claimed it would be &quot;madness&quot; to keep the track. &quot;I am very clear that it is not compatible to have football and track and field athletics in the same stadium in this country,&quot; he said. &quot;The West Ham option would be a huge challenge and I don&apos;t think it would work. The entire bid was based on the principle of sustainable legacy and not creating white elephants and only 17 months out from the Games we have still not resolved the thorny issue of future of the stadium. &quot;It&apos;s madness to suggest we should keep a track just on the basis we may get an athletics World Championships or European Championships say once every 15 to 20 years.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/19/european-tour-pga-abu-dhabi-championship", "sentences": ["In the past three months he has teed it up in China, Singapore and, this week, in the Middle East \u2013 half a world away from his home in southern California and, perhaps more significantly, the site of this week&apos;s Bob Hope Classic on the PGA Tour."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-19T22:17:53Z", "title": "Phil Mickelson is in Abu Dhabi and it's no joke for the Bob Hope Classic", "tags": ["European Tour", "PGA Tour", "Golf", "Phil Mickelson"], "article": "Professional golf is changing and proof of that was to be found on the eve of the Abu Dhabi Championship as the great and good prepared for tomorrow&apos;s opening round of the first big European Tour event of the year. Lee Westwood was there, Martin Kaymer and Graeme McDowell, too, but inevitably the eyes were drawn to Phil Mickelson. In years past, the American left-hander played golf outside the United States about as often as he had candlelit dinners with Tiger Woods. He was a home bird, a stalwart of the PGA Tour. Now he is anything but; perhaps not a &quot;world player&quot; in the manner of Gary Player or Ernie Els but he is getting there. In the past three months he has teed it up in China, Singapore and, this week, in the Middle East \u2013 half a world away from his home in southern California and, perhaps more significantly, the site of this week&apos;s Bob Hope Classic on the PGA Tour. &quot;I want to play a lot more internationally. It has been great for me and my family to experience a lot of different cultures and learn from them,&apos;&apos; he said of his decision to play this week. There is also, he neglected to mention, the small matter of the appearance fee he is being paid by the tournament organisers here, rumoured to be more than $1 million. That in itself tells a story. The PGA Tour does not allow appearance fees but in golf&apos;s new frontiers, around Asia and the Middle East, such lucrative stipends have become part of the landscape. Tiger Woods, for instance, is scheduled to play in next month&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic for a reported $3 million. In two weeks&apos; time, the Wisconsin-based US Ryder Cup player Steve Stricker will receive the first appearance fee of his career when he plays in the Qatar Masters. This is good news for Stricker&apos;s accountant and Qatari autograph hunters \u2013 the American is one of the most approachable figures in the sport \u2013 but it cannot be viewed as good news in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, home of the PGA Tour. The US Tour remains the world&apos;s richest tour and over the course of a long season it can be said to attract the best players. But for how much longer? And for how much longer can it bear to watch events like this week&apos;s Bob Hope Classic, once a premier tournament on the other side of the Atlantic, reduced to a sideshow. The field at the Hope, which is taking place in Palm Springs, has only two players from the top 40 of the world rankings. The Abu Dhabi event, meanwhile, boasts all four of last season&apos;s major championship winners, Mickelson included, along with the world No1, Westwood. From a purely golfing perspective, the next four days might offer one of the best quality tournaments of the year outside the major championships. The Englishman is trying to maintain his place at the top of the world rankings and Mickelson is out to prove he is fit again after a 2010 which began brilliantly with victory at the Masters but faded as he battled the effects of arthritis. &quot;We know we are not going to be as sharp as we are on day one at Augusta but we have to have our game ready this week. The only way to know where you stand is to play against the best,&apos;&apos; the American said. Mickelson will certainly get his wish, and on a difficult golf course made very difficult by some thick rough. It should be quite a spectacle. The rise of the Abu Dhabi event should also be recorded as a bellwether in golfing politics. In the mid-90s Greg Norman floated the idea of a world tour featuring the top 40 players in the world playing in select events but he ran into opposition from the then hugely powerful PGA Tour. The proposal, which was to be financed by the late Australian tycoon Kerry Packer, never got off the ground. Fifteen years later, Norman&apos;s vision has been partly realised, albeit without his involvement. The Australian is not in the field this week, but he will be here in spirit."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/20/the-fiver-free-football-email", "sentences": ["Falling attendances in Singapore have led authorities to begin rescheduling games so they don&apos;t clash with televised fixtures in the English Premier League.", "&quot;If fans like it, we&apos;ll look at how we can implement it more,&quot; tootled the Singaporean FA&apos;s general secretary, Winston Lee."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-20T15:59:35Z", "title": "Cowpats for goalposts | Paul Doyle | The Fiver", "tags": ["Football politics", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "FOOTBALL IS THE WORST GOVERNED SPORT IN THIS COUNTRY. DISCUSS The Fiver doesn&apos;t wash. The Fiver is frequently forced to expose itself in public. The Fiver, in this regard, is probably like you. And your children. Because though it boasts some of the richest sports clubs on the planet, Britain doesn&apos;t bother looking after the vast majority of its sports-participating people. Yes, while every hamlet in France, Germany, Holland and the rest of the civilised world is equipped with changing rooms, showers, pitches, swimming pools and so on, sporty folks in Blighty must spend their weekends attempting to peel off their shorts with frigid fingers while trying not to slip in cow pat. And as for what to do when you need to have a whizz or empty your bowels before a game, well, let&apos;s just say the Fiver has frightened more than a few Sunday drivers in its time ... Football clubs, of course, are the most wealthy in the land, yet in spite of all the money sloshing around the game, facilities in most places are roughly on a par with those for dog fighting and camel wrestling. That is not quite what the Tory MP for Kettering, Philip Hollobone, complained about to parliament today but it should have been. Instead he took only a tentative step in the right direction: &quot;Premier League footballers are vastly overpaid, Premier League clubs are hugely in debt, our national team is, in many ways, a disgrace,&quot; Hollobone exclusively revealed to Westminister. &quot;Meanwhile, in the real world with clubs like Kettering Town football club in the non-league, they are struggling to provide suitable ground facilities despite massive fan support,&quot; continued Hollobone before asking his colleague and sports minister Hugh Robertson: &quot;Would you agree with me that football in this country at the moment faces an unsustainable future unless the issues of governance are properly sorted out?&quot; &quot;If you look across sport, it is very clear to me that football is the worst governed sport in this country, without a shadow of a doubt,&quot; replied Robertson as several MPs who weren&apos;t asleep belched in agreement. Robertson then declared that he would await the findings of a culture, media and sport select committee report before deciding what to do. &quot;Action is needed and the government will take it but it wants to see the results of that select committee first,&quot; trumpeted Robertson. Hands up who thinks a Tory government will demand not merely that clubs run themselves properly but actually ensure more of their wealth trickles down to the grassroots? Perhaps that could help fill the funding gap that will be exacerbated by the Tories&apos; planned cuts? Or does the Tory plan for preventing children from playing sport in primitive conditions simply consist of preventing them from playing sport full stop?

We had to take the kid to the doctors&apos; this morning, so I was not able to start my day the usual way, which is scanning the news around 6:30 am and getting up a post or two in the morning. Everything is fine, by the way, thanks. So let&apos;s catch up on the day&apos;s events. First, the hoot of the day is the ridiculous Daily Caller headline trying to blame last year&apos;s uptick in pedestrian deaths on Michelle Obama&apos;s anti-obesity campaign. The idea here is that the first lady has sent more people out there walking, so more are dying. I&apos;m pretty sure the DC, which obviously takes some pride in writing obscenely over-the-top headlines, did this one just to goad liberals into being outraged, so I won&apos;t take the bait. Who knows, maybe they&apos;re right about the connection. Come on, Tucker, let&apos;s you and me go out cruising one night and brush past overweight pedestrians. Teach &apos;em a lesson, out there trying to lose weight on the Kenyan-socialist plan. Item two: She&apos;s running: &quot;Have there been informal conversations between supporters on the ground in Iowa and with the PAC? Of course there have,&quot; SarahPAC Treasurer Tim Crawford told POLITICO. &quot;Do we have supporters all across the nation? Yes,&quot; he continued. &quot;Do we have supporters in Iowa? Yes. Do those supporters want Sarah Palin to run for higher office? Yes, of course they do.&quot; That catechismic sentence structure is always a dead giveaway. I really dislike it and wish people would stop talking like that. Do I ever lapse into it? Occasionally, sure. And what am I hoping to convey when I do? That I&apos;m saying something without really saying it, if you get my drift. It would seem to me that she has to do something before she announces to try to fix some of the post-Arizona damage. Or maybe she doesn&apos;t even think that way and doesn&apos;t see it as damage at all. Item three: I read today that the Democratic convention for 2012 is likely going to be held in either St. Louis or Charlotte, North Carolina. St. Louis has been the front-runner but Claire McAskill is getting nervous that St. Loo hasn&apos;t been named yet. They&apos;re both good picks, and, building on the Denver location last time, they mark the firm arrival of the end of the era of Democrats hugging the coasts (Chicago being the only exception). Looking back, can you believe the Democrats held back to back conventions in New York City, in 1976 and 1980? And at a time when NYC was at its absolute lowest point: The foul and filthy city of Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and porn theater marquees blaring &quot;Four Erections!&quot; at passersby? And then they returned there again in 1992? Item four: I want to leave most of the China discussion to the Guardian&apos;s redoubtable diplomatic staff, but I think Yglesias makes a point here that isn&apos;t made often enough in all the stories about how China is taking over everything:  China is a dynamo and Greece is a basket case, but Greece is much richer than China. Rapid Chinese progress does in part reflects the skill and wisdom of Chinese policymakers. But in large part it merely reflects the madness of a previous generation of Chinese policymakers\u2014the people who left the country at such a low level in 1980 from which it&apos;s so rapidly been growing. If you look at the economic success of Chinese people in Taiwan or Hong Kong or Singapore or diaspora communities around the world, the striking thing about the PRC is how poor it still is.   I read a few weeks ago that the number of Chinese we&apos;d call middle class by our standards is infinitesimal, like 50 million people or something. I&apos;m sure in some ways the regime likes it this way because once they have a truly broad middle class, then it&apos;s only a matter of time before their political system will have to change, I think. The more poor people, the more authoritarian they can get away with being. Item five: Piers Morgan&apos;s debut on CNN came away with high ratings. But what I want to know is, are there any Americans employed on British television in this manner? I mean, our prime time is littered with speakers of the king&apos;s English, from Simon Cowell (okay, he&apos;s not there anymore, but was for years) to all these Cowell imitators, and now Morgan, and Jamie Oliver and who knows who else. David McCallum. Does this work in reverse? Why not? I really don&apos;t understand it at all. Do you think I could host a British television show, with my charming Yank accent and dapper West Virginia ways?

Wheech! Out they pop! And they&apos;re gone! Looks like you&apos;ve got clean away with this one, Andy, you saucy devil! This sort of Tory news management technique may explain the reasoning behind Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy&apos;s decision to issue a statement that wan&apos;t so much an &quot;open letter to fans&quot;, more a sheet of paper rolled into a funnel through which a constant stream of warm straw-coloured water can be passed and aimed at the back of the bloke in front&apos;s legs. Insisting once again that Spurs should be allowed to move into the 2012 Olympic Stadium once the Games are over, and trash the joint, Levy made his pitch to fans who&apos;d much rather the club stayed at White Hart Lane, or moved to a nearby site (the Northumberland Development Project), rather than upping sticks to Stratford. &quot;I must once again repeat the concerns we have about the viability and deliverability of the Northumberland Development Project,&quot; he whelped. &quot;No progress has been made with the remaining land owners and this is a potentially costly issue.&quot; Promising to do away with the running track, he continued: &quot;Our proposals for the Olympic Stadium site include an iconic 60,000-seater stadium, the construction of which is fully financially guaranteed. It would rank amongst the finest in the world and deliver one of the best fan experiences anywhere in Europe.&quot; Exactly what sort of fan experience this would promise in the long run for supporters of athletics, say, or Leyton Orient, one stop down on the tube, was not explained. But Levy needs to cut costs, so fair&apos;s fair. But there is some hope for Spurs fans who would quite like to stay put, and Orient fans who don&apos;t want their patch queered.

BITS AND BOBS Having flirted with attractive football for a while, Tony Pulis has reverted to type and signed the lumbering striker&apos;s lumbering striker, John Carew, on loan until the end of the season. Lord Ferg says Antonio Valencia could return to action as early as next month, following his horrific injury earlier this season. &quot;I think possibly towards the end of February he should be back in the first-team squad which is a big boost to us,&quot; purpled Ferg. Wembley&apos;s hosting of this season&apos;s Big Cup final means the League One and Two play-offs will be hosted at Old Trafford. Ryan Giggs, 89, is open to the idea of being a target for lazy gags about his age for another season: &quot;I am quite happy still playing at the moment and enjoying my football as much as ever,&quot; he said. &quot;We will sit down and talk but I am really looking forward to playing next year.&quot; STILL WANT MORE?

An already fractious process intensified as the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, appealed to fans to back the move while West Ham&apos;s co-owner David Gold insisted the 2012 legacy promises should be about &quot;more than money&quot;. Newly released pictures show how the stadium would have looked under the original plans inherited by the Olympic Park Legacy Company, which pushed for the process to be reopened when Baroness Ford became its chair in May 2009. At the time, the then Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, had effectively closed off the debate, after the Olympic Delivery Authority failed to find a suitable tenant. Realising a vibrant legacy for the stadium would be key to its regeneration masterplan, Ford resolved to return to the market. The 25,000-capacity roofless option, which would involve taking down the external structure and removing 55,000 seats, is still a potential fallback if neither Tottenham&apos;s nor West Ham&apos;s bid is acceptable. However, a new tenant would still have to be found. It is understood that West Ham have substantially improved the financial terms of their bid this week in an effort to deal with fears that Spurs, who have partnered with the O2 operator AEG, would offer a better return to the OPLC. But West Ham&apos;s captain, Scott Parker, appeared to score an own goal when he said that &quot;in an ideal world&quot; he would rather not play in a stadium with a track around it. &quot;Every footballer wants to play in the best stadium. I can only comment on what I&apos;m seeing here and it&apos;s a fantastic stadium with good facilities that would move the club forward,&quot; Parker said of the joint bid with Newham council, Essex County Cricket Club, the promoter Live Nation and the shopping mall giant Westfield. &quot;[But] if I was being brutally honest, I&apos;d rather not\u00a0play in a stadium with a track around\u00a0it.&quot; The pictures go some way to backing the Tottenham case that they are reusing 80% of the investment left behind under the original legacy plans. Their stadium adviser today also hit back at claims that rebuilding the stadium and removing the track would be a waste of \u00a3496m of public money and an environmental disaster. &quot;The temporary structure which we estimate to be about 20% of the total cost will be dismantled and will be reused, partly within our proposed new stadium and partly at Crystal Palace,&quot; Paul Mitchell, a director of the consultancy Arcadis UK, said. &quot;This is a sustainable solution in which every single temporary facility will be reused or recycled.&quot; But as more athletes joined the chorus of protest against the Spurs proposal to rebuild the Olympic Stadium and refurbish Crystal Palace to provide an athletics legacy, Gold said only the West Ham bid honoured the commitments made in 2005 to win the Games. &quot;It&apos;s a magnificent stadium,&quot; Gold said. &quot;A commitment was made in Singapore in the name of the nation and we have to respect that. We believe we can bring together football, athletics and many other sports. I&apos;m an east London boy, it&apos;s where I started. I was born here in abject poverty. This isn&apos;t just about business, this is about me and who I am. My roots are here. This is more than money.&quot; He added: &quot;The atmosphere at stadiums is what you thrive on the most. Tottenham is the same and Upton Park is the same, it&apos;s tight and it sets off a good atmosphere. I&apos;m sure the people involved in trying to get the stadium will be looking to keep that atmosphere.&quot; His beleaguered manager, Avram Grant, backed the move. &quot;The stadium is in east London and West Ham is in east London,&quot; he said. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t build a stadium in Fulham because the area belongs to Fulham. The stadium needs to belong to West Ham.&quot; Harry Redknapp, the Tottenham manager, acknowledged that a proportion of Spurs fans would oppose the move if the club are granted preferred bidder status by the OPLC next Friday. &quot;The supporters have a right to an opinion,&quot; Redknapp said. &quot;They are the most important people. Without them we wouldn&apos;t be here. &quot;But somehow or other Tottenham need a new stadium because the capacity is about 36,000 now and you can&apos;t get a ticket here for love nor money.&quot; In an open letter to fans, Levy repeated concerns about the &quot;viability and deliverability&quot; of an alternative \u00a3450m plan to redevelop White Hart Lane, arguing that delays have forced the club to make the Olympic Stadium their No1 priority.

Both clubs will be forced to recalibrate their lobbying strategies after the Olympic Park Legacy Company decided it needed more time to make the decision on naming a preferred bidder. &quot;We are asking for further clarification from both bids. We need the process to be robust,&quot; said an OPLC spokeswoman. A new date for the board meeting is yet to be set, but it is understood that the delay could be of up to a fortnight. The OPLC has always made clear that it would postpone the decision if it felt more time was required. &quot;Given the detailed nature of both bids received, we need more time to seek further clarification with both bidders in order to identify a preferred bidder,&quot; said the OPLC. &quot;The stadium is a significant public asset and we have a duty to run a robust process.&quot; Margaret Ford, the OPLC chair, and the chief executive, Andrew Altman, may also have been hoping the delay would take the heat out of what has become an increasingly charged debate. Given the likelihood of a challenge from the losing bidder, the decision will also have to be subject to significant legal scrutiny. The OPLC will work with the preferred bidder with the aim of signing the lease by the end of March, subject to approval from the government and the London mayor, Boris Johnson. Lord Coe and others involved in the bid to bring the Games to London have argued that it has a moral obligation to select the joint bid from West Ham and Newham Council, which proposes a multi-sport future and the retention of the athletics track as part of a \u00a3100m makeover, given the promises made in Singapore in 2005. But Spurs have argued that its solution, to rebuild the Olympic Stadium as a dedicated football ground and provide a legacy for athletics at Crystal Palace as part of a \u00a3250m investment, is the only commercially viable option. Spurs have partnered with the O2 operator AEG to devise an events programme that they say will form the bedrock of the regeneration of the Park, while West Ham and Newham are partnering the rival promoter Live Nation and the shopping mall developer Westfield. The tender document did not insist on the athletics track being retained, saying only that bidders must make provision for the promised athletics legacy in the stadium or propose a viable alternative. The fallback option of a 25,000\u2011seat athletics stadium remains an option, though that would leave the OPLC back at square one in terms of securing a viable tenant. The OPLC board is being advised by a sub-committee which includes the former Arsenal managing director Keith Edelman, the former Oftel director David Edmonds and Philip Lewis, chief executive of the property division of Kirsh Group. Five stated criteria are being used to assess the rival bids: \u2022 To achieve a viable long-term solution for the Olympic Stadium that is deliverable and provides value for money \u2022 To secure a partner with the capability to deliver and operate a legacy solution for a venue of the stadium&apos;s size and complexity \u2022 To re-open the stadium for operational use as rapidly as possible following the 2012 Games \u2022 To ensure that the stadium remains a distinctive physical symbol supporting the economic, physical and social regeneration of the surrounding area \u2022 To allow flexible usage of the stadium, accommodating a vibrant programme of events allowing year\u2011round access for schools, the local community, the wider public and elite sport."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/singapore-you-drop-sustainability-business", "sentences": ["Singapore is very far from normal, something that Lee Kuan Yew, the city-state&apos;s prime minister from 1959 to 1990, is at pains to point out in his new book, Hard Truths.", "Surrounded by countries that do not wish it well, and in competition with rising neighbours in Asia, Singapore&apos;s future is far from guaranteed.", "As a result Singapore plans to be self-sufficient in water by 2061, when their agreement to draw water from Malaysia ends.", "He asked why they weren&apos;t as dusty and diseased as in Singapore?", "Dismissed as &quot;Disneyland with the death penalty&quot; and as &quot;an antiseptic island peopled by a passive citizenry and governed by paranoia&quot;, Singapore demonstrates the power of triple bottom line strategy at the country level: economic competitiveness, social inclusion (up to a point) and a cleaner environment for all.", "Although Lee is pessimistic about the likelihood of nation states getting a grip on the climate disaster he sees threatening the region, he is determined that Singapore adapts to climate change and develops new industrial clusters in areas like clean technology.", "Their tiny country, Lee warns the rising generations of Singaporeans, &quot;is like a chronometer."], "publicationDate": "2011-01-26T11:11:18Z", "title": "Singapore \u2013 'You drop it, you break it, its finished'", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business"], "article": "Sometimes today&apos;s abnormal holds useful clues to tomorrow&apos;s normal. Singapore is very far from normal, something that Lee Kuan Yew, the city-state&apos;s prime minister from 1959 to 1990, is at pains to point out in his new book, Hard Truths. It&apos;s one of the most gripping and personal accounts of the thrills and spills of politics that I have read. Surrounded by countries that do not wish it well, and in competition with rising neighbours in Asia, Singapore&apos;s future is far from guaranteed. One reason why the city-state is so keen on water recycling and desalination, for example, is that Malaysia has periodically threatened to cut off the critical water it supplies. As a result Singapore plans to be self-sufficient in water by 2061, when their agreement to draw water from Malaysia ends. This propensity to think long is shot through Lee&apos;s book. In one memorable section \u2013 and there are many \u2013 he recalls a visit to Boston in 1968, where he had an eco-epiphany. Like Sherlock Holmes and the dog that didn&apos;t bark, he noticed that that the trees and other vegetation in the city centre were a rich, verdant green. He asked why they weren&apos;t as dusty and diseased as in Singapore? The answer: vehicle emissions were tightly controlled \u2013 something Lee promptly put into force back home. Dismissed as &quot;Disneyland with the death penalty&quot; and as &quot;an antiseptic island peopled by a passive citizenry and governed by paranoia&quot;, Singapore demonstrates the power of triple bottom line strategy at the country level: economic competitiveness, social inclusion (up to a point) and a cleaner environment for all. It remains to be seen whether the People&apos;s Action party (PAP), that has held power for over 50 years, survives Lee&apos;s eventual death (he is still a cabinet member), but he aims to ensure his successors \u2013 perhaps seduced by consumerist lifestyles \u2013 do not forget how fragile the city-state&apos;s success is. While in the city last week, I spoke to hundreds of people in government, business and civil society, and found a growing interest in corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Although Lee is pessimistic about the likelihood of nation states getting a grip on the climate disaster he sees threatening the region, he is determined that Singapore adapts to climate change and develops new industrial clusters in areas like clean technology. Their tiny country, Lee warns the rising generations of Singaporeans, &quot;is like a chronometer. You drop it, you break it, it&apos;s finished. Some countries, you get a second chance, you buy spare parts, you put it back again. I&apos;m not sure we&apos;ll ever get a second chance.&quot;  And I&apos;m not sure, if he&apos;s right about climate change, whether by 2061 a huge number of Asians won&apos;t find themselves more than inconvenienced in a Humpty Dumpty future. Our best hope: to win over cities, city-states and countries to the &quot;one planet&quot; way, before we lose our grip.

It used to be that, through the prism of the French New Wave, you were either a Godard person or a Truffaut person. Godard being the spiky, radical revolutionary and Truffaut the relaxed, warm-hearted classicist. With hindsight, the divide seems far narrower, not least because both made utterly personal films and loved cinema deeply. But you get the impression Truffaut was the happier of the two. His films were often freewheeling, heartfelt and empathic, with a judicious mix of comedy and tragedy.

Zak Brown is still in his race suit, which does not really fit with the lavish interior of this penthouse on wheels, but his main focus is outside the\u00a0cockpit. This weekend Brown is a competitor in the Rolex 24 Hours, the traditional curtain-raiser of the international motor racing season. For just about every other day of the year he is doing deals that shape motor racing worldwide. So successful is he, and so well connected, he might be the man to step into Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s shoes when the master of Formula One eventually departs. Brown, who is still 10 months away from his 40th birthday, was born in Los Angeles and harboured dreams, rare for an American, of being a Formula One driver. He travelled to England and trained at Donington Park under the tutelage of Richard Dean, who became a firm friend and is now a business partner. A penniless Brown spent many nights sleeping on Dean&apos;s sister&apos;s floor in Sheffield as he tried to work his way up the racing ladder. Like so many who shoot for grand prix stardom he came up short. His struggles to launch and fund his driving career alerted him, however, to the fact that he is one hell of a businessman. &quot;I didn&apos;t go to college,&quot; Brown says. &quot;I&apos;m not sure I could even spell it. The business came out of a necessity to make a living because I wasn&apos;t making a good living as a driver. The business came about as a need to eat. &quot;I was told to stop driving \u2013 and it hurts your ego at that point \u2013 and focus on sponsorship. It was in 1998 when I realised it was not that I wasn&apos;t good at finding sponsors, but I wasn&apos;t good at finding sponsors for Zak Brown, because Zak Brown wasn&apos;t going to take LG or UPS where they need to go. They needed a superstar driver. Once I came to grips with that and started working on sponsorships for other people a light went off and said &apos;Stop, look at how much business is taking off now.&apos; So I stopped in 2000. Business took off so I was pretty quick to figure out this is where I need to channel 110% of my effort.&quot; That channelling of effort \u2013 and it is seemingly limitless \u2014 into his company Just Marketing International has made Brown not just a very rich man, but a key figure in Formula One. Last week Brown flew to London for 24 hours and, although he is coy about his business, is believed to have had dinner with Ecclestone, who talks very highly of him. Members of his 140-strong staff talk of how they never have to wait longer than 20 minutes for a reply to an email, wherever Brown is in the world. &quot;I don&apos;t sleep well,&quot; says Brown, &quot;maybe three, four hours a night. I have to clear all my emails before I go to bed and I get 250 a day. But if I roll over and see the red light flashing on my phone I have to see what it is and answer it. It drives my wife crazy when I&apos;m home, which is not a lot.&quot; Is it a bit of an OCD thing? &quot;It&apos;s a big OCD thing,&quot; he laughs. &quot;I&apos;ve got problems.&quot; The deals done after those fitful nights have taken LG, UPS and countless other global corporations where they want to go in motor sport. The electronics giant LG is now an official partner of Formula One and their logos adorn Sebastian Vettel&apos;s and Mark Webber&apos;s Red Bulls. JMI&apos;s client list is blue chip and extensive. If you want to get your company into Formula One, Brown is the man who can make it happen, with a solution tailored for every need. There are parallels with another racing driver who came up just short behind the wheel but still had a massive influence on motor sport. Back in 1958 Ecclestone failed to qualify for the only grand prix he entered and from then on he concentrated on driver management before running a team and then effectively running the sport. Does Brown see the similarity? &quot;The people who were really successful in motor sports were from the inside,&quot; Brown says. &quot;You&apos;ve got to have a bit of racer instinct in you to survive. Very few people have come from the corporate world, once they have matured in business, and been successful. It&apos;s usually someone with a passion for the sport, who started at the grassroots level either as a driver or a mechanic and came up through the ranks. I definitely feel that I&apos;m a racer from that standpoint.&quot; Ecclestone is an admirer of Brown and last year attended the launch of his United Autosports team, an outfit that races a pair of Audi R8s in the British and European GT championships \u2013 not the levels of motor sport that the man who runs Formula One&apos;s commercial rights normally troubles himself with. &quot;We&apos;ve done a lot of business with Bernie,&quot; says Brown cheerily. &quot;You&apos;ll see us in Singapore, China, Daytona. Sponsorship is the world we live in and we do more of it than anyone else. Yeah, it&apos;s a great honour to have someone like Bernie come to our team launch, support our team. I think it says something about the relationship that we have.&quot; Ecclestone was happy to offer a rare endorsement: &quot;I know first-hand the determination and drive Zak Brown delivers to the commercial side of Formula One. Since he brings that same focus and intensity to bear in any enterprise, I&apos;m confident his leadership and marketing skills will be of great advantage to his United Autosports team.&quot; That team goes from strength to strength, racing around the world to increase the brand, often with marquee names behind the wheel. Martin Brundle and Mark Blundell are on the driving strength of Brown&apos;s Riley-Ford that, he hopes, will finish well up the leader board when the Daytona race finishes this evening. What next for Zak Brown? &quot;Brands want big sponsorships and that is what pays big bills when you have 130-140 employees,&quot; he says. &quot;You can&apos;t feed them off doing $100,000 transactions. We are just going to keep doing what we&apos;re doing and just do more of it. Our success is dependent on the sport&apos;s success.&quot; The &quot;sport&quot; to many is simply Formula One and with Ecclestone \u2013 the commercial rights holder and most powerful man in F1 \u2013 now into his ninth decade, there are those in the grand prix paddock wondering what the future holds. &quot;I think it will be impossible to replace Bernie,&quot; says Brown. &quot;You&apos;d certainly have to approach it with a bit of a team. You&apos;d need a chief executive, but Bernie&apos;s got such a unique skill set that I look around the world and I don&apos;t know if you could pop in and be Bernie overnight. I think that is a concern for the sport because he is 80 so he&apos;s not going to go on forever. He&apos;s still got a bit of a run in him. I don&apos;t think he&apos;s going to retire, he&apos;s going to go until the lights go off, so he could have another 10 years in him.&quot; The upward curve enjoyed by Brown&apos;s business means that he has afforded himself the luxury of racing again on an occasional basis, albeit all around the world and for a team he owns himself. Driving, he says, is the only thing that stops him thinking about his business. But does he see himself, somewhere further up that curve, becoming the most influential man in motor racing? &quot;That&apos;s flattering,&quot; he laughs. &quot;Certainly this is my life. I feel that I&apos;m well-rounded, having driven, owned a team, done sponsorship, done business with all these people that have run the sport. &quot;I would certainly like to be in Formula One, in some capacity, forever. There&apos;s a lot I don&apos;t know. I&apos;ve not done television contracts but those things can be learned, or there are other people that have the expertise. I ask for a lot of advice. I have an advisory board of seven individuals with the former president of AT&amp;T and the former CMO of DuPont, so I think one of my strengths has been recognising what I don&apos;t know and trying to surround myself with people that do know. &quot;Every president has his cabinet so I know my limitations and I trip over them every once in a while. I&apos;m not going to charge forward on something I don&apos;t have experience in without trying to gather a bunch of experience or getting people around me. I want to be in the sport forever, so if I were ever to get the call to participate in the future of Formula One in some way shape or form, I&apos;d jump all over that.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/jan/30/5", "sentences": ["Hooded pitta, Pitta sordida, photographed in the island nation of Singapore.", "Image: Marie Louise Ng, 26 January 2011 [velociraptorize].Nikon D3S, 500/F4   Question: If I told you that the males and females of this Singapore mystery bird species look almost identical to each other, what could tell me about their breeding behaviours?"], "publicationDate": "2011-01-30T20:25:59Z", "title": "Mystery bird: hooded pitta, Pitta sordida", "tags": ["Science"], "article": "Hooded pitta, Pitta sordida, photographed in the island nation of Singapore.

There usually is. And we know that there are many desperately poor people in Egypt. This Wikipedia page uses two rankings to show that the average per capita income in the country is just $6,367 (IMF numbers) or $6,200 (CIA World Fact Book).  The United States is around $47,000 in both, while the UK is around $35,00 in both. Qatar, Luxemborg, Norway and Singapore lead the way. So it&apos;s dirt poor. But lo and behold, but some other measures things aren&apos;t as bad as they could be. From Think Progress:  According to the CIA World Fact Book, the U.S. is ranked as the 42nd most unequal country in the world, with a Gini Coefficient of 45. In contrast: \u2013 Tunisia is ranked the 62nd most unequal country, with a Gini Coefficient of 40. \u2013 Yemen is ranked 76th most unequal, with a Gini Coefficient of 37.7. \u2013 And Egypt is ranked as the 90th most unequal country, with a Gini Coefficient of around 34.4. The Gini coefficient is used to measure inequality: the lower a country&apos;s score, the more equal it is. Obviously, there are many things about the U.S. economy that make it far preferable to that in Egypt, including lower poverty rates, higher incomes, significantly better infrastructure, and a much higher standard of living overall. But income inequality in the U.S. is the worst it has been since the 1920\u2032s, which is a real problem.  Here&apos;s the chart. The UK by the way ranks 92nd, so slightly less unequal than Egypt. No I would not rather live there. It&apos;s just a dramatic way to highlight the terrible thing that has happened in the US. Our society is more unequal than at any time since 1920. It is not desirable or sustainable. And it makes America an awfully poor model for the developing world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/01/chelsea-fernando-torres-transfer", "sentences": ["&quot;The true reason for those touting the legacy myth is to save face over the wholly unrealistic promises made in Singapore by the Olympic bid team,&quot; said ABAC&apos;s coaching officer, John Bicourt \u2013 a double Olympian."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-01T00:05:00Z", "title": "Chelsea's \u00a350m deal for Fernando Torres worries Uefa | Digger", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Fernando Torres", "Uefa", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport", "Business"], "article": "Roman Abramovich&apos;s preparedness to spend \u00a350m on Fernando Torres has come as a surprise and as a blow to Uefa. The Chelsea owner has been viewed by Uefa mandarins as a key proponent of its financial fair play regulations, which will seek to limit clubs&apos; losses to \u20ac45m (\u00a338.7m) over a three-year period that began this season. Chelsea&apos;s chairman, Bruce Buck, has even gone as far as to speak in favour of\u00a0extending Uefa&apos;s rules to a salary cap,\u00a0yet how the Premier League champions would intend to square the Torres business with the current regulatory environment is unknown. One Uefa insider described the willingness to bid \u00a350m for a single player as &quot;a worrying sign&quot;. Chelsea yesterday released a set of highlights of their 2010 accounts, showing losses had risen from \u00a347.4m in 2009 to \u00a370.9m in the 2009-10 season. This is problematic for Uefa, since Chelsea are not the only club whose finances are in need of repair and there has been a trend across Europe for big-money transfers this January. With Manchester City having spent \u00a327m last month they would seem to be on course to eclipse Chelsea&apos;s \u00a3141m record losses for a Premier League club. If that comes to pass, it would almost certainly put them in default of Uefa&apos;s rules. Michel Platini will be resolute. He warned three weeks ago that such clubs face being banned from Europe. &quot;It will be time for them to face the music if there is a club that doesn&apos;t fall in line,&quot; said Uefa&apos;s president. Transfer tap turned off February is seldom a month to bring many people much cheer but this year for Championship clubs on the breadline, it will be tougher than ever. That is the view of Geoff Mesher, a forensic accountant whose Transfer Tracker has been watching the diminishing trickle-down from the Premier League to the rest of the football pyramid with a wince. By 6pm yesterday less than \u00a312m of top-flight cash had reportedly filtered down to the three other divisions. &quot;Lower\u2011league clubs have always budgeted for transfer revenues,&quot; Grant Thornton&apos;s Mesher told Digger, and these have now dried up. Also: &quot;There is a squeeze on sponsorship revenues, concessions and merchandising. All these things together will make for a difficult time for the majority of clubs.&quot; Leeds in loan dilemma Leeds United do not own Elland Road. A firm called Barnaway bought the freehold for \u00a38m during the club&apos;s financial meltdown in 2004. Although this later passed to a British Virgin Islands shell company, Teak Commercial, the Leeds chairman, Ken Bates, has always been emphatic that Leeds do not own their ground. The reason Digger mentions all this is that Leeds are approaching Leeds City Council for loans to redevelop Elland Road. That seems like it would be a bit of a risky investment. Land Registry records show that Teak Commercial still holds the title to the ground, so no one else \u2013 apart from Barnaway&apos;s sole shareholder, Jacob Adler \u2013 knows who owns Elland Road. And according to the most recent accounts for Leeds United Holdings, the\u00a0club&apos;s parent, there are only \u00a32.5m of\u00a0fixed assets in the club. So if the council wanted to secure its loans against club property it might find it difficult to get proper cover. Digger asked Leeds United&apos;s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, for his view yesterday but he did not call back. Coe&apos;s grounds for concern The Association of British Athletics Clubs, a splinter group, has a reputation for plain speaking. Whereas UK Athletics, the sport&apos;s official governing body, has swung behind West Ham United&apos;s bid for the 2012 Olympic Stadium, ABAC believes that decision to be flawed. &quot;The true reason for those touting the legacy myth is to save face over the wholly unrealistic promises made in Singapore by the Olympic bid team,&quot; said ABAC&apos;s coaching officer, John Bicourt \u2013 a double Olympian. UKA responded: &quot;The entire current GB team have given their backing to West Ham&apos;s bid.&quot; And\u00a0as Bicourt hinted, The hopes of Lord Coe, left, ever becoming the International Association of Athletics Federation&apos;s president would also seem to depend on it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/01/tottenham-olympic-stadium-athletics", "sentences": ["&quot;The true reason for those touting the legacy myth is to save face over the wholly unrealistic promises made in Singapore by the Olympic bid team."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-01T12:03:11Z", "title": "Tottenham's Olympic Stadium plan backed by athletics group", "tags": ["Olympic Stadium", "Athletics", "Sport", "West Ham United", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Football", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The first signs of a backlash within athletics against the hitherto strong support within the sport for West Ham United winning the right to the Olympic Stadium emerged yesterday when a rival body to UK Athletics backed the Tottenham Hotspur option. The Association of British Athletics Clubs, a lobbying group that has a history of criticising the governing body UK Athletics, said the Spurs plan to remove the running track and refurbish Crystal Palace would leave a better long-term legacy for the sport. &quot;Saying that there would be a proper athletics legacy merely by keeping the track at the Olympic Stadium is a myth and a sham,&quot; said John Bicourt, a former British Olympic athlete who is an officer of the ABAC. &quot;The true reason for those touting the legacy myth is to save face over the wholly unrealistic promises made in Singapore by the Olympic bid team. West Ham, should they win the bid, would almost certainly demand the right to remove the track after a few years on the basis that the stadium is barely used for athletics enough to justify keeping it.&quot; Rob Whittingham, a statistician who has tracked the numbers of active elite athletes in the UK for several years, argued that a 60,000 stadium was &quot;not relevant&quot; for athletics because the sport would never fill it. Bicourt said the ABAC viewed Spurs&apos; bid as a &quot;realistic alternative&quot; in that it would see the home of British athletics at Crystal Palace rebuilt as a 25,000-seat arena with the possibility of increasing the seats to 40,000 if needed. UK Athletics is understood to view the ABAC as a contrarian, unrepresentative body but critics of UK Athletics believe it has nailed its colours too firmly to the West Ham mast without considering both options. &quot;As the official internationally recognised governing body for athletics, UKA wholeheartedly supports an Olympic legacy for athletics in the Olympic Stadium as part of a vibrant multi-use facility,&quot; said a UK Athletics spokeswoman. &quot;Such is the strength of feeling about this issue, some of the biggest names in the sport have spoken out in support of retaining a track. These include Usain Bolt, Paula Radcliffe, Steve Cram, Brendan Foster, Michael Johnson and Dame Kelly Holmes. Additionally the entire current GB team, led by captain Jessica Ennis, have given their backing to West Ham&apos;s bid.&quot; The UK Athletics chairman, Ed Warner, has been outspoken in his backing for the West Ham bid.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the recovery was &quot;beset by tensions and strains which could even sow the seeds of the next crisis&quot;. Speaking in Singapore he argued that allowing emerging markets to grab the lion&apos;s share of global growth at a time when developed nations are weighed down by debts would create unsustainable imbalances. He also said growing inequalities in both developed and developing nations could trigger social unrest and undermine future growth. The hard-hitting speech follows hard on the heels of uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and the threat of further strikes in Greece and Spain.. Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister, said: &quot;Without jobs and income security, there can be no rebound in domestic demand \u2013 and ultimately, no sustainable recovery.&quot; IMF officials are visiting Greece this week to broker a deal with the country&apos;s left-leaning government after figures showed it was struggling to make cuts in line with an IMF and EU bailout. The IMF has come under strong criticism for forcing debtor nations in need of bailout funds to sack thousands of public sector workers and impose stiff austerity measures, including higher taxes. But in a pointed message to countries like Britain, Strauss-Kahn said it was up to individual states to limit their budget deficits, but without widening income inequalities or putting up barriers to growth. &quot;In the advanced economies, the key is to promote growth and job creation. While structural reforms are essential to make these economies more competitive, these reforms are only likely to pay off over time. So what can be done to improve the short term? The most urgent task is to repair and reform the financial sector, to reduce risk and pave the way for healthy credit growth,&quot; he said. A report yesterday by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research found that more than 90% of the 200,000 jobs created in Britain over the last two years were part-time. The report said employers were reluctant to commit themselves to full-time staff while the economic outlook remained uncertain. Strauss-Kahn said: &quot;Looking more closely, we see a worrying development: the pre-crisis pattern of global imbalances is re-emerging. Growth in economies with large external deficits, like the US, is still being driven by domestic demand. And growth in economies with large external surpluses, like China and Germany, is still being powered by exports. As the IMF warned in the years leading up to the crisis \u2013 and as the G20 has emphasised \u2013 these global imbalances put the sustainability of the recovery at risk. &quot;The &apos;global growth gap&apos; is also straining the recovery in other ways. Energy prices are rising swiftly, reflecting rapid growth in the emerging economies. Food prices are rising too \u2013 though here supply shocks are the main reason \u2013 with potentially devastating consequences for low-income countries. Together, these price increases are beginning to feed into headline inflation. Large and volatile capital flows to emerging economies is another challenging development. They are complicating macroeconomic management and in some cases raising concerns about financial stability.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/01/welsh-choir-only-men-aloud", "sentences": ["&quot;We youngsters can finally stand up and say that singing is still alive in our traditions, and that we are not all tarred with the same brush as the rest of British youth.&quot; This year promises a packed concert programme for Only Boys Aloud, and the old boys at Dunvant are also ramping up their ambitions \u2013 they&apos;ll be leaving the school canteen behind, and packing their blazers and ties for a summer tour in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-01T21:30:00Z", "title": "Welsh male voice choirs: a vocal minority", "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "article": "A school canteen after-hours, the shutters closed\u00a0and the chairs stacked, makes for a peculiar music venue. But this is home to the oldest amateur male-voice choir in Wales, which I&apos;m watching rehearse on\u00a0a quiet Monday evening in the village of Dunvant, near Swansea. The\u00a0room is a sea of white hair and pink scalps, and bellies booming out tenor and bass notes. The sound made by the Dunvant Male Choir is a cornerstone of Welsh musical culture; it&apos;s the soundtrack to everything from the chapel to the rugby field to the rowdy pub singalong. It&apos;s also something I particularly cherish, both as a local girl who has long flown the nest \u2013 and as the elder sister of the choir&apos;s 28-year-old conductor, Jonathan Rogers, who is one of the young men taking this centuries-old musical tradition into the\u00a0future. In 2011, the Welsh male-voice choir is entering a new, challenging age. On\u00a0the one hand, choral singing \u2013 and all-male choral singing, in particular \u2013 has never been more high-profile. Its most prominent flag-wavers are Only Men Aloud, the Cardiff-based winners of the 2008 BBC choral talent show Last Choir Standing. They bagged a multimillion-pound deal with Universal Records, recently sold out the 7,500-capacity Cardiff International Arena, and performed on Strictly Come Dancing on Christmas Day. But membership of the more traditional Welsh male-voice choirs is falling. Last year, Welsh philanthropic organisation the Hywel Williams Foundation commissioned a study to look at why this might be; among the factors under scrunity are the increasing ages of choristers, and the scarcity of available funding. It&apos;s an issue that Only Men Aloud have also been addressing. Last April, their founder, Tim Rhys-Evans, set up 10 youth choirs in the Welsh valleys, encouraging young boys to follow the traditions of their fathers and grandfathers. A few months later, all 220 members of these new choirs \u2013 who all operate, naturally, under the name Only Boys Aloud \u2013 performed at Wales&apos;s national arts festival, the National Eisteddfod. Their set, which followed traditional pit songs and hymns with a showstopping a capella Welsh-language version of Journey&apos;s Don&apos;t Stop Believin&apos;, brought the house down. Get a job, join a choir But if these shiny new versions of the traditional male-voice choirs are proving so popular, then why are people battling to preserve the old choral customs? Back in Dunvant, once a thriving mining village and now a sleepy suburb of housing estates, the choir members have much to say about the history of C\u00f4r Meibion (as the male-voice choir tradition is known in Welsh) \u2013 and, with most of them over 60 (unlike Only Men Aloud, who are all in their 20s and 30s), they have the benefit of long-term experience. Dunvant Male Choir was formed in 1895 in the town&apos;s Ebenezer Congregational Chapel, by a group of miners, steelworkers and quarrymen. Many of the current members were taken along by their male relatives, including Dewi Morgan, 64, a former tinplate works engineer, who has been in the choir for 35 years. &quot;Choirs were part of quiet village life when I was a boy,&quot; he says. &quot;You went to school, you left school, got a job, joined a choir.&quot; Times have changed hugely, however. Morgan&apos;s own sons aren&apos;t interested in joining him in the choir, in part because it requires a significant time commitment: rehearsals are twice-weekly. &quot;The modern malaise of the male-voice choir is that there are too many other things to do,&quot; Morgan explains, plainly but perfectly. The rising age of the singers remains a concern, too. In Dunvant&apos;s annual magazine, recently deceased singers are noted under the membership lists, and given lavish tributes. The choir have, nevertheless, maintained their core membership of 80, and their choristers are determined to move with the times. Only Men Aloud&apos;s Tim Rhys-Evans was himself Dunvant&apos;s conductor over a decade ago; he incorporated more modern songs, like You Raise Me Up, popularised by Daniel O&apos;Donnell, into their hymn-heavy repertoire. &quot;It was a hurdle at first,&quot; says widower Bill Davies. At 82, he&apos;s one of the choir&apos;s oldest members \u2013 but he&apos;s still spry as a whippet, and known playfully by his choirmates as the Gower&apos;s most eligible bachelor (on his last birthday, Davies stood on a chair in the rugby club and gave an impromptu solo rendition of Elvis&apos;s Can&apos;t Help Falling in Love With You). &quot;But soon we got into it,&quot; Davies adds of the choir&apos;s new material, &quot;and now we enjoy it.&quot; The change of repertoire, he says, made the choristers realise that the singing should not be all about nostalgia. &quot;It&apos;s the camaraderie you get from a choir that&apos;s important. That&apos;s something that younger lads need as much as us older ones. Singing makes you happy, after all.&quot; His eyes twinkle. &quot;How else do you think I&apos;ve lived to this age?&quot; The evident joy that male-voice choir members take in their singing has always moved me. It also moved Robert Plant in 2007, who happened to sit in on a Dunvant recording session, as his friend was the sound engineer. Many of the older members didn&apos;t know who Plant was, but he was so entranced by Dunvant&apos;s version of Welsh hymn Myfanwy, that he played it as the crowd left the Led Zeppelin reunion gig that December. C\u00f4r Meibion emerged in Wales in the 19th century, fuelled by the industrial revolution that was bringing Welsh men together in large numbers, and the nonconformist Christianity dominating Welsh churches. Another 19th-century invention, rugby union, also boosted the connection between singing and national identity \u2013 and while religion may have declined in the country, sport has not. The performances of unofficial crowd anthems at international matches \u2013 such as Sosban Fach (Little Saucepan), a folk song from west Wales, and the popular hymn Cwm Rhondda \u2013 have become expressions of national pride. In the 1950s, Welsh captain Cliff Morgan said that the singing at matches put a yard on every stride, and 20 yards on every kick. For years, Tim Rhys-Evans has been fascinated by the dichotomy between Welsh men&apos;s gruff machismo and their love of song. He comes from New Tredegar in the Rhymney Valley, 50 miles away from Dunvant. Before going to Cardiff&apos;s Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama, he learned to sing through local chapel and youth choirs. He then returned to the male-voice tradition in his spare time after he became the director of Welsh National Youth Opera. &quot;It shocked me,&quot; he says, &quot;that for every seven girls that sang, only one boy would sing. It made me think there&apos;s something really going wrong here, in a country where our most famous choral heritage has been a masculine one. I realised it&apos;s all do with the fact that it&apos;s not cool to sing, or you must be effeminate if you&apos;re interested in singing.&quot; To address this, he set up the Only Boys Aloud network of choirs in the valley communities he came from, many of which remain depressed by the decline of heavy industry in the 1980s. It was important for Rhys-Evans that rehearsals were held in sports clubs rather than chapels or schools, and that the boys would be singing with people the same age as them, both to feel less intimidated by older men \u2013 &quot;and,&quot; he laughs, &quot;less uncool&quot;. Rehearsals in Manics T-shirts The fact that Welsh identity is no longer stigmatised has also helped swell numbers. Since the 1993 Welsh\u00a0Language Act revived the mother tongue, and the Welsh Assembly was created in 2000, many\u00a0bands and TV personalities have made a virtue of their Welshness \u2013 including groups such as Manic Street Preachers and Lostprophets, whose T-shirts many of the boys wear to choir\u00a0rehearsals. Most of those who sang in front of 9,000 people at the Eisteddfod had never sung in public before. The opportunity has, according to 18-year-old chorister Emyr Jones, changed their lives. He joined the Aberdare branch in April, and fought through the snow in December to perform alongside Only Men Aloud at their homecoming Christmas concert \u2013 not in a lowly chapel, but at the Cardiff International Arena. &quot;To have said that one day I would sing there, I would have laughed out loud,&quot; Jones says. He also thinks that their singing carries a political dimension. &quot;We youngsters can finally stand up and say that singing is still alive in our traditions, and that we are not all tarred with the same brush as the rest of British youth.&quot; This year promises a packed concert programme for Only Boys Aloud, and the old boys at Dunvant are also ramping up their ambitions \u2013 they&apos;ll be leaving the school canteen behind, and packing their blazers and ties for a summer tour in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. As they do, I will be listening to them sing again on my hi-fi, for the millionth time, their voices reminding me that there&apos;s no place like\u00a0home. \u2022 Dunvant Male Choir perform\u00a0at Tabernacle Chapel, Swansea on 5\u00a0February and the Majestic Choir festival, Torquay on 19 February.

About the Daily Mystery Bird:  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in 24 different time zones, and some people are following on their iPhones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours.2. If you know the bird&apos;s identity, provide subtle hints to let others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful as small clues to less experienced players. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones.4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too).2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all.4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

Littlewood&apos;s sentence is the longest term handed down in the UK for insider trading since the Financial Services Authorities took over responsibility for prosecuting the offence 10 years ago. The trio admitted to eight episodes of insider dealing between 2000 and 2007, netting gross profits of \u00a3590,000 \u2013 but not until being presented with evidence gathered by the FSA in a two-and-a-half-year investigation costing \u00a3700,000. Angie Littlewood \u2013 the conduit for the inside information, passing it to her friend Helmy Sa&apos;aid to make trades \u2013 received a 12-month suspended sentence. The Littlewoods have three children between the ages of three and eight. Sa&apos;aid was jailed for two years and will be deported to Singapore to serve most of the remainder of the sentence. There had been some concern that the FSA would not be able to prosecute him after raids on two of his properties in 2009 revealed that he was no longer in Britain. However, he was later traced to the French island of Mayotte, off the coast of Madagascar, and extradited. Passing sentence this morning, Judge Leonard QC said the sentences were meant to deter others from insider dealing. &quot;Those rogue traders that let down the honest, discreet majority must be made to pay,&quot; he said. Earlier this week Christian Littlewood&apos;s counsel had told a sentencing hearing at Southwark crown court that the judge should consider a lighter sentence against the corporate financier because he claimed not to have known the extent of his wife&apos;s trading. He just &quot;lit the touch paper&quot;, Christian&apos;s counsel said, and dealings were kept from him. Outside the court, FSA officials told a different story, pointing to evidence suggesting Christian had masterminded the conspiracy. One text he sent to his wife read: &quot;Sell enough shares to get money back but leave profit in shares.&quot; At that time she did not hold any shares. Littlewood&apos;s gross salaries, including huge bonuses, ranged from \u00a3200,000 to more than \u00a3400,000 over the period he abused information. The court was told that the couple, despite only being in their 30s, had a portfolio of seven rental properties and a flat in Hampstead. Judge Leonard said he was sparing Mrs Littlewood jail as he considered it &quot;unjust&quot; to separate a mother from her children. Earlier in proceedings, prosecuting counsel told the court the FSA had evidence that Christian Littlewood had passed inside information to a previous girlfriend \u2013 whose name was not given \u2013 in 1999 for the purposes of share dealing. Sa&apos;aid was also ordered to pay \u00a3640,000 in confiscation. The FSA said today that confiscation orders in relation to Christian and Angie Littlewood would be dealt with at a later date. Investigators said episodes of insider dealing to which the three pleaded guilty represented just the most egregious and clear-cut examples of the conspirators&apos; trading. In total the FSA had identified 51 suspect trades which they believed had generated gross profits of about \u00a31m. The FSA admitted this week it had come close to catching the plotters six years ago when suspicious trades by Littlewood&apos;s wife prompted officials to send her a letter asking her to explain her share dealings. In 2005, regulators sent a letter to Siew-Yoon Lew \u2013 the Singaporean maiden name under which Angie Littlewood traded \u2013 which led her to stop using knowledge from her husband to trade shares. Instead, she passed information to Sa&apos;aid and the trading profits were split three ways. Asked why no further action was taken, FSA officials said they could not require her to explain her trading activities. &quot;We have hundreds of cases open at any one time. It is about making our presence felt.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/03/3d-racing-beyond-the-rails", "sentences": ["But shooting the sport for the new medium is far from straightforward, as was revealed by a test last autumn at Kranji racecourse in Singapore, using cameras borrowed from the latest Jet Li movie.", "He is less complimentary about the general quality of light in Singapore, but the Guardian has donned a pair of 3D glasses to get a sneak preview of the Kranji footage and it is impressive nonetheless."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-03T00:06:01Z", "title": "3D show bidding to be sport's answer to Top Gear ready to exit stalls", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Today Lowestoft, tomorrow the world.

Customers of Hughes Electrical will be the first viewers to get a look at the new venture, whose producers hope there is an untapped global audience for a show that tries to mix sporting thrills with the glamour of international travel. It will offer, they claim, the world&apos;s first 3D footage of horse racing and will bring the sport to a broader audience. But shooting the sport for the new medium is far from straightforward, as was revealed by a test last autumn at Kranji racecourse in Singapore, using cameras borrowed from the latest Jet Li movie. &quot;At the moment, the 3D rigs are huge,&quot; says Ted Bather, chairman of Rainshine, the producing company. &quot;You need two cameras, they&apos;re very bulky and we&apos;ve been testing how close we can get them to the track. They also require very good light, but horses don&apos;t like strong light, they don&apos;t like bulky things looming over them. &quot;Over the next two to three months, there will be another generation of 3D cameras coming on to the market which will be lighter, more portable, much easier to use, that will enable us to deliver the kind of content we&apos;re seeking. The quality of cameras is improving dramatically and in a couple of years it&apos;ll be much easier.&quot; But Bather has no intention of putting the project on hold to wait for better technology. He hopes to give his cameras a second outing during the Dubai carnival meeting at Meydan next week. &quot;The light is rather nice in Dubai at this time of year,&quot; he says. He is less complimentary about the general quality of light in Singapore, but the Guardian has donned a pair of 3D glasses to get a sneak preview of the Kranji footage and it is impressive nonetheless. The trackside shots of runners breaking from the stalls are dramatic and the technology shows its worth when a horse jogs past after a race, sending great flecks of foamy sweat flying out towards the viewer. &quot;I do think [racing] doesn&apos;t film well in 2D,&quot; says Bather. &quot;You lose the muscularity, the speed of movement. People who aren&apos;t into horses, when they&apos;ve seen our footage, they&apos;ve all said, &apos;wow.&apos; &quot; But Bather cannot yet offer a date when the British public will get to decide its reaction. &quot;We&apos;ve spent the last nine months testing the equipment and the format in order to be able to hit a viable price-point. We&apos;re just starting conversations with a number of broadcasters.&quot; The number of broadcasters around the world offering 3D programming, and the number of households capable of viewing same, remain limited, but Bather says he expects imminent growth in both areas and hints at a new 3D channel trying to start up in Britain before the royal wedding in April. He may make the first complete edition of Beyond The Rails at Sha Tin, Hong Kong, that month. At the latest, he hopes to begin at Kranji in May. When they finally see it, committed racing fans may feel that Bather&apos;s show is not aimed solely, or even mainly, at them. &quot;Our model is not to follow a [complete] race,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ll show an event,&quot; meaning the race-meeting as a whole, &quot;and the human-interest stories around it.&quot; He says Beyond The Rails will be &quot;very travelogue-y&quot; and will have &quot;reality elements&quot;. Publicity material describes celebrities being given a small amount of money and being challenged to get to that month&apos;s main international race-meeting by whatever means they can. Bather&apos;s target is an audience beyond the heartland. &quot;It&apos;s a funny old sport, people are either really into it or they ignore it. We&apos;re trying to show why so many rich and famous people are gripped by it.&quot; In the meantime, broadcasters are receiving his trailer, which could hardly be accused of underselling the sport. &quot;More muscular than muscle cars \u2026 or muscle egos&quot; says the throaty voiceover as shots of Formula One cars are followed by Premier League footballers. &quot;It&apos;s addictive adrenaline, debonair and dashing.

Juliane Kokott, one of the eight advocate generals of the European court of justice, gave her view on a landmark case brought by Karen Murphy, landlady of the Red, White and Blue pub in Portsmouth. Murphy uses a Greek decoder card to show live Premier League matches at much cheaper rates than BSkyB charges commercial premises in the UK. The FA Premier League, which sells TV rights exclusively to broadcasters across Europe on a territory-by-territory basis, is attempting to clamp down on British pubs buying in live coverage from foreign broadcasters. Kokott today opened the door for the potential dismantling of this country-specific sports rights regime, saying that in her opinion the &quot;exclusivity of the rights in question have the effect of partitioning the internal market into quite separate national markets, something which constitutes a serious impairment of freedom to provide services&quot;. While Kokott&apos;s opinion is not binding, the ECJ tends to follow the advice of advocate generals in the majority of cases. The Luxembourg-based court is expected to deliver its verdict on the Murphy case later this year. Kokott said that the &quot;economic exploitation of the [TV] rights is not is not undermined by the use of foreign decoder cards as the corresponding charges have been paid for those cards&quot;. &quot;Whilst those charges are not as high as the charges imposed in the UK there is ... no specific right to charge different prices for a work in each member state,&quot; she added. Kokott said that the idea of selling on a territorial exclusivity basis was &quot;tantamount to profiting from the elimination of the internal market&quot;. She dismissed the copyright argument put forward by the Premier League that it held exclusive rights to matches broadcast to the public. &quot;There are no comprehensive rights which protect the communication of a broadcast to the public where no entrance fee is charged,&quot; she said. The Premier League said that it believes Kokott&apos;s opinion would &quot;damage the interests of broadcasters and viewers of Premier League football across the EU&quot;. A spokesman added that the advocate general&apos;s view did not appear to be compatible with the &quot;existing body of EU case law&quot;. &quot;The opinion expressed by Advocate gGeneral Kokott may reflect a particular policy view in relation to the provision of audio-visual services throughout the EU,&quot; he said. &quot;However if her opinion were to be reflected in the ECJ&apos;s judgment it would prevent rights holders across Europe from marketing their rights in a way which meets demand from broadcasters whose clear preference is to acquire, and pay for, exclusive rights within their own territory only and to use those rights to create services which satisfy the cultural preferences of their viewers within that territory.&quot; The Premier League said that if the European Commission &quot;wants to create a pan-European licensing model for sports, film and music then it must go through the proper consultative and legislative processes to change the law rather than attempting to force through legislative changes via the courts&quot;. &quot;The ECJ is there to enforce the law, not change it,&quot; the spokesman said. The Premier League will make more than \u00a31.6bn in the UK alone from its current three-year deal with BSkyB and has a separate deal in this country for live match coverage with ESPN. The Premier League is believed to have made well in excess of \u00a31bn in TV deals outside the UK for rights covering 2010 to 2013, almost double the \u00a3625m made under the previous deal period, with the popularity of the top English division booming in territories including the Middle East, North Africa, Hong Kong and Singapore. No figures are given for Europe, however it is understood that France, Scandinavia and Germany are the most lucrative markets for Premier League rights. Investment bank Jefferies said that the Premier League may have to look to offer a sweetener, such as the international broadcasting rights, for a nominal amount to BSkyB to keep the value of the deal up. Jefferies claims BSkyB makes about \u00a3200m a year in revenue from selling subscriptions to pubs and other commercial premises in the UK. However, Jefferies only sees about \u00a360m to \u00a370m &quot;at risk&quot; if landlords were eventually able to buy cheaper Premier League coverage from overseas. &quot;Not all subscriptions are primarily driven by English Premier League [matches], but it remains a significant attraction for some of Sky&apos;s 44,000 pubs, clubs and office subscribers,&quot; the investment bank said. Becket McGrath, a partner in EU and competition at law firm Edwards Angell Palmer &amp; Dodge, said: &quot;If followed by the full court, this opinion has serious implications for the Premier League and Sky. &quot;In the short term, Sky will face more defections from subscribers to foreign sources of Premier League football. In the longer term, the Premier League is likely to receive less money when it next auctions off its TV rights, as no bidder will be prepared to offer as much for UK rights. It may ultimately be forced to abandon territorial licensing all together.&quot; One observer pointed out that while the specifics of the case deal with sports rights, the outcome of the ECJ judgement has ramifications for any audiovisual industry that sells packaged rights in Europe including the film, TV and music sectors.

Fry, the show&apos;s host, was due to arrive in Japan earlier this week to film Planet Word, which will explore the link between language and manga, mobile phones and other media, and explain how young Japanese are transforming their mother tongue. The author and TV presenter, who is currently filming in Singapore, sparked controversy after describing Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who survived the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as &quot;the unluckiest man in the world&quot; in an episode of QI broadcast in December. Roland Kelts, an authority on Japanese pop culture who was to accompany Fry in Tokyo, said he had been told that filming would not go ahead &quot;due to ongoing threats against Stephen Fry, even after official apologies were offered and the [Japanese and British] embassies became involved&quot;. Kelts, author of Japanamerica: How Japanese Pop Culture Has Invaded the US, added: &quot;The producers had to scramble for an alternative, presumably Asian, location.&quot; The British embassy in Tokyo said it was not aware of any threats directed at Fry or his production company Sprout Pictures. As the controversy unfolded last month, Fry wrote on Twitter: &quot;I&apos;m coming to Japan the week after next as it happens, and I&apos;ll certainly let my regret known [sic](if they let me in!)&quot;. A spokeswoman in the Tokyo office of BBC Worldwide, which promotes the corporation&apos;s content for the overseas market, said she was not in a position to discuss the controversy. Sprout Pictures in London did not respond to requests for comment. The Guardian understands, however, that executives at BBC Worldwide in Tokyo had voiced doubts about the merits of filming in Japan so soon after the QI furore. Kelts said he was disappointed that Japan would not feature in the five-part series, which, according to the BBC, will span locations including Hong Kong, Sydney, Israel, Kenya, Tanzania and Malaysia. &quot;Naturally, it&apos;s not worth risking injury or worse to shoot a TV documentary on language and culture,&quot; Kelts said. &quot;But I do think it&apos;s a shame that the project was scuttled over what to me seems a fairly minor and innocuous misunderstanding.&quot; Yamaguchi, who died of cancer last year aged 93, was on business in Hiroshima when it was destroyed by an atomic bomb on 6 August 1945. An estimated 80,000 people were killed instantly, and another 60,000 died in the months that followed. After spending a night in Hiroshima, Yamaguchi was able to travel by train back to his home town, Nagasaki. That city was bombed on 9 August as Yamaguchi was explaining his earlier brush with death to his boss. Fry said: &quot;Well, this man is either the unluckiest or the luckiest, it depends which way you look at it.&quot; He voiced amazement that Yamaguchi had been able to use public transport so soon after the attack, prompting panellists to poke fun at Britain&apos;s train services, including a joke about &quot;the wrong kind of bomb [on the tracks]&quot;. Alan Davies wondered if the bomb had fallen on Yamaguchi&apos;s head, adding: &quot;He never got the train again, I tell you.&quot; Fellow panellist Rob Brydon quipped: &quot;Is the glass half empty, is it half full? Either way it&apos;s radioactive. So don&apos;t drink it.&quot; The exchange prompted a complaint from the Japanese embassy in London, which accused QI of making light of the bombings. Yamaguchi&apos;s eldest daughter said Britain, as a nuclear power, had no right to &quot;look down&quot; on her father. The BBC and production company Talkback Thames apologised, saying: &quot;We are sorry for any offence caused. QI never sets out to cause offence with any of the people or subjects it covers. &quot;However, on this occasion, given the sensitivity of the subject matter for Japanese viewers, we understand why they did not feel it appropriate for inclusion in the programme.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/03/liam-plunkett-england-cricket", "sentences": ["I was 10 hours in a hotel there and then on to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-03T22:30:03Z", "title": "Liam Plunkett endures 16,000-mile odyssey for England but may not play", "tags": ["England in Australia 2011", "England cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "A quick look at Liam Plunkett&apos;s recent movements would be enough to have Phileas Fogg reaching for the travel sickness pills. Plunkett, the latest recruit to prop up England&apos;s crocked cricketers in Australia, left the Caribbean on Sunday. Four flights and 16,000 miles later, he arrived in the early hours of Wednesday. The bowler is not even guaranteed a starting place in England&apos;s seventh and final one-day international against Australia on Sunday, which is a dead rubber as the tourists have already lost the series \u2013 calling into question whether the England and Wales Cricket Board should even have sent for a replacement. He then faces the prospect of repeating the trek in reverse. Plunkett&apos;s odyssey started when he left the England Lions tour of the West Indies to fly to Perth, where he was joined by the other England players today. &quot;I left St Kitts at about 4pm which got me to Miami at around 7pm,&quot; he said. &quot;Then I was pretty much straight on a plane to Heathrow. I was 10 hours in a hotel there and then on to Singapore. I was on the ground there for half an hour and straight on the plane here. I took some sleeping tablets and slept really well. &quot;I just slept on the planes when I felt tired rather than paying attention to the time. I got in around midnight the night before last and slept until 8am. Then last night I had 12 hours sleep. I feel refreshed now.&quot; At least, this is what we thought he said because this Marco Polo in flannels was yawning again. &quot;I watched some films twice. There was one with Denzel Washington about a train. Unstoppable? And I watched Avatar again. It wasn&apos;t 3D on the plane. And there were a couple more.&quot; Plunkett, 25, got the call when Ajmal Shahzad (hamstring) and Chris Tremlett (side) pulled out of the protracted ODI series. Shahzad and Tremlett have returned to England and today it was revealed they would be joined by Paul Collingwood, who has been ruled out of the final game with a back spasm. He becomes the fifth England player to limp home early. Two other key bowlers, Graeme Swann (back) and Tim Bresnan (calf), have been in England and although Stuart Broad (abdominal) arrived here recently it was not with the intention of taking part in the ODIs but as a training exercise. Plunkett has bowled only two overs for England in the past three and a half years, in an ODI against Bangladesh in Chittagong in March last year. The tall fast bowler, who is also a more than useful tail-ender, made his Test debut in Lahore in November 2005 and played his first ODI there the following month. But his last Test appearance was in 2007. He toured here with the Ashes squad four years ago but was one of that miserable winter&apos;s forgotten players. He did make an impression in the one-day series, however, taking 12 wickets. After that he lost his form and some components of his action. &quot;Apparently so, that&apos;s what people say. But I was still young at the time and I had a dip in form. You change your action so many times to try to get comfortable but I am still young and still learning. Glenn McGrath says he was still learning at 31 and 32 so if you don&apos;t try to keep on learning you will go backwards.&quot; Naturally, given his marathon, Plunkett wants to play on Sunday and could be the replacement for his stricken Durham team-mate Collingwood. &quot;I&apos;ve been in the squad a few times and not played so hopefully I&apos;ll get a chance now.

Child protection was working with me and my husband but, because of his drug addiction and my alcohol addiction, we were getting worse. I was so miserable. I was just giving up on life. I did not have the energy or the will to try and sort myself out.&quot;  These were the words of a young mother, EP, describing her frame of mind contemplating her exit from an abusive relationship last week. Defending legal aid, especially in these straitened times, is a hard sell. Attempts to rouse public and political sympathy too often sound like a charity appeal for lawyers and fall on deaf ears. However, MPs were given a series of powerful, sometime uncomfortable, reminders as to the importance of publicly funded legal advice this week. A series of ordinary people gave testimony before a distinguished panel of non-lawyers in the Commons committee room 10 as part of an extraordinary event called the Commission of Inquiry into the case for legal aid. The former Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris, the canon of Westminster Abbey, the Reverend Professor Nicholas Sagovsky and Diana Holland, assistant general secretary of the trade union Unite were weighing up evidence as provided by the likes of EP, and organisations such as Liberty, the Child Poverty Action Group and Bail for Immigration Detainees. The session was organised by the Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers together with the Young Legal Aid Lawyers group and chaired by Michael Mansfield QC. EP, visibly nervous, sat alongside other &quot;witnesses&quot;. On one side sat a young Bangladeshi woman who won her legal fight to re-house her and her 12-year-old sister when their mother became ill with cancer and, on the other, a London pensioner who successfully prevented her landlord from kicking her and her husband out of their home of 50 years. The case went all the way to the court of appeal but tragically her husband died of a heart attack before the ruling. &quot;I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t the sole cause but I have no doubt that the stress was part of it,&apos;&apos; she said. Back to EP. Hers was one of three testimonies that dealt with relationship breakdown. Ministers want to scrap legal aid for private law family cases except where there is domestic violence or a forced marriage. Her former husband was a City banker who enjoyed &quot;quite a party lifestyle&apos;&apos; complete with a cocaine habit by the time they married in 2002. &quot;He was older, very domineering and controlling,&apos;&apos; said EP, acknowledging that she was &quot;naive&apos;&apos;. The troubled family moved out of London to try to help him back on track but the relationship became physically abusive. EP became withdrawn and spent &quot;almost all&apos;&apos; of her time with their baby daughter. She began to drink heavily and ended up with her own addiction problem. The marriage began to collapse, both became violent and the police were called out. Social services became involved and eventually proceedings were started to take their daughter into care. At this point the woman approached solicitors. &quot;I realised if I was ever going to properly repair my life I needed to get out of my marriage.&quot; Did she have the financial resources with which she could have paid for legal advice? asked Sagovsky. No, EP replied. &quot;My husband had control of our finances.&apos;&apos; Despite the fact that ministers say legal aid will be available in divorce cases where there is domestic violence, on closer reading it doesn&apos;t follow that people like EP would get help from a lawyer. You need to read the Ministry of Justice&apos;s green paper (in particular, paragraph 4.67). Legal aid will only be available for divorce proceedings where there is &quot;clear objective evidence&quot; of domestic violence and then only physical violence. It seems public funding will only be available where the Legal Services Commission is already funding domestic violence proceedings; where there is a non-molestation or other protective order; or where the other half has been convicted of a criminal offence concerning violence or abuse towards their family. EP wouldn&apos;t have qualified. So how was EP? &quot;My life&apos;s so much better. I am a functioning parent,&apos;&apos; she said. The divorce proceedings took three years to sort out and at the beginning of that period she became pregnant with their second child. But a dark episode in the family&apos;s life appears to have closed. The decree absolute arrived last October. EP hasn&apos;t had a drink for three years and her husband has sorted out his cocaine addiction and now lives in Singapore. The couple have &quot;an amicable relationship for the sake of the children&quot;. She describes herself as &quot;indebted to my solicitor&quot;. &quot;She was unbelievably supportive, more than just a professional relationship. She helped me see that I was never going to improve my life unless I got out of my abusive marriage.&apos;&apos; Diana Holland of Unite asked EP what advice she would give to other women in her position. She replied: &quot;Reach out.

The corporate financier knew immediately why police were stationed outside and exactly what their visit meant. His secret life as an insider trader \u2013 which dated back at least eight years \u2013 was about to come to a swift halt, unless decisive action could be taken. Wearing only a pair of boxer shorts, Littlewood bolted through the back door as police officers trailed behind, anxious to stop their suspect from destroying crucial evidence, as well as escaping. It proved a futile dash. The half-naked banker was tackled by his pursuers, who soon discovered where he was heading: his garden shed was found to contain a floppy disc which recorded much of the crime in extraordinary detail. That disc provided the Financial Services Authority&apos;s &quot;Operation Duke&quot; with important evidence in a case that resulted in Littlewood, his wife Angie and her friend, juice-bar owner Helmy Sa&apos;aid, pleading guilty last week to an insider dealing conspiracy that netted profits of at least \u00a3590,000. Littlewood was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. Angie&apos;s 12-month sentence is suspended for two years and Sa&apos;aid was jailed for two years. Investigators say the crimes were merely the most egregious and clear-cut examples of the conspirators&apos; trading. In total they identified 51 suspect trades which were believed to have generated gross profits of about \u00a31m. The whole tale is expected to lead to calls for tougher sentencing for insider dealers and has been dubbed the biggest case of its type yet prosecuted in Britain. The trio&apos;s downfall can be traced back to trades placed seven months before the raids, in the two weeks before a small publicly listed motor insurance company called Highway was acquired by larger rival Liverpool Victoria for \u00a3153m in August 2008. That deal was no surprise to the Littlewoods or Sa&apos;aid, who had bought 684,701 shares in the insurer worth \u00a3338,000. A fortnight later those trades had netted the team a \u00a3160,000 profit. Risk That raised the FSA&apos;s suspicions. It was soon discovered that Sa&apos;aid had enjoyed an extraordinary run of successful investments, trading at or just before 22 merger or acquisition announcements between 2000 and 2008. Of those, 15 were linked to investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort, though Dresdner had not been involved with Highway. A link soon emerged, however. Sa&apos;aid first bought Highway shares on 13 August, the same day that Littlewood had been classified as an &quot;insider&quot; on the transaction by his then employer Shore Capital. Littlewood, it was soon discovered, had previously worked for Dresdner, yet phone and banking records failed to establish a connection between the two men. What did exist were large cash transfers between a Siew-Yoon Lew and Littlewood and Sa&apos;aid. Lew, it transpired, was Angie Littlewood&apos;s Singaporean maiden name. The method of the scam was now clear, but why risk it? Littlewood&apos;s gross salaries, including huge bonuses, ranged from \u00a3200,000 to more than \u00a3400,000 over the period he abused his position and the court was told the couple did not lead a &quot;champagne lifestyle&quot;. That rather dull image is consistent with the portrait painted by ex-colleagues. &quot;He was never a joyous character,&quot; says one. &quot;He was never the charming mover and shaker ... he was the one chained to his desk doing the work. He never stood out and you would never have guessed [what he was up to].&quot; What did stand out was the private property empire the unremarkable couple had assembled. Despite the Littlewoods only being in their 30s, it is estimated they owned assets worth \u00a33m. They had no mortgage on their flat in Rosslyn Court, Hampstead, which Land Registry records show they bought for \u00a3669,000 just before Christmas 2004. Nor was there any debt on seven rental properties located nearby. &quot;They traded on around 50 lines of stock associated with Littlewood&apos;s employers,&quot; recalls one source close to the investigation. &quot;But they were rolling over the money rather than taking much profit.&quot; In fact, about \u00a3400,000 of profit remains in the trio&apos;s share trading accounts. So if the deals were not about making fast money and living lavishly, what was the motivation? In his recent blogpost on the drivers of insider trading, US psychologist and Wall Street commentator Dr Doug Hirschhorn writes: &quot;Commonly, the outside observer assumes that because trading involves money that it has to be about greed. Well, I don&apos;t believe it is. I believe it is about winning. About finding an advantage and beating your competitors. The money is just a way of keeping score.&quot; The Littlewood&apos;s computer contained a mountain of electronic data for the FSA to study. The investigation unearthed 1,700 gigabytes of information \u2013 equivalent to a skyscraper-size pile of A4 paper \u2013 which perhaps means it is not surprising when aspects of insider trading cases are overlooked. In fact, the latest statistics produced by the FSA suggest as much. In 2009, 30.6% of takeover announcements generated so-called abnormal pre-announcement price movements (though these statistics include people making good guesses and price rises after press speculation, as well as insider deals). Even within successful investigations such as the Littlewood case, important details get missed. Three years before the Highway transaction, the FSA had suspicions about Angie Littlewood. A letter was sent to Siew-Yoon Lew \u2013 the name under which she then traded \u2013 that led her to stop using knowledge from her husband to buy shares. Instead, she passed information to Sa&apos;aid and the trio split the profits. Angie Littlewood did not respond to the FSA&apos;s 2005 request for explanations and the regulator, which sends out many such letters, did not pursue her. Legacy The judge said Angie had been under her husband&apos;s influence, was suffering from &quot;moderate depression and possible alcoholism&quot; and was a good mother to her children \u2013 aged three, five and eight \u2013 at least one of whom has a serious medical condition. These mitigating factors were taken into account when sentencing. Sa&apos;aid, who has spent almost a year in jail, will be deported to Singapore after serving his sentence. Christian Littlewood is due for release in 2014, but some suggest his case will have a longer-lasting legacy. &quot;The maximum sentence for insider dealing is seven years,&quot; says one lawyer. &quot;This is supposedly the most &apos;serious insider dealing case&apos; yet. They have nicked \u00a3600,000 and yet they get just over three years. It would not surprise me to see the start of some kind of lobbying process to get insider-dealing sentences increased.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/07/cambodia-thailand-border-clashes", "sentences": ["Singapore&apos;s foreign ministry has called on the two neighbours to negotiate for their own sake and &quot;the broader interests of Asean&quot;, the south-east Asian regional grouping."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-07T15:59:10Z", "title": "Cambodia calls for UN support to end Thai border clashes over temple", "tags": ["Cambodia", "Thailand", "World news", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Cambodia has asked for an urgent UN security council meeting after Thai and Cambodian troops clashed for a fourth consecutive day over a disputed border area at an 11th-century temple. Several hours of shelling and machine-gun fire subsided on Monday morning as both sides blamed each other for hostilities which have killed at least five people since Friday. A Cambodian government spokesman, Phay Siphan, said fighting broke out again after halting around midnight. There was no immediate comment from the Thai authorities, but an Associated Press reporter in the area said the sound of gunfire and artillery could be heard. The Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, said the latest clash was sparked when Thai soldiers crossed the border in search of a dead comrade and Cambodians opened fire. Hun Sen, who has warned that the fighting poses a threat to regional stability, said: &quot;We need the United Nations to send forces here and create a buffer zone to guarantee that there is no more fighting.&quot; Hun Sen has sent a letter to the UN security council calling for an emergency meeting. Thailand&apos;s foreign ministry sent its own letter to the security council to formally protest against the &quot;repeated and unprovoked armed attacks by Cambodian troops&quot;. In the past, Thailand has ruled out foreign involvement in its long-running dispute. A statement from the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, on Sunday said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the fighting and urged both sides &quot;to exercise maximum restraint&quot;.

Cambodian officials say a Thai artillery barrage on Sunday caused the partial collapse of the Preah Vihear temple, a UN world heritage site, but Thai officials have dismissed that account as propaganda. The international court of justice in 1962 awarded the temple to Cambodia, which uses a century-old French map as the basis for its territorial claims, but the ruling failed to determine ownership of the scrub next to it. Built between the ninth and 11th centuries, Preah Vihear is dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva and revered partly for having one of the most stunning locations of all the temples constructed during the Khmer empire, the most famous of which is Angkor Wat.

Something about the decapod form seems especially well suited to survival, and crabs have evolved independently and \u200brepeatedly for millions of years.  T\u200bhe 4,500-odd species of crab are superbly adapted for a multitude of habitats. They live in tropical and sub-tropical lands and in every sea in the world\u200b except the Antarctic, though even that could soon change. They range from the oyster crab, smaller than a pea, to the Japanese spider crab whose leg span can reach almost four metres. Some of the most lumpen ones are coconut crabs, named for their ability to crack coconuts with their pincers and which live on coastal lands from Kenya to the south Pacific, climbing trees and stealing pans from kitchens. Crabs feature in the cooking of every territory they occupy, scuttling their way into woks and casseroles from here to Micronesia. The crab we know best in this country is Cancer pagarus, with the pedestrian pseudonym of &quot;edible crab&quot;. They&apos;re useful because, like the delicious Dungeness crab of the Pacific northwest, you can eat the meat from both their claws and bodies. The word crab in fact descends from those claws, coming ultimately from the Indo-European root &quot;gerbh&quot;, meaning to scratch or carve. (A useful tip if ever a crab pinches your finger is to tickle its belly. This supposedly makes it release its grip but you&apos;ll forgive me for not having tested it myself.)  If a crab loses its claws it will die slowly of starvation, but if it loses one then, remarkably, it&apos;ll grow another. That&apos;s because all crabs \u2013 indeed all crustaceans \u2013 moult their exoskeletons as they grow, forming new and stretchier &quot;cuticles&quot; under the old ones and squeezing their way out. There&apos;s a video of a giant spider crab moulting here, a deeply unsettling spectacle. A newly moulted crab fills itself with water and then slowly replaces that water with muscle. This has an important result in the kitchen: up to 50% of the weight of a recently moulted crab will be water, while an actively growing animal has much denser, sweeter flesh.  Recently-moulted crabs are the stock-in-trade of the soft-shell industry: the best are the blue crabs from the eastern seaboard of the US and Canada, and you also get delicious ones from the Venetian lagoon. Preparing a soft-shell crab for the table is a rather brutal process, and in any case you&apos;re unlikely to get them fresh in this country. Cleaned soft-shells freeze well, and that&apos;s the only practical if pricey way of getting hold of them in this country. They&apos;re delicious deep-fried in a simple batter but I like the look of Atul Kochhar&apos;s recipe using mustard oil and serving them with a sweet chilli chutney. Female crabs tend to have more meat than males and the pregnant ones or &quot;berried hens&quot; supposedly have the best flavour of all, but the Marine Conservation Society says that pregnant females should never be caught. There is currently a dearth of information on European crab stocks and we can&apos;t say whether they&apos;re being overfished: &quot;it will be several years before enough data is gathered to gain a good understanding of the trends in landings&quot;, in the MCS&apos;s words. But one advantage is that, unlike fish, crabs are always caught live, so immature ones can be thrown back into the sea \u200buntil they&apos;re big enough for the pot. One of my favourite recipes is crab with linguine, quick and easy as anything, and the European version of the chilli crab dishes ubiquitous in Singapore. According to Niki Segnit&apos;s magisterial Flavour Thesaurus, apple, avocado and citrus are some of crab&apos;s favourite companions, but I&apos;m sure you have your own preferences.

Either way, it is definitely radioactive \u2026 don&apos;t drink it.&quot; The same joke about an Auschwitz survivor and Zyklon B would never have passed. The BBC apologised, but the furore in Japan has intensified. Nuclear victims groups, the mayor of Nagasaki and Japan&apos;s foreign minister, as well as users of Japanese social media, have expressed their anger. As the BBC is Britain&apos;s state television, it has damaged Britain&apos;s image in Japan. But few seem to care: the rare British comments on the internet range from mildly sympathetic to &quot;they got what they deserved&quot;. That jokes about nuclear victims touch a raw nerve in Japan should not have been a surprise. Many victims are still alive, and there are people still suffering from the effects of the nuclear bombs. Yamaguchi was in bandages for 12 years. His wife was exposed to radioactive &quot;black rain&quot; and both children suffered health problems. Yamaguchi kept silent for years (amid the unknowns of radiation, victims have suffered discrimination). After his son died prematurely from cancer, he decided to tell his story. His daughter, Toshiko, said about the BBC: &quot;To laugh about this \u2026 is not something you do as a human being. I cannot tolerate it. They don&apos;t understand.&quot; There are issues surrounding Japanese public memories of the war. But suffice it to say that the way Japanese deal with it is more complex than is usually portrayed. Japan is the only nation that has suffered from nuclear attack; nuclear victim organisations and many other Japanese people feel that their country has a unique perspective on nuclear issues and an obligation to share the memories \u2013 especially with countries that possess a nuclear arsenal. For many, opposition to nuclear weapons has played a large role in Japan&apos;s postwar identity as a pacifist nation. The apathy around the BBC incident in Britain is a sign that for many people, Hiroshima and the Asia-Pacific war is something that does not concern them. Britain seems more and more to revel in a romantic memory of the &quot;good war&quot; and especially the blitz. Just look at the finale of The King&apos;s Speech: all together, standing firm against tyranny. Apparently it is still necessary to remind people that the reality was messier. Britain was not just standing up to the tyranny of the Nazis. In the same war, Britain was fighting Japan in Malaya, Burma and India trying to defend a colonial empire that was fundamentally racist and undemocratic. The Japanese, in their quest to become an equal partner to the western great powers, had since the 1890s acquired their own colonial empire in Taiwan, Korea, Micronesia and Manchuria. When war came, the Japanese hailed their military offensives in 1941 against the western powers in Malaya, Singapore, Burma, the Philippines and Indonesia as the &quot;liberation from western colonialism&quot;. The brutal occupations that followed can hardly be called that. At best, this was a war of one colonial empire against another. But it remains an uncomfortable truth that the Japanese caused the end of the British (and Dutch and French) empire in Asia. Of course, Britain did not drop the bomb, but it did play a key role in the evolution of the practice of bombing civilians, which ultimately led to the atomic bombings. Ironically, it was Britain under Winston Churchill that developed terror bombing, in Iraq in the 1920s. The harsh reality of the blitz also provided new lessons for the bombing campaigns against Germany and later Japan. In developing bombing strategy with the US, the RAF was the big advocate for carpet bombing of civilian targets. The strategic bombing campaign in Japan wiped out most major cities and more than sixty smaller cities. The M69 incendiary cluster bombs were especially designed to break through the roofs and release burning oil jelly inside Japanese wooden houses; Napalm delivered in your living room. On top of this came the nuclear attacks. A traumatised Yamaguchi remembered crossing a river packed with &quot;charcoaled bodies, floating one next to the other like log rafts.&quot; General Curtis LeMay famously said that &quot;if we&apos;d lost the war, we&apos;d all have been prosecuted as war criminals&quot;. American historian Mark Selden has called the allied bombing campaign a &quot;forgotten holocaust&quot;. This was not the &quot;good war.&quot; And tasteless jokes about A-bomb victims thrive on misplaced nostalgia and historical amnesia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2011/feb/09/ask-tom-travel-advice-egypt", "sentences": ["We are visiting Singapore, Bali, Thailand and Kuala Lumpur so far.", "Big players include Air Asia (whose hubs are Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, near Singapore, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Bangkok and Jakarta), Jetstar Asia and Tiger Airways (both with hubs in Singapore)."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-09T05:27:00Z", "title": "Ask Tom - your travel dilemmas answered", "tags": ["Egypt holidays", "Venice holidays", "Cruises", "Florida holidays", "Caribbean holidays", "Budget travel", "Thailand holidays", "Travel"], "article": "I&apos;ve read that Jet2 has cancelled flights to Red Sea resorts from 1 March.

The airline says: &quot;While the Red Sea resorts are not currently affected, the safety and comfort of our customers is our number one priority, and as such we do not want them to face the stressful uncertainty of whether their holiday will go ahead as planned.&quot; This is consistent with Jet2&apos;s decision to cancel departures to Tunisia, another currently unpredictable destination, through this summer.

As the statement from Jet2 notes, Red Sea resorts continue to be unaffected by events in Cairo and other major cities.

My mum turns 60 in April and has always dreamed of going to Venice. So, for her birthday, my dad has arranged for both of them, plus my brother and me to go to Venice for four days. We fly on Monday 4 April and return on Thursday 7 April. We&apos;ll definitely do the big sites like St Mark&apos;s, but can you suggest less well-known sights? My mum is into art, music and literature but I&apos;m sure she would love to see anything that is interesting or reflects Italian culture. Also, I know it can be hard to find a good but reasonably priced restaurant. Ideally we would like to go for a special celebratory meal on one night and eat at more everyday trattorias for the rest of the trip.Eliza Lebowski With four days you can cover the principle historic and artistic sights, but I would suggest taking it slowly. Intersperse diving into St Mark&apos;s Square and Basilica, the Accademia and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection with simply strolling around, especially in the Dorsoduoro and Cannaregio districts. In the latter the Ca&apos; d&apos;Oro, a 15th-century house full of great art, and the strikingly different Jewish ghetto are wonderful, must-see sights. After two days you may be flagging. If so, hop on a local vaporetto (ferry) out to the islands of Murano and Buranofor another perspective on Venice. On another day you might consider investing in the Chorus Pass, which allows entry to 16 churches around Venice, many packed with great and little-seen art treasures. To avoid disappointment when eating in Venice, venture far and wide. Anywhere with a multi-language menu or on the more obvious routes through the city is likely to be underwhelming. Some of the city&apos;s best food is served in the form of cicheti (small, tapas-like plates) in traditional osterie (pub-restaurants) and bacari (bars) down alleys and on obscure squares. There are some of these around the San Marco, San Polo and Cannaregio sestieri (districts) \u2013 finding them can be half the fun. Guardian journalist Gavin McOwan explored some of these last year. While seeking out these spots will take you off the tourist trail like almost nothing else in Venice, the special meal you&apos;re after can be found too. There&apos;s a lot of choice in the top-end category. The Corte Sconta, in the Castello district, is one of the best-regarded high-concept places. Or try the classic Fiaschetteria Toscana in Cannaregio. Book for around 8.30pm to give you time for a glass of prosecco beforehand.

Cruises stated as departing from Orlando in fact leave from Port Canaveral \u2013 on Florida&apos;s east coast, close to the famous Cape and 52 miles from the City Beautiful. Most cruise lines put Port Canaveral in brackets, like an airport claiming proximity to a big city putting its true location in as an afterthought like Frankfurt-Hahn and Venice Treviso. As well as &quot;Orlando&quot;, these cruises usually call at Nassau (Bahamas), St Thomas and St Maarten in the eastern Caribbean and as San Juan (Puerto Rico). According to the always useful Weather to Travel (Tomorrow&apos;s Guides, \u00a38.99), June is the wettest month of the year in Nassau. There is on average twice as much rain as in May and around 50% more than July. The weather tends to be hot and humid, and though you can expect it to rain most days, this should be concentrated into afternoon downpours, which tend to be brief and heavy. If you&apos;re on a cruise you may find that rain isn&apos;t too much of a problem as there&apos;ll be plenty to do below decks, but showers could have an impact on how much you enjoy your time ashore. I&apos;m planning a three-week trip around south-east Asia in August. We are visiting Singapore, Bali, Thailand and Kuala Lumpur so far. Do you have any tips for low-cost travel between these locations? Also, can you recommend a place in Thailand with a bit of nightlife and a beach but not the raucous shores of Koh Samui or Ko Phangan?Barrioprincess As I noted in the live blog last week, there&apos;s a mind-boggling array of low-cost carriers operating in south-east Asia. Big players include Air Asia (whose hubs are Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, near Singapore, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Bangkok and Jakarta), Jetstar Asia and Tiger Airways (both with hubs in Singapore). In Thailand try Thai Airlines&apos; low-cost subsidiary, Nok Air, and Bangkok Airways. Any experiences readers have of flying with these airlines are welcome in the comments section. Of course, there are also inexpensive bus and train links between many destinations. Requests for alternative Thailand come up a lot; I&apos;ve recently recommended Ko Lanta, Ko Tao and Ko Chang. Any other suggestions?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/09/visitbritain-tourism-agency-cut-jobs", "sentences": ["Offices will close in Argentina, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Hong Kong (leaving Beijing and Shanghai offices in China), Hungary, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa and Thailand."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-09T12:55:58Z", "title": "VisitBritain tourism agency to cut jobs", "tags": ["UK news", "Travel", "London"], "article": "VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, is to cut up to 30% of its staff and close its offices in 13 countries just as it prepares for an expected rise in overseas visitors generated by the royal wedding in April and the Queen&apos;s diamond jubilee and the London Olympics and Paralympics next year.

The \u00a312bn group, whose products span fighter plane engines to nuclear technology, was at the centre of a massive aviation safety scare last year when an Airbus superjumbo carrying 466 passengers and crew was hit by an explosion in one of its four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines shortly after taking off from Singapore&apos;s Changi Airport. No one was killed in the incident, which was caused by a manufacturing fault that triggered an oil leak, but it caused considerable disruption to Airbus and A380 customers using Trent 900 products \u2013 including Germany&apos;s Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. One expert warned that, like oil company BP in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon spill, Rolls-Royce faced a backlash in the US because it is a well-known British global brand and challenges American competitors such as General Electric. However, Rolls-Royce appears to have headed off serious repercussions such as a mass-grounding of Trent-powered planes after rapidly overhauling the A380 engines. Modestly acknowledging the furore that erupted following the A380 incident this morning, Rolls-Royce said: &quot;This regrettable incident attracted widespread attention.&quot; The group added that it was the victim of a one-off engine blowout that occurs infrequently in modern aviation, after the oil leak triggered a fire that caused a turbine disc to shatter and explode through the A380&apos;s wing. &quot;Uncontained disc failures happen with a frequency of about once a year on the world&apos;s large civil aircraft fleet. However this was the first time an event of this nature had occurred on a large civil Rolls-Royce engine since 1994.&quot; Since that incident two decades ago, Rolls-Royce Trent and RB211 engines have accumulated 142m flying hours without serious incidents. Announcing full-year results this morning, Rolls-Royce said costs related to the Trent 900 failure, including &quot;un-contracted settlements&quot; and &quot;incremental service and support costs&quot;, came to \u00a356m. It added that a &quot;modest level&quot; of additional costs might be incurred this year. However, the group said engine orders at its civil aerospace division remained strong and totalled \u00a37.5bn in 2010 \u2013 including a \u00a31bn order from Air China placed soon after the Qantas scare. Reflecting a growing trend among industrial companies, Rolls-Royce said service revenues, generated by contracts to maintain and overhaul products as well as build them, had risen by 15% since 2009. Shares in Rolls-Royce, which lost \u00a31bn in value in the immediate aftermath of the Trent 900 explosion, were unchanged this morning at 654.5p \u2013 giving the business a market capitalisation of \u00a312.2bn. Elsewhere in the full-year results, Rolls-Royce said underlying revenues rose by 7% to \u00a310.9bn, with underlying pre-tax profits rising by 4% to \u00a3955m. The final dividend was 16p per share. Sir John Rose, presenting his last full-year results statement before retiring, said the group&apos;s three main pillars \u2013 civil, defence and marine \u2013 were all firing strongly. &quot;Rolls-Royce has delivered a strong performance in 2010 with record underlying revenues and profits. This reflects our global customer base and the balanced portfolio of products and services that we offer. It is a measure of progress that the civil, defence and marine businesses now each generate underlying profits of more than \u00a3300m.&quot; Rose hands over to John Rishton, chief executive of Dutch retailer Royal Ahold, at the end of March. &quot;It has been an extraordinary privilege to work with so many outstanding people and to contribute to the development of a business that has been at the forefront of engineering and technology for over 100 years,&quot; said Rose."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2011/feb/10/britains-growing-pirate-problem", "sentences": ["Meanwhile, we&apos;re stuck with its self-regarding ways and threat to move the investment side of its businesses elsewhere to Geneva or, more likely, to Singapore or Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-10T11:57:00Z", "title": "Britain's pirate problem | Michael White", "tags": ["Banking", "Business", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Phone hacking", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Media", "Politics", "UK news", "Press intrusion"], "article": "Taken in the round, the latest reports on bankers&apos; bonuses and tabloid phone hacking, both on the front page of Thursday&apos;s Guardian, serve to confirm that British society has a growing problem with pirates on the deck fighting their way into the wheelhouse of state. It&apos;s not just a Somali headache. Not being as attractive as Robert Louis Stevenson&apos;s ambiguous villain, Long John Silver, or Johnny Depp&apos;s Captain Jack Sparrow, these pirates, British and foreign, need to be repelled. Alas, we cannot afford to make all of them walk the plank \u2013 but feeding a few of the villains to Captain Hook&apos;s crocodile would set a good example to the others. Though very difficult, phone hacking is the easier problem to deal with. Confirmation of evidence that John Prescott was a target \u2013 despite previous brush-off assurances \u2013 suggests that the issue here is not simply the familiar one of over-mighty press lords (we&apos;ve had that for a century), but of their underlings&apos; collusion with the police. As has been obvious since the start of investigative reporter Nick Davies&apos;s heroic campaign (Channel 4&apos;s Dispatches programme this week was very ungenerous, and don&apos;t expect a press award either, Nick), Scotland Yard did not try very hard to test the News of the World&apos;s &quot;rogue reporter&quot; defence when the tabloid&apos;s royal correspondent went to jail. Its own defence is now falling apart as evidence grows that more and more public figures, wheeler-dealers and so-called celebrities have had their messages intercepted. I can&apos;t stress too often that there is sometimes a higher public interest defence for such illegal activity \u2013 we can all applaud the NoW&apos;s successful exposure of apparent betting fraud by the Pakistani cricket team. But Sienna Miller&apos;s love life is not such a case, and I for one would rather not be reminded that Prescott has reproductive organs, let alone a residual desire to give them exercise. Sorry, John, I just think it&apos;s usually a private matter. I&apos;m sure Rupert Murdoch, the man ultimately to blame for this sort of caper, would feel the same if it was his willy being hacked. More heads will roll and careers suffer for this, not least because Rupert, the seedy Captain Hook of this yarn, I think (at heart a comic pantomime villain) has belatedly realised that his bid to take 100% of the BskyB cash cow is being damaged by these excesses. But it is just as important that blameworthy coppers are also called to account if they leave the force and seek more wholesome work than becoming columnists for Murdoch outlets \u2013 a recent pattern. Those banker bonuses are proving a harder nut to crack, as George Osborne and David Cameron, guilty of mouthy boastfulness before the election, are now discovering. The financial services industry is a very important part of the British economy \u2013 too important, most of us can probably agree. But it will take time to rebalance and diversify it in other ways. Meanwhile, we&apos;re stuck with its self-regarding ways and threat to move the investment side of its businesses elsewhere to Geneva or, more likely, to Singapore or Hong Kong. London is a nicer place to live \u2013 that&apos;s why the global super-rich are buying half a dozen Mayfair flats and joining them together for the wider family \u2013 but we can&apos;t depend on it always being so. Meanwhile, it helps keep the property market from the terrifying price collapse we have seen in places \u2013 notably the US and Ireland \u2013 where there is a reckless excess of supply over demand. This is not a happy situation to be in, but it&apos;s where we are in 2011. Could it be worse? Of course. If you have 15 minutes or so, I recommend this long article in Vanity Fair by Michael Lewis, the author of the much-admired account of the Wall Street crash, The Big Short. It describes how bankers and property developers went mad in Ireland and foolish politicians failed to call time. A familiar story here, too, I expect you are thinking. Yes \u2013 and Cameron/Osborne were egging them on even worse than Gordon Brown at the time. But, for reasons I won&apos;t go into here (read the Lewis article) our situation is not so parlous. I&apos;m just back from Dublin and find that the Westminster coalition is under strain over that AV referendum, prisoners votes and the cuts programme. The Treasury&apos;s Project Merlin has extracted promises from the bankers to lend more money to cash-strapped small business in the coming year \u2013 good, if it happens sensibly \u2013 but has not yet addressed the structural problems of &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks or the bonus provocation. Hence the resignation of Vince Cable&apos;s ally, Lord Matthew Oakeshott \u2013 or do I mean sacking, as the Times (paywall) suggests \u2013 as the business secretary protests publicly that the bonus culture remains &quot;extraordinarily wrong&quot;. Oakeshott, who was a Lib Dem Treasury spokesman outside the coalition, is not a man whose appearance in a news report, usually with a lively and outraged quote, has often raised my confidence in the story at issue. I don&apos;t know why, but there is it. Be that as it may, he&apos;s right this time. He left after describing Treasury negotiators as having &quot;an awful combination of arrogance and incompetence ... most of them couldn&apos;t negotiate their way out of a paper bag&quot;. Gosh, I remember saying something similar to Prezza and chancellor Brown at a press conference to promote those PFI deals. The City sharks would remove the Treasury&apos;s trousers before lunch and come back for their shirt later in the day was the thrust of my complaint. Alas, we still need their money. What&apos;s important for Whitehall officials to grasp is that the other side is often also winging it \u2013 and often wrong. As we all now know (and some wise souls said at the time) these bankers couldn&apos;t price a risk in a paper bag either. Lewis&apos;s article describes how a clever Brit who warned that Irish banks were doomed was sacked and his report censored before being presented \u2013 for a seven-figure sum \u2013 to the Irish government, which had belatedly sought &quot;expert&quot; advice. The system was basically sound, the Taioseach, Brian Cowen, was told. Told by whom? By Merrill Lynch. Today, both Cowen and Merrill Lynch are in the dust, the latter part of the spectacular crash of September 2008, which also brought down the Irish banking system and the government, which foolishly guaranteed its losses. It&apos;s going to take time to wind down this folly, and the damaging and unwarranted bonuses for piratical City traders, too. A few more prosecutions would also help clear the air. But restless Lib Dems \u2013 90 councillors are protesting against the Eric Pickles cuts this week \u2013 should not think that resigning or protesting will save them. They&apos;re in too deep for that now. The Irish Greens resigned from the Fianna F\u00e1il coalition and triggered this month&apos;s election.

Last November, British-led efforts to build a radically designed giant offshore wind turbine with a 275m wingspan were given a shot across the bows when a group of Spanish companies announced they were starting work on an even larger and more powerful turbine. At stake is dominance of the nascent offshore wind sector as it steps up to the sort of scale that will enable it to compete with gigawatt-sized coal, gas and nuclear power stations. Most of today&apos;s large wind turbines are now more than 100m tall and generate about 3MW, meaning more than 300 or even up to a thousand such turbines are needed to match the output of a conventional power plant. By contrast, just one of the British 10MW &quot;Aerogenerator&quot; turbines being developed by designers and engineers, including Arup and Rolls Royce, could power 5,000-10,000\u00a0homes. The dramatic-looking project is also unusual in its vertical axis design \u2013 it rotates like a sycamore leaf \u2013 rather than the horizontal axis turbines that currently dot the UK coast. Feargal Brennan, head of offshore engineering at Cranfield University, where work is being carried out on the design, says: &quot;The UK has come late to the race, but with 40 years of oil and gas experience we have the chance to lead the world. The new [Aerogenerator] turbine is based on semi-submersible oil platform technology and does not have the same weight constraints as a normal wind turbine. The radical new design is half the height of an equivalent [conventional] turbine.&quot; The first Aerogenerator turbines are unlikely to be built until 2013-14. But even such grand ambitions are likely to be dwarfed by Spain&apos;s &quot;Azimut project&quot;, which hopes to build an enormous 15 MW turbine as soon as 2020. Spanish turbine-maker Gamesa is leading the \u20ac25m (\u00a321m) effort, along with 11 wind and engineering companies and 22 research centres. A Gamesa spokeswoman says: &quot;The initiative, scheduled to finalise in 2013, is designed to establish the technological groundwork for the subsequent development, in around 2020, of a large-scale offshore wind turbine. The programme&apos;s initial objectives call for developing a turbine with unit capacity of 15 MW that is capable of overcoming the technical and financial hurdles currently limiting the rollout of offshore wind energy.&quot; The company believes connections to the grid and foundations for the turbines will prove to be two of the toughest technical obstacles. Spain is already a world leader in wind, with installed wind power rising by 18.5% last year and now providing 16% of the country&apos;s electricity needs. Spain and the UK are not alone in the big wind battle. US wind turbine-maker Clipper is working on a 10 MW offshore turbine dubbed the &quot;Britannia project&quot;, with a prototype expected as early as 2012. The 72m-long blades will be made in the UK, on Tyneside, and Clipper has been awarded a \u00a34.46m government grant for offshore wind development. The world&apos;s leading turbine-maker, Danish firm Vestas, is also eyeing bigger turbines, and has told industry press that it is working on a 6 MW model. Elsewhere in Europe, Upwind, an EU-funded project that has been working since 2006 to tackle the technical challenges of building 8-10 MW-sized turbines, draws to a close this year. All the players in the race have an eye on the huge offshore wind plans being encouraged by governments around the world, from the British coast to the Yellow Sea off South Korea and the Google-backed offshore farms off the US&apos;s eastern seaboard. Who will succeed is unclear, but one things seems certain: large scale could bring colossal rewards. In search of jobs as well as energy Britain&apos;s lead on offshore wind presents a major opportunity in the global scramble for green jobs and business, experts\u00a0predict. &quot;For once in a very long time, Britain is leading in a cutting edge technological sector, both in terms of policy frameworks and expertise,&quot; says Peter Madigan, head of offshore at green energy trade body, RenewableUK. &quot;We are seeing an increasing number of foreign delegations from places as far as China, Thailand, Singapore, Japan and the United States visiting the UK to discover &apos;the secret&apos; of our success in this sector.&quot; But despite having the most installed offshore wind in the world and some of the planet&apos;s best natural resources around its coast, the UK must not get complacent, he warns. &quot;There has to be a sense that this kudos is based as much on our current success as it will draw on our ability to rollout further projects. Continual development of our offshore market will send a clear signal that the technology has a future and that we are in the best position to assist everyone\u00a0else.&quot; Madigan also points to the importance of moving the manufacture of offshore wind turbines to the UK, most of which are currently made in Europe, the US and China. The turbines are the single largest items of expenditure when a new offshore wind farm is built. Siemens recently announced plans to build Britain&apos;s first major offshore wind turbine manufacturing plant in Hull and other firms, such as Mitsubishi and GE, are also planning turbine factories in the UK. Robert Gross, the director of the centre for energy policy and technology, Imperial College London, says that while the UK catches up on turbine-making, other companies still benefit from offshore wind&apos;s rise. &quot;One of the main myths about wind power is that because British-owned companies do not produce turbines there is no role for UK industry in offshore wind. In fact UK companies are active in many parts of the supply chain, from specialist components used within turbines to towers, foundations and cables.&quot; UK expertise in design, support services and vessels is another opportunity, he says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/feb/11/5", "sentences": ["Orange-bellied flowerpecker, Dicaeum trigonostigma, also known as the orange-breasted Flowerpecker, photographed on the island nation of Singapore.", "Image: Marie Louise Ng, 26 January 2011 [velociraptorize].Nikon D3s, 500/F4   Question: This Singaporean mystery bird is so gorgeous it&apos;ll make your eyes bleed."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-11T21:21:19Z", "title": "Mystery bird: orange-bellied flowerpecker, Dicaeum trigonostigma", "tags": ["Science"], "article": "Orange-bellied flowerpecker, Dicaeum trigonostigma, also known as the orange-breasted Flowerpecker, photographed on the island nation of Singapore.

But, hey, this is wilderness in style.\u00a0 It&apos;s all very eco-friendly too \u2013 largely solar-powered, and staffed mostly by locals \u2013 so you needn&apos;t have a guilty conscience. Move it away and there&apos;d be little sign that it had ever existed.\u00a0 Leaving the fireflies to party I paddle slowly back home and feast on spicy shrimp and freshwater fish with coconut, cooked in banana leaves, before heading for a blissful night&apos;s rest, lulled to sleep by the gentle bobbing of the water. Most visitors to Cambodia flock to the revitalised capital of Phnom Penh further east, and the temples around Siem Reap in the north. This coastal region, part of the Koh Kong Conservation Corridor, is home to some of the country&apos;s most impressive natural sights. The long civil war kept developers and loggers at bay, and the potential for ecotourism is huge (although the threat of hydroelectric power plants looms).\u00a0 Four Rivers, with its gorgeous setting on a bend in the river, is magical at all times of day \u2013 misty in the morning, glowing at sunset and prettily lit up after dark \u2013 and as tranquil a place as you could wish for. I spend much of my time here kayaking through the mangrove maze (spotting those fireflies, and watching monkeys gather at the water&apos;s edge at dusk), swimming in the river from steps outside my tent (a pool is planned) and visiting waterfalls, where the pounding torrent gives a great back massage. There are excursions into the jungle, led by a former poacher, to spot wildlife and to visit villages and fruit plantations (overnight camping is a new option too). As I&apos;m here at the end of the rainy season, when leeches and mud make trekking treacherous, we take a boat downstream instead. Thick mangrove forests line the banks, and dolphins can sometimes be spied in the estuary opening on to the Gulf of Thailand. Koh Kong island appears on the horizon, an as yet undeveloped paradise with pristine beaches and untouched rainforest.     Village life on Koh Sra Lau.    We stop at Koh Sra Lau, an island with one tiny fishing village, and wander around while women sit mending nets and offer us fried fish with tamarind sauce and papaya. There&apos;s no tourist fatigue here, just friendly welcomes. A little boy grabs my hand and leads me to the village school, where children proudly sweep the classroom before the teachers appear. I&apos;m keen to explore more, so the next day head to Chi Phat village, and a community-based project started by conservation charity Wildlife Alliance in the Southern Cardamoms Protected Forest. It aims to preserve the rainforest by helping villagers earn a living from ecotourism, instead of illegal logging or hunting endangered animals, and giving tourists a unique green adventure. It&apos;s a winding bus journey down to the port town of Andoung Tuek and a two-hour boat ride along Phipot river to the village. There are several guesthouses, but I choose a homestay on the outskirts of town with Chou and her young family, who sit underneath the stilted wooden house, a cow curled at their feet like a pet dog. A far cry from the luxuries of Four Rivers it may be, but it&apos;s clean, comfortable and a great way to see everyday village life. Chi Phat is all about outdoor adventure: you can trek or cycle into jungle and mountains for days at a time, sleeping in hammocks or rustic campsites, go birdwatching, take boat trips or check out the nearby bat caves and an area dotted with mysterious ancient burial jars. I sign up for a 28km mountain bike tour to O&apos;Malu waterfall. Crossing grassy plains and traditional farmland, we follow Lucky \u2013 a 23-year-old from the village who&apos;s been trained in everything from bike maintenance to wildlife spotting \u2013 up steep paths through the tangled jungle, with gibbons calling high overhead. It&apos;s a challenging ride in parts (yep, I end up on my bum in a puddle at one point) but jumping into the cool pool at the base of the waterfall is a great reward. There&apos;s no one else around as we tuck into lunch, sitting on rocks in the sunshine, surrounded by rainforest, the waterfall roaring. Marvellous though the sights of Angkor Wat and the buzz of Phnom Penh are, I can&apos;t help thinking that it&apos;s Cambodia&apos;s more remote natural attractions that offer the best adventure \u2013 and one it would be a shame to miss.\u00a0 \u2022 Tents for two at Four Rivers Eco Lodge (ecolodges.asia) cost from $118 a night including breakfast and boat transfers.

The former world No1 was paid a reported $3m (\u00a31.9m) to play the tournament \u2013 more than seven times what the winner received. The money bought Woods&apos;s presence but it could muster up only a vague reminiscence of the player he once was as a three-over-par 75 cost him his chance of a first victory in more than a year. He began the day one shot off the lead and finished seven shots behind, in a tie for 20th \u2013 well beaten in the main event and also beaten in the much hyped, and ultimately over-hyped, meeting of the world&apos;s top three ranked players. Lee Westwood won that contest with a round that vaulted him into contention before three dropped shots on the last two holes cost him his chance. Still, Westwood was happy with his 72 and the retention of his No1 ranking. &quot;Not bad considering I came home in an ambulance,&quot; he said afterwards. What a smiling contrast the Englishman made with Woods, who left the scene surrounded by a coterie of security guards after mouthing familiar platitudes about the progress he is supposedly making as he rebuilds his swing under his new coach, Sean Foley. &quot;There were quite a few positives this week but a couple of glaring examples of what I need to work on,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s like anything. All my old feels [for the clubs] are out the window when the winds blow. That&apos;s the thing when you are making change. It&apos;s fine when the wind is not blowing. But when you have to hit a shot when the wind blows ... the new swing patterns get exposed.&quot; Woods, whose last win in a tournament came at the Australian Masters in 2009, might want to ask himself if he really believes this stuff and, while he is at it, he might also want to ask himself how much its serves the cause of his post-scandal rehabilitation to be broadcast around the world spitting on the green as he prepared to putt on the 12th green. Golf&apos;s moral guardians were out in force as the YouTube video of the incident attained &quot;viral&quot; status and for once it was hard to disagree with those who took offence. Yet if the American&apos;s contribution to the event ultimately left a bitter taste, Quir\u00f3s&apos;s victory was the ultimate expression of everything that is good about golf and the Spaniard&apos;s modern interpretation of the game. He is an unashamed bomber who gives the ball a lash, goes looking for it and then gives it another lash. It is an uncomplicated formula, delivered with a smile, which sometimes works and sometimes does not. This was one of those days when everything came good in the end, even if the journey was circuitous. Starting the day one shot behind the leaders, Rory McIlroy, Thomas Aiken and Anders Hansen, the Spaniard made his move early, eagling the short par-four 2nd. Two quick birdies cemented his lead but he followed those with a triple-bogey at the 8th, where his ball became lodged in a tree. Typically, Quir\u00f3s responded with a smile and a birdie. It was an adventuresome round and it got even more so at the par-three 11th, where his &quot;half-wedge&quot; tee shot ended up in the cup for a hole-in-one. This proved the decisive blow as he came home in 68, good enough for a one-shot victory over Denmark&apos;s Hansen and James Kingston of South Africa. &quot;I have to recognise that the 11th might be one of the more exciting moments in my career,&quot; Quir\u00f3s said. &quot;I am very proud of myself. I think I managed very well with difficult situations.&quot; The 70th-ranked Hansen, who had his best finish since coming second at last year&apos;s Singapore Open, was left to rue his missed chances. &quot;Obviously a little disappointed,&quot; he said. &quot;I gave myself a chance after leading and got myself out of it early but brought myself back in it. I thought I played nicely but Alvaro played some great golf.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/feb/15/xavi-hernandez-barcelona", "sentences": ["Symonds works ticket and Virgin are badly advised Pat Symonds, who conspired with Flavio Briatore to persuade Nelson Piquet Jr to crash his Renault so that Fernando Alonso could win the 2009 Singapore grand prix, is working behind the scenes at the Virgin team in preparation for a return in 2013, when his ban from full-time work in Formula One ends."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-15T00:20:00Z", "title": "How do you like your sour grapes, Se\u00f1or Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez? | Richard Williams", "tags": ["Barcelona", "Football", "Sport", "Champions League", "European club football", "Champions League 2010-11"], "article": "The teams were a goal apiece, with the visitors down to 10 men, when a distinctive noise came from the away end at Loftus Road on Sunday afternoon. As a forward and a defender converged on a 50-50 ball near the corner flag, the force of their collision drew a massive grunt of satisfaction from the spectators. This was English football, and it made me think back to that much discussed interview Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez of Barcelona gave in these pages last Friday, when he spoke with barely hidden contempt for anything other than the rarified approach to football nurtured in the academy at La Masia. His admiration of the English game was restricted to individuals \u2013 the likes of Paul Scholes, John Barnes and Chris Waddle \u2013 and to the atmosphere created by the fans at Premier League grounds. There was faint praise for what he saw as changes taking place: &quot;Barry, Lampard, Gerrard, Carrick ... they are players who treat the ball well. You see them and you think, Christ, they are trying to play.&quot; All too clear, however, was his opinion of the basic attributes of the game in its birthplace. &quot;You watch Liverpool and Carragher wins the ball and boots it into the stands and the fans applaud,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s a roar! They&apos;d never applaud that here.&quot; Xavi concluded the conversation with a ringing declaration. &quot;I&apos;m a romantic,&quot; he said, ignoring the fact that it is quite possible to be romantic, albeit in a slightly different footballing register, about Harry Cripps of Millwall, Stuart Boam of Middlesbrough, Terry Butcher of Ipswich Town, Tommy Smith of Liverpool, Brian Kilcline of Notts County and Coventry, or Micky Droy of Chelsea, and many other defenders who became, to the supporters of their clubs, symbols of resistance. I love watching cerebral midfield maestros and would have made Xavi the world player of the year for the past three seasons. But there was something irritating about his tone, particularly when he dismissed Internazionale&apos;s achievement in eliminating Barcelona at the semi-final stage of last year&apos;s European Cup: &quot;There is something greater than the result, more lasting. A legacy. Inter won the Champions League but no one talks about them.&quot; How do you like your sour grapes, Se\u00f1or Hern\u00e1ndez? It seems a pity that a man with so many honours to his name cannot accept that there is more than one way to play football, and that Inter beat Barcelona with two finely drilled performances which saw them win 3-1 at home and hold on for a 1-0 away defeat, despite being a man short for more than an hour of the second leg. Xavi might also do well to remember that the reduction of Inter to 10 men came about through a disgracefully exaggerated reaction from his team-mate Sergio Busquets to a challenge from Thiago Motta. When Busquets went down, clutching his face, a television camera revealed him parting his fingers to peek at the referee&apos;s reaction as Motta received the red card. People are certainly still talking about that, and also about the way Jos\u00e9 Mourinho reorganised his side to preserve victory in the tie on the way to matching the clean sweep of six trophies amassed by Xavi and his team-mates the previous year. Barca had 74% of possession in the game against Internazionale at the Camp Nou, and completed 548 passes against their opponents&apos; 67. So they had only themselves to blame for their failure. And I confess it was with just the merest glimmer of schadenfreude that on Sunday, two days after reading Xavi&apos;s claims to superiority, I watched his team struggle against Sporting Gij\u00f3n, ending their run of 16 consecutive league wins and scraping a draw only through a glorious late chip from David Villa. Of course Xavi&apos;s Barcelona represent a powerful force for good in the game as a whole. Of course we delight in their artistry. Of course we all want to see the battle of wits and skills when they meet Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday . But we also want contrasts of temperament and style, or the game is nothing. Symonds works ticket and Virgin are badly advised Pat Symonds, who conspired with Flavio Briatore to persuade Nelson Piquet Jr to crash his Renault so that Fernando Alonso could win the 2009 Singapore grand prix, is working behind the scenes at the Virgin team in preparation for a return in 2013, when his ban from full-time work in Formula One ends. &quot;Pat is retained by one of our shareholders as an adviser, and he&apos;s advising the team,&quot; Virgin&apos;s president announced last week. &quot;He&apos;s allowed to do consultancy work through his company.&quot; After three decades in the sport, Symonds is well liked in the paddock and the value of his engineering expertise, particularly to a new team struggling to establish themselves, must be considerable. But it is still staggering to see a team willing to employ a man who shares the guilt for the most heinous crime in the history of motor racing. Or did I miss something? Ski director gets the picture For once you could see the steepness of the slopes and get a real sense of what it feels like to be skiing at 65mph. So congratulations to the team behind the TV pictures from the world downhill skiing championships at the weekend, who positioned their cameras to provide the most vivid expression of events on the classic Kandahar course at Garmisch-Partenkirchen. For the director to hold the helicopter shot that tracked Christof Innerhofer down the first third of the piste needed almost as much steadiness of nerve as the Italian showed on his way to the bronze, providing a new and enlightening perspective on the velocity at which the racers travel. And the angle that showed the men taking the second turn of the run in shadow, their skis throwing up a clouds of powdered snow suddenly irradiated by a shaft of sunlight, was visual poetry. You can find the best bits on YouTube. Ace call at Roland Garros  During a busy weekend for sport, tOn a busy weekend for sport, the radar barely registered the excellent decision of the French tennis federation to redevelop the Stade Roland Garros, increasing capacity by 30% and putting a retractable roof on the centre court, rather than building a new complex in a more distant suburb of Paris.

Not for nothing has he been compared to the late, great J Dilla in terms of his ability to create amazing fresh sounds from ancient vinyl, while in terms of obsessive crate-digging for sonic gold he's like a one-man Avalanches. \"He takes a fragment, a pop particle, and uses its DNA to construct a brilliant new piece of music,\" wrote our New Band Of The Day columnist recently, commenting that Williams' ethereal, crackly take on sexed-up R&B made him a sort of cerebral R Kelly for bedroom lo-fi nerds.   ARGENTINA ARGENTINA: Zonaindie Iguana Lovers - Bloqueada The history of Iguana Lovers goes as far back as 1991 when they released Universo, their first album, which had a limited run in cassette format. Along with big acts such as Babas\u00f3nicos and El Otro Yo, they managed to create a whole new movement within Argentine rock music, with a post-punk sound influenced by British bands like Happy Mondays, The Stone Roses and New Order. Bloqueada is from their new EP, International Mistery Man, which can be downloaded from their website.  AUSTRALIA  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They? aBillion - Soldiers It may not be summer where you are right now, but it's definitely summer in Australia - and despite the natural disasters there's still enough sun and surf to make a song like Soldiers really hit the spot. Sydney's aBillion has burst onto the blog scene riding the proverbial chillwave, engaging many of the micro-genre's tropes but managing to make them their own. Although, there's a lot of music like this floating around at the moment, Soldiers has enough of a hook and groove to it to make you tune in.    BRAZIL BRAZIL: Meio Desligado Cabru\u00eara - Visagem Cabru\u00eara is a band from the north-east of the country who merge typical regional rhythms with contemporary music such as electronic and rock. They're famous for their insane shows, always full of stage dives and crowd-surfing from the band's frontman, Arthur Pessoa. Visagem is an instrumental theme that shares its name with their most recent album, which was released last year and is available for free download thanks to Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company that is the biggest sponsor of culture in the country.    CANADA CANADA: I(Heart)Music Fire And Neon - Everybody's Going Disco never died. It just went into hiding somewhere on the outskirts of Canada's capital, where it was then discovered by Fire And Neon. They, in turn, nursed it back to health and made a debut EP full of irresistibly dancey anthems.    CHILE CHILE: Super 45 Namm - Stellar Pablo Flores is one of the most iconic Chilean musicians. Aside from founding the experimental music netlabel Jacobino Discos, he takes part in several projects. In Namm, Flores joins Loreto Molina, Pablo Fuentes and Anita Gallardo in exploring synth-pop from an experimental perspective, but elegant nonetheless. Stellar is taken from his latest EP, Saba, offered under a Creative Commons license.    CHINA CHINA: Wooozy Re-TROS - Up Next: Bela Lugosi's Back Also known as Rebuilding The Rights Of Statues, this post-punk outfit formed in Beijing in 2003. Inspired by the likes of Bauhaus, Gang Of Four, Magazine and Joy Division, Re-TROS have become a mainstay in the Chinese underground scene. Hua Dong has one of the most piercing vocals and his distorted guitar lines add 'darkness' to the Re-TROS sound. The band have released two albums to date and have been very well received by fans and critics alike. They have been invited to support Gang Of Four for a one-week Australian tour at the end of February.    COLUMBIA COLOMBIA: Colombia Urbana Cris Supra - Este Verano Under the influence of R&B, Cris Supra gives us Este Verano, his new single for 2011. Supra is a representative exponent of the electro hip-hop scene in Colombia, with the principal base of his music coming from influences such as LMFAO, Pitbull, Lil Jon, David Guetta and Kid Cudi.    DENMARK DENMARK: All Scandinavian Stupid White Men - Walk And Slaughter Banjos, dobros, pathos-filled lyrics, dark emotions and a dusty Southern rock feeling. Sounds like a good combo to you? Then you'll dig quartet Stupid White Men and their excellent debut album It's A Fine Day To Kill Someone Nice, which was released last month.    FINLAND FINLAND: Glue Moses Hazy - Something You Ate From the far north of the Finnish Lapland, Moses Hazy deliver the first single from their third album. This is a pretty straightforward rock song with an in-your-face chorus and a bunch of acid notes to add some psychedelia to the mix. Danceable and fun.    GERMANY GERMANY: Blogpartei Touchy Mob - Atlantic Back Folk-techno, as Ludwig Plath calls his music produced under the name Touchy Mob, seems to be the natural connection of two currently popular genres that tend to be honest and plain. But as you listen to his songs and remixes you are drawn into hypnotic structures, great arrangements and Plath's soft, gentle voice. Atlantic Back is just one facet of his talent - check out more songs from this promising Berlin-based artist on Bandcamp and Soundcloud.    GREECE GREECE: Mouxlaloulouda Exposed By Observers - Doubt Is Dead Exposed By Observers frantically blend cheap samples, drum machine sounds, distinctive beats, clicks, bleeps and tightly-coiled guitars riffs with manic electro buzz and raw, squawking vocals. Yet they are less faithfully wed to punk and more interested in dance-derived rhythms. Doubt Is Dead is taken from their digital single, Fake Stories, the first in a series of monthly releases (there will be at least five parts). Visit Soundcloud to check out Fake Stories Never Get Old and their debut EP, Secondhand Youth.    ICELAND ICELAND: Icelandic Music Maffia R\u00f6kkurr\u00f3 - S\u00f3lin Mun Sk\u00edna R\u00f6kkurr\u00f3's music is built around Hildur Krist\u00edn Stef\u00e1nsd\u00f3ttir's voice and swooping strings. Their debut album \u00dea\u00f0 K\u00f3lnar \u00cd Kv\u00f6ld\u2026 (\"It's Getting Colder Tonight\u2026\") was released in 2007. S\u00f3lin Mun Sk\u00edna is taken from their more mature second album, \u00cd Annan Heim (\"In Another World\"), released last year by Icelandic label 12 T\u00f3nar and produced by Alex Somers, partner and music collaborator of J\u00f3nsi of Sigur R\u00f3s.    INDIA INDIA: Indiecision IAFWAY - Unsaturated New Delhi hardcore act IAFWAY (short for \"I Am Fake Who Are You\") are unlikely contenders for Indian metal glory. Still in school, the sextet can't even legally buy drinks at the clubs where they hope to take their brand of screamo. Yet their videogame-inspired tunes bely a maturity well past their years. On Unsaturated, a track from their free debut EP, they bring together melodramatic hardcore trappings with an almost graphic novel-ish wielding of screamo \u00e0 la Bring Me The Horizon.    INDONESIA INDONESIA: Deathrockstar Pee Wee Gaskins - Jakarta Is A Mistake Pee Wee Gaskins divide opinion - lots of people hate them but even more love the five-piece South Jakarta pop-punk boys. Since their music has grown in maturity and their lyrics have become deeper, we should agree about the progress they have made. Put aside the band promotion, public relations and social media consciousness, it's the music itself that continues to redefine the sound of PWG.    IRELAND IRELAND: Nialler9 MOTHS - Slow/Down The definition of 'one to watch' is an artist who is clearly adept at making music and impressing but maybe hasn't gone as far as the album-making cycle. MOTHS aka Jack Colleran has a good excuse. He's only 17 and still in school in County Kildare but he has already made a couple of standout electronic jams. Definitely keep an eye out for more of this goodness.    ISRAEL ISRAEL: Metal Israel Blank Divinity - In Another Life Blank Divinity is a metal band from Ashkelon, a seaside city no stranger to rocket attacks. They rightfully boast transcendence over all metal genres into their own sometimes brutal, sometimes melodic and most of the time completely shredding brand just waiting to be picked up by the right record company. Their talent is undeniable (though their occasional female vocalist is not to my taste) and I can definitely see these guys playing the major European festivals one day. Check them out.    ITALY ITALY: Polaroid Green Like July - Flying Scud Green Like July's second album, Four-Legged Fortune, was recorded at the ARC Studios in Nebraska and produced by A.J. Mogis (Saddle Creek). In fact, it definitely has a Bright Eyes vibe but this song in particular, with its Dylan-esque mood (that organ, that bridge), is a pure folk-rock jewel, intense and fragile at the same time. I love the way it burns out when it reaches the last words, you can totally see the trembling light of the stars, and the night fades away.    MEXICO MEXICO: Red Bull PanameriKa Marlento - As The World Turns Marlento is one of those bands with the outstanding ability to stir vivid scenes on their listeners' minds. This five-piece from Guadalajara sports a deviant mixture of influences within their songs, from Americana to New Wave, ebbing and flowing from furious post-punk to melancholic Mexican folk. As The World Turns is the quite catchy and tight first single from their sophomore album, Ludo, to be released this month.    NETHERLANDS NETHERLANDS: Unfold Amsterdam Nikoo - Shameless There's a real urgency to every sound this noise-pop outfit creates. Tribal drums clatter ferociously, while guitar fuzz emanates through the entire frequency spectrum, at times the mid-range riffs starting punch-ups with harmonic-fried highs. But drawing members from some of the Netherlands' most underrated alt-pop bands (Foam, The Sugarettes, amongst others), raw and enduring harmonies are rarely far from the surface of the noise. Imagine all the fun and chaos of Baltimore's Ponytail but with much less banshee.   NEW ZEALAND NEW ZEALAND: Einstein Music Journal Popstrangers - Avenue Noisy shoegaze collides with angry post-punk in Popstrangers' songs. They released their second EP, Happy Accidents, in November on Shoot The Freak, and its five distorted pop songs instantly stand out. There's a real menacing quality to the slacker vocals, drilling rhythm section and rusty guitars. Avenue sounds like a classic Flying Nun track in some regards, all pent-up aggression and hooky choruses dropping off to a sweetly serene bridge.   NORWAY NORWAY: Birds Sometimes Dance Jonas Alaska - In The Backseat Jonas Alaska is a 22-year-old up-and-coming singer-songwriter from \u00c5mli. He's currently living and studying in Liverpool and playing shows solo or with the band Homestead. He's no doubt walking in the footsteps of Bob Dylan, but don't be mistaken - he's not a pale copy, rather a brilliant musician in the same vein. He spent the fall of 2010 recording his debut album and we can all look forward to its release this summer.    PERU PERU: SoTB Kanaku & El Tigre - Bicicleta Kanaku & El Tigre are a cool group who will revitalize our ears this summer. Bruno Bellat\u00edn and Nico Saba's compositions take in folk melodies and experimental sounds made by any unusual instrument. Their stories talk about vices and selfishness, but also about sweetness and a weird hope. Bicicleta is from their first LP, Caracoles, a real hidden treasure.    PORTUGAL PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco? Hipn\u00f3tica + Unixx - Perfect Betrayer T(h)ree is the name of a collaborative compilation featuring 33 bands from Portugal, Macau and Hong Kong. Hipn\u00f3tica, who recorded and produced this track with Hong Kong group Unixx, is one of the most interesting Portuguese alternative bands and have been releasing music since 1997. Twelve-Wired Bird Of Paradise is their critically-acclaimed latest album and came out last year.    ROMANIA ROMANIA: Babylon Noise White Walls - The Lost Art Of Chapeaugraphy Part II This month we're presenting you something a bit different. Progressive metal that blends furious riffs with moments of calm, harsh vocals with melodic ones, alternating explosions with restraints. I'm talking about White Walls, from Constanta, four guys becoming ever more appreciated thanks to their live performances and debut album, Mad Man Circus, available for download via their label, Asiluum.    SCOTLAND SCOTLAND: The Pop Cop Reverie - Get To Know Me Reverie is the stage name of Louise Connell, a striking 21-year-old singer with a tempting voice and pop songs with hints of Martha Wainwright. Get To Know Me is such a flawless acoustic strum, it surely can't be long before daytime radio is all over this. The track is taken from her surprisingly diverse debut album Melodies which you can download for less than the price of a glass of wine at Bandcamp.    SINGAPORE SINGAPORE: I'm Waking Up To... Elektone - Falling Into You Memories fade in and out of reality when it comes to Elektone's dreamy brand of electro-pop. Started by Zulfadly Amin, a graduate of our National Arts Council's Noise Singapore initiative, he and his merry band capture love and light waves as pangs of desire wash over Singapore's bullet-speed society. Taking a moment to enjoy Elektone's music is almost like allowing yourself to fall asleep in a mass rapid transit, dreaming of tomorrow as yesterday happens all around you.    SOUTH KOREA SOUTH KOREA: Indieful ROK Auhm - Hide In The Fog So far, Youn Sang Hoon is best known as the guitarist in the beyond lovely indie-pop act Donawhale, but with the band on hiatus that may well be about to change. In addition to occasionally supporting former MAP artist Apollo 18 on stage, he's been making some music under the moniker Auhm. Hide In The Fog is a glorious post-rock track that is far from as shy as the title implies. Hopefully an EP will be out before the summer, but for now we'll have to be satisfied with Auhm's wondrous demo recordings.    SPAIN SPAIN: Musikorner AtletA - Evasi\u00f3n y Victoria 12twelve were one of Spanish post-rock's top bands. Out of its cinders and spirit, many creative adventures rose, AtletA being one of them. Composed of two former members of the aforementioned Barcelona band, Jaume L. Pantale\u00f3n and Jos\u00e9 Rossell\u00f3 redefine their sound with a bigger experimental expression. Krautrock, synth loops and free-jazz structures dissolve and pass the baton that Pantale\u00f3n already held in Ruizpantale\u00f3n, shading the compositions with hypnotic brightness, as Evasi\u00f3n y Victoria shows.    SWEDEN SWEDEN: Swedesplease Stay Hungry - Against The Wall I guess I should have asked for a couple of more songs from the straight edge hardcore band Stay Hungry since this one clocks in at only 1:27. Still, it's a perfect use of a minute and 27 seconds - nothing is wasted in this band's minimalistic aggro punk. I'm not a hardcore expert and am far removed from the scene, but to me these guys have it. Whatever 'it' is.    SWITZERLAND SWITZERLAND: 78s Death Of A Cheerleader - Flesh & Blood Death Of A Cheerleader is a four-piece from Winterthur. They recently released Flesh & Blood, a forerunner to their debut album, recorded and produced by Magnus Lindberg in Sweden.

The company will be 60% owned by Deutsche B\u00f6rse and include the New York Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange and London&apos;s Liffe futures exchange. It will have a combined revenue of $5.4bn (\u00a33.3bn). The merger has caused concern on both sides of the Atlantic. Charles Schumer, a senior Democrat and a member of the Senate banking committee, has said the new company would have to put the NYSE name first if it wanted his support through the regulatory process. &quot;Some may say: &apos;What&apos;s in a name?&apos; But I say: &apos;A lot.&apos; The New York Stock Exchange is a symbol of national prestige, and its brand must not suffer under this merger,&quot; he said. In Germany Johannes Witt, an employee representative on the B\u00f6rse&apos;s supervisory board, said jobs in his country were under threat. &quot;It will be a matter of time before the Americans take control. We should be wary of this,&quot; he said. As well as regulatory scrutiny, the deal requires approval from a majority of NYSE Euronext shareholders and 75% of Deutsche B\u00f6rse investors. The companies did not say what the name of the new entity would be when announcing the details of their merger. Speaking on cable news channel CNBC, NYSE Euronext chief executive Duncan Niederauer said the name would not be DB-NYSE, as had been speculated. &quot;It won&apos;t be announced today, it&apos;s still under discussion,&quot; he said. The exchange groups expect to save $400m because of synergies from the deal as well as exploiting &quot;substantial opportunities for incremental revenues&quot;. Niederauer, a former Goldman Sachs partner, will be chief executive of the new company, while Deutsche B\u00f6rse chief Reto Francioni will be chairman. Francioni said: &quot;This transaction brings together two of the most respected and successful exchange operators in the world to lead the way in global capital markets and set the standard for growth, quality and market reach. The combination makes sense for all of our constituencies.&quot; The tie-up comes amid a major shakeup in the world&apos;s exchanges. Technology is driving down the cost of accessing markets across the world and has led to the rise of multiple new trading platforms. The big players are looking to shore up their positions through consolidation. The London Stock Exchange and the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, are also planning a merger. While the Singapore exchange is negotiating a tie-up with Australian exchange ASX. Speculation has mounted of a potential counterbid for NYSE by the Chicago-based exchange group CME. The future of Nasdaq OMX, which lists the shares of hi-tech companies including Apple, Amazon, Intel and Microsoft, is also under scrutiny.

He was interrogated after being picked up by South Korean guards. South Korean military officials were at a loss as to how he had survived unscathed the two-and-a-half mile wide minefield in the demilitarised zone and evaded North Korean border guards. The man turned his back on elaborate birthday celebrations for the reclusive and ailing Kim. Staged festivities are scheduled throughout the week, including exhibitions of Kimjongilia, a hybrid flower named after the &quot;dear leader&quot;, as well as ice-skating, acrobatics and musical shows. Streams of uniformed soldiers, citizens and children offered bouquets of flowers and bowed before a giant statue of Kim Il-sung in the capital Pyongyang, in footage from AP Television News. &quot;We are greeting the 16th of February, an important holiday in our country, completely sure that the day of becoming a powerful and prosperous country \u2026 will definitely come, under the leadership of our respected General Kim Jong-il,&quot; Yun Kum-sun, a Pyongyang resident, said at Mansu Hill, which overlooks the city. &quot;The venues of the events are pervaded with deep trust in Kim Jong-il who has led the Korean revolution only to victory, true to the will of President Kim Il-sung,&quot; KCNA reported, referring to Kim&apos;s father and the state&apos;s founder. In the lead-up to Kim&apos;s birthday his second son was seen at an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore. Kim Jong-chul was accompanied by about 20 men and women at the gig on Monday, according to Korea Broadcasting System (KBS). Jong-chul was an early favourite to succeed his father but has since lost out to his younger sibling, Kim Jong-un, in his late 20s. The South marked the occasion by releasing balloons with anti-Pyongyang messages across the border, while in Seoul protesters burned posters of Kim Jong-il, who is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. Kim was away from public view for months and looked frail when he reappeared later, although last year he twice travelled to China. Kim has marked his birthday in the past by handing out luxury items and other goods to North Korea&apos;s long-suffering citizens. But there was no such show of generosity this time and a South Korean activist said the North failed to deliver on a promise to dole out a day&apos;s worth of food to its 24 million people in the days leading up to Kim&apos;s birthday. Diplomatic sources say North Korea has ordered all its embassies to appeal to foreign governments for food aid in a sign of growing desperation. This direct approach to foreign capitals, launched in December, is highly unusual for the insular and totalitarian regime, which normally negotiates deliveries of food assistance with international organisations such as the World Food Programme."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/feb/19/job-australia-working-overseas", "sentences": ["Singapore touts itself as a unique blend of east and west, a multicultural society with a global outlook where it is easy to adjust and adapt.", "&quot;We have seen a 25% increase year-on-year in the last three years of permanent placements in Brazil, while both Shanghai and Singapore are active markets and there are some great opportunities for the right candidates.&quot; While there are communities of more than 1,000 Britons in more than 100 countries around the world, the big expat populations are in Australia (more than a million), Spain, the US, Canada and France.", "&quot;We&apos;d been thinking of moving here and at this time of my life, it was either moving to Australia or buying a motor bike.&quot; How countries compare Singapore Population: 4.8 million.", "System of entry: Similar to Singapore \u2013 but spouses must get their own employment pass if they want to work too.", "Downsides: As Singapore but worse; difficult language to learn."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-19T00:01:05Z", "title": "Looking for a top job?

The queasiness grew when he moved into a flat opposite a homeless hostel, on a noisy street in St Kilda beach \u2013 a 20-minute tram ride from the city \u2013 where the partying carried on until 3am. &quot;My initial impressions weren&apos;t very good,&quot; said Jowett, who arrived in October, having successfully responded to an ad in the Guardian placed by SMS Management &amp; Technology, an Australian consultancy company, which is sponsoring him. He is now weighing up whether to stay or return to his family home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. At the age of 50, Jowett had decided it was now or never to test the waters Down Under \u2013 an idea he and his wife, Suzanne, 49, had toyed with for some time. There were sound economic reasons. His consultancy projects at GCHQ, the eavesdropping centre in Cheltenham, and for the Serious Organised Crime Agency, were coming to an end in a tightening job market. Nor was he too thrilled at the prospect of living under a Conservative-Lib Dem government. &quot;I felt quite depressed at the election,&quot; says Jowett, as we chat on the 41st floor of an office tower with sweeping views of Melbourne. &quot;The political situation is not in line with my allegiances.&quot; Jowett&apos;s decision to give the southern hemisphere a try reflects the contrasting economic fortunes of Britain and Australia. As the British economy splutters \u2013 it shrank 0.5% in the last quarter of 2010 \u2013 Australia&apos;s is motoring and is expected to grow by 3.5% this year. Unlike the UK and US, Australia has weathered what Australians call &quot;the GFC&quot; (global financial crisis), thanks to solid banking supervision. Now it is riding high on the back of China&apos;s explosive growth and its demand for raw materials. Iron ore, coal, copper and wool account for more than 70% of Australia&apos;s exports to China \u2013 easily its biggest market. So while Britain&apos;s economy flounders, Australia&apos;s is flourishing \u2013 although some commentators caution that it could suffer should China&apos;s economy go off the boil. For the time being, Australia&apos;s boom brings its own problems. It has a skills shortage and is eager to recruit a wide range of professionals and tradespeople, from secondary school teachers to architects, computer experts to nurses and civil engineers to cartographers. It is a long list and the regional areas, in particular, suffer from shortages. The recent floods and hurricane damage in Queensland have only sharpened the need for construction workers. Older professionals such as Jowett should benefit from changes in Australia&apos;s points-based visa system due to come into force in July. The changes \u2013 which continue to give top priority to employers who want to sponsor individual migrants \u2013 will focus on better English language skills, more extensive skilled work experience, higher-level qualifications obtained in Australia and overseas and different age ranges. Australia realises that many people in their mid to late 40s are just reaching the peak of their careers, acquiring the level of expertise it needs. Australia has been a draw for Brits ever since the \u00a310 Poms, an Australian government scheme of assisted passage that brought more than 1 million British migrants. These days programmes such as the BBC&apos;s Wanted Down Under and Relocation: Phil Down Under on Channel 4 serve to pique British curiosity about moving to Australia, although as some of the programmes make clear, the roads in Australia are not necessarily paved with gold. Still, as recession bites, more Brits may be tempted to move abroad for work. It is not just Australia that wants skilled British workers. Singapore touts itself as a unique blend of east and west, a multicultural society with a global outlook where it is easy to adjust and adapt. After establishing itself as a centre for finance and IT, it is now seeking to attract those working in interactive and digital media, biomedical sciences and green technology. It has done a fair job in luring foreign labour, as about one in four skilled workers on the island come from overseas. In recent years, China has also attracted skilled British workers. A report last year called Global Brit, from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), estimated that the percentage of Britons living in China since 2006 jumped by 30% \u2013 albeit from a low base \u2013 and the British population in the UAE grew by 20% in the same period, probably reflecting the greater job opportunities, although Dubai&apos;s bubble burst during the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile, other countries such as Brazil, Argentina and South Africa are also in the market for skilled expats. Glotel, a recruitment firm for telecommunications engineers and project managers, finds a big demand in those countries for its experts. &quot;At present we are seeing a surge in opportunities within South America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina,&quot; says Lee Wilsher, managing director of Glotel. &quot;We have seen a 25% increase year-on-year in the last three years of permanent placements in Brazil, while both Shanghai and Singapore are active markets and there are some great opportunities for the right candidates.&quot; While there are communities of more than 1,000 Britons in more than 100 countries around the world, the big expat populations are in Australia (more than a million), Spain, the US, Canada and France. The IPPR report says most British emigrants move abroad primarily to work \u2013 55% in 2008. They also tend to be younger, better educated and in higher-earning jobs than the general British population. In fact, latest figures show that emigration among professionals and the highly skilled has slowed recently, with greater numbers returning home \u2013 but the UK is still experiencing &quot;brain drain&quot;. On the plus side, though, the UK received about \u00a34.5bn in remittances from abroad in 2006 \u2013 which represents 0.3% of GDP. The drop reflects a waning in a British emigration boom that began in 2000. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show the number of people leaving the UK for 12 months or more fell from 427,000 in 2008 to 368,000 in 2009, while an estimated 140,000 British citizens emigrated in 2009, the lowest number since 1999, down from 173,000 in 2008. The IPPR finds that people choose to emigrate mainly because they see opportunities. In other words, it is positive &quot;pull factors&quot; that encourage them to emigrate, not negative &quot;push factors&quot; such as the economic or political situation in the UK. Jowett says, however, that both apply to his case. He loves Melbourne and feels at home after his less than auspicious start in this fast-growing city of 4 million people, with its myriad bars, cafes and restaurants and its terrific, if overburdened, tram system. &quot;It feels very cosmopolitan and very European,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a bit cliched but everybody is friendly. I&apos;m a big sports fan, I&apos;ve watched the Ashes and I&apos;m a keen golfer, so this place really does appeal.&quot; His wife and two children came to visit for three weeks at Christmas and loved it, so the pressure is on him to stay, Jowett says. But there are downsides. Although his salary is higher than in the UK, he finds it counteracted by the cost of living, particularly the high rent. In fact, Melbourne is suffering from its success. A recent survey of housing affordability around the world listed Melbourne near the bottom \u2013 321st out of 325 markets. The Demographic International Housing Affordability Survey put the median Melbourne house price at $565,000 (\u00a3353,823) with the median household income at $63,000. Such prices have prompted some analysts to say Australia has gone from the exemplar of modestly priced, high-quality, middle-class housing to the least affordable housing market in the English-speaking world. A big emotional wrench The popularity of Australia has fluctuated over recent decades. After a drop in popularity during the 1990s, it rose in the 2000s. Australian immigration records show nearly 2,000 Britons a month settled permanently in Australia during the first half of 2006, accounting for one in five long-term immigrants to Australia and more than doubling the British arrival rate of 10 years ago. In 2008-09, 31,882 Britons settled permanently there, but the number dropped to 25,439 in 2009-10. So in thinking of settling permanently in Australia, Jowett is bucking the trend, although if the UK economy is stuck in the doldrums, others may follow his example. Going so far can be a big emotional wrench. Olivia Stuart moved to Australia with her Australian husband in 2009 from Linlithgow, Scotland, mainly for the sake of their three boys, aged nine, six and four. She works as a GP in Wangaratta, two-and-a-half hours from Melbourne. They love the outdoor life, Stuart enjoys her work and they feel relieved to be in a strong economy, unlike their friends and family back home. &quot;Every GP clinic in town would like another doctor,&quot; says Stuart. &quot;The hard bit is it&apos;s a long way back and it&apos;s expensive. We miss family and friends, but you just have to accept that.&quot; She also warns that dealing with the paperwork is an ordeal. &quot;If you don&apos;t like paperwork don&apos;t emigrate,&quot; she says. &quot;It took three months to become a GP, even though there is a big shortage. There are a lot of bureaucratic hoops.&quot; Jowett, who was born in Barnsley, says he misses walking in the Yorkshire Dales and Peak District and most of all watching Barnsley, his football team, where he had a season ticket. But overall, he has not been disappointed. &quot;We always wanted to travel and have done a lot of travelling,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;d been thinking of moving here and at this time of my life, it was either moving to Australia or buying a motor bike.&quot; How countries compare Singapore Population: 4.8 million. Outlook: Economy estimated to have expanded by 14.7% in 2010, surpassing even China&apos;s rate. Expansion in 2011 expected to be a more restrained 4.3%. Who they need: Digital media experts; bioscientists/engineers; accounting/financial managers. System of entry: Advance job offer needed to get a work permit or an employment pass. Downside: The government doesn&apos;t brook much argument over its policies. Canada Population: 33.4 million. Outlook: Recovering from recession, but strong growth forecasts threatened by a looming population shortage. Hence the urgent requirement for more workers and citizens generally. Who they need: Who don&apos;t they need? Healthcare, IT and skilled tradespeople among the most sought-after, but many more on the list. System of entry: Points-based. Downside: Isolation can be a problem in the world&apos;s second-biggest territory. Qatar Population: 1.4 million. Outlook: Has one of the world&apos;s highest per capita GDP rates and a fast rate of economic growth. Who they need: Healthcare workers; engineers to work on gas field expansion and 2022 World Cup stadiums. System of entry: Similar to Singapore \u2013 but spouses must get their own employment pass if they want to work too. Downside: 40C temperatures are common in the summer months. China Population: 1.3 billion. Outlook: Nouriel Roubini, the economist who saw the 2008 financial crisis coming, believes the world&apos;s second-biggest economy is overheating. Only a stronger yuan can help cool the economy and bring down inflation, he says. Who they need: English teachers; entrepreneurial people who can facilitate trade with western companies. System of entry: Z visa, normally issued once job has been offered.

As I write, eBay is inviting bids on no fewer than 128 ancient Bactrian and Indo-Greek silver and bronze coins, from sellers in Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. Probably every one of them is the product of looting over the past 20 years. With luck, you might even pick up one of the tens of thousands of items plundered from the collections of the old National Museum of Afghanistan in Kabul between 1992 and 2001. For those with deep pockets, I can particularly recommend the eBay seller &quot;The Precious Art from Past&quot;, who is currently offering 289 looted AfPak objects for sale, including an extraordinary ancient Gandharan sculpture of a seated Heracles in near-perfect condition, yours for \u00a318,950 plus postage and packing. Such are the hazards of living at a &quot;crossroads of civilizations&quot;. It must be said that this kind of briskly utilitarian attitude towards Afghanistan&apos;s pre-Islamic heritage is nothing new. In 1999, the leader of the Taliban government, Mullah Omar, issued a decree forbidding any damage to the monumental Buddhas of Bamiyan, on the grounds that the Taliban considered the Bamiyan statues &quot;as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors&quot;. Aside from their potential economic value, no obvious benefits derived from the existence of the Bamiyan Buddhas: as Omar rightly noted &quot;In Afghanistan there are no Buddhists to worship the statues.&quot; Why should a Pashtun Muslim feel any sense of responsibility for the culture of Gandharan Buddhists? Dozens of times over the past 3,000 years, the plains and valleys around the foothills of the Hindu Kush have changed hands between Iranians, Greeks, Chinese, Scythians, Turks and Indians. An oft-photographed plaque outside the National Museum in Kabul reads: &quot;A Nation Stays Alive When Its Culture Stays Alive&quot;. No one should be taken in by the bland phrasing \u2013 this is as provocative as it gets. Which culture? Whose nation? In March 2001, Omar gave one answer, by revoking his decision of two years earlier and ordering the dynamiting of the Bamiyan buddhas. Simultaneously, most of the few remaining pre-Islamic objects in the Kabul museum were also smashed or sold off. It would be quite wrong to see the events of March 2001 as merely an act of barbarous vandalism (though they certainly were that too). They also represented a particular claim about which bits of Afghanistan&apos;s history were worth preserving: for the Taliban, the only &quot;national culture&quot; that mattered was the one that began in AD622. For an alternative account of Afghanistan&apos;s bloody history \u2013 one, as it were, with the Buddhists left in \u2013 we can look to a spectacular exhibition which opens at the British Museum next month. Neil MacGregor, director of the museum, hopes to show that &quot;We are at a historically anomalous moment when the country is seen as remote and isolated . . . Afghanistan&apos;s relationships are long and deep.&quot; At the heart of the exhibition is the miracle of Tillya Tepe, the &quot;hill of gold&quot;, a huge earthen barrow 80 miles west of Mazar-i Sharif, between the Hindu Kush mountains and the streams of the Amu Darya. Some time in the mid-first century AD, this mound was chosen by a nomadic prince as his burial kurghan. The prince himself was interred at the peak of the hill, and a horse was sacrificed and buried alongside him. In a ring around the prince&apos;s tomb were the graves of five women, probably his five wives, all of them clad in gorgeous textiles and jewellery of extraordinary splendour. Archaeologists recovered more than 20,000 objects from these six tombs, the richest of them coming from the graves of the two women buried closest to the Tillya Tepe prince. One of these two favoured princesses was buried with a silver Chinese mirror lying on her breast; beside her were an Indian ivory comb, a gold seal with the image and name of the goddess Athena in Greek, two distinctly European cherubs riding on the backs of dolphins, and, most remarkably of all, a gold coin of the Roman emperor Tiberius, minted at Lyon in Gaul between AD14\u00a0and 37. Who were these women? What language did they speak? The jewellery from Tillya Tepe is like nothing known from any other part of the world: Chinese, Indian, Bactrian, Siberian and Greek styles are jumbled and fused together into a glorious but baffling kaleidoscope. Many of the gold objects are studded with brilliant coloured stones, above all with turquoise. Particularly common are turquoise stones in the shape of hearts. These probably depict the ivy plant, sacred to the Scythian nomads of central Asia: in 329BC, during his expedition into the central Asian steppe, Alexander the Great saw nomadic burial mounds and trees wreathed with ivy. There are other reasons to think that the nomads of Tillya Tepe might have been Scythians \u2013 the main sources of turquoise in inner Asia lie in\u00a0the hills around Mashhad, around 300 miles west of Tillya Tepe in the heart of Scythian territory in north-eastern\u00a0Iran. It is hard to overstate the importance of the finds from Tillya Tepe. Nomads are the quintessential &quot;people without history&quot;; the nomadic encampment normally leaves no traces for the archaeologist to recover. These burials are, effectively, our only evidence for the long nomadic interlude in Afghan history between the fall of the Greek kingdom of Bactria in around 145BC and the rise of the Kushan state in the late first century AD. And crucially, whoever these nomads may have been, they were self-evidently as cosmopolitan as they come. Here, at the intersection of three ancient Asiatic trade routes, the princesses buried at Tillya Tepe were about as isolated from the wider world as Carla Bruni. As their jewellery clearly shows, the Tillya Tepe nomads sat at the centre of a web of cultural connections and influences stretching across thousands of miles, from the Mediterranean to the Ganges. To the south, across the high passes of the Hindu Kush, the Kabul river valley leads down towards the Khyber pass and India. North of the Oxus river, a tangle of trading routes (the &quot;Silk Road&quot;), stretching from Han China through Xinjiang and central Asia, had grown up over the course of the last two centuries BC. It was in northern Afghanistan, in the region of Tillya Tepe, that the Chinese silk road met the long-established caravan routes stretching west across the Iranian plateau into Mesopotamia and, ultimately, across the eastern borders of the Roman empire. Fragments of Chinese silk have been found across the Roman empire, from Palmyra in the Syrian desert to Holborough in Kent. Whichever route this silk took on its way to Europe, whether overland via Iran or by ship from India to the Roman ports on the Red Sea, it could not avoid passing through the nomadic pastures of northern Afghanistan. The gold coin of Tiberius in the princess&apos;s grave at Tillya Tepe, 3,000 miles from its mint in southern France, is just one tiny trace of this vast network linking Beijing to the shores of the Atlantic. The nomad graves were first uncovered by a Soviet-Afghan team in the autumn of 1978. Afghanistan in the late 70s was far from the ideal place and time for a vast hoard of gold of this kind to emerge. Late in 1979, once the finds had been analysed and photographed, they were handed over to the National Museum in Kabul for safe-keeping. By the end of the year, the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan. In 1988, as it became clear that the Soviets were preparing to withdraw, the communist president of Afghanistan, Muhammed Najibullah, had the finds from Tillya Tepe and other sites (including Ai Khanoum and Bagram, also on display in the British Museum exhibition) crated up and sealed in the vaults of the Afghan Central Bank. This proved to be a far-sighted move. As the country slid into anarchy in the early 90s, the Kabul museum was repeatedly shelled and looted; it was during these years that the museum&apos;s tens of thousands of artefacts began to be dispersed across the world. When the Taliban took Kabul in 1996, Najibullah was promptly lynched and the bank vaults searched, without success. The few museum staff who knew the location of the Tillya Tepe finds kept it to themselves, and the crates were left undisturbed throughout the period of Taliban rule. Their fate officially remained unknown until 2003, when safes beneath the presidential palace were opened by the Afghan minister of culture. Sadly, the security situation in Kabul was still so fragile that it was impossible to contemplate displaying the Tillya Tepe gold in the Kabul museum itself. Since 2006, the artefacts have been touring Europe and the United States. Few Afghans have ever had the chance to see them in their home\u00a0country. Still, the Kabul museum is at least open to visitors again. In 2009, a small exhibition, Rescued Treasures, went on display at the museum, including the pick of more than 2,000 looted Afghan artefacts impounded at Heathrow airport in 2004. The British ambassador to Afghanistan, Mark Sedwill, described the purpose of the exhibition as &quot;giving the Afghan people back that sense of cultural heritage that was so nearly taken from them&quot;. It is depressing to learn how few of these &quot;rescued&quot; objects actually came from the original, pre-1992 Kabul collection: most were the product of a fresh wave of looting of Afghanistan&apos;s ancient sites in the 90s and early 2000s. Given Afghanistan&apos;s recent history, I think we ought to be a little wary about the ambassador&apos;s notion of a single Afghan &quot;sense of cultural heritage&quot;, on the brink of being lost, but now &quot;given back&quot; to &quot;the Afghan people&quot;. The Kabul museum is situated far to the south of the city centre in the Dar al-Aman district, a European-style suburb laid out by the westernising Shah Amanullah Khan in the 1920s. On the opposite side of the road from the museum lie the bombed-out ruins of Amanullah&apos;s Dar al-Aman palace, complete with Parisian arcades, neo-classical pediments and formal gardens. The juxtaposition of the two buildings is no coincidence. As in modern Iran, Afghanistan&apos;s pre-Islamic &quot;heritage&quot; is a sharply politicised and divisive issue. Iran&apos;s ruling Shia clerics view their pre-Islamic past with intense suspicion: the site of Persepolis, in particular, is stamped with the secular and westernising aspirations of the Shah&apos;s regime in the 1960s and 70s. Happily for Persepolis, the archaeology of ancient Persia is also central to Iranian national pride, since it proves how much older and more civilised they are than the Sunni Arabs. Afghan archaeology, while also closely associated with the secular wing of the country&apos;s urban elite, has no such useful nationalist overtones to protect it. It is possible to over-analyse the dynamiting of the Bamiyan buddhas and the repeated vandalism of the Kabul museum. Whatever else he had in mind, Mullah Omar&apos;s actions in early 2001 had a lot to do with sticking two fingers up to the west. But there is a reason why that provocation was so effective. The Taliban were consciously and deliberately turning their back on Afghanistan&apos;s long history of engagement with China, the subcontinent and the west. The destruction of the buddhas was the crudest possible way of rejecting what they saw as a threateningly &quot;secular&quot; and cosmopolitan version of Afghanistan&apos;s history.

Well, we&apos;ve all had nights out like that, though for Charlie, this was probably Tuesday morning. He&apos;s such a bad boy, isn&apos;t he? The baddest! Sexy, isn&apos;t it, ladies? He&apos;s living the dream, isn&apos;t he, guys? If anyone answered &quot;yes&quot; to these questions, please smother yourself with a pillow for the good of humanity now. It seems to be bad boy season right now \u2013 &quot;caddish&quot; Charles Spencer snaring yet another fiancee, Shane Warne upsetting Liz Hurley, Berlusconi\u2026 being Berlusconi. However, all of them are drips, amateurs, compared with Charlie. Sheen ended up in rehab twice recently (drugs, alcohol, porn stars, violence, hospitalisation, all the classics). His top-rating show, Two and a Half Men, was temporarily postponed while he got better. Better? Sheen resembles a startled gosling that&apos;s just crawled out of Charles Bukowski&apos;s left nostril or a haunted scarecrow from a Stephen King story. His smile looks like the broken zip from hell. Does this pass for &quot;better&quot; in Hollywood these days? I thought: &quot;I should feel sympathy for him&quot; (let (s)he who casts the first stone, etc). Despite being a multimillionaire, Sheen is clearly a sick idiot, who views sex and celebrity as an extreme sport. However, I tend to make a point of not feeling sorry for bad boys such as Sheen. And that&apos;s because I don&apos;t want to indulge and encourage them. It&apos;s the equivalent of saying: &quot;Go ahead, bad boy, make another woman&apos;s life hell.&quot; I&apos;m not even sure I buy into all the Charlie Sheen myth-making. If he really was that perma-intoxicated, he wouldn&apos;t be copulating with porn stars, he&apos;d be urinating all over himself. Some other myths? Bad boys are funny, charming, wild, a rollercoaster ride (sigh!), not like other men. In Sheen&apos;s case, would this be &quot;partying&quot; with a porn star, while his former wife, Denise Richards, slept a few rooms away with his children? (Adorable!) Threatening another wife with a knife. (A keeper!) Or ranting at Richards when her mother was dying from cancer: &quot;Go cry to your bald mother, you fucking loser!&quot; (Hot!) Sheen comes across as the worst kind of diehard misogynist, modelled from a Mel Gibson Shaker Maker kit. And what happens? He&apos;s idolised. Paid millions. Elsewhere, even non-famous bad boys are encouraged to think that they&apos;re Marlon Brando in Streetcar, the untamed real deal. All this admiration, not just from other men, but from women, too. One thinks: what is it about these self-hating women that they flatter and indulge these horrors? It is tantamount to gender betrayal. Someone once told me that, subliminally at least, everything men do, or dream of doing, from climbing mountains to making millions, even to pulling their fingers and comedy farting, is to impress women. Could it be that some men look up to men like Charlie because they think women want men like Charlie? This results in behaviour in the general &quot;Charlie&quot; spectrum, which leads (ta-da!) to a lot of unhappy women and probably children, too. Is this what women are doing when they simper over bad boys \u2013 turning the female talent for self-loathing into an everyday hell for the women who actually end up dealing with them? Those women who are &quot;into bad boys&quot; really should get over it, or at least stop broadcasting it. Remember that men sometimes actually listen to what we say, try to guess what we want, with the tragic outcome that Charlie Sheen syndrome becomes our fault, too.

I say &quot;on the razz&quot; \u2013 he actually went to an Eric Clapton concert in Singapore. The same Clapton he saw playing in Germany five years ago. Around that time, Kim Jong-il decided his son was &quot;too effeminate&quot; to rule. Steady on, Pops, this is Slowhand, not Lady Gaga. As Kim Jong-Choi has pierced ears and wears a lot of black, it might be more accurate to dismiss him as &quot;too emo to rule&quot; or perhaps &quot;too goth to govern&quot;. Going to Clapton&apos;s gig doesn&apos;t seem so bad, unless your dad rules the single party state, the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea. (Oops, he does!) That&apos;s kids for you \u2013 always showing you up. This is the brilliant thing about political families \u2013 there is nearly always one child who rips off the mask of contrived ultra-respectability. Ronald Reagan&apos;s daughter, Patti, grassed up Daddy for being senile. Then there is Sarah Palin&apos;s teen-mom, ice-skating daughter, Bristol. And Carol and Mark Thatcher, Maggie suffering the mortifying progeny double whammy. What is it about political kids and their talent for sabotage? There the parent is, on the world stage, wielding vast international power, then along come their resentful, gum-chewing brats to screw everything up. It&apos;s a Wizard of Oz moment: curtains whisked back to reveal the all-powerful political whizzes for what they really are \u2013 exhausted parents with embarrassing, out-of-control kids. The Obama girls are adorable, but give them time. That little one has a glint in her eye\u2026 Dimbleby&apos;s got it right. No question Why is David Dimbleby accused of being a prima donna for his refusal to drag himself up to Glasgow for weekly production meetings for Question Time? Staff will now have to fly back to London to brief him, at the licence payers&apos; expense, but this isn&apos;t Dimbleby&apos;s fault. The BBC is moving Question Time to Glasgow because of its target of 50% of network spending outside of London by 2016. However, Question Time is a political programme that surely has a right to remain, as Dimbleby put it, &quot;around the swirl of Westminster life&quot;. As Question Time travels to a different locale around Britain each week, his stand can&apos;t be dismissed as London-centric snobbery or laziness. If you&apos;re prepared to sit in a provincial town hall on a weekday evening, with the likes of Nigel Farange sharing your water jug, no one could doubt your commitment. Likewise, calls for him to be replaced are ludicrous. Question Time without Dimbleby would be like Coronation Street without the cobbles. The truth is that Dimbleby is probably doing what many of his colleagues afflicted by the changes want to do (editor Ed Havard has already resigned over the issue). If filming for a particular programme has to be relocated, that&apos;s different, but expecting personnel to move around for the sake of a few production meetings is unfair and bizarre. One supposes there&apos;s always Skype, if the BBC really wants to torture the presenter. However, to me, this isn&apos;t about Dimbleby regally opining: &quot;The mountain must come to Muhammad.&quot; Rather, it&apos;s a case of: &quot;The mountain is being an overbearing, corporate jobsworth, insisting on change for change&apos;s sake.&quot; David Dimbleby&apos;s obstinacy rather becomes him."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/20/libya-protests", "sentences": ["This was filed earlier from Singapore by Reuters journalists:   April Brent crude and U.S. crude futures rose more than $1 a barrel on Monday as the threat of supply disruptions from OPEC member Libya grew, with protesters calling for the departure of the country&apos;s veteran ruler, Muammar Gaddafi.The leader of the Al-Zuwayya tribe in eastern Libya threatened on Sunday to cut oil exports to Western countries within 24 hours unless authorities stopped the &quot;oppression of protesters&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-20T23:34:24Z", "title": "Libya protests \u2013 as they happened", "tags": ["World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Protest", "Muammar Gaddafi"], "article": " 11.33pm: Hello. This is a new live blog covering developments in Libya.  11.36pm: In a long and rambling address to the Libyan people live on state television, Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s son, Saif, has been warning that the uprising against the regime is doomed to fail.  &quot;This is an opposition movement, a separatist movement that threatens the unity of Libya as a country,&quot; according to the BBC translation of what Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said. He claimed that the number of &quot;casualties&quot; has not exceeded 84 but has accused the foreign media of exaggerating the death toll in the city of Benghazi. There was a mistake on the Army&apos;s side when it came to confronting the protests, he said, adding that some of those who attacked the soldiers were &quot;under the influence of drugs&quot;.He claimed that at least three different groups are involved in the protests, one of which he described as &quot;islamic&quot;. It&apos;s unclear at this stage who he is referring to, be he claimed that the government have made a series of arrests and have detained outsiders who he said were brought into the country to foment unrest. He claimed that there was a plan by those seeking to overthrow the government to create a series of small emirates in Libya.  11.42pm: Gaddafi&apos;s son issued a series of warnings that appeared designed to spread fear among the general population and deter them from joining the uprising. The warnings ranged from predicting that the price of bread would rocket to warning that foreign oil companies would pull out of Libya. He predicted that the country would be plunged into civil war if those who had taken up arms against the state did not pull back.  11.45pm: He also referred to the telephone conversation he had with William Hague earlier in the day and insinuated that the call from London was a sinister sign of things to come.  &quot;The British foreign minister has given me a phone call,&quot; he said, according to early translations of the statement.&quot;Be ready because that means that foreign occupation is coming back to Libya&quot; Going on, he appeared intent on depicting the uprising as an attempt to establish Islamic emirates in Libya and warned viewers that this would bring down the wrath of the US and Europe &quot;The west and America will not allow any Islamic emirates to be formed in the middle east. They will not allow chaos in Libya. They will not allow chaos that would result in chaos and terrorism.&quot;  11.48pm: Saif, who has in the past pushed a reform agenda in Libya with only limited success, also appeared to hold out a carrot. He said the General People&apos;s Congress, Libya&apos;s equivalent of a parliament, would convene on Monday to discuss a &quot;clear&quot; reform agenda, while the government would also raise wages.  11.49pm: While Saif Gaddafi has been speaking, reports have been streaming in of how the unrest appears to be spreading to Tripoli from other cities. This is from Reuters:  Libya&apos;s unrest spread to the capital Tripoli on Sunday after scores of protesters were killed in the second city Benghazi, which appeared to have slipped out of control of forces loyal to strongman Muammar Gaddafi.Gaddafi has attempted to put down protests with a violent crackdown, triggering some of the worst bloodshed in the two months since unrest began sweeping across the Arab world.In the first sign of serious unrest in the capital, thousands of protesters clashed with supporters of Gadaffi in Tripoli. Gunfire could be heard and police using tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.In Benghazi, centre of Libya&apos;s unrest, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and appeared to be in control of the city before security forces opened fire and killed scores.Benghazi residents said soldiers from a unit had joined their protest and defeated a force Gaddafi&apos;s elite guards. Bodies were brought to a hospital riddled with bullets and wounds from rocket-propelled grenades.A witness in Tripoli said police in the capital were using tear gas against protesters, some of whom were throwing stones at billboards of Gaddafi.A resident of the capital told Reuters by telephone he could hear gunshots in the streets. &quot;We&apos;re inside the house and the lights are out. There are gunshots in the street,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s what I hear, gunshots and people. I can&apos;t go outside.&quot;An expatriate worker said protesters were being dispersed by police and he could see burning cars in the capital.    11.55pm: Back to some more segments from Saif&apos;s address, which is being met with widespread derision by opponents of the Libyan regime on twitter and elsewhere. Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s son said that his father remained in the country and was backed by the army. &quot;We will fight to the last minute, until the last bullet,&quot; he added. Earlier, he admitted protesters have seized control of some military bases, weapons and tanks. &quot;We are not Tunisia and Egypt,&quot; he went on to insist, referring to the successful uprisings that toppled longtime regimes in Libya&apos;s neighbors.  11.59pm: It appears from the role played tonight by Saif al-Gaddafi that the Libyan dictator&apos;s son is destined to play a key role in whatever events shape Libyan history in the days ahead. An Anglophile who studied a the London School of Economics, his strong connections to Britain will no doubt be of great interest to many.  12.10am: You can read a profile of Saif, written by the Guardian&apos;s Middle East Editor, Ian Black, here.  12.16am: The fall-out from events in Libya appears to be taking a toll among representatives of the regime abroad. Al Jazeera has reported that the Libyan ambassador to China resigned earlier this evening during an interview live on air. Now, BBC Arabic is reporting that the Libyan ambassador to India has also resigned from his post in protest at the violence being used to suppress the protests at home.  12.23am: Middle eastern commentator Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi, who tweets at @SultanAlQassemi, has been quick on the draw with a translation of Saif&apos;s statement tonight. You can read it here.  12.30am: Users of twitter is beginning to pick up on Saif&apos;s connections with Britain, including his recent \u00a31.5m donation to the London School of Economic&apos;s Centre for Global Governance.  Nuggets like this from Saif&apos;s own LSE PhD are also being poured over: &quot;I shall be primarily concerned with the central failing of global governance: it is highly undemocratic.&quot;  12.36am: On Saif&apos;s LSE donation, @randomvariable tweets   Gaddafi&apos;s donation was accepted by David Held, writer of the key undergrad textbook &quot;Models of Democracy&quot;  In the meantime, you can pass on comments for tonight&apos;s blog by contacting me at @BenQuinn75  12.44am: Here&apos;s some fairly typical reaction to the Saif&apos;s speech on twitter. @EnoughGaddafi tweets:   Many people believed #saifalislam was a reformer, today&apos;s speech was a sign of more of the same, gaddafi theater #libya #feb17   12.52am: The local time in Tripoli is now just before 3am but the impact of events there and in other parts of Libya has been filtering through to international markets. This was filed earlier from Singapore by Reuters journalists:   April Brent crude and U.S. crude futures rose more than $1 a barrel on Monday as the threat of supply disruptions from OPEC member Libya grew, with protesters calling for the departure of the country&apos;s veteran ruler, Muammar Gaddafi.The leader of the Al-Zuwayya tribe in eastern Libya threatened on Sunday to cut oil exports to Western countries within 24 hours unless authorities stopped the &quot;oppression of protesters&quot;.   12.58am: @naomimc has just pointed out that Saif Gaddafi is apparently a keen user of twitter himself.  It seems that he currently boasts 158 followers at @SaifGaddafi. Wonder if that number is going to go up or down?  1.25am: In comparison to the protests in Tunisia and Egypt, the nature of Libya&apos;s regime has meant that it has been much more difficult for the international media to get a handle on events there. However, those inside the country have continued to stay in touch by telephone with the Guardian and other news outlets. Al Jazeera has been carrying an audio recording of an interview tonight with a pro-democracy activist in Tripoli. He identified the city&apos;s Green Square as Libya&apos;s potential equivalent to Tahrir Square in Cairo and Pearl roundabout in Manama, Bahrain. The man told the channel that he and others had marched to the square earlier and managed to displace Gaddafi loyalists who had been attempting to prevent opponents of the regime from entering it. He claimed that marchers had come under fire from snipers and from civilians throwing rocks, but had succeeded in taking over the square.  1.31am: We&apos;re going to wrap it up for now on the liveblog, but join us again in a few hours for further coverage of this fast-developing situation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/22/happiness-green-china", "sentences": ["The GDP figure in Guangdong, one of China&apos;s most developed provinces, is now close to that of the four Asian Tigers \u2013 Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 which themselves have entered the ranks of developed nations."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-22T10:33:00Z", "title": "Be happy, says Chinese province in new five-year plan", "tags": ["Green economy", "China", "Ethical and green living", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "As China&apos;s growth figures have rocketed, criticism of the country&apos;s &quot;GDP first&quot; approach has also been rising. That criticism is now starting to influence policy: in January, the Communist Party branch in Guangdong, a province in southern China, specified a &quot;Happy Guangdong&quot; as one of its goals for the 12th Five-Year Plan period, which runs from 2011 to 2015. It aims to achieve this target by boosting domestic demand, innovation, workforce development, regional coordination, green development and &quot;harmonious sharing&quot;.  Guangdong&apos;s proposal won swift approval from civil society, with both the media and the public praising the &quot;Happy Guangdong&quot; concept. It is clear that the Chinese people \u2013 particularly those in more developed regions \u2013 have come to realise the limitations of a system where, once a certain degree of growth has been achieved, GDP is still prioritised above all else. They hope that broader indices can be used to promote economic and social development and increase the well-being of China&apos;s citizens. At the end of the 1970s, China&apos;s per-capita GDP was only US$290 (1,906 yuan). Housing was basic and people struggled to survive. Private bathrooms, personal transportation, refrigerators, televisions, cassette players and telephones were all part of daily life in the United States and Europe, but remained an unreachable dream for most Chinese people. A low level of economic development was preventing the pursuit of happiness And so China declared war on poverty. With economic growth as its central battle strategy, it went all out in pursuit of higher GDP. Thirty years later, China has overtaken Japan to become the world&apos;s second largest economy and has per-capita GDP of about US$3,000 (19,700 yuan). Challenges to basic survival have been met, while some areas have become wealthy and modern. The GDP figure in Guangdong, one of China&apos;s most developed provinces, is now close to that of the four Asian Tigers \u2013 Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 which themselves have entered the ranks of developed nations.  The dream of a better life among ordinary people has driven this economic miracle. And economic growth has become the Communist Party&apos;s most important source of legitimacy.  Once an individual&apos;s material needs have been met, further consumption provides diminishing returns of happiness. For a nation, it is the same \u2013 once economic development provides subsistence, or even a comfortable existence, for its people, further GDP growth does not noticeably increase well-being. Sociological, psychological and economic research has shown this to be the case, and our own experiences confirm it. When issues of survival have been dealt with nationwide and when many regions have achieved economic modernisation and comfortable living standards, the additional happiness generated by further economic growth begins to fall.  Moreover, the narrow pursuit of GDP growth can actually damage the factors that create happiness. For example, many parts of China have welcomed polluting industries for the sake of economic growth, resulting in air and water contamination, higher rates of illness \u2013 and a decline in day-to-day well-being. What is the point of this kind of economic growth? This question is not unique to China. Some nations have gone so far as to propose replacing GDP with Gross National Happiness (GNH) \u2013 easy to calculate by combining indices measuring GDP, public health, social welfare, culture and environmental quality. Bhutan has already adopted the idea of GNH into national policymaking, leading it to cap the number of tourists allowed to visit the country each year in order to limit environmental and social impacts. As a result, Bhutan&apos;s per-capita GDP is low, but it has become, many argue, the world&apos;s &quot;happiest nation&quot;.  In China, Guangdong has taken the lead in moving away from GDP-focused development and stressing that a happy society is not simply a rich one: it also needs a clean environment, secure civil rights, social justice and the provision of public and cultural goods. The implications of this are worth considering.  But while the idea of Gross National Happiness is now taken seriously, its implementation in China still faces obstacles. Take one component \u2013 environmental indices \u2013 as an example. Over recent years, China has seen continuous reports of heavy-metal pollution, algal blooms, sprawling landfills and air pollution. But the environmental authorities have used reported reductions in chemical oxygen demand (a measure of water pollution) and carbon-dioxide emissions to claim that the environment is improving. Even Zhang Lijun, vice minister for environmental protection, admits that there are problems with using those two measures to evaluate the quality of China&apos;s environment. Meanwhile, using their own cameras, Beijing residents have shown that the city&apos;s &quot;blue-sky days&quot; are much rarer than official statistics claim. Against this background, it is easy to understand why official environmental data gets better every year, while the public&apos;s sense of well-being diminishes. Non-GDP indices are being used for appearance&apos;s sake only. Meanwhile the GDP-first approach remains popular, particularly with local governments under increasing financial pressure. Short-term measures designed to boost GDP, such as selling land, speculating on property markets and supporting polluting industries, are constantly employed.  Why, when the extra well-being provided by further economic growth is falling, is China still pursuing GDP at the expense of other forms of social development? Besides the fact that there is still room for growth, the most important driving force is the system for assessing the performance of officials. Over the past 30 years, China&apos;s market reforms, combined with a concentration of power in government hands, have created a form of economic development led by local government. This has made economic growth the most important measure of an official&apos;s success and, to a certain extent, distorted his or her public-service role.  In the 1980s, the Chinese Communist Party&apos;s source of legitimacy shifted from ideology to economic record. Although ideological education remained significant, the party&apos;s right to rule was increasingly drawn from actual economic growth. This formed the core of a system for assessing local government performance, evaluating results and determining promotions that, over three decades, has become entrenched. But society has developed faster than the political system, and China has been left with a rigid assessment framework that is ill-suited to the needs of a rapidly changing society.  Another issue is that, under the existing system, local government and local business come together to form a powerful interest group that supports GDP growth over competing demands, such as environmental protection. Its members have interests to protect, organisational ability, financial backing and, in some cases, media control. Meanwhile, the needs of the environment are advocated by newer groups, which are both scattered and weak. Sometimes their voices are heard in the media, but they are no match for powerful lobby groups. This is why many polluting projects continue despite objections from numerous environmental organisations.  Everyone knows that protecting the environment is a good thing. And everyone knows that money does not equal happiness. But the system nonetheless results in a chronic focus on GDP. Merely advocating happiness indices will not solve the problem. As long as local government officials seek good evaluations \u2013 and those evaluations are carried out by superiors from higher levels of government, without public involvement \u2013 GDP will remain the most direct and effective measure of success. And, for officials, ignoring public demands to prioritise well-being over GDP growth will continue to make perfect sense.  The GDP chase is the product of an outdated method of assessing government performance. Calling for officials to pay more attention to well-being without changing that system will make happiness indices nothing more than window-dressing. Only reforming that system and letting the public participate in the evaluation of local government will force officials out of the GDP rut and allow the creation of a &quot;Happy China&quot;. \u2022 Tang Hao is deputy professor at South China Normal University, a Fulbright scholar and a columnist."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/feb/23/the-fiver-marseille-man-utd", "sentences": ["I don&apos;t want to be the next Andy Gray&quot; - Woodlands Wellington coach R.

Brent crude leapt $8.54 to $119.79 a barrel, the highest price since August 2008, and later traded at $113.93 a barrel. It closed at $112.20 on Wednesday, up 5.4% on the day. Oil prices have gained 15% in the past four days. US crude for April delivery rallied to $103.41, the highest since September 2009. Stock markets around the world tumbled again, with the FTSE 100 index in London down about 15 points at 5908.34. The Dax in Frankfurt dropped nearly 80 points. Overnight, the Nikkei in Tokyo closed 1.2% lower. Libyan oil production has dropped by 1.2m barrels a day due to the escalating crisis, according to Italy&apos;s ENI, the largest foreign oil producer in Libya. The country normally produces 1.6m barrels a day. Markets worry that the unrest could spread to Saudi Arabia, which pumps a tenth of the world&apos;s oil and is the only country with significant spare capacity that could be used to plug supply shortages. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said further disruptions could create &quot;severe&quot; oil shortages that would require &quot;substantial demand rationing&quot;. &quot;The market cannot accommodate another disruption, in our view, with the problems in Libya potentially absorbing half of Opec&apos;s spare capacity,&quot; said the bank&apos;s commodity analyst Jeffrey Currie. &quot;Although we still see contagion to the large energy producers in the Gulf as relatively low, the stakes associated with further contagion are now much higher, which creates even further upside risk to our price forecasts.&quot; The cost of oil hit an all-time high of $147 (both Brent and US crude) in July 2008, but then fell back as the recession in most western countries reduced demand for crude. Commodity analysts at Japanese bank Nomura have warned that prices could perhaps hit $220 a barrel if the crisis in the Middle East continues. They compared the current situation to the 1990-1991 Gulf war, saying if Libya and Algeria were to halt oil production, prices could peak above $220 a barrel. Others have predicted that oil could rise above $150 a barrel if the turmoil spreads. The International Energy Agency warned this week that surging oil prices could derail the world economic recovery. Economists reckon that a $10 a barrel increase in the price of oil knocks about half a percentage point from global GDP growth, although some still expect oil prices to drop back later this year. &quot;Clearly this spike in the price of oil, unless it is just temporary, could well have quite an unfavourable affect on the global recovery process,&quot; said David Buik at BGC Partners. &quot;If the consumer starts to feel the cost of higher fuel at the pumps, which will inevitably adversely affect his disposable income, then retail activity will fall sharply and that means lower growth, if any at all. Inflation may well become rampant, but its harmful effect could be very temporary.&quot; Gold prices hovered near a seven-week high as the surge in oil prices triggered inflation fears. Spot gold traded at $1,415.45 an ounce. &quot;People don&apos;t have much confidence that the Libya crisis will be settled any time soon, so a lot of them are betting on gold,&quot; a dealer in Singapore told Reuters. &quot;Gold will be king.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/24/first-robot-marathon-japan-osaka", "sentences": ["Last year&apos;s tournament in Singapore drew 500 teams from 40 countries."], "publicationDate": "2011-02-24T13:14:19Z", "title": "World's first robot marathon sets off in Japan", "tags": ["Robots", "Technology", "Japan", "Science", "World news", "Running", "Sport", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "As a sporting spectacle, this is one event that is unlikely to set pulses racing.

The event is the world&apos;s first robot marathon, which began in the western Japanese city of Osaka on Thursday. The five battery-charged runners, each between 30cm and 44cm in height, will compete on arguably the least picturesque marathon course in the world: a room in Osaka&apos;s Asia-Pacific trade centre. Organisers of the Robo Mara Full say the race will test the robots&apos; durability and manoeuvrability to the limit as they attempt to complete 422 laps of the 100-metre track to make up the 26.2-mile marathon distance. The event is being organised by Vstone, a Japanese robot maker, and funded by the municipal government of Osaka, a city that once depended on heavy industry but is now trying to position itself as a centre of robot innovation. While the bipedal robots won&apos;t have to worry about pulling a muscle or hitting the &quot;wall&quot; in the final stages, they still performed knee-bends and other warm-up exercises before lining up. Vstone&apos;s entry is broadcasting the entire race on Ustream via a video camera installed in its head. Japan has an impressive record of marrying cutting-edge robot technology and athletic achievement. It hosted the first robot football World Cup in Nagoya in 1997, and again in 2005, in Osaka. Last year&apos;s tournament in Singapore drew 500 teams from 40 countries. The universities and companies taking part in the Osaka marathon are permitted to change their robots&apos; batteries and carry out running repairs, but the machines must run unassisted.

The decision, part of attempts by the Ministry of Defence to make savings, has raised concerns that large military contractors with no experience of objective news reporting or radio and television production could bid to run the service as a money-making scheme. Critics of the decision expressed concern that the values and ethos of the broadcasting station would be lost. Contractors thought to be interested in bidding include Babcock, Serco and BT. The MoD, after lengthy internal debate, is due to publish a statement of its broadcasting requirements soon, say BFBS sources, opening up its services to external suppliers for the first time since it began in 1943. The MoD said that the service would be put out to tender shortly, with the successful bidder taking over in 2013. Further cuts are expected in an already reduced budget, currently about \u00a320m a year. In effect BFBS, which employs a 30-strong independent news team, faces dismemberment, taken over in some places by local garrison radios. A charitable trust, the Services Sound &amp; Vision Corporation, currently receives the funds from the government and the money is then used by BFBS. Any surplus is used for events such as live concerts or reinvested in charities helping armed forces personnel. The BFBS has a tradition of standing apart from government publicity agencies and PR machines. Though supportive of the armed forces it aims to provide credible and unbiased news from teams of dedicated reporters. It is assisted by news footage from the BBC and, more recently, Sky News. But sources say there are always tensions and disputes between it and the MoD. One current area of friction is said to be the focus on a lack of accommodation for naval families. The MoD is also believed to be unhappy with the coverage of the rapid decommissioning of military planes, ships and hardware in the recent defence review. BFBS services centre on the main theatres of war and deployments, notably Afghanistan and the Falklands. It has journalists permanently stationed at Camp Bastion, the main British base in Helmand, south Afghanistan. It broadcasts to British troops in Germany, where it was established in 1945. Under the current defence review the 20,000 British troops there will be withdrawn by 2020. The main show is a half-hour TV news programme at 5.30pm. There are also rebroadcasts of the Today programme and PM on radio. BFBS broadcasts 10 British TV channels, all overseas, with an emphasis on such topics as welfare for military families and accommodation. In addition BFBS runs 400 live entertainment shows every year, with visiting British entertainers, and runs programmes in Cyprus that soldiers attend after ending a tour of duty before returning home. BFBS manages cinemas in Germany, shops on military bases and an archive so soldiers can download favourite programmes, such as Top Gear, before going to the front. Teams of technicians go to the forward bases to ensure the services are available to troops. BFBS calling British forces radio has its roots in north Africa during the second world war, when the British army in Algiers set up an experimental radio station in a harem. After the war it moved to Hamburg. One of its most celebrated programmes was Two-Way Family Favourites, playing records requested by troops based in Germany and their families in the UK. Anchored by Cliff Michelmore and Jean Metcalfe, who later married, it was later broadcast by BBC Radio&apos;s Light Programme. BFBS says its studios have &quot;looked out over Victoria Harbour from Hong Kong Island, Basra air station in Iraq, the Banja Luka metal factory in Bosnia, Singapore, Nairobi, Berlin, Kosovo, Cologne and the back of Paddington railway station in London&quot;.

Born James McDonald Lincoln, he was the son of a Sydney signwriter, and after leaving school ran a small gym in the city. He started wrestling on booths run by the Australian showman Roy\u00a0Bell, where his role was as a plucky schoolboy challenging the professionals. Then, under the name Elmo Lincoln, he wrestled at the old Leichhardt stadium, in the days when visiting Americans topped the bill. On his way to England to seek fame and fortune, Lincoln regularly wrestled in Singapore with the legendary American Chief Little Wolf \u2013 in reality an ageing and increasingly alcoholic Mexican. He arrived in England at 19 and, while working as a bodyguard to a currency dealer, wrestled down the bill to no great effect, as Paul or James Lincoln, until the Scottish promoter and wrestler George Kidd suggested he don a mask. Some run-of-the-mill wrestlers can be transformed by a bonnet, as it is known in the trade, and Lincoln was one such. At 5ft 8in and less than 14st, neither Lincoln nor his tubby alter ego, Doctor Death from Hollywood US, possessed the physique of a heavyweight such as his great Sydney friend Ray Hunter, or the technique of the great &quot;shooters&quot;, &quot;Judo&quot; Al Hayes or Kidd himself. However, once in a mask, Lincoln&apos;s posture changed and he appeared to be their physical equal: he became one of the great masked men in the ring. As the years went by, and more and more Doctor Deaths appeared in halls throughout Britain, Lincoln would remark wryly, &quot;Often imitated \u2013 never\u00a0equalled.&quot;     A wrestling bill featuring Paul Lincoln, aka Dr Death.    It was a time when wrestlers were rebelling against the stranglehold that Joint Promotions \u2013 with regional promoters working in conjunction \u2013 held over the business. Lincoln was able to promote himself through his connections at Granada cinemas. Dale Martin bills (Joint Promotions&apos; standard bearers) could be staple fare, but Lincoln introduced a number of exotic creatures, such as the giant Ski\u00a0Hi\u00a0Lee; the Glaswegian Milton Reid, who wrestled first as Jungle Boy, then bald-headed as the Mighty Chang; the Wild Man of Borneo; and the bowler-hatted Society Boy. When he fought the former world boxing champion Randolph Turpin, Lincoln refused to begin until a doctor was present, telling the crowd, &quot;Turpin is going to be hurt.&quot; &quot;He\u00a0had more front than Sainsbury&apos;s,&quot; said one\u00a0admirer. Soon Lincoln&apos;s promotions were joined by some of Dale Martin&apos;s stars, such as Mike Marino. In wrestling&apos;s heyday, Lincoln promoted around the world; with some of the profits, he took a share with Hunter and other wrestlers in the upmarket Cromwellian nightclub in Kensington, London. In the 1970s, wrestling changed. There was a reconciliation between Martin and other promoters, and they joined forces. No longer could Lincoln put together his own bills. Disillusioned, he agreed to be unmasked \u2013 initially in Colchester, Essex, by Peter Maivia, who played the villain in the Bond film You Only Live Twice. After that, his mask came off regularly. Lincoln then went to Spain, where he wrestled again in a mask in Valencia for a year as a Spanish Doctor Death, making a weekly road trip to Madrid for fights in a bullring. He later returned for a time to Australia, where he wrestled as Major Lincoln, a villainous British Army officer. His time in wrestling was, he said, the best of his life. Lincoln&apos;s other influential career was outside the ring. He was heavily involved in encouraging skiffle and rock&apos;n&apos;roll. In 1956, he and Hunter opened the 2i&apos;s coffee bar in Old Compton Street, Soho, where there was an admission charge of sixpence for each of two evening houses. Among those who appeared on the bill were Tommy Steele, Bruce Welch of the Shadows and Wally Whyton and the Vipers, who for some time were the regular band. Lincoln also managed the early British rockers Terry Dene and Wee\u00a0Willie Harris. Steele actually appeared at the 2i&apos;s only twice, but played a big part in creating the venue&apos;s reputation. Lincoln was the first to realise the profits to be made from all-teenage package shows consisting of nothing but rock&apos;n&apos;roll and skiffle without tired music-hall acts slowing down the evenings. His 2i&apos;s &quot;Rock Across the Channel&quot; to Calais, France, was the first of many such &quot;riverboat shuffles&quot;. When the enormously popular BBC programme Six-Five Special was broadcast from the 2i&apos;s, Lincoln was interviewed and, said the journalist Fraser White, &quot;his voice rang with a sacred softness that made him sound like the Billy Graham of the teenage movement&quot;. After his wrestling career was over, he ran a private detective agency in Sydney, where he was also a partner in a Mexican restaurant, before returning to England to invest in a large nightclub in Southampton. In later years he lived quietly in the city. Even in increasing ill-health, he always tried to attend the annual British Wrestlers Reunion. He was also in Old Compton Street in 2006 to see a plaque unveiled on the site of his 2i&apos;s coffee bar. He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, to whom he was devoted, his daughter, Natalie, and three grandchildren. \u2022 Paul Lincoln (James McDonald\u00a0Lincoln), wrestler, born 3 May 1932; died 11\u00a0January 2011"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/04/chinese-defence-spending-rise", "sentences": ["Professor Huang Jing, a north Asia security expert at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew school for public policy, said there were often substantial increases in China&apos;s military budget \u2013 usually including a rise in officers&apos; salaries \u2013 when it was preparing for a change of leadership."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-04T08:29:00Z", "title": "Chinese defence spending to rise to \u00a356bn", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Chinese military spending will rise by 12.7% this year, a return to double-digit growth after an unusually restrained increase in 2010. The official budget will hit around 601bn yuan (\u00a356bn), to fund &quot;appropriate&quot; hardware spending and wage rises for the People&apos;s Liberation Army \u2013 the largest in the world \u2013 said Li Zhaoxing, spokesman for the National People&apos;s Congress. The largely rubber-stamp parliament, which opens on Saturday, will discuss the country&apos;s social and economic aims for the next five years. The rise in spending will fuel concerns among rival powers about China&apos;s increasing might. They are already concerned about its apparently tougher line on territorial disputes in areas such as the South China Sea, and its investment in new technology such as a stealth fighter jet. In 2010 spending rose at its lowest rate for years, by 7.5%, to 532bn yuan. Li told a news conference: &quot;China&apos;s defence spending is relatively low by world standards. China has always paid attention to restraining defence spending.&quot; Many analysts believe China spends more than it states publicly. US military spending has doubled in real terms since 2001 and although the Obama administration has vowed to cut spending over the next five years, it has requested a Pentagon base budget alone of $553bn (\u00a3340bn) for 2012. India also announced a rise in its annual military spending this week by about 11.6%, to 1.64tn rupees (\u00a322.4bn). Experts suggested the jump was intended to counter China&apos;s growing strength. Professor Huang Jing, a north Asia security expert at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew school for public policy, said there were often substantial increases in China&apos;s military budget \u2013 usually including a rise in officers&apos; salaries \u2013 when it was preparing for a change of leadership. Its leaders also felt they were entering a period of uncertainty, with domestic challenges and upcoming leadership contests in countries such as the US, Japan and India, he said. &quot;Leaders will have less political capital to spend on foreign affairs, and foreign policy tends to be more expendable for political capital at home, so I think all of them will be tougher on foreign affairs.&quot; Huang said China&apos;s military buildup began in the mid-90s as it became concerned Taiwan would seek legal as well as de facto independence. &quot;The defence industry is a kind of machine: once you start it, you cannot slow it down. 2010 to 2050 are going to see a dramatic expansion of Chinese military power,&quot; he predicted. &quot;You also have to take into consideration that China&apos;s military seems to have become more influential in decision-making, or they at least voice their concerns louder than before.&quot; Xu Guangyu, director of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said the budget was &quot;not really high&quot; given the size of the army. He said the country&apos;s five-year plan, which focuses on raising living standards, will require salary and welfare improvements for the 2.3 million personnel, in part to offset the effects of inflation. &quot;The other reason is that the cost for military equipment is going up, especially for high-tech weapons.&quot; He predicted growth would slow again next year. Ni Lexiong, a defence expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said the increase reflected closer military cooperation between the US, Japan, South Korea and other countries in the region. He also pointed to Beijing&apos;s need to deal with new threats to its citizens and assets overseas.

There&apos;s just the small matter of a HK$10-15m (\u00a3800,000-\u00a31.2m) that invitation-only guests are required to spend downstairs at the casino. The Paiza Club and Mansions are part of the Macau Venetian, the world&apos;s largest casino, and the fifth biggest building on the planet. And every time you buy something with a Made in China label, much of the money eventually ends up here. Las Vegas is puny in comparison. Chinese punters bet around \u00a370bn on Macau&apos;s baize tables (they prefer baccarat) last month alone. This year it could reach \u00a31tn, an almost unimaginably colossal sum. Think of all the cash issued from all the UK&apos;s ATMs last year. Then multiply it by five. Macau&apos;s casinos \u2013 the Venetian, MGM Grand, Wynn, Sands, Lisboa, and many, many more \u2013 skim around 2.5% from punters, giving them net revenues in February alone of HK$19.9bn (\u00a31.6bn). The enormous Galaxy, Hilton, Sheraton and Shangri-la hotels and casinos are still under construction on Macau&apos;s new strip, yet the city is already raking in five times more money than Vegas. &quot;Macau is not the Las Vegas of the East \u2013 Las Vegas is the Macau of the West,&quot; says veteran casino expert Justin Casey of consultants APG. Yet seven years ago there was just one casino on the peninsula. It&apos;s lunchtime on a Tuesday in February, and the skies above the former Portuguese colony are a smoggy grey. The sea is a dirty brown, carrying the effluent of the thousands of factories further up the Pearl River, the world&apos;s greatest concentration of industry. But already the Venetian is half-full with visitors streaming over the border with mainland China. The casino, three times the size of its sister complex in Vegas, cost \u00a32bn to build, and as we walk through acres of baccarat tables, the hospitality manager (he looks after 3,000 bedrooms) tells me the floorspace could accommodate 100 jumbo jets. By the end of the day \u2013 a quiet one for the complex \u2013 more than 65,000 punters have come through the doors. When Deng Xiaoping began the post-Mao economic reforms in China, he didn&apos;t anticipate this. The country&apos;s industrial revolution has spawned literally millions of millionaires. While the factory workers are bussed into the smoke-filled Lisboa (think Brighton Pier, if it stretched to France), the factory owners are helicoptered into the VIP suites. 70% of the money wagered on Macau&apos;s tables comes from the wallets of the Chinese super-rich. But Chinese law forbids its citizens from taking more than 20,000 renminbi (\u00a31,800) over the border. So Macau&apos;s billions rest on a very Chinese solution to capital controls. On the mainland, wealthy punters deposit their money in what are called &quot;junkets,&quot; organisations widely believed to be controlled by triad gangs. Once in Macau, the junkets dispense the money back to individuals, and extend credit, often two to three times the amount originally deposited with them. They bring the VIPs to the casinos, and are paid huge commissions. Back on the mainland, punters who fail to pay up face menacing debt collectors. In each major casino, the junkets have lavish gaming rooms on private floors reserved solely for their VIP punters, prepared to buy a bare minimum of \u00a320,000 in gaming chips. The public are not just roped off, few would even know of the existence of the private rooms. A small army of security guards keeps the public far from view, and hundreds of CCTV cameras observe every move. But Guardian Money obtained access to several of the rooms. In the first \u2013 and this was a Tuesday afternoon \u2013 were around 20 VIPs, mostly male. Every single bet was for a minimum of \u00a31,600. In the evening it would rise to \u00a33,200. A second room was empty. A third junket room had around 40 players, again playing at \u00a31,600 a hand. The thickly-carpeted corridor, the width of a big SUV, stretched hundreds of feet, leading to scores more VIP rooms. Back on the smoke-filled &quot;mass market&quot; floors, the minimum bets are typically \u00a320\u2013 significantly higher than Vegas. But there are no free cocktails or slot machines. There aren&apos;t even smiling faces. Gambling here is a serious business. Why China&apos;s industrious workers, the world&apos;s greatest savers, will squander it all on baccarat remains a mystery even to China experts. &quot;The Chinese believe in luck. They are willing to gamble a big fraction of their net worth,&quot; says gaming analyst Huei Suen Ng of Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia. But she acknowledges that this doesn&apos;t quite explain what is going on. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s just our culture, maybe it&apos;s in our genes,&quot; she says. The other rather less acknowledged factor is money-laundering. The junkets take in Chinese renminbi (which cannot be converted on the world&apos;s money exchanges) while the casinos can pay out in dollars. Some critics believe Macau is a gigantic operation for secreting money away from the eyes of the Chinese state. Suitloads of dollars take the short hop from Macau to Hong Kong, much of it pouring into the city&apos;s white-hot property market. Even bigger sums are believed to head into offshore tax havens. The authorities, for now at least, turn a blind eye. The casinos are a huge cash cow for the Chinese state, too, which levies tax at 39%. If Macau gets out of hand, Beijing can turn it into a desert overnight by refusing internal visas to mainland Chinese. But the casino operators think that unlikely \u2013 as the money might instead switch to Singapore, away from Chinese control, where two new mega-casinos are already close to matching the whole of Vegas in takings. Visitors from America or Europe won&apos;t be flocking to Macau&apos;s polluted shores, and average room rates \u2013 close to \u00a3160 a night \u2013 would in any case deter them. It is a uniquely Chinese place, with hangar-like casinos encircled by Gucci and Louis Vuitton shops. Vegas-style entertainment is thin on the ground, swimming pools are unused, and nightclubs rare. The average Chinese visitor spends 1.6 days in Macau, and uses the time to gamble non-stop. Prostitution is legal, though pimping is not. The daily parade of sex workers in a mall below the Lisboa dubbed &quot;the Race Track&quot; draws organised tour groups with cameras, rather than many real punters. The Venetian&apos;s gondoliers in the miles of fake canals sing Volare, and our chanteuse had even sung in the Sydney Opera House, but makes better money in Macau. A water fountain show in front of the five-star Wynn evokes Vegas, but the backdrop of Chinese casino architecture is so extraordinarily vulgar it makes Vegas look almost charming. But Brits can make money from the tables of Macau without going anywhere near China.

In its first set of full-year results since the $35.5bn (\u00a321bn) bid fell apart, Britain&apos;s biggest insurer unveiled a pre-tax profit of \u00a32.1bn for 2010. Operating profits beat City expectations with a 24% rise to \u00a31.9bn, against forecasts of \u00a31.7bn. This prompted the company to pledge more generous dividends in coming years - and increase its 2010 payout to 23.85p a share, well above the 21p expected in the City. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: &quot;This expression of future confidence in prospects should help to mollify shareholders upset by the distraction of the failed AIA approach last year.&quot; However, there are questions whether a potential multimillion pound bonus for chief executive Tidjane Thiam could reopen the rift. Shares in Prudential were the top riser on the FTSE 100 index, jumping 4.6% to 746.5, up 32.5p. They fell sharply last June when the bid for AIG&apos;s Asian business collapsed, after shareholders balked at the price tag. The bungled bid left Prudential with a \u00a3377m bill but Thiam and chairman Harvey McGrath firmly resisted calls from angry investors to quit. Chastened by the experience, the management has has sworn off big acquisitions and is desperate to restore shareholder faith in the company by focusing on cash generation and ambitious profit targets. The insurer has invested heavily in the rapidly growing markets of south east Asia, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, along with Hong Kong and Singapore, and hopes to double Asian operating profits by 2013 from 2009&apos;s \u00a3465m figure. Shareholder Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management said the results &quot;vindicate last year&apos;s shareholder revolt against the AIA acquisition. Had that gone through, they would have been diluted&quot;. He added: &quot;I&apos;m not saying all is forgiven, but some credit must go to the management for keeping the company on course and for the company to benefit from the improvement in the global economy.&quot; Asked whether the criticism from investors had died down, Thiam said: &quot;We believe the majority of shareholders are focused on the performance of the company ... We need to move on and run the company in the interest of shareholders.&quot; He pointed out that the Jackson business in the US made more profit last year than the whole of the Pru in 2006. He refused to comment on whether the company would face another shareholder revolt if it paid him a hefty bonus. The company publishes its annual report with details on executive pay on 13 April. &quot;If he does get a multimillion pound bonus, it&apos;s probably more acceptable than the bankers getting one when some of the banks produced poorish results,&quot; said Mumford. He thought that Thiam and McGrath were &quot;safe up to a point&quot;. Thiam said the Pru was committed to its London base, citing its time zone advantage and open job market, amid fresh rumours that banks such as HSBC could be on the move. He also reiterated that the insurer had no plans for a separate listing of its Asian business, which powered 24% ahead to make profits of \u00a31.9bn last year. &quot;The current structure of the group works really well,&quot; he said. Overall new business sales were also better than expected, rising 23% to \u00a33.5bn.&quot;At first glance these figures look very strong,&quot; said Oriel Securities analyst Marcus Barnard.

Not surprisingly, at a time spending on all public services is being cut. But elsewhere, notably Asia and the Middle East, military spending and arms acquisitions are booming, observes a leading security thinktank. Something potentially very significant is happening. &quot;There is persuasive evidence that a global redistribution of military power is under way&quot;, John Chipman, director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said at the launch of the latest annual edition of The Military Balance on Tuesday. The British government&apos;s so-called &quot;Strategic Defence and Security Review&quot; last autumn &quot;indicated the hard times facing most western defence ministries and armed forces&quot;, added Chipman. It led to cuts in Britain&apos;s defence capability including its ability to contribute to future expeditionary operations beyond Europe. While ministers, notably Liam Fox, the defence secretary, was at pains to describe the SDSR as the result of a considered debate about the UK&apos;s security needs, the IISS reflected widespread scepticism about such claims. &quot;The SDSR was essentially a budget-cutting exercise which degenerated into inter-service rivalry as each of the three military branches lobbied the prime minister and the Treasury in support of what they claimed were vital capacities&quot;, it said. More of this soon - despite the cost-cutting defence review, and the loss of the carrier, Ark Royal, and its jump jet Harriers, four of the navy&apos;s frigates, and the scrapped Nimrod maritime reconnaissance aircraft, ministers and defence officials are desperately scratching around to find at least another \u00a31bn cut in the defence budget before April 1. Chipman raised another point. &quot;Faced with contracting domestic order-books, military exports to other regions are more important than ever for US and European defence companies&quot;, he said, noting that the companies are at the same time facing growing competition from &quot;non-western defence industries, notably those of Brazil, China, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea&quot;. After his trademark blaming Labour for the cuts - &quot;you can&apos;t be secure, if you&apos;re broke&quot;, he said - Liam Fox seized on the warning about the distribution of military power at an IISS reception in London on Tuesday evening. In a speech to the thinktank Civitas last month, Fox dwelt on the need for Britain to increase its exports of arms and weapons systems. As he put it: &quot;The MoD can be at the forefront of the government export led growth strategy.&quot; The most comprehensive data on arms sales and the weapons trade are published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, which is expected soon to confirm the trends highlighted this week by the IISS."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/mar/12/blue-mountains-australia-nsw-sydney", "sentences": ["\u2022 Qantas (qantas.com) flies from London Heathrow to Sydney via Singapore, from \u00a3820 return."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-12T00:05:15Z", "title": "Wild blue yonder: Australia's Blue Mountains", "tags": ["Australia holidays", "Sydney holidays", "Wildlife holidays", "Travel"], "article": "I&apos;m sitting on the pea-green seats of the train, gazing out into a world fast vanishing beneath a gauzy, shimmery mist. As we climb two hours west from Central Station, Sydney, the mist cloaks the vast plateaus, it snakes through the dark forests and curls around the clifftops and canyons that comprise the Blue Mountains. I&apos;m in search of the peace and quiet that attracts Sydneysiders year round to the one million hectares of New South Wales that are named after the blue haze of the eucalyptus oils. As the angry sky darkens and rain thunders down, I confess to feeling slightly fearful, as well as excited, at the prospect of staying alone in a secret eco cottage with acres between myself and the nearest human being. I step out into Katoomba, the tourist hub of the Blue Mountains (with soggy tourists aplenty today), and it&apos;s as if I&apos;ve stepped into some wonderland at the top of the Magic Faraway Tree. Even the facades of the dinky buildings are shrouded in mist. I shelter in a quaint little cake shop, and even it \u2013 and the chocolate fondant I scoff \u2013 are like something from a fairytale land. &quot;You read out the directions and I&apos;ll follow them,&quot; says the taxi driver I hail. &quot;&apos;Please Note: There are no signs for the Woolshed Cabins until you actually arrive,&apos;&quot; I bellow. &quot;DO NOT TURN OFF INTO MEGALONG VALLEY!&quot; scream the instructions. Whoops. Too late. But I&apos;d advise anyone to do their best to get lost in the Blue Mountains. The mist clears to reveal the awesome landscape: vast, rugged cliffs, ferns, tall gum trees. Soon we get back on the muddy track. &quot;Pass the Logan Brae Apple Orchard,&quot; I read out. Squelch, squelch, down the dirt track into the Kanimbla Valley ... bump, bump, bump over the cattle grid tar road \u2026 and then we see it. The cottage stands beside a wooden shearing shed isolated amidst acres of countryside. Marion the owner and I sip hot sweet tea on the verandah and she tells me about the mountains, before showing me round the property. In the lounge, the huge windows let in views of the afternoon light leaking over the chalky cliffs. In the loft bedroom, the triangular windows show distant forests. &quot;Don&apos;t go near the fences \u2013 they&apos;re electric. And don&apos;t walk in the fields over there,&quot; says Marion, pointing to the grass, which reaches taller than both of us, &quot;as you might not come out again. Snakes!&quot; Indeed, this area has some of the most lethal snakes in Oz. The information booklet in the cottage provides further warnings: &quot;Not all horses are approachable and cattle are definitely NOT &apos;pattable&apos;.&quot; As she leaves me, I almost run after her and beg her to stay, or to take me with her. But soon, I relax and discover what solitude in nature is all about. Horses whinny and chomp in the fields. Peewees sing. Great yellow butterflies flutter past. I walk west from the cottage with the long wet grass tickling my legs, past tall gum trees and along the creek paddock, keeping an eye out for wallabies and kangaroos and wombat holes \u2013 and snakes! As I walk towards the blue hills of Oberon and the Jenolan Caves, I feel quite tiny. The sun begins to set, silhouetting the trees, night-time encroaches over the cliffs until the sky is on fire, although I spin round and it&apos;s still broad daylight behind me. It&apos;s little wonder that the Blue Mountains are a favourite haunt of artists. Back in the cottage I stick on one of the cottage&apos;s CDs, the multi-volume Complete Classics, and delve into the basket of goodies left for me. The kitchen has a slab timber bench and Australian hardwoods, and soon I have sausages sizzling on the stove. In the airy loft bedroom, I fall asleep to the rain pattering against the windows, the horses whinnying outside.     Straw Bale House, Old Leura Dairy    The Blue Mountains area is full of little villages and I move on next to Leura, a scenic 15-minute drive away. It&apos;s hard to believe that the Old Leura Dairy Old Leura Dairy (+61 2 4782 0700, oldleuradairy.com) was once a dilapidated ruin, for now its six lodgings \u2013 Moo Manor, Buttercup Barn, the Studio, the 1920s Worker&apos;s Cottage, the Milking Shed, and cavernous Straw Bale House, where I am staying \u2013 are gloriously restored in line with the philosophy to be &quot;as gentle on our world as possible&quot;. The houses are still luxurious, despite being built from recycled materials and hand-painted tiles, with decor reminiscent of a giant doll&apos;s house, full of treasures procured from auctions: a wooden rocking horse, old typewriters, a beautiful statue of mother and child. The owner is an art collector, which has made its mark in the paintings adorning the walls. I relax on the rocking chair, then bathe in the claw-foot bath. A peek inside the guestbook offers clues as to who would stay in such a magical place: mothers escaping from husbands and children; couples seeking a romantic retreat; and the odd solitary soul desirous of time, space and beauty. But after a few days of relaxation in my private retreats, I want to explore the nooks and crannies of the Blue Mountains. An obvious place to start is Katoomba, the crowded gateway town to the area, and the region&apos;s most visited destination, which has cafes and bars, and adventure operators offering to arrange trips into the bush. Nature spotting bush walks, horse-riding adventures, walking along the famous Six Foot Track footpath to caves and Megalong Valley, a ride on the steep scenic railway and the Skyway cable car can all be arranged here. Over a bite to eat, though, in the art deco Cafe Zuppa, I flick through a brochure and I spot a picture of Blackheath, a smaller village 20 minutes&apos; drive away, so named because of its wild, open-heath scenery, often charred by bushfires, but blooming with rhododendrons in spring. It&apos;s peace and quiet I yearn for, after all, so I set off in search of it. En route the driver points out some lovely places to stay: the Possums Hideaway nestled within gardens, Redleaf Resort, and Bower Cottage, with a blue bird on its sign. I ask him to stop so I can take a peek, and crunch up the gravelly path to a yellow facade. It&apos;s love at first sight. I have found it \u2013 the cottage of my dreams!     Bower Cottage    Its location, on Evans Lookout Road, was perfect too: not far from one of the most stunning viewpoints of the Mountains, Evans Lookout, and after apple juice in the Bush Rock Cafe, I gave my new trainers a run for their money, jogging along the narrow, deserted pathways to the viewpoint. Even in this place of solitude, I eventually run into a group of tourists, peering through binoculars at the trio of Aborigine maidens turned to stone by a sorcerer, as myth has it. These Three Sisters, viewed from Echo Point near Katoomba, are one of the most popular attractions of the mountains. When I must leave the cottage, I return to Katoomba, but find my own peaceful corner among the tall colonnades, library, drawing room, piano bar with a piano tinkling away as if just for me, of the heritage building, the Carrington Hotel. There, I am tempted into the Yindi Day Spa, and opt for the cheapest thing on offer \u2013 a half-hour head massage. Then I am back on the pea-green seats of the train chugging down through the beautiful mists and into the bright hot heart of Sydney. I take with me a little more space in my head \u2013 and that&apos;s the secret of why you would stay alone in a cottage in the wilderness of Australia. \u2022 Qantas (qantas.com) flies from London Heathrow to Sydney via Singapore, from \u00a3820 return.

Garai plays Sugar, a Victorian prostitute who becomes a wealthy man&apos;s mistress and is eventually introduced into his suburban household. &quot;I read a lot, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever read a character so absolutely conjured as Sugar,&quot; says Garai. &quot;I wanted to portray her to the best of my ability and very respectfully. She is so complex, full of paradox. She is also very damaged.&quot; The Crimson Petal director Marc Munden \u2013 whose work includes The Devil&apos;s Whore and The Mark of Cain \u2013 says that Sugar&apos;s opaqueness would have made it difficult for audiences to engage with her if weren&apos;t for Garai&apos;s skill as an actress. &quot;Romola has such intelligence and lively thought going on behind her eyes that she keeps us compelled and seduced, despite Sugar giving little away. She is a great technical actress who also understood instinctively Sugar&apos;s guile, her status, her damage.&quot; Playwright Lucinda Coxon adapted the book for the small screen, which pleased Garai. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of sex and nudity involved so it was important for me to know that the person making the piece was going to talk about prostitution in a serious and responsible way, because that doesn&apos;t often happen.&quot;     As Sugar in The Crimson Petal and the White. Photograph: BBC/Origin Pictures    This aspect was also important to Munden. &quot;The Crimson Petal is also about the mechanics of prostitution,&quot; he says. &quot;The base things Sugar puts her body through \u2013 the douching, the use of abortifacients, her painful skin condition. Romola was determined that we were unflinching in our depiction of that.&quot; Garai&apos;s other big role this year is also in a BBC drama, The Hour, and it is also realised by a woman \u2013 Abi Morgan, who created Sex Traffic and adapted Brick Lane for the big screen. The Hour is set against the backdrop of the 1956 Suez Crisis and follows the launch of a current-affairs TV programme. Though Garai was intrigued by the period, and by parallels with the current political situations in both Iraq and Egypt, she was drawn to her role as a TV producer because it was the chance to show another side of the era. &quot;I have mixed feelings about the 50s nostalgia at the moment, especially in terms of women and fashion. I think Mad Men is an amazing show, but there&apos;s another side to it. Postwar Europe was morally stagnant and there was a lot of neo-conservatism. There was an underside to that period, especially in terms of gender politics, which I think was much more interesting.&quot; As you may have noticed, Garai does not make light of things. Ask her an anodyne question about any role she&apos;s played and chances are you&apos;ll find yourself nodding along to her thoughts on sex equality and sociology. She admits that she finds it impossible not to think about the impact of her work and the repercussions of her choices. &quot;I can only do something that my sister or my daughter, if I have one, could watch and feel positive about. That rules a lot out. I think one of the reasons I&apos;ve done so much period work is because I feel so depressed by how society chooses to represent women in contemporary work. I mean, I&apos;m sure I have a total persecution complex and I do it more than I have to, but I definitely think about it.&quot; Not that Garai is po-faced: she laughs at herself when she mentions her persecution complex and it&apos;s best to imagine that everything she says comes with a big, good-natured beam. She really wanted to make her other upcoming role a complete &quot;comedy bitch&quot;, despite her thoughts on the typical representation of women on screen. The bitch in question is Sylvie, a character in One Day which is one of the most anticipated films of 2011. Adapted from David Nicholl&apos;s bestselling book, the film follows the romance between Dexter and Em on the same day each year for two decades. Sylvie is Dexter&apos;s wife. &quot;I thought there&apos;d be a lot of fun in making her a total bitch, but [director] Lone Scherfig doesn&apos;t work in those sorts of stereotypes. The character was quite a departure for me and it was great to do comedy, I&apos;ve never done anything like it before. If the filming experience is anything to go by, that film will have a lovely warmth.&quot;     As Briony Tallis in Atonement. Photograph: Rex Features    When all three projects are finished, Garai is off on holiday and says that she&apos;s not sure what she&apos;s doing when she gets back. Nothing is confirmed. I wonder if it&apos;s hard to come home with nothing definite to return to and she looks baffled. &quot;That has never occurred to me. Even if I&apos;m not working, I&apos;ve got to take my nephews to the park, play tennis. I&apos;m a real culture vulture \u2013 I go to the theatre, exhibitions, sometimes when I&apos;m working I feel exhausted keeping up with it all. My life is full of things without work.&quot; Precisely what most of those things are we&apos;ll never know, as Garai has made it a policy not to talk about her private life. She was born in Hong Kong and lived there and in Singapore with her banker father and her mother \u2013 who was a journalist before Garai and her three siblings came along \u2013 until the age of eight, when her family moved to Wiltshire. Her name is simply the female version of Romulus rather than a reference to the George Eliot novel. Her siblings are Ralph, Rosie and Roxy. The surname Garai is Hungarian. Her great-grandfather was Bert Garai, who founded the Keystone Press Agency in 1924. Other than the potted family history there&apos;s little else. &quot;I&apos;m not very strategic,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m a motormouth, so if I talked about my private life you&apos;d be here all afternoon and I&apos;d still be talking. The only way to deal with it is not to say anything at all. There&apos;s a boundary that I&apos;ve set and I don&apos;t break it.&quot; She&apos;s happy to talk about the fact that she recently graduated from the Open University with a first in English Literature, though. She should be happy, it&apos;s no mean feat for someone with such an erratic work schedule. It took four years for her to complete. &quot;I wanted a degree. It&apos;s a terrible thing to admit, but sometimes I felt like just an actor. I&apos;m a snob and I wanted a degree. I didn&apos;t want to feel like someone&apos;s slightly dumb girlfriend when I was at a dinner party with writers.&quot; She says a natural lack of interest in the showbiz events and red carpets that come with her job has made it easy to maintain her privacy. She finds those parties complicated because people attend them for strategic reasons. &quot;I have a fear of appearing frivolous which exerts a strong, controlling influence on me; but also, on a surface level, I just don&apos;t enjoy those parties. I was talking to an actor friend and he asked if I was going to one, he said it would be fun. I thought, if I look like total crap, will it matter? Can I get really drunk and dance like mad and talk to random strangers about bullshit and not worry about it the next day? The answer to all those questions is no; so, in my opinion, not so much fun.&quot; Garai doesn&apos;t offer to paint the town with me when we finish talking, but she does give me a lift home, which is miles out of her way and very nice of her. Unsurprisingly, we don&apos;t talk about boys and shopping in the car. Instead we discuss the peculiar artifice of interviews. We get close to boys when we talk about journalists and actors who&apos;ve hooked up, but that&apos;s it. Garai really would rather discuss ego and the importance of saying something significant. In a world far more interested in shopping than politics and in boys rather than gender politics, that can only be a very good thing.

Cuts are all very well, but the coalition needs a growth agenda to show it can make Britain&apos;s recession-blighted economy bloom again. Government insiders were alarmed by news that GDP contracted by 0.6% in the final three months of last year, even before the steepest budget cuts in a generation started to bite. Unrest in the Middle East has dealt another blow to the prospects of a spring bounce for the economy, creating what environment minister Chris Huhne has called a 1970s-style oil shock, squeezing firms and consumers hard. Ministers have been hauled before Osborne, business secretary Vince Cable and David Cameron&apos;s blue-skies thinker Oliver Letwin to explain what they can do to kick-start economic growth, in a process Cable says has been as rigorous as last year&apos;s eye-watering spending review. The results, to be published alongside the budget in a &quot;growth review&quot;, must bear fruit quickly if the coalition is not to lose the public&apos;s trust in its ability to manage the economy. Unemployment has been rising, yet the government wants the private sector to pick up many of the thousands of workers who will be laid off from the public sector in the coming months. But surveys suggest that most firms are still too nervous about fragile demand to start hiring. CBI boss John Cridland has called for an &quot;all-action&quot; budget on 23 March to put the recovery on a secure footing: &quot;I think they should focus on what I call the &apos;squeezed middle of companies&apos;: those are the businesses that create jobs.&quot; The CBI is calling for the government to help create a new bond market, aimed at financing these middle-sized firms. &quot;We have lots of short- and medium-term capital that&apos;s expecting a quick turnaround; but if these businesses are going to export to China, India, Brazil, they need the chance and the space.&quot; Some of businesses&apos; demands will be wearyingly familiar to Whitehall officials scrambling to finalise Osborne&apos;s &quot;budget for growth&quot; \u2013 cut red tape, reduce the tax burden, cancel the rise in petrol duty \u2013 but many make more unusual suggestions. The Observer asked a selection of entrepreneurs, chief executives and business lobbying groups to come up with more imaginative \u2013 and less well-worn \u2013 plans for restoring Britain&apos;s economy to health. SIR JAMES DYSON Inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner It&apos;s time to invest in hi-tech Britain, supporting start-ups with potential but few means to realise it. This will sustain, and ultimately grow, Britain&apos;s export capability. Each year tens of thousands of ideas and inventions are developed here. Too few are transformed into commercial success. R&amp;D is inherently risky, but we have to think long-term. George Osborne has to make it easier for start-ups to access capital. An enhanced R&amp;D tax credit will encourage more companies to undertake the risk of inventing in the first place, and in turn ensure a flow of exportable technology to narrow the trade abyss. Singapore&apos;s stands at 250%. The government should raise ours to 200%. WILLIAM CHASE Founder of Tyrrells crisps, now boss of vodka exporter Chase Distillery  The first thing they could do is to help all those who are exporting: give them breaks on their tax or national insurance \u2013 different ways to help them. We need to get aggressive and get all our businesses exporting. I did it, and it was really hard. It&apos;s painful to start with. The government should put some money in so firms can get the advice they need. but there&apos;s nobody in government with any commercial business sense. LEE HOPLEY Chief economist at manufacturers&apos; group EEF We need changes to the capital allowances regime. Manufacturers, even small ones, are mobile. They are already reliant on overseas consumers and the question for them is: do they serve those customers from the UK, or do they go elsewhere? It&apos;s things like a strategic approach to environmental taxes. At the moment there&apos;s a climate change levy on heavy energy users, carbon reduction targets, and an EU emissions trading scheme. In addition, the government recently said it wants to put a floor under the carbon price. There&apos;s different things going on in different parts of government. It&apos;s about certainty, and also about having a sense of what the overall cost will be. IAN LIVINGSTON Chief executive, BT Everyone will be lobbying the chancellor to spend money that isn&apos;t available. However, our fiscal stability can&apos;t be put at risk. BT is putting \u00a32.5bn into a superfast broadband programme. The government should consider ways to stimulate more infrastructure investment. A one- or two-year boost to capital allowances would encourage companies to invest now rather than later, and would not cost the government anything over the long term. Removing obstacles to investment is also important. We have certainly found local planning delays to be one of those obstacles. The government could help by issuing supportive planning policy guidance for projects that have synergy with national policy aspirations. Finally, investment is also about skills. Apprentice programmes are important and I really support the government&apos;s drive to increase take-up and investment in them by firms of all sizes. ANDREW CAVE Chief spokesman, Federation of Small Businesses  There&apos;s a clear need to incentivise job creation. For the smallest businesses, we would like to see a national insurance holiday for the next two people they take on. This is a policy designed for the returning-to-growth period. It&apos;s a very aspirational thing. The average business in the UK has four people; in the US it&apos;s six. We are also calling for an increase in the minimum wage for apprentices (currently \u00a32.50 for under-19s, and anyone in the first year of their training). We&apos;re very supportive of the government&apos;s drive to create more apprenticeships, but to make that realistic we need to remove the red tape around taking on an apprentice and also give more value to the apprentices themselves. MARK PRICE Managing director, Waitrose We&apos;re going to see a surplus of young people trying to get into the workplace and there needs to be some imaginative thinking on how to give them better skills and experience. At Waitrose we&apos;re developing a scheme to get 16-to-18-year-olds in for a month or two months&apos; experience. The &quot;big society&quot; concept aims to involve business in supporting the broader community and the government should work with companies to make these approaches easier. I&apos;m also keen on the development of philanthropy. The government might want to think about encouraging people to be more philanthropic by offering US-style tax breaks for donations to charity. LARA MORGAN Founder of hotel toiletries supplier Pacific Direct The government is making gestures towards supporting private sector growth. Unfortunately, much more needs to be done. The chancellor should call a halt to legislation targeting heavier taxes on &quot;non-dom&quot; individuals based in Britain but domiciled elsewhere. This forms a barrier to international entrepreneurs. And we need a central platform where everything about enterprise can be gathered so that people don&apos;t have to search all over the internet to find the support they need to build businesses. TIM MARTIN Founder, JD Wetherspoon pub chain Pubs are a high-employment way of generating a pint of bitter for the customer. If you buy your drinks at the supermarket, it&apos;s cheaper because it&apos;s creating fewer jobs. We&apos;re in danger of moving to an economy where people do their own hair, mend their own cars and don&apos;t go out \u2013 that means high unemployment. To generate a huge number of jobs, the government should cut VAT for restaurants and the catering industry to 5%, as they have done in France. And there should be a five-year moratorium on any extra regulations that might increase the cost of doing business. That includes any increase in leave for maternity, paternity, eternity, fraternity \u2013 anything with an &quot;ity&quot; on the end."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/mar/15/academy-status-state-schools", "sentences": ["Among its other work is school improvement in Lambeth, south London, Ofsted inspections, school support in Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Brunei and running a for-profit firm running English language and teacher training in India."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-15T08:00:01Z", "title": "Is academy status being foisted on schools?", "tags": ["Academies", "Primary schools", "Secondary schools", "Schools", "Education", "Education policy", "Politics"], "article": "It makes an unlikely setting for a passionate outburst of frustration at the &quot;big society&quot;, the alleged privatisation of state education and claims of a deficit in democratic accountability. But the front room of a terraced house in Louth, Lincolnshire, seems central to that argument now, as members of a &quot;Save our Schools&quot; group discuss proposals \u2013 some of them not yet public \u2013 that raise the possibility of the bulk of the county&apos;s schools leaving the local authority to become academies. The four members of the group discussing the plans, who are all parents with children aged between three and 14, are incensed about the possibility of this happening at both primary and secondary level. It is the primary element that seems the more intensely contentious. The controversy raises questions about public and private interests in state education, and the extent to which communities have the right to influence decisions being made about the future of state schools, as institutions across England are encouraged to consider academy status. The group has discussed a letter, which has been seen by Education Guardian, sent last month to all primary heads and chairs of governors in Lincolnshire, setting out proposals for their schools to leave the authority and become academies. This is proposed to happen under an organisation with an aim, its annual accounts for 2010 say, to become &quot;a significant provider of state-funded schooling&quot; by 2012. The letter was sent by Andy Breckon, a director of not-for-profit body CfBT, which has been running outsourced school improvement services for Lincolnshire since 2002. Breckon is therefore also head of school improvement for Lincolnshire. Under the headings &quot;Lincolnshire School Improvement Services&quot; and &quot;CfBT Education Trust&quot;, the letter invited recipients to a meeting on 3 March to discuss an &quot;emerging proposal for Lincolnshire schools to join the CfBT Schools&apos; Trust&quot;. The letter says the plan would enable schools to become academies as part of the trust, thus achieving higher levels of funding &quot;within a supportive collegiate structure&quot;. Schools, it says, would pay a membership fee to CfBT, which would not be &quot;anywhere near the funding levels currently top-sliced by local authorities, and therefore all schools will be in a stronger financial position than at present&quot;. The letter adds: &quot;This proposal has the support of senior councillors at Lincolnshire County Council.&quot; The parents&apos; group was astounded, as the county council had not said anything officially about whether schools should move to academy status since last June, when a letter to schools from Peter Duxbury, director of children&apos;s services, set out a string of risks. Sarah Dodds, the founder of Louth Save our Schools, says the letter suggests a private organisation using its close links to the county council to push its own agenda, without any general public discussion. Dodds, a mother of four and part-time primary school supply teacher, says: &quot;Mr Breckon claims that the proposal has the support of &apos;senior councillors&apos; within the council. However, my source at the council is 100% sure it has not been sanctioned in a council meeting. &quot;The fact that a firm can offer school improvement services to a local authority while simultaneously touting them to become academies must be a moral conflict of interest at best. &quot;And how could CfBT seriously provide future impartial school improvement services to schools who resist the temptation and stay within the local authority?&quot; To academy critics, such as the Anti Academies Alliance, the case illustrates the problems that could develop across the country as England&apos;s tradition of local authority organisation of schools could give way to a future in which private bodies, each with their own objectives, can have greater influence. The Save our Schools group, which has accrued 150 members since Dodds set it up six weeks ago, believes the move amounts to a potential backdoor privatisation of primary schools in the county. Although it is up to individual school governing bodies to decide whether to go with the plan, the group says that institutions, worried about tight budgets, are being influenced towards it by CfBT. Charlotte Hopkinson, another Louth parent, says: &quot;What is being proposed for primary schools is just terrifying. Not many people know that this meeting [for the heads and chairs of governors, attended by around 100 people, according to the council] even happened.&quot; The lack of public discussion of the plans angers the parents most. Under last year&apos;s Academies Act, governors have to consult on their plans, following a concession by ministers to opponents. However, governing bodies are still allowed to leave community consultation until after an application for academy status \u2013 and decision by ministers \u2013 has been made. Academies are only required to have one parent on their governing bodies. Hopkinson says: &quot;Everything is hidden. You get the impression the attitude is: &apos;we are not going to tell you till we have made our decision&apos;.&quot; Zoe Bunting, who has a daughter in year 5 at a Louth primary, says: &quot;How can anyone talk about the big society when schools are being taken out of community hands in order to privatise them?&quot; The primary schools themselves seem reluctant to discuss the letter or any academy plans. Education Guardian approached 10 Lincolnshire primary heads at random last week. Two offered a message of &quot;no comment&quot; without coming to the telephone. The other eight did not return messages. John Hough, a Labour county councillor within this Conservative-led authority and vice-chairman of the council&apos;s children and young people&apos;s scrutiny committee, says: &quot;What is the county council&apos;s position? It is not clear. &quot;CfBT are effectively suggesting that if schools do not sign up, they are almost not going to be able to continue. That&apos;s the way heads are interpreting it. This should be subject to proper process and go through proper public scrutiny.&quot; Although the group has only 150 members, there is a tradition of standing up to large organisations in this market town in the Lincolnshire Wolds, with a &quot;Keep Louth Special&quot; campaign having resisted large superstores in the town centre. CfBT, formerly the Centre for British Teachers, is based in Reading, and had an income in the year to April 2010 of \u00a3151m, employing 2,400 people worldwide, according to its Charity Commission accounts. It lists its principal objective as to &quot;advance education for the public benefit&quot;. It used to run the national literacy and primary strategies for the Labour government. It runs seven private schools, and academies in Merton, south London, and Oxford. Among its other work is school improvement in Lambeth, south London, Ofsted inspections, school support in Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Brunei and running a for-profit firm running English language and teacher training in India. CfBT&apos;s annual accounts for the year to March 2010 say that the UK environment in which it operates is &quot;currently very difficult&quot;, in the light of government cuts. It adds: &quot;Our aims are to be a significant provider of state-funded schools, and consolidate our position in fee-funded independent schooling,&quot; among others, while also &quot;responding to opportunities to participate in the management of US charter schools and UK free schools&quot;. The plans for secondaries in the Louth area, which prompted the group&apos;s formation, are unusual. In January, four schools and a further education college announced proposals to consider options including merging to become one academy. There is no suggestion, as yet, of private sponsorship and no link with CfBT. Among the reasons for the discussions are falling rolls and worries among secondaries, in this county of grammar schools, that the government could force them to become academies anyway because of poor results. Figures from Hough suggest that 25 secondaries in Lincolnshire are either already academies or considering conversion, while 43 have yet to declare any plan to move towards academy status. So far, nationally, 467 academies were open at the start of March. Numbers will grow dramatically. A poll published on Saturday said nearly half of England&apos;s secondaries were now either planning to become academies, or already had the status. Sally Lockren, the National Union of Teachers representative at one of the secondary schools considering the academy move, says: &quot;I always thought the [traditional] state system would keep going in the county because primary schools are not going to leave the authority. &quot;Now it looks like we are looking at the end of state education in Lincolnshire.&quot; Lincolnshire County Council responds to a request for comment with a document on notepaper headed &quot;Lincolnshire School Improvement Services/CfBT Education Trust&quot;. It will not say whether the CfBT proposal has been formally discussed in council. It adds that it is for school governors, rather than the council, to decide on academy status. Two senior councillors \u2013 the leader, Martin Hill, and the portfolio-holder for children&apos;s services, Patricia Bradwell \u2013 support the CfBT proposals, it says, but the council&apos;s position has not changed since Duxbury&apos;s letter last year. It adds: &quot;Over the last few years, a number of proposals have been made that CfBT should sponsor an academy, and CfBT and the county council considered that this was a conflict of interest. &quot;However, after the Academies Act 2010 came into existence, where schools themselves were able to choose to become an academy, a number of schools approached CfBT and asked if they could join the CfBT Trust. CfBT does not believe there is a conflict of interest as it is school governors making the decisions, and CfBT is just one of a range of options.&quot; The council added that no primary school had yet decided to join the trust. CfBT itself is not allowed to comment, under the terms of its school improvement contract, it says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/mar/17/health-privatisation-plans-professor-ian-kirkpatrick", "sentences": ["Concerns have also been raised about the annonymity of patient records as these are shared with private companies in remote locations such as India or Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-17T22:00:07Z", "title": "The private sector is drooling over health privatisation plans | Ian Kirkpatrick", "tags": ["Health policy", "NHS", "Health", "Privatisation", "Healthcare industry", "Economic policy", "Capita", "Society", "Politics", "Business"], "article": "The government&apos;s plans to outsource more NHS services have left many in the public sector with a bitter taste in their mouth and the private sector positively drooling. In the coming years, an array of health services is likely to be outsourced despite little evidence that it would improve efficiency and make savings. This will see a push to further privatise clinical services such as radiology and pathology \u2013 the latter worth \u00a32.5bn per year. The government has recently been in talks about privatising part of the NHS blood service to make it more &quot;commercially effective&quot;. Even NHS Direct is in the firing line with Capita \u2013 a company reported to the Office of Fair Trading two years ago for allegedly overcharging schools by \u00a375m for IT contracts \u2013 lined up to manage the contract, according to reports. Major off-shoring is also on the agenda. John Neilson, head of NHS Shared Business Services, said recently that the NHS should outsource the administration of procurement to call centres in India to save \u00a320bn over the next four years. For private companies eyeing a slice of the NHS pie, it gets better: NHS Trusts may ultimately come under private ownership with many of the services they manage also outsourced. Areas such as estates management, worth about \u00a37bn per year, and back-office functions such as HR and IT are also prime targets to be transferred to private owners. Outsourcing of public sector services is nothing new. New Labour are as guilty as the current government. But the push to privatise a much wider range of services has accelerated and is set to move into top gear. How much might be up for grabs? In terms of the total hospital service annual budget, I would estimate up to \u00a312bn per year could be contracted out. It may be that outsourcing on this scale will yield efficiency benefits, with the potential for delivering economies of scale through shared services using call centres and common technology platforms. But the signs are there that wholesale privatisation will cost in different ways. In 2008, the Office for Public Management&apos;s (OPM) report &quot;Driven by Dogma&quot; found that outsourcing was &quot;primarily driven by political will rather than evidence-based practice&quot;. The report struggled to uncover conclusive evidence that private involvement in the running of services yielded improved value for money, and in some cases may be a burden to the taxpayer. Transaction costs associated with the specification of services, drawing up contracts, billing, monitoring performance and \u2013 inevitably when things go wrong \u2013 dispute resolution are likely to rise. These costs are already be significant in the NHS: a recent health select committee report estimated those costs to be as high as 14% of total expenditure, in large part because of the rise in transaction costs. And what about the services provided? Many trusts have now brought back services that were previously outsourced, such as catering and cleaning, largely because of concerns associated with their declining quality, and higher infection rates. Concerns have also been raised about the annonymity of patient records as these are shared with private companies in remote locations such as India or Singapore. The drive to outsource first and think later is fundamentally flawed and distasteful. Far from &quot;modernising&quot; the NHS, we \u2013 the public \u2013 may end up with health services that are less accountable, less responsive to the needs of clinicians and patients and, ironically, less efficient.

Gove is in discussions about introducing a new measurement for the league tables that would enable the public to see how many pupils in a school had bypassed GCSEs and gone straight on to A-levels. A Department for Education source is reported in the Times Educational Supplement as stating that England should look to copy Singapore, where about a fifth of pupils take A-levels without having sat GCSEs or their equivalents. &quot;We are considering much greater freedom for schools to accelerate bright kids past GCSEs to do either A-levels or pre-Us [an alternative to A-levels] and introducing league table measures that capture that and reward schools for it, not penalise them,&quot; the source said. &quot;We want a league table system that doesn&apos;t disincentivise schools from doing what they think is in the best interests of the kid.

How many children are going to be bypassing GCSEs in any one school and are they going to be able to mix with their age group or with older children?&quot; Chris Howard, headteacher of Lewis School, Pengam, south Wales, and immediate past president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said GCSEs were an &quot;unnecessary staging post&quot; and that students should just be tested at 18. &quot;Teaching unions have argued for many years that GCSEs have become an ineffective benchmark and a barrier to progress. The general gist of these plans are correct.&quot; He said there may be problems implementing them. &quot;Some schools will wonder how they can get around the fact that some courses are going to be regarded with higher esteem than others, but I think that many will say they can get over that.&quot; Teachers have criticised Gove for assessing pupils&apos; performance according to the proportion who obtain GCSEs in English, maths, a science, a foreign language and a humanity, such as history or geography, at grade C or above. Gove retrospectively introduced what is now known as the English baccalaureate into this year&apos;s league tables."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/19/aerotropolis-kasarda-lindsay-cities-review", "sentences": ["Just as cities such as Southampton or Singapore grew up around their seaports, so the airport will become the heart of tomorrow&apos;s city."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-19T00:05:45Z", "title": "Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next by John D Kasarda and Greg Lindsay \u2013 review", "tags": ["Science and nature", "Future of cities", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "In his dystopian novel The Sleeper Awakes, begun in 1899, HG Wells portrayed a future world in which vast machine-like cities were linked by air travel. Since then, no vision of the urban future has been complete without ubiquitous air transport, from Fritz Lang&apos;s Metropolis (1926), in which gnat-like aircraft soar among the skyscrapers, to the police spinners of Ridley Scott&apos;s Blade Runner (1982). In 1997 JG Ballard predicted that &quot;the airport will be the true city of the 21st century&quot;. Now John Kasarda, an American management consultant and academic, is jetting around the world showing politicians and business leaders how Ballard&apos;s prediction is about to come true. This &quot;prophet of living our lives aloft&quot; has flown more than 3m miles in the last 25 years and has &quot;jet lag stamped on his face&quot;. Journalist Greg Lindsay, the author of this enthusiastic survey of Kasarda&apos;s ideas, is clearly a believer. As the subtitle proclaims, this is &quot;the way we&apos;ll live next&quot;. According to Kasarda, the future city will have &quot;an airport at the center and concentric rings of uses radiating outward&quot;. The aerotropolis is designed for the wired, always-on &quot;Instant Age&quot; of smart phones and smart cities, where the only law is the survival of the swiftest. Kasarda argues that this is the next stage in globalisation, a radical rethink of how we live in a world rendered flat by new technology. Just as cities such as Southampton or Singapore grew up around their seaports, so the airport will become the heart of tomorrow&apos;s city. Dubai is the model. It is &quot;the aerotropolis writ large, a city of hubs designed to lure the world&apos;s wealth to its door&quot;. And as in so many other areas, China has been quick to seize the initiative. It will build 100 new airports by 2020, when it aims to have 82% of its population living within 90 minutes&apos; drive of one. This investment will enable the iPods and other high-value goods manufactured there to travel via Hong Kong to America within 48 hours. In contrast, the west views airports as &quot;nuisances or toxic threats&quot;. Kasarda warns: &quot;If we don&apos;t change our minds, the game will be over. In some ways, we&apos;ve already surrendered.&quot; There is no doubt that transport \u2013 whether on four legs or four wheels \u2013 has shaped cities throughout history. But to be successful, cities have to offer so much more than docks or terminals. In a revealing phrase, Lindsay describes Kasarda&apos;s aerotropolis as &quot;an urban machine not for living but for competition&quot;. HG Wells would have feared for the people who lived in such a place. Kasarda&apos;s overblown rhetoric cries out to be challenged, something Lindsay fails to do. But in its account of the rapidly evolving nature of work \u2013 from high-tech Chinese factories to the computerised fulfilment centres springing up around runways across America \u2013 this pacey but over-long book is at once fascinating and chilling. Lindsay and Kasarda dismiss the idea that air travel should be curtailed due to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as fatal for economic growth. Similarly, fears about peak oil are countered by the prospect of synthetic fuels. If the oil really does stop flowing, then they believe electrification of cars will allow reserves to be prioritised for aircraft. This dramatic option is one that Laurence Smith also raises in his book, The New North (322pp, Profile, \u00a320). But Smith does not minimise the challenges facing our oil-addicted societies. He points out, for instance, that to meet the expected demand for oil in 2030 we would need to discover the equivalent of nine Saudi Arabias. A scientist at UCLA, Smith studies the geophysical impact of climate change, particularly in the far north. In this measured and thoughtful book, he examines what our planet will be like 40 years from now. By 2050, the world&apos;s population will have grown to 9.2 billion, of whom 6.4 billion will live in cities, &quot;forming crowded urban clots around the hot lower latitudes of our planet&quot;. China will be the world&apos;s largest economy, followed by the US and India. People will be wealthier and older \u2013 Japan will have 13 people of working age for every 10 retired people. In 40 years&apos; time global warming will have transformed the planet. Despite technological advances and a growing diversity of energy sources including renewables and nuclear, the world will still rely heavily on fossil fuels. China is currently building two coal-fired power stations a week, &quot;equivalent to adding the entire UK power grid every year&quot;. Shockingly, coal will become the world&apos;s primary energy resource, with demand tripling by 2050. Smith&apos;s headline conclusion is that, as global warming thaws the permafrost and frees the Arctic of sea ice, the &quot;New North&quot; will become increasingly important. Although the Arctic proper (north of the Arctic Circle) is very small, the New North \u2013 the land and ocean lying above the 45\u02da N latitude \u2013 is vast, comprising some 29% of the world&apos;s ice-free land. The Northern Rim countries \u2013 the northern US, Canada, Russia, Iceland, Greenland, Norway, Sweden and Finland \u2013 form a bloc of a quarter of a billion people with a $7tn economy. Their population and power are set to grow dramatically by 2050, Smith predicts. As global warming takes effect, rainfall will increase here while droughts create water-shortages in the south. Estimates suggest that 30% of the world&apos;s undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its oil lie in the shale-rich sedimentary rocks of the Arctic. Its rich natural resources might make it the next Middle East in terms of its potential for conflict. The high Arctic is destined to become an &quot;economic engine, shovelling gas, oil, minerals and fish into the gaping global maw&quot;. Although at times it labours under the weight of evidence, The New North is a more convincing portrayal of the future than Aerotropolis. But both books raise urgent questions about what kind of world we want to live in."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/20/japan-nuclear-crisis-fukushima-workers", "sentences": ["South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore have started screening food arriving from the country."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-20T12:32:27Z", "title": "Fukushima workers exposed to high radiation levels", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Fukushima"], "article": "Six workers at the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been exposed to radiation levels beyond the usual legal limit while carrying out emergency operations to make the complex safe. The news came amid reports that radiation from the stricken plant had found its way into the food supply, raising anxiety in a country already struggling to deal with the aftermath of the worst crisis in its postwar history. Meanwhile Switzerland has announced it will move its embassy in Japan to Osaka because of fears radiation levels in Tokyo could increase. The operator of the Fukushima plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said it would have to vent radioactive gas from reactor 3, but later called off the risky procedure after pressure inside stabilised, albeit at a relatively high level. The Kyodo news agency reported that Tepco said six staff members had been exposed to more than 100 milliSieverts of radiation, but had been assigned to other tasks and were continuing to work because they had not shown any abnormal signs since being exposed. The government earlier increased to 250 mSv the limit for those working in the emergency operation. Japan&apos;s fire and disaster management agency said readings of up to 27 mSv were detected on 50 firefighters. They were decontaminated after a 13-hour operation to spray water into the spent fuel pool at reactor 3 ended in the early hours of the morning. On Sunday morning, workers doused a pool at reactor 4, also a cause of concern, for the first time. &quot;I think the situation is improving step by step,&quot; the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Tetsuro Fukuyama, told a news conference. Yukiya Amano, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), heralded a &quot;strengthening&quot; of work. But Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy-general at Japan&apos;s Nuclear Safety Agency, cautioned: &quot;We are making progress ... [but] we shouldn&apos;t be too optimistic.&quot; Technicians have already restored power lines to reactors 1 and 2. They hope they can restore cooling systems, although the pumps may well have been damaged by the earthquake, tsunami and subsequent explosions at the plant. David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US told Reuters: &quot;The workers need to go through the plant, figure out what survived and what didn&apos;t, what can be readily repaired and get the cooling systems back up and running to deal with the cores and the spent fuel pools.&quot; Tepco&apos;s president has made a public apology for &quot;causing such great concern and nuisance&quot;. The firm has been widely criticised for not being open enough about the problems at the facility and its attempts to remedy them. The government&apos;s chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, confirmed the plant would not be used again. The nuclear safety agency said the facility could be buried in sand and concrete, as happened at Chernobyl following the nuclear disaster in 1986, but has said that trying to cool the reactors remains the priority for now. Japan is considering a temporary ban on sales of food products from the Fukushima region after levels of radiation exceeding government limits were found in milk and spinach. The contaminated food and water pose no threat to human health, Edano said, adding that the tainted milk and spinach had not found its way on to the market. &quot;These levels do not pose an immediate threat to your health. Please stay calm.&quot; Iodine-131 was present in milk at a farm 20 miles away from the crippled nuclear plant and in spinach grown at farms more than 60 miles away in neighbouring Ibaraki. Tiny amounts of radioactive iodine have been found in tap water in and around Tokyo, about 150 miles away from the atomic plant, and five prefectures near Fukushima. The education and science ministry said traces of another radioactive material, caesium-137, had been identified in tap water in nearby Tochigi and Gunma prefectures, but posed no danger to people even if ingested. The government is to provide daily counts of radioactive materials in tap water from all of the affected areas, as well as levels in atmospheric fallout such as rain and dust. Radiation was also detected on fava beans exported to Taiwan. An official from Taiwan&apos;s department of health said a shipment of beans from Japan&apos;s south-western Kyushu island had shown slightly higher radiation than naturally occurring trace levels. The department said the radiation, detected only on the surface of the beans, was well below Taiwan&apos;s legal limit and not harmful to human health. Radioactive dust and particles were recorded in the greater Tokyo area but posed no risk to health, the government said on Sunday. Edano said someone who drank the tainted milk for a year would receive the same amount of radiation as in a single CT health scan; eating the spinach would be the equivalent of one-fifth. He said the contaminated water, milk and spinach would have to be consumed in enormous quantities over a long period to pose a threat to health. &quot;If you eat it once, or twice or even for several days, it&apos;s not just that it&apos;s not an immediate threat to health, it&apos;s that even in the future it is not a risk,&quot; he said. &quot;Experts say there is no threat to human health.&quot; Graham Andrew, a senior IAEA official, told reporters in Geneva that Japan was considering halting food sales from the affected region. The spread of radioactivity to the food supply is already affecting Japanese food exports. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore have started screening food arriving from the country. Local farmers said they were worried that the discoveries would affect other, so far unaffected, produce from the region, which is known for its rice and several varieties of fruit and vegetable. &quot;There will be damaging rumours,&quot; said Shizuko Kohata, a farmer who was evacuated from her home near the Fukushima plant. &quot;I grow things for a living, and I&apos;m worried that I won&apos;t be able to carry on after this.&quot; The government said radioactive iodine-131 present in spinach tested on Wednesday was three to seven times above acceptable government standards. Levels in drinking water from Fukushima were slightly over the limit on Thursday but had decreased significantly by the weekend, the health ministry said. Drinking one litre (1.76 pints) of water with the iodine at Thursday&apos;s levels is the equivalent of receiving one 88th of the radiation from a chest x-ray, said Kazuma Yokota, a spokesman for the prefecture&apos;s disaster response headquarters. Iodine-131 decays within a matter of weeks, but can pose a short-term risk to health, the IAEA said. &quot;There is a short-term risk to human health if radioactive iodine food is absorbed into the human body,&quot; the agency said. &quot;If ingested, it can accumulate in and cause damage to the thyroid. Children and young people are particularly at risk.&quot; A potentially greater concern is caesium-137, which caused widespread damage to the food supply in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. The substance affects cells in the entire body and can increase the chances of developing cancer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/20/michael-gove-pupil-stew", "sentences": ["This year: Singapore&apos;s &quot;special express&quot; ride for clever kids, so they skip GCSEs altogether and get on with As from age 14.", "Both Finland and Singapore are world leaders when it comes to results.", "Singapore stands for streaming, relentless testing, rigorous league rankings: the ultimate pressure cooker.", "Is there anything Finland or Singapore can throw into this pot?"], "publicationDate": "2011-03-20T19:00:00Z", "title": "Michael Gove's pupil stew | Peter Preston", "tags": ["Education", "Michael Gove", "Schools", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Why, as this newspaper inquired the other day, the constant churning revolution in the NHS? And why, it might have added, so many parallel convulsions down in Mikey Gove&apos;s dream school canteen? On the menu this lunchtime: reindeer steak and noodles. You know how Gove and his minions tour the globe like magpies, hunting for bright educational wheezes to nick. Last year: Finland&apos;s policy of letting only the brightest graduates teach. This year: Singapore&apos;s &quot;special express&quot; ride for clever kids, so they skip GCSEs altogether and get on with As from age 14. First, let&apos;s ask for the whole menu. Both Finland and Singapore are world leaders when it comes to results. Finland is naturally great at community schools, at true comprehensives, at brilliant classroom leadership: an appetising stew of wholesome ingredients. Singapore stands for streaming, relentless testing, rigorous league rankings: the ultimate pressure cooker. And Gove&apos;s struggling old England? Think chips with everything. Thus we come to Professor Alison Wolf, Gove&apos;s close adviser and author of a new, headline-catching review that tells how we&apos;re failing the two-thirds of\u00a0our kids who aren&apos;t academically focused: students who will need a way of earning a living, or several different sorts of living \u2013 and make up the bulk of the million or so young who can&apos;t find work today. What is our system doing for them? Mostly failing, as usual. They don&apos;t have priority, says the professor. Keeping them in education \u2013 in class or training till 18 \u2013 won&apos;t be much use if the diplomas they toil away at lack street cred with employers. It&apos;s crazy to chain them to desks, but not to insist they do GCSE English and maths until they pass. But does any of that happen? Not really. Dreadful for them, bad and shameful for us, she concludes. And you can begin to see a pattern forming. University entrance shrinking in numbers, not expanding exponentially as the cuts bite. Universities themselves more divided than ever between the research-grounded best and the rest. Schools \u2013 under Gove&apos;s traditional tutelage \u2013 spending more time on the &quot;English bac&quot; subjects, and less on newer, softer options. Is there anything Finland or Singapore can throw into this pot? Absolutely: in the way that, two or three years from the end of schooling, they split into different areas. University aspirants go one way, the more technically inclined another. Everybody knows these human candidates, setting out on life, are of equal worth. Nobody pretends they are equally academic, or that one style of learning fits all. In the England of 50 years ago we&apos;d have known the labels to fit such categories: universities, polytechnics; grammar schools, secondary moderns. But then came other, more aspirational labels. Ones where equal worth equalled equal status. Ones in which a single, giant size of school fitted all. Ones in which the same catchment area supposedly helped create cohesive, classless communities. But now, as you survey the results of so much churning, it&apos;s difficult not to feel that old English weakness returning. Take Wolf&apos;s bleak diagnosis of &quot;a systemic denial of opportunities&quot;. Take the 66% who won&apos;t get to university, or perhaps anywhere much else. Take the status of our academic traditions, but not the reality of the training most children need. And take the actual example of Helsinki and the Straits, where separate institutions serve separate pupil needs. An end to the comprehensive ideal? The birth of advanced, new-age secondary moderns? Another convulsion replacing the last? From top to bottom, you can see its elements falling into place.

First RIM announced US prices and dates, though not UK ones, for its Playbook tablet.

Prices are, including VAT: Wi-Fi only:16GB: \u00a3399.00 (\u00a3332.50 ex 20% VAT) 32GB: \u00a3479.00 (\u00a3399.17 ex 20% VAT) 64GB: \u00a3559.00 (\u00a3465.83 ex 20% VAT) Wi-Fi and 3G: 16GB: \u00a3499.00 (\u00a3415.83 ex 20% VAT) 32GB: \u00a3579.00 (\u00a3482.50 ex 20% VAT)64GB: \u00a3659.00 (\u00a3549.17 ex 20% VAT) Those compare to prices last year respectively of \u00a3429, \u00a3499, \u00a3599, \u00a3529, \u00a3599 and \u00a3699. Calculating the differences, the retail (with VAT) price has fallen by between 4% and 7%, with the average being 5%; the ex-VAT price (the one you would normally compare against the US price) has fallen by between 5% and 9%, averaging 7.4%. That is Apple unveiling its next weapon - price - in this battle, where everyone is using every trick that they know to get an edge.  Or is it? It turns out that what&apos;s happening is that Apple is indeed cutting prices, but doing it with the help of the exchange rate. At the moment $1 = \u00a30.6191; back in May 2010 (when the iPad launched in the UK and other countries) it was $1 = \u00a30.682452 (20-day average), so the dollar has weakened against the pound (you need fewer pounds to buy a dollar now than you did). The dollar, in fact, is about 10% lower now than it was against the pound last May.  In turn, that means that $499, the iPad price in 2010 and 2011, equated in 2010 to \u00a3340.54, but is now \u00a3304.69. (In other words: it takes fewer pounds to get the $499 that Apple wants to get for each iPad sold.)  So it might seem like Apple is doing everyone an enormous favour by cutting the price (and it certainly won&apos;t hurt sales), but it is actually benefiting from the movement in exchange rates - in fact, it&apos;s going to make more profit from iPad sales this year than last year, even with a lower price. A couple more interesting wrinkles to the iPad 2 launch internationally: sales won&apos;t start until 5pm in the evening of Friday, or 1am that day if you&apos;re ordering online. Why has it chosen such a time of day to do it? No word on that (we have called Apple but got no response), but there&apos;s the faintest possibility that it&apos;s to discourage the people who made the lives of would-be iPad buyers in the US hell - buying up loads of them in order to ship them off to the Far East. And another clue that that is the motive comes from the fact that sales in Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea won&apos;t start for another two weeks, even while the other 25 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK) get theirs. (Though that won&apos;t really dissuade them - they&apos;ll just come back at the weekend, surely.)     The dollar/pound exchange rate since May 2010: the pound has sttrengthened since the launch of the iPad last year, which will help Apple's bottom line even as it cuts prices    And just to add to the tablet fun, at CTIA Samsung has announced (or possible re-announced) its tablets and pricing. There will be the Galaxy Tab 10.1 (guess the screen size), to be released on 8 June - running Android 3.0 (&quot;Honeycomb&quot;). Prices: $499 (16GB), $599 (32GB). The Galaxy 8.9 will be priced at $469 (16GB), $499 (32GB), and be released in &quot;early summer&quot;. So is this iPad competition? Well, Honeycomb is certainly nice, and that&apos;s price-competitive with the iPad, at least in the US. UK prices haven&apos;t been set (or suggested) and the release date is only &quot;later this year&quot;. Samsung didn&apos;t want to share sales figures either: &quot;those are only for internal use,&quot; we were told. (The press release and details haven&apos;t made it to Samsung&apos;s online press releases.) The list of tablets that have been announced is thus growing ever longer, but the list of those actually seen in the wild in the UK remains extremely short - the iPad and the Samsung Galaxy Tab (and now @Dirkbruere&apos;s Advent Vega) being the principal ones. Anyone else got a tablet not in that list that they&apos;ve bought in the UK this year?

You always know that&apos;s the way he has to be ridden, that&apos;s the way Ryan gets the best out of him, and it&apos;s just a question of whether he gets the gaps or not.  &quot;He&apos;s a funny guy. If he was a man, he would be a loner. He&apos;s not a very social type, you have to train him the way he wants. We play around with him, we try to confuse him and he tries to confuse me and we just get along as best we can.  &quot;He never really runs a bad race. The only bad race he&apos;s ever run was at Ascot last year, and that&apos;s because he&apos;d had a long season here and in Hong Kong. He&apos;s even harder to train in English conditions because he knows exactly where the start of every canter and gallop is, here you can confuse him because you can change things around. Here you can play around with him, in Newmarket you can&apos;t.  That&apos;s why basically we won&apos;t be training him in England any more, he&apos;ll go to Hong Kong and Singapore and then start all over again next year.  Ryan Moore was only at the press conference briefly. &quot;They went a good gallop,&quot; he said. &quot;I was aiming at the right horses and the gaps always happened just when I needed them to. I don&apos;t worry about it [finding gaps]. If it happens, it happens.&quot;  Greg Wood in Dubai Good afternoon from Meydan, Dubai, where the richest race in the world, the Dubai World Cup, is due off in approximately six and a half hours&apos; time. Before that, there is a high-class card that includes two more of the most valuable events in world racing, the Sheema Classic and the Dubai Duty Free, both run on turf \u2013 and several more contests that thrust horses from countries including Japan, South Africa, the United States and, of course, Britain into truly international competition. The temperature here \u2013 where we are four hours ahead of GMT \u2013 will have cooled somewhat by the time the racing starts with an event for pure-bred Arabians in a couple of hours. At the moment, though, it is quite insanely hot, well over 30 degrees by all accounts, and it will be interesting to see how the Tapeta track stands up to it. Speaking to the excellent Richard Hoiles a while ago \u2013 you can follow him on Twitter too, incidentally \u2013 he wondered whether the course could ending up riding a little slow, as the wax holding it together starts to melt and makes it a little stickier than usual. If so it could be hard to make ground up the straight, though on the other hand, there is a stiffish breeze blowing up the stretch too, which could leave the horses that race up with the pace gasping for breath just when they need it most. These are just two of the many factors that need to be weighed up ahead of a card like this, when horses arrive from racing jurisdictions on several continents with outstanding domestic form to their name but no obvious way to compare one with another. For some punters, this is a complete turn-off, but personally I like the chance to think a little more laterally than normal and try to find horses at attractive prices in races where the favourite may face rather stronger opposition than the betting might suggest. One that definitely catches the eye is I Want Revenge (1.50), who was the hot favourite for the Kentucky Derby two years ago before he was withdrawn just a few hours before the race and has been very lightly campaigned since. Last time out, he ran fourth, beaten less than three lengths, in the Grade One Donn Handicap, one of the feature events at Gulfstream&apos;s winter meeting, and could conceivably outclass what is a weak field, even for a Group Two, today. At 9-1 with Bet365, who offer a quarter the odds the first three places, he is well worth an interest. Others that might reward close inspection are Euroears (3.05) and Gio Ponti (5.35), again each-way, at around 12-1 in the Classic. JJ The Jet Plane looks horribly short in the Al Quoz Sprint, a race that, at best prices, is 2-1 the favourite and 12-1 bar, but I can&apos;t realistically find one to put up against him so will instead simply be cheering for Triple Aspect (1.15), owned by Tony Bloom, who has also supplied the cash to build Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&apos;s magnificent new stadium.  Today&apos;s TV races Industry will be rewarded for Liam Jones when he is crowned the champion all-weather jockey today and the rider may also be celebrating a payday in the richest race of the winter season, the Winter Derby at Lingfield, aboard the useful outsider Cockney Class (3.10). The favourite, Nideeb, makes obvious appeal on the strength of his high-class Polytrack form, but he needs every yard of this mile-and-a-quarter trip. Cockney Class never really delivered what connections expected last season, victory in a six-furlong Newmarket handicap being followed by four defeats.But moving up in trip is going to help him, while a gelding operation could also bring about beneficial effects, so it is far from impossible that he can get involved. His final effort last season, when sixth of 13 in the Group 3 Darley Stakes, does not leave him with a lot to find. Lingfield 2.00 Despite being top weight, Hitchens should score. With Silaah likely to help cut out a frantic early gallop on his inside, the selection is fancied to cut his rivals down close home, provided he can hold his position to the bend. Newbury 2.15 Back from a break since falling when in the process of giving Sway a good fight at Exeter in December, Easter Legend looks a big player, despite meeting that rival on marginally worse terms. A smart hurdler on her day, she is sure to have been well schooled over fences since that latest blip and good ground suits. Lingfield 2.35 Both of the Richard Hannon-trained runners look major players and the betting market may provide an important clue about their relative prospects. But Vanguard Dream impressed as he maintained his unbeaten record in three starts this season and he could just have the edge. He looked talented when pulling out more to win at Newbury in October, despite having been keen enough in the early stages. Newbury 2.50 Since being fitted with a tongue-tie, Emmaslegend has proved nothing short of a revelation and, with her trainer in flying form, she can cut the mustard, even in this much stiffer grade. Her full-sister, Aimigayle, one of the toughest mares in training, loves these kind of conditions and Emmaslegend can prove a chip off the old block. Newbury 3.25 Expensive to follow this season, Maktu has nevertheless given plenty of encouragement to his followers, particularly when he came from a long way back to finish strongly over two and a half miles at Newbury last time. That kind of trip was never going to see Maktu at his best, but it offers good reason for hope in this contest, and the booking of Ruby Walsh is eyecatching to say the least. Ogee looks like the danger. Horse sense Philip Robinson will start the new Flat season with a point to prove, having been given another chance to show his talents by another well-liked veteran of his profession, Clive Brittain. Neil Callan was preferred for the job as stable jockey to Michael Jarvis&apos;s successor, Roger Varian, but Robinson has been working hard with his fitness in recent weeks and Nideeb (3.10) is a strong fancy to advertise his skills in the Winter Derby at Lingfield. A thorough stayer at this trip, he will need a decent pace to be seen to best effect, but his all-weather form is solid and his recent work suggests that he has improved again for another winter on his back. Dansili Dancer carries high hopes, but it will be a surprise if something does not have the legs of the nine-year-old in the closing stages and it could well be Nideeb who comes home strongest. Barry Hills is in Dubai to watch his runners at the World Cup meeting, but Tasheyaat (3.40) is expected to go close to making a winning debut at the same meeting, while, in the following race, his stablemate Whistle On By (4.15) is not short on ability, but has been plagued in the past with breathing problems, which seems ironic, given his name. Before leaving for Dubai to watch Twice Over&apos;s challenge for the World Cup, Henry Cecil was able to supervise work at an important stage of the season. Frankel&apos;s high-class work on the Cambridge Road Polytrack on Wednesday has been well documented, but his stablemate Air Traffic is a name to note. While Khalid Abdullah&apos;s immaculately bred, unraced colt World Domination has been the subject of plenty of talk already, it was Air Traffic \u2013 whose six older siblings have all been winners \u2013 who came out on top in their latest gallop. Rated last season&apos;s joint champion two-year-old along with Frankel, Dream Ahead was also spotted going through the gears on the Cambridge Road this week. His trainer, David Simcock, whose team look forward this year, has been trying to get the colt to settle better in his work and the signs are encouraging that the Middle Park winner is learning. Seen and heard &quot;I am not one to get involved in racing politics,&quot; said Richard Hannon on his website this week and he may have a bit to learn about spin. Announcing his intention not to run horses in races with low prize money, he said: &quot;It costs on average between \u00a316,000 and \u00a317,000 a year for an owner to have a horse in training and with these cuts the powers-that-be are simply driving them out of the sport&quot;. Those words might have carried more weight had it not been for the previous item on Hannon&apos;s site, confirming that he would start the new season with a record number of 231 horses in training. Henry Cecil is considered racing royalty in Britain, though he has never in fact been knighted. This fact was evidently lost on the Dubai newspaper that this week published a story about &quot;Sir Henry Cecil&quot;. Will Hayler&apos;s best bet Alfie Flits 3.50 Bangor Alfie Flits takes the eye off bottom weight, now that he finally gets to race on better ground than the slop he has been encountering in the depths of winter. A smart performer on his day, he has come right down the weights as a result of his recent poor showings, but there have been hints that a return to form could be imminent. He should be a decent price for this competitive contest."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/26/victoire-pisa-wins-dubai-world-cup", "sentences": ["&quot;Basically we won&apos;t be training him in England any more, he&apos;ll go to Hong Kong and Singapore and then start all over again next year.&quot; Khawlah, in the blue colours of Godolphin, became the first filly to win the UAE Derby and she is now likely to be steered towards the Oaks at Epsom in June."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-26T19:40:50Z", "title": "Victoire Pisa leads home one-two for Japan in Dubai World Cup", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Dubai World Cup"], "article": "Henry Cecil&apos;s attempt to win the Dubai World Cup, the world&apos;s richest race, came to nothing at Meydan as Twice Over, the dual Champion Stakes winner, endured a difficult passage in a muddling race that fell to an enterprising ride by Mirco Demuro on Victoire Pisa, from Japan. This World Cup, the second to be run at Meydan, was a repeat of last year&apos;s renewal from Cecil&apos;s point of view, as Tom Queally, Twice Over&apos;s jockey, could not get a position from a wide draw and was forced to race four wide through the first bend. Victoire Pisa, though, received smart steering from a much better post position in stall six, as Demuro brilliantly steered his mount wide of the field and into a prominent position three furlongs out in a race that, again like last year&apos;s, was run at a very steady pace. Demuro then kicked on two furlongs out and comfortably held the late challenge of Transcend, also trained in Japan, who completed the country&apos;s best result in an international race. Monterosso, the outsider of the field, was third, with Cape Blanco, Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s first World Cup runner, in fourth. Amid the delight of the winner&apos;s connections after their victory, thoughts quickly turned to the devastation unleashed on Japan by the recent earthquake and tsunami. &quot;It is a great souvenir to take back to Japan,&quot; Yoshimi Ichikawa, the winning owner, said. &quot;I was very worried during the race as I didn&apos;t know what would happen. I really appreciate the support we have had from all the people in Japan.&quot; Demuro was overcome with emotion after the race and was in tears when interviewed on his way back to the winner&apos;s enclosure. &quot;It&apos;s unbelievable. It&apos;s just unbelievable to win the Dubai World Cup for Japan,&quot; he said. Cecil&apos;s frustration that Twice Over could not get into the race was clear. &quot;He was taken out there, and then they slowed it right up and he couldn&apos;t go anywhere,&quot; Cecil said. &quot;Tom said he broke well, but when they got to the bend, the next minute he was out the back, and they slowed it up on the far side as well, so he didn&apos;t have a run, did he? I don&apos;t like making excuses and hard-luck stories, but the race just went all wrong for him.&quot; While Cecil endured only disappointment, Luca Cumani, his near-neighbour in Newmarket, took one of the most valuable prizes of his long career when Presvis, a horse who has to finish fast and late, came with a perfectly timed run under Ryan Moore to win the Dubai Duty Free. Presvis is a quirky horse, but one who has been an exceptional servant to Cumani, having now won nearly \u00a34.5m in prize money in a 22-race career. &quot;He&apos;s a funny guy,&quot; Cumani said. &quot;If he was a man, he would be a loner. He&apos;s not a very social type, you have to train him the way he wants. We play around with him, we try to confuse him and he tries to confuse me and we just get along as best we can. &quot;Basically we won&apos;t be training him in England any more, he&apos;ll go to Hong Kong and Singapore and then start all over again next year.&quot; Khawlah, in the blue colours of Godolphin, became the first filly to win the UAE Derby and she is now likely to be steered towards the Oaks at Epsom in June. Master Of Hounds, Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s first runner in Dubai for six years, looked to have the race won when Moore kicked clear a furlong out, but Mickael Barzalona, an outstanding young riding prospect from France, got Khawlah up to win by a nose in the final stride. Oaks quotes for Khawlah range from 12-1 to 20-1, but her win was also a significant boost for the form of Havant, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, who beat Khawlah with some ease at Newmarket last October. &quot;It&apos;s a real privilege to be here,&quot; O&apos;Brien said, suggesting that a prolonged cooling of relations between Sheikh Mohammed, Dubai&apos;s ruler, and John Magnier, who supplies O&apos;Brien&apos;s ammunition at Ballydoyle, may now be over. &quot;People have to see this place to believe it. The vastness, the glamour and the size of it, no words can do it justice,&quot; he added. Barzalona has enjoyed considerable success in France, where he is based with Andr\u00e9 Fabre. Bright riding prospects can easily burn out as rapidly as they appear, but this was an accomplished performance, and he could well emerge as a leader in the next generation of European jockeys. Godolphin completed a treble as Rewilding took the Dubai Sheema Classic, the main supporting race, following success for Skysurfers in the Godolphin Mile. Rewilding was a disappointing favourite for last year&apos;s St Leger, but his connections feel that he needs time between his races, and he will return to Britain with the rest of Godolphin&apos;s team next month with the King George at Ascot a possible target."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/26/sri-lanka-england-world-cup", "sentences": ["There will be opportunity aplenty to examine this during the next 12 months, during which they play series in India, Bangladesh and back here in Sri Lanka, as well as taking on Pakistan somewhere yet to be decided (the indications are that, unless a disagreement with Abu Dhabi can be settled, it will be in Singapore and Malaysia)."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-26T21:17:12Z", "title": "England head for home after Sri Lanka's record-breaking run chase", "tags": ["Cricket World Cup 2011", "Sri Lanka cricket team", "England cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "England can go home now. After five months, the end of the road came under the lights of the Premadasa Stadium, where they were pulverised by Sri Lanka. Perhaps we should have expected it, but England&apos;s tenacity in clinging on to a tournament in which they had contrived to lose to Ireland and Bangladesh was seductive. It suggested, with one last push, there might be more to come. Instead, it was illusory, for the tank was empty, nothing left to give after a memorable winter. There was no shame in defeat. Tied in knots by a quartet of spinners on a pitch with little turn, but no pace, the lifeblood of runs cut off by the tourniquet of fields set by Kumar Sangakkara and an inability or desire to venture from the crease, England made 229 for six, of which Jonathan Trott made a diligent, if one-paced, 86 \u2013 his fifth half-century of the tournament, passing 400 runs on the way \u2013 and Eoin Morgan a tempo-changing, if chancy, 50, before succumbing at the start of the batting powerplay. Another 30 runs or so and they might have believed it to be a workable total, for is not batting second here under lights supposed to be the kiss of death? Instead, it proved a doddle. In the glare of the evening, England were torn to shreds by the exuberant batting of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga, who put on an unbroken 231 for the first wicket, making a mockery of England&apos;s earlier travails. Each reached a century, Dilshan, an exotic right-hander of malicious intent, making 108 from 115 balls, with 10 fours and two sixes, and the elegant Tharanga 102 from 122 balls (12 fours and a six), thrashing Chris Tremlett to the extra-cover boundary to reach three figures and win the match after Dilshan had given him the chance by studiously blocking the last two balls of Graeme Swann&apos;s winter. Each batsman left the field drained, but ecstatic, crippled by cramp, Tharanga having spent the final overs with a runner and Dilshan hobbling arthritically. There were 63 deliveries of the match remaining. Three times now, at Colombo&apos;s SSC in 2001 and in Dambulla the following year, Sri Lanka have beaten England by 10 wickets in a one-day international, but never chasing a total of this magnitude. This win was the highest successful run chase by 10 wickets in the history of World Cup cricket. On familiar territory, Sri Lanka look formidable and now face New Zealand in the same stadium on Tuesday, confident that, in their own conditions, shouted on by their own crowd (and notwithstanding the remarkable World Cup capacity of the resourceful Kiwis to punch above their weight) next Saturday&apos;s final in Mumbai beckons. Only the fitness of Muttiah Muralitharan will give them cause for concern. Murali was not at his mesmeric best, but completed nine of his 10 overs before leaving the field towards the end of the England innings, clearly troubled by the hamstring injury that has bothered him throughout the tournament. It would be a travesty if his last international act was to limp from the arena. This defeat will represent a watershed for England, for they have yet to come to terms with this form of cricket on the subcontinent. There will be opportunity aplenty to examine this during the next 12 months, during which they play series in India, Bangladesh and back here in Sri Lanka, as well as taking on Pakistan somewhere yet to be decided (the indications are that, unless a disagreement with Abu Dhabi can be settled, it will be in Singapore and Malaysia). The World Cup provides the natural start and finish of a four-year cycle and already the way will be open for the next generation to begin staking a claim. They can start early in the summer against Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka had England&apos;s measure from the start and never let go. Andrew Strauss won the toss he wanted, having named a side unchanged from the one that beat West Indies, the first time he has done so in 14 matches since the Ashes. It may be that they read the run capacity of the pitch wrong. Part of the skill of one-day cricket is recognising what a defendable total is and then having the courage of the conviction to try to achieve it. Two hundred and fifty, the pundits were saying, and England had a chance, and that is how they appeared to approach their innings. Until the advent of Morgan, it lacked impetus of any sort as Strauss and Ian Bell, promoted to open, fell tamely, and Ravi Bopara, after a stand of 64 with Trott, was lbw sweeping Murali. All the time, Trott had been playing with the tempo he has adopted all winter, providing the backbone of a total. To accommodate this, however, he needs energy around him and immediately it came from Morgan, who started to flick and carve, and generally upset the rhythm of the bowlers. Fortune favoured him, the only blot on an otherwise exemplary Sri Lanka report card. When on 16, he lifted Ajantha Mendis over extra cover, only for Thilan Samaraweera, running in from the boundary, to make a hash of a straightforward chance. Then, on 32, he lofted Murali in a similar direction, this time for Angelo Mathews to grass the chance. Two balls later, when he tried to carve Murali square, it was the left-arm spinner, Rangana Herath, diving forward, who put down the catch. Murali was bug-eyed in his apoplexy. Morgan and Trott added 91 for the fourth wicket before England took their final powerplay and Morgan, having lost the toe of one bat to a Lasith Malinga yorker, used his replacement to slice Malinga high to Mathews at point."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/mar/26/4", "sentences": ["  Coppersmith barbet, Megalaima haemacephala (formerly; Xantholaema haemacephala and Bucco indicus, protonym; Bucco haemacephalus), also known as the Crimson-breasted Barbet or or simply as the coppersmith, photographed at Singapore, Southeast Asia.", "This species, which specialises in forest edge and scrub habitats, has recently expanded its range and, as of 1960, inhabits Singapore, where all the old growth forest has been removed."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-26T22:52:57Z", "title": "Mystery bird: Coppersmith barbet, Megalaima haemacephala", "tags": ["Science"], "article": "  Coppersmith barbet, Megalaima haemacephala (formerly; Xantholaema haemacephala and Bucco indicus, protonym; Bucco haemacephalus), also known as the Crimson-breasted Barbet or or simply as the coppersmith, photographed at Singapore, Southeast Asia.

Can you identify it? Response: this is an adult coppersmith barbet, Megalaima haemacephala. This species, which specialises in forest edge and scrub habitats, has recently expanded its range and, as of 1960, inhabits Singapore, where all the old growth forest has been removed. Males and females of this species look alike (this species is monomorphic). The red forehead, yellow eye-ring and throat patch with streaked underside and green upperparts, are distinctive, so the coppersmith barbet is not generally confused with any other species. Juveniles are duller and lack the adults&apos; red patches. This bird&apos;s common name comes from its call, which has a metronome-like quality, often being described as sounding like a coppersmith&apos;s banging.  Barbets are frugivorous birds that are thought to be important agents of seed dispersal in tropical forests. Like their distant relatives, the woodpeckers, barbets nest in tree cavities.

Except that in the messages flying out ahead of the budget, Tiga had been saying how they were calling for better R&amp;D breaks \u2013 but also tax breaks specifically for the games industry (to help it compete with Canada in particular, but also the US, Korea, Scandinavia and Singapore), measures to support prototype funding, changes to venture capital trusts and the enterprise investment scheme (EIS), and incentives to support &quot;games clusters&quot; of companies. OK, the EIS did come through, in some form. But the rest of it? Nowhere to be seen. So let&apos;s give Tiga two cheers, or perhaps a crouching ovation. Good, but could do better. We should have known that something like this half-hearted measure was coming. Interviewed by MediaGuardian&apos;s Dan Sabbagh last week, Jeremy Hunt let slip thoughts on the games industry \u2013 you know, the one that contributes \u00a31bn to UK GDP, employs 9,000 skilled development staff, is almost all (85%) outside London, and is in SMEs that the government so needs. What did Hunt think? &quot;We need to diversify our economy, replicate some of the success of the City,&quot; he said \u2013 with &quot;the right regulatory framework&quot;. What\u00a0about the tax break? &quot;I don&apos;t know if that was the right way to go.&quot; Oh, disappointing. But: &quot;we need to offer the video game industry a package as financially competitive as Canada.&quot; This is one where you just can&apos;t square the circle. Being competitive with Canada means making the long-term investment of a tax break. R&amp;D credits just won&apos;t do it \u2013 something Tiga grumpily pointed out in its semi-celebratory email: the tax breaks for games companies in Canada, for example, mean its games industry grew by 33% between 2008 and 2010, while the UK&apos;s declined by 9%. The government long ago stopped investing directly in companies, but it can still nudge the scales when it wants to. It&apos;s happy to do it for the record and film industries \u2013 witness all the blather about controlling &quot;digital lockers&quot; that can be used to share files (and are invaluable to businesses that need to move big files around). The\u00a0games industry is just as big. But of course it isn&apos;t 100 years old. Maybe Tiga needs to wait until 2100 for a government that really understands the need for games. Frankly, though, if we have a prime minister and minister for communications who already play games (Angry Birds and Super Mario Galaxy respectively), we could hope for better. Much better."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/mar/31/london-2012-olympic-legacy", "sentences": ["Lord Coe&apos;s electrifying speech in Singapore that secured the Games set the tone \u2013 this would be an Olympics that would deliver not only a fantastic sporting spectacle but leave behind a legacy for east London, the UK and the world."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-31T10:24:38Z", "title": "What will be the legacy of the London 2012 Olympics? | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "London was supposed to be the Games that would touch the parts other Olympics couldn&apos;t reach. Lord Coe&apos;s electrifying speech in Singapore that secured the Games set the tone \u2013 this would be an Olympics that would deliver not only a fantastic sporting spectacle but leave behind a legacy for east London, the UK and the world. It vowed to inspire a generation through sport, regenerate the poorest part of the capital, get the entire country off their sofas and into the pool or the gym and leave behind a framework for elite sport that would ensure we never again plumbed the depths of Atlanta or Athens. World peace wasn&apos;t on the list but it might as well have been. Added to that since have been all sorts of other legacy goals around shifting perceptions of disability, cultural aims and sustainability. Some have been well realised, others less so. Such was the need to sell the \u00a39.3bn public investment to taxpayers that they were promised the moon on a stick. The dreaded &quot;L-word&quot; has become such a clich\u00e9 that organisers and ministers turn verbal somersaults to try and avoid using it. To this observer, the physical legacy rising out of the earth in Stratford can&apos;t help but impress \u2013 in bricks and mortar terms at least. Leaving aside for now the issues surrounding regeneration (ably outlined by Dave Hill here) the so-called sporting legacy can be broadly divided into what it means for elite sport, the venues and for mass participation. Elite legacy Despite the impact of the funding cuts, the elite sporting legacy seems the most secure. There is a genuine determination to avoid the &quot;Sydney effect&quot; \u2013 where the Australians put huge sums into achieving at their own home Games but went backwards afterwards. The government has protected funding through to 2015 (ie almost through to Rio) by changing the formula by which Lottery money is distributed. What will happen after that is anyone&apos;s guess. That is one of the myriad questions at the heart of the increasingly acrimonious legal battle between Lord Coe&apos;s Locog and Lord Moynihan&apos;s British Olympic Association over how any potential profit from the Games should be defined and divvied up. Moynihan&apos;s detractors, of whom there are many, argue his sugar-coated words about battling for a legacy for British sport (a nest egg of up to \u00a3320m he believes would be shared between the BOA and grassroots sport if he prevails) are merely a front for a long-standing, self-serving power-play to expand his organisation&apos;s remit and fill a financial hole. But his supporters, including some of the Olympic sports, feel he is right to battle to secure as much hard cash as he can in the belief that government funding for elite sport is going to drop off a cliff at a time when the investment required to compete is only going to increase. Venues In terms of the provision of the venues now nearing completion, the picture is mixed. The velodrome and the white water canoeing course at Broxbourne, planned and built with a defined legacy in mind due to the oversight of the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority, show what happens when it goes right. The aquatics centre \u2013 where design has trumped function and finding a legacy operator could prove a struggle - could yet show what happens when it goes wrong. And the jury is still out on the stadium. Clearly, the decision to discount a true &quot;dual use&quot; option a la the Stade de France in 2006 may yet come back to haunt organisers and planners if West Ham United&apos;s vision comes unstuck. Yet it is hard to argue against the fact that London will be left considerably better off in term of world-class sporting venues after the Games than before it. Participation This is the element that has long proved most controversial. There is scant evidence that hosting an Olympic Games inspires the population to somehow, by osmosis, get fit or play more sport. It has not happened at any previous Games. But emboldened by the legacy concept that won the Games, ministers promised in 2006 that not only would the Olympics spark an upturn in the nation&apos;s health afterwards but that by pouring \u00a3480m into sport through governing bodies, plus tens of millions more in so-called &quot;themed rounds&quot; directly through Sport England, they would make a big difference before the Games. One million more people were to play sport three or more times a week by 2013, they declared, and a further million were to engage in more physical activity three or more times a week \u2013 a more elastic definition that included activities such as gardening and decorating. Sport England, the body charged with delivering the first of those missions, has faced an uphill battle ever since. Shortly after coming to power, the coalition government (very) quietly dropped the 1m due to be delivered through the department of health. Now, we understand, the 1m to be delivered through Sport England is to go too. There is a persuasive argument that the target was the wrong one in the first place \u2013 persuading someone who already plays tennis twice a week to go jogging as well is nowhere near as valuable as getting someone who is inactive to do some sort of sport once a week. But even by their own measure, progress has been dismally slow. Unfortunately for Sport England, and for Labour, they set the baseline not at the 2005-06 level (by which calculation they would have risen by a creditable 585,000) but the 2007-08 figure \u2013 by which measure the numbers have improved by a dismal 66,000. Going by the figures, it appears ministers and Sport England have been wrong to put their faith \u2013 and \u00a3480m from taxpayers and Lottery hopefuls - in the hands of the governing bodies. Cajoling, bullying, persuading and threatening them appears to have made no difference. In every sport, there are excuses. Team sports feel the Active People survey measure (30 minutes or more at least once a week) is unfair because it discriminates against those who take a whole day to play \u2013 cricket for example. Others feel that Sport England should measure actual sessions in actual leisure centres rather than relying on a (albeit comprehensive) survey. The Football Association is aggrieved that the figures take into account all forms of the game when its historic focus has been on maintaining 11-a-side numbers. But with some honourable exceptions, too many governing bodies (some because they are simply underpowered and understaffed) have proved themselves unequal to the task handed to them. The bounty was handed out, but too few governing bodies have the staff or structure in place to help them spend it wisely. In conclusion Sport England is starting to get tough by taking the money away, but it could be too little, too late. There are plenty of good, committed, enthusiastic people working at the sharp end in British sport. But ministers need to realise it will take an awful lot more than the prospect of seeing Jessica Ennis winning gold to reverse the effects of decades of under-investment in our communal sporting infrastructure. Many of the intractable problems remain. Links between sports clubs and schools should be much better. New state-of-the-art facilities funded by the Football Foundation, for example, insist they are used almost continuously by schools and the community as a condition of funding. And all agree that not enough has been done to raise the profile of coaching as a profession, whether at community or elite level. On the continent or in the US, being a sports coach or even an administrator is a passport to respect and a decent salary. In the UK, it&apos;s all too often an under-rewarded and under-appreciated slog. The FA has belatedly made much noise recently about the importance of age-specific coaches and the need to train them better and pay them more, but the same is true across sport. Labour are wrong when they criticise the coalition for scrapping their targets \u2013 given that they were probably the wrong targets introduced for the wrong reasons \u2013 but they&apos;re on safer ground when they hit out at the effect of local authority cuts on sporting facilities and schemes to fill to them. The culture, media, sports and Olympics minister, Jeremy Hunt, told the Guardian this week that he believed that local authorities understood the power of sport and were committed to keeping facilities open. But when it comes to the crunch, councils are likely to see sport as the easy option to strike a red pen through. Things have improved since the depressing 1980s era of dilapidated leisure centres, draughty pools and disappearing playing fields. But a journey through France, Germany or the Netherlands still inspires envy at their municipal facilities and the fear is that the bad old days could easily return. That would be no Olympic legacy at all."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/31/el-bulli-ferran-adria", "sentences": ["In the wake of the recent death of fellow Catalan chef Santi Santamar\u00eda from a heart attack in his Singapore restaurant at the age of 53, Adri\u00e0&apos;s decision to go global on the internet while staying local to work is even more understandable.", "Santamaria, head chef at the triple Michelin-starred Can Fabes restaurant, not far from El Bulli, had been running eight restaurants, with a total of seven Michelin stars, in such diverse places as Madrid, Barcelona, Qatar and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-03-31T17:24:50Z", "title": "El Bulli for you: Ferran Adri\u00e0 now caters for a mass market", "tags": ["Ferran Adri\u00e0", "Food & drink", "Spain", "Life and style", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "The world&apos;s greatest chef has had enough. &quot;I don&apos;t care now whether I have three stars, or however many. Or whether I am No 1 or No 28,&quot; explains Ferran Adri\u00e0, the former plate-washer who has revolutionised high cuisine over the past 20 years. &quot;You can&apos;t stay at number one forever. Imagine if Barcelona won the Champions League for 15 seasons,&quot; he adds. &quot;The system couldn&apos;t handle it.&quot; Adri\u00e0&apos;s words may sound world-weary, but in fact they are the opposite. Having reached the top, and stayed there for so long, he is closing his world-famous El Bulli restaurant and turning its location, in a charming Mediterranean cove, into a research foundation that will reach out to the masses by publishing daily on the internet. It is yet another bold move in the story of Spain&apos;s rise in the world of fine food. Like half a dozen other Spanish chefs whose names are hallowed by gourmets, Adri\u00e0 has transformed a small restaurant far off the beaten track into an international brand. From Basque chefs Juan Mari Arzak and Andoni Luis Aduriz to Adri\u00e0&apos;s fellow Catalans the Roca brothers, the Spanish kitchen rules. Last year four Spanish establishments made the top 10 in the S.Pellegrino restaurant awards. The irony is that Spaniards&apos; eating habits, once based on a traditional Mediterranean diet rich in healthy vegetables, fruit and beans, have disintegrated just as its chefs have won global fame. &quot;Right now there is no real difference between the diet of someone in M\u00e1laga and someone in Liverpool,&quot; says Dr Francisco Tinahones, head of the endocrinology department at M\u00e1laga&apos;s Hospital Cl\u00ednico. Obesity and adult diabetes have rocketed to 20% and 12% of the population respectively, with the latter doubling in 20 years. Child obesity is at 30% in some areas. &quot;Experts mostly believe that, as a result, this generation will live shorter lives than their parents,&quot; says Tinahones. Part of Adri\u00e0&apos;s mission will be to correct that, much as Jamie Oliver has tried to in Britain. He already works with Valentin Fuster, an eminent Spanish cardiologist. Adri\u00e0 will start by sharing the secrets of how he feeds his own employees. &quot;People imagine that chefs in top restaurants eat well, but often they don&apos;t because they are too busy and only have time for a sandwich,&quot; he said. &quot;Three years ago we decided to eat fantastically. Now we serve a three-course lunch that costs us just \u20ac3 a head.&quot; His entire staff of 75, in other words, eats for the price of a single meal at El Bulli \u2013 though they do not get the 44 dishes served to each diner the day the Guardian visited, which included typically bizarre Adri\u00e0 inventions such as soya matchsticks and game cappuccino. The monthly staff menu will eventually be published in English in book form, titled The Family Meal. Turning El Bulli into a foundation will also stop it bleeding money. Adri\u00e0 takes a loss on the restaurant, making money elsewhere \u2013 mostly as a consultant. &quot;This is like a research and development department. You shouldn&apos;t expect it to make money,&quot; he says. Although he insists his decision to close has nothing to do with money, it highlights the complex economics of high cuisine \u2013 where top chefs often make money away from the restaurants that made them famous. Professor Julia Prats, an economist who carried out a case study on El Bulli for the University of Navarre&apos;s IESE business school, says it is a fantastic marketing tool for Adri\u00e0. &quot;Even if it breaks even, that&apos;s an accomplishment,&quot; she said. In the wake of the recent death of fellow Catalan chef Santi Santamar\u00eda from a heart attack in his Singapore restaurant at the age of 53, Adri\u00e0&apos;s decision to go global on the internet while staying local to work is even more understandable. Santamaria, head chef at the triple Michelin-starred Can Fabes restaurant, not far from El Bulli, had been running eight restaurants, with a total of seven Michelin stars, in such diverse places as Madrid, Barcelona, Qatar and Singapore. Adri\u00e0 does not mind losing El Bulli&apos;s exclusivity. A restaurant with just 15 tables that opens for six months a year and serves only supper can feed just 8,000 people a year. Pressure from the rich and famous to get a table was intense. &quot;I am tired of having to turn people away,&quot; Adri\u00e0 said. Rather than retreating from the public gaze, however, Adri\u00e0 says his new venture will see his El Bulli team exposed to even greater scrutiny than that exercised by the Michelin Guide&apos;s star-givers (who routinely give him three) or the magazines that consistently name him the world&apos;s top chef. &quot;It will be even tougher, because there will effectively be far more people waiting to be &apos;served&apos; on the internet,&quot; he says. Among the artists, architects and others he will bring into the kitchen to broaden El Bulli&apos;s creative drive, the new team will include a journalist to serve up a daily ration of revelations from his experimental kitchen. The challenge will also be about competing with El Bulli&apos;s own history. Adri\u00e0 is famous for the hours he spends in his workshop, pursuing new ideas for the menu. Although he has represented Spain at art shows such as Documenta in Germany, Adri\u00e0 rejects the idea of cuisine as art. &quot;The umbrella is not art, but creativity,&quot; he says. He will be bringing other creatives into the foundation&apos;s kitchen. &quot;They will be able to see how we create, and we can study how they do it,&quot; he said. Vicente Todol\u00ed, the outgoing Spanish director of the Tate Modern, is a friend of Adri\u00e0 and will be among those advising him. Adri\u00e0 will also teach creativity at Harvard for two weeks a year. His systematic approach to invention means that will include &quot;teaching how to be an efficient creator&quot;. Some eating will be done at the El Bulli Foundation, but there will not be regular meals. Those wanting a taste of the Adri\u00e0 magic, however, can get to two new Barcelona outlets that he has opened in recent weeks with his brother, Albert. One, Tickets, serves tapas invented at El Bulli. The other, called 41, serves snacks and cocktails. Both, inevitably, are booked out. Either way, though, the master chef of the century so far is retiring from the frontline of serving up food. &quot;You can&apos;t win the Oscar every year,&quot; he says. &quot;Even the people who love you will start to say: &apos;Oh no, not them again!&apos; &quot;It is not easy to step down when you are at the top and it may go badly,&quot; he adds. &quot;But at least we will have tried it and have been consistent in our own approach to creativity.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/01/nasdaq-counterbid-nyse-euronext-stock-exchange", "sentences": ["Last October, Singapore Exchange made an $8.3bn bid for Australia&apos;s ASX, regarding a transaction that is still under discussion."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-01T15:33:31Z", "title": "Nasdaq leads $11bn counterbid in heated battle for NYSE Euronext", "tags": ["Nasdaq", "Stock markets", "US news", "London Stock Exchange", "World news", "Business"], "article": "The battle for supremacy in the increasingly global exchanges market has intensified with Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) joining forces to make an unsolicited $11.3bn (\u00a37.1bn) bid for NYSE Euronext \u2013 a few weeks after NYSE agreed a merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. NYSE Euronext said it would &quot;carefully review&quot; the offer before deciding whether to stick with Deutsche B\u00f6rse or switch allegiances to the new suitors. The bid is substantially higher than the $9.5bn all-share deal NYSE agreed with the German exchange group in February \u2013 as well as including a cash component, which may prove attractive to its shareholders. Under the terms of the $42.50-a-share offer ICE, the Atlanta-based derivatives market, would take on NYSE Euronext&apos;s derivatives business, including Liffe, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, Europe&apos;s second largest derivatives market. Nasdaq OMX, the New York technology bourse group, would acquire the stock exchanges in New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, as well as the US options business. Nasdaq and ICE claimed that within the next 12 to 18 months they could cut about $740m from the resulting entities&apos; combined annual operating costs, the bulk of which they said would come from &quot;consolidating platforms&quot;. They declined to comment on likely job losses. Deutsche B\u00f6rse is understood to be considering its options, with analysts split on whether it would increase its previous bid or throw in the towel. The Nasdaq offer is 19% higher than NYSE&apos;s closing price on Thursday night and 27% higher than its valuation before Deutsche B\u00f6rse made its intentions known. Karl Morris, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said: &quot;It&apos;s quite a bold move from Nasdaq and ICE. Certainly I think the premium they&apos;re paying is quite high ... It makes you wonder what Deutsche B\u00f6rse is going to do about this and I struggle to see how they can lift their bid to match.&quot; Dick Grasso, the former NYSE chairman who was forced to quit in 2003 after a row about the size of his $140m pay package, saw things quite differently. &quot;What would you pay for the Mona Lisa? I wouldn&apos;t look at this proposal from Nasdaq to be its final bid,&quot; Grasso told Bloomberg TV. Nasdaq&apos;s chief executive, Robert Greifeld, is &quot;a very capable CEO and isn&apos;t going to put out his final offer because he knows Deutsche B\u00f6rse is going to outbid him&quot;, Grasso added. Nasdaq&apos;s attempts to unseat Deutsche come amid a flurry of deals as bourses attempt to cut costs and offset declining profits from equity trading with options, futures and derivatives platforms. The more companies expand through acquisition, the more they can cut costs and the greater the need for rivals to follow suit so they can continue to compete. Last October, Singapore Exchange made an $8.3bn bid for Australia&apos;s ASX, regarding a transaction that is still under discussion. Meanwhile, in February, London Stock Exchange agreed to buy Canada&apos;s TMX Group  and Deutsche signed its deal with NYSE. Bats Global Markets, the third largest US stock exchange, agreed to buy Chi-X Europe, the continent&apos;s largest alternative trading system. Analysts said proposal could raise questions about competition, since it would unite the two largest US exchanges. However, the deal agreed with Deutsche B\u00f6rse is also expected to raise competition concerns since it would give the resulting entity a huge presence in some parts of European trading. Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said: &quot; The combination of the two leading US exchanges delivers an opportunity to build a global exchange platform that has scale and growth potential to benefit investors, issuers and other market participants. We believe it would increase transparency and liquidity in US markets and create jobs as new companies raise capital.&quot; The offer consists of $14.24 a share in cash, as well as 0.4069 Nasdaq OMX shares and 0.1436 ICE shares for every NYSE Euronext share."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/04/berlin-philharmonic-cinema-3d", "sentences": ["The first film features a performance of Mahler&apos;s First Symphony and Rachmaninov&apos;s Symphonic Dances, recorded in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-04T16:07:45Z", "title": "Berlin Philharmonic comes to British cinemas \u2013 in 3D", "tags": ["Berlin Philharmonic", "3D", "Film", "Arts funding", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "UK news", "Technology"], "article": "When Sir Simon Rattle brought the Berlin Philharmonic to London for a series of rapturously received concerts in February, tickets rapidly disappeared.

The technology aims to give cinemagoers the sensation of not only sitting in the front rows but right among the orchestra, offering close-ups of the virtuoso players. The first film features a performance of Mahler&apos;s First Symphony and Rachmaninov&apos;s Symphonic Dances, recorded in Singapore. Rattle, principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic since 2002, is hoping to replicate the success of opera, ballet and theatre in cinemas. The Metropolitan Opera in New York has reached 1,500 screens in 46 countries and last season tripled its audience, selling a record 2.4m tickets and raising $48m. The latest season looks set to earn $60m, an indication of the potential. Cineworld and Empire are among the UK cinema chains that will show the Berlin Philharmonic concert on 9 May, under the watchful eye of other orchestras. If it proves popular, such concerts could be lucrative as public funding is cut. The initial experiment is a recorded concert, but live performances are next. The concerts could also raise the profile of classical music&apos;s unsung heroes - the rank-and-file musicians overshadowed by soloists and conductors. Stanley Dodds, a violinist with the Berlin Philharmonic, spoke of his excitement: &quot;Nothing of its kind has ever been done before. It gives the feeling of being in an orchestra. When you see the winding tubes of a horn, or a very nice old Italian violin in 3D, you feel you could touch it. You can observe the concentration and intensity of the musicians&apos; facial expressions and body language.&quot; Kate Pidgeon, of Arts Alliance Media, said the UK film distributor had jumped at the chance to take on world-class classical music. The Berlin Philharmonic&apos;s recent concerts in London were sold out and drew rave reviews, suggesting there is a huge potential audience for classical music. She said: &quot;If you live in Derby or Stroud, it&apos;s a big effort to trek to London for a great performance. At your local cinema, you can go to a concert for the price of a cinema ticket rather than hundreds of pounds with travel and hotels.&quot; Days after the Arts Council cut its grants to symphony orchestras, Horace Trubridge of the Musicians&apos; Union spoke of the potential for other orchestras: &quot;UK orchestras are on red alert for any kind of new idea that&apos;s going to help them get through this period.

One analyst described the move as &quot;aggressive&quot; and a likely signal that the bank expects inflation to continue spiralling upwards over the coming months. China has spent the past six months stiffening lending criteria, raising interest rates and insisting banks retain higher capital to limit the escalating level of borrowing, especially by property developers. Inflation has been running within striking distance of a 28-month high of 5.1% that it reached in November. Consumer prices rose 4.9% in February, driven by an 11% jump in food costs. Further moves to clamp down on lending and inflation are expected in the coming months. Markets cooled on the news, as traders digested the likelihood of slower growth in China and its immediate negative impact on global growth. But several analysts said it would provide a more stable mid-term outlook for the Asian economies with a more modestly growing China at its heart. Xu Biao, an economist with China Merchants Bank in Shenzhen, said: &quot;The March inflation figure must be very high, for which the central bank has to increase interest rates. It is an aggressive move, and the central bank is acting more aggressively than the market had expected.

The real money community may use this as a buying opportunity.&quot; Benoit Anne, head of emerging markets strategy at Societe Generale, said the decision was good news in the long run because a calmer Chinese economy was good for sustainable global growth. She said: &quot;This is ultimately good news because it reduces the risk of policy error in China that markets were getting nervous about. It reduces the danger of Chinese policymakers being too dovish and shows them addressing the mounting inflation risk which is a massive tail risk for emerging markets. We will see a few more hikes as China needs more monetary tightening. &quot;Ironically, markets may react negatively in the short term as a Chinese rate hike is associated with the retrenchment of global liquidity and syncs with the debate we&apos;re now having about the appropriate exit strategy for economic stimulus.

Switzerland enforces EU sanctions through its State Secretariat of Economic Affairs [Seco], which is seeking information from Fifa in connection with the reports. &quot;We have requested a number of documents from Fifa about this,&quot; Thomas Graf, the deputy head of Seco&apos;s sanctions department said. &quot;We are waiting for these documents and we will determine if there has been a violation of the sanctions on Myanmar [Burma] or not.&quot; Fifa says it &quot;did not infringe any corresponding regulations, whether from Switzerland or Fifa regulations&quot;. Still, the development may embarrass Fifa&apos;s president, Sepp Blatter, who was the guest of Zaw Zaw and the junta during a visit last month. While there Blatter laid the foundation stone at the Rangoon national youth academy. An article on Fifa&apos;s website referred to this as Myanmar&apos;s Goal IV project, indicating that its Goal project of 2001 and Goal II project of 2004 have been supplemented with two further Fifa-funded construction projects. But although documents for projects I and II are on the Fifa website, it appears to have forgotten to make public details of the two more recent projects. Sky Blue blues Coventry City lost \u00a312m in the first 19 months following their takeover by Sisu Capital in December 2007. Only an \u00a38m cash injection prevented their going into administration last week. Group accounts are more than a month overdue and they are likely to paint a depressing picture when, two years ago\u00a0\u2013 with average attendances 9% higher than today \u2013 the wages-to-turnover ratio was running in excess of\u00a090%. Sisu is considered a pariah by some fans but if the Sky Blues did slip into administration the picture would be bleaker still: what white-knight investor would seek to pick up a club whose only assets are the expensive player contracts? Critically, Coventry do not own their stadium and relegation this season or next would be as catastrophic as it has been for Plymouth Argyle. But there may be some encouragement here. As they are the anchor tenants to the cash-cow \u00a3113m Ricoh Arena, the stadium&apos;s shareholders \u2013 Alan Higgs, Peter Davis, Marilyn Knatchbull-Hugessen and the local council \u2013 rely on the club&apos;s survival. This should give Coventry&apos;s board some leverage in negotiating the purchase of the stadium. With \u00a338m of cuts to its budget from central government, the council may even be a distressed seller, although its deputy leader, George Duggins, told Digger: &quot;Not so distressed a seller that we won&apos;t get proper value for the shares.&quot; All Sisu has to do is come up with the cash. Clubs face hard times Championship clubs are keeping an open mind on the true impact of the \u00a323m slide in the value of their domestic broadcast deal until the Football League&apos;s international-rights negotiations are concluded. A fag-packet calculation suggests each second-tier club will lose \u00a3766,000 a year, every League One club \u00a3115,000 and each League Two club \u00a376,666. However, in practice, what the clubs receive is unequal and the real numbers will only be known when the facility fees \u2013 payments for each on Sky \u2013 are calculated. And here is where the bun fight will be: the most telegenic clubs will attempt to claw back the losses in guaranteed income by raising the facility fees. A \u00a323m reduction in income cannot come without rancour. Questionable legacy At the Sports Journalists&apos; Association question time on Tuesday night London 2012&apos;s chief executive Paul Deighton, left, cited two pension funds&apos; \u00a3871.5m deal to buy half of the Stratford City retail development as real evidence of the Games&apos; legacy.

Ministers are investigating tactics to &quot;nudge&quot; people into abandoning the rush hour, such as convincing train, tube and bus companies to offer bigger discounts for travelling outside the busiest hours. Instead of just peak and off-peak fares, the price of a journey could be staggered incrementally, with the most expensive fares around the times of 9am and 5pm. The system could be organised so that a 6.30am fare is cheaper than a 7.30am fare, for instance. &quot;It is crazy these days for people to go to work when work can come to people. It is even crazier that we all travel on the same train on the same day at the same time. We should be able to spread the peak across different times,&quot; Baker said. The plan would reduce carbon emissions, but ministers are also warning that there is urgency to fast-track changes to the rush hour because of the Olympics, warning that it would be &quot;impossible&quot; for the capital to accommodate the visitors anticipated for the games as well as going about its business as usual. Baker said: &quot;We are going to have a gigantic influx of people all wanting to travel to see their events and it is simply not possible for everything to keep running if every one carries on as normal, so you have got to work differently to do this.&quot; &quot;This is not just the Olympics. It is winter too. Should business shut down when it snows? No. Should government spend taxpayers&apos; money investing in hundreds of snow ploughs? No. We should make sure we can carry on in business and government without everyone needing to travel in that period.&quot; Options being considered include new &quot;office hubs&quot; in rural areas which would allow people to hotdesk closer to home. Some might have childcare facilities attached in &quot;co-working&quot; zones. Flexi-working, late or early starts, could stagger the rush hour and give people a greater work-life balance. More video-conferencing might mean people don&apos;t have to leave home at all. The Trades Union Congress is backing the consultation. A TUC spokesman said they were pleased the minister was taking an interest. Staggering payments to encourage people to travel outside rush hour have been most stringently applied in Singapore, which also began the first road-pricing scheme in 1975. The system adjusts the price according to how busy the roads are at the time of driving. Singapore also has some of the world&apos;s highest car taxes, and new cars are rationed in a bid to keep the state, the size of the Isle of Wight and having 4 million residents, congestion free."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/07/green-bankers-city-reputation", "sentences": ["We will be seriously tested by other ambitious financial capitals, including cities that missed out the first time round, such as New York, Chicago and Sydney, or by those that have identified this as a key growth area, such as Frankfurt, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-07T10:45:37Z", "title": "Green bankers can help to restore City's reputation  | Ben Caldecott", "tags": ["Green economy", "Green jobs", "Environment", "Banking", "Business"], "article": "After the events that led to the credit crunch and our current fiscal situation, the last thing people want is more bankers. But what if they were green bankers? Green bankers could lead a new approach to finance, helping Britain earn its way in a competitive global economy while supporting the entrepreneurs and businesses that are going to deliver a more sustainable future for everyone. Restoring financial services, especially in London, as a key driver of Britain&apos;s economic success should be in all of our interests. Not only does a successful financial services sector buoy tax receipts, but a thriving financial capital underpins growth by creating high-value jobs and economic activity throughout the country. For the last 45 years, the trade in financial services has brought a large surplus of money into the UK - even during the crash - despite the overall balance of payments having been negative for the last 25 years. So as we look for a way to create a sustainable economic recovery, it would be hard to ignore the potential role of financial services. In the same way that London has played a leading role in financing international industrialisation and development, we can do the same for the capital-intensive global transition to a low-carbon and sustainable economy. Although this sector is immature, the international market on which it is based is already large and growing rapidly. According to a recent Bloomberg/Pew Center report on global clean energy investment, there was a record $243bn worth of finance and investment in 2010. In Europe, \u20ac1 trillion of energy infrastructure investment is estimated to be required in this decade alone and globally, $46tr in additional investment is thought to be required by 2050 to tackle climate change. British efforts to gain market share in these large and growing green markets should extend to every sector, from services to manufacturing to R&amp;D. But we are lucky that in financial services Britain&apos;s capital has an excellent foundation on which to build. London is already the world&apos;s leading green financial capital, but this privileged position was achieved almost entirely by accident. As the largest financial centre within the European Union emissions trading scheme (ETS) and being part of a developed country that unlike the US signed the Kyoto protocol, London by default became the centre of both the EU and international carbon market. Another critical factor has been the active promotion of green and climate change-related policies by successive British and EU governments. Not only does this create a plethora of green investment opportunities in a large and close hinterland - the European market - that can be accessed by London based professionals, but it also means that London has become a leading green policy hub and ideas machine. Green policy ideas started by London&apos;s thinktanks, NGOs, and academic institutions are quickly picked up by UK politicians, disseminated through London&apos;s international media hub and then promoted in other European member states and internationally. Britain can be proud of this nexus of green innovation. But London&apos;s promising start in this new sector could be successfully challenged. We will be seriously tested by other ambitious financial capitals, including cities that missed out the first time round, such as New York, Chicago and Sydney, or by those that have identified this as a key growth area, such as Frankfurt, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. That&apos;s an intimidating mix of competitors by any standard. So what can we do to support this early success? An essential prerequisite is sustaining the capital&apos;s overall health as a financial centre, for example, by ensuring London is a well-regulated and affordable place to do business. But beyond these generic factors we can and must do more. The UK government and London mayor can directly and indirectly help. They must ensure that pioneering policies in the UK and Europe are successful, such as the EU ETS, new schemes to enable private investment in energy efficiency (the &quot;green deal&quot;) and renewable heat (the renewable heat incentive). New initiatives, such as the Capital markets climate initiative launched by Greg Barker, a UK climate change minister, need to become successful long-term platforms for policy-makers and financiers to come together and help create solutions to climate change. Government can also make sure that London&apos;s academic innovators in the climate change space, such as Imperial College, get the technology research funding they need to succeed. The greenest Olympics ever and the Olympic legacy can also be designed to support green and low-carbon entrepreneurs. In addition to these efforts, we must quickly send the right signals to businesses and investors that London is serious about success. The new UK green investment bank should be located in the capital, for example, and London&apos;s newly promised enterprise zone should be designed to attract and support green innovators over the long term. These measures can help keep London ahead of the game and support our economic recovery. This will help Britain earn its way in the world, transform our planet for the better and, just perhaps, salvage something of the reputation of bankers. \u2022 Ben Caldecott is the head of European policy at Climate Change Capital"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/07/paul-octopus-euro-2012-pavlik", "sentences": ["The octopus is very unusual, Zhilenko explained, being small in size but well-suited to the task ahead: &quot;Pavlik weights only 300 grams, but he can raise aquarium decorations, weighing 10 kilograms with the help of his tentacles.&quot; The octopus came to Ukraine from Singapore (there is currently no information on his parentage but the chances of it being traced back to Weymouth, as with Paul, seem slim) and is housed in perfect conditions in Alushta&apos;s zoo, with a huge aquarium and fresh muscles and crabs for breakfast every day."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-07T12:15:01Z", "title": "Paul The Octopus finds psychic successor as Pavlik tips for Euro 2012", "tags": ["Paul the 'psychic' octopus", "Football", "Euro 2012", "Sport"], "article": "Commemorated as the ultimate psychic cephalopod in January when a statue was unveiled at his Sea Life Aquarium in Oberhausen, Germany, Paul The Octopus brought mussel-munching match-predictions to the masses during the 2010 World Cup.

Unlike the battle against the Taliban, this uprising receives little international attention, although it is set against the backdrop of competing superpower interests, reminiscent of the Great Game when Russia and the British empire fought for control over this region. Eight years ago, the dream was for the small fishing port of Gwadar in Pakistan&apos;s Balochistan province to be transformed into a duty-free port and a free economic zone. The hope was that Gwadar would become a regional hub of shipping, commercial and industrial activities, providing a link between Pakistan and the vast oil and gas reserves of central Asia. A real estate frenzy followed as land was bought from locals at exorbitant prices. Billboards proclaiming future housing estates and resorts were put up overnight and work began on the port with Chinese help. A two-lane highway linking Gwadar with Karachi was completed in record time. Today, the port has been finished and is ready for ships but Gwadar looks more like a ghost town than a gold-rush town. Empty plots of land still await the buildings that were promised but never built. Oddly enough, instead of handing the port over to the Chinese government, it was leased out to the Singapore government three years ago. It is only used at half its capacity and the cranes are already getting rusty from lack of use. Located near an important shipping lane, the deep seaport was built by the China Harbour Engineering Company Group. The Chinese government invested heavily in this project, up to $200m some say, so that landlocked western China could benefit from access to the sea. As an emerging superpower hungry for energy, China needs access to the oil and gas rich Central Asian states. The Chinese have also been keen to assist Pakistan in building other roads to acquire a 3,500km link between Kashgar (near the border with Pakistan) and Gwadar. They are currently helping the Pakistan government to widen the Karakoram highway that connects Islamabad to China through Pakistan&apos;s high mountain ranges. It appears that there is a long-term plan to eventually connect the Karakoram highway with Gwadar. This is upsetting the other emerging superpower of the region, India, who does not want China&apos;s security establishment to have safe passage to the Arabian Sea. The fear they have been articulating is that Gwadar might become a naval outpost for the Chinese. The local people, who hoped to benefit from the construction of the port, are crushed by the disappointing turn of events. &quot;We were expecting change to come,&quot; says Asghar Shah, a local resident who works for an NGO. &quot;But it was a big let down \u2013 we are victims of the new Great Game.&quot; The government of Pakistan was allegedly pressured not to hand the port over to the Chinese. In fact, the Americans eye Gwadar as a potential military base, given the proximity of Iran. The locals are reluctant to criticise their government&apos;s handling of Gwadar, though. &quot;People disappear in Gwadar \u2013 their bodies are found dumped in a remote area a few days or weeks later. No one knows who is behind it,&quot; says Asghar Shah, refusing to speculate further. There is a more immediate problem at present. The Baloch nationalists are opposed to any development in Gwadar because they say these mega projects will marginalise the local Baloch population. Balochistan&apos;s development record is dismal. Covering nearly 350,000 square kilometres, it is by far the largest province in the country but houses less than 7% of Pakistan&apos;s population. The basic quality of life indicators are abysmal. On-tap drinking water is available to less than 5% of the population. The female literacy rate is under 15%. The Baloch people are demanding more autonomy for the province. For decades, Pakistan&apos;s Balochistan province has been the scene of sporadic clashes between government troops and guerrillas who are fighting for autonomy. In the past few years, the rebels have again stepped up their attacks. Government troops and installations across the province have come under rocket attack and bombings, especially Gwadar town. Last month, seven army personnel and three labourers building a road near the Iranian border were killed by unidentified gunmen. The Baloch nationalists fear that if Gwadar grows into a modern city, the Baloch people will become a minority in their own province. No one is quite sure who is funding them, but there are rumours that they get support from India. Gwadar is today a deserted town where outsiders are looked upon with suspicion. Most of the educated young people have moved out to look for jobs in the other big towns and cities of Pakistan. The new and luxurious Pearl Continental Hotel built on a cliff overlooking the port and the town below is empty \u2013 it has been closed down for &quot;renovations&quot;. The road leading to the small airport outside the town is heavily guarded by security forces. There are no tourists now \u2013 most have been scared off by the attacks. Foreigners do not dare to venture here either. For centuries, Gwadar has also been a smuggler&apos;s paradise \u2013 it was once infamous for its human trafficking in slaves and it is still a place where illegal immigrants are smuggled into the Middle East and beyond. The idea had been to capitalise on its location, but the dream of Gwadar remains just that. Pakistan&apos;s strategic location as a gateway to the oil and gas riches of central Asia means that it will remain a battleground for competing interests for the foreseeable future.

The double world championship\u2011winning team prepared for the new season in the chill of a lakeside winter boot camp near Milton Keynes. If they can survive Milton Keynes, the logic seems to be, they can survive anything. &quot;It was a very good team-building exercise,&quot; Christian Horner, their team principal, said. &quot;The race team had to build a bivouac and carry an injured colleague back to base camp and make him a cup of tea with only a piece of wood and a stone, or something like that. &quot;It worked very well because we could mix up all the car groups. I think 45 people went on that. We threw the engineers in as well because it&apos;s important for them, as well, to be able to make a cup of tea. &quot;Mark&apos;s No1 mechanic [Mark &apos;Crunch&apos; Lenton works for Mark Webber] was the guy with the &apos;broken leg&apos; who had to be carried home by people from Sebastian&apos;s [Vettel] car. Everybody you see in the pit lane, 25 or 26 people who are employed on both cars, were there.&quot; Quite what relevance all that has in Malaysia, where it is hot enough to make Shadrach croak for water, is not immediately apparent. But it is clearly not just the design wizardry of Adrian Newey, and the unique set-up of the car, that Red Bull hope will give them an edge this season. For the 2010 season the team had a different type of preparation at the English Institute of Sport in Marlow, where they worked with Olympic coaches. &quot;Last year we had a fantastic facility at Bisham Abbey,&quot; the team manager, John Wheatley, said. &quot;But it only appealed to 75% of the guys. For 25% it was too physical. We&apos;re not all athletes. I believe McLaren went to Bisham Abbey this year, thinking it was the magic ingredient. &quot;So we decided to try something else this winter and we did the bespoke boot camp course. The guys are so competitive that lots of things went wrong and people were dropped in the water and things like that. Last year we kept it quite secret until a couple of the guys phoned in to the Chris Evans radio show and told him: &apos;We&apos;re the Red Bull team and we&apos;re on the way to Bisham Abbey to do a boot camp.&apos; I don&apos;t think anyone knew anything about it until then. But these boot camps are really worthwhile. The mechanics started work here at eight this morning and they will work on until three in the morning, so it&apos;s a long shift.&quot; Indeed, it all seemed to pay off on Friday. Webber, who was so disappointing in his native Australia in the season&apos;s opening race two weeks ago, was fastest in both practice sessions here, though in the second he was given a run for his considerable money by Jenson Button. The McLarens of Button and Lewis Hamilton split the Red Bulls of Webber and Vettel, with the top four drivers separated by just 0.25sec in the afternoon session. &quot;It&apos;s been a good and productive day for us. We had to sort out the tyres, and learn their different characteristics and it will be fascinating to see how it works out over the rest of the weekend,&quot; said Horner. Horner, however, does not see a repeat of Melbourne, where Vettel was almost a second faster than Webber in qualifying before totally dominating the race. &quot;Last season the average gap between the two was just under two tenths of a second. We did see some differences, like in Singapore, where that gap was exaggerated. But Mark has always done well here and I expect him to be in good form this weekend. &quot;Seb was in electrifying form in Melbourne. I think there was a set-up direction that Mark went in that was a little bit different to the one Seb went in and then there was the small issue with the rear damper. &quot;Melbourne has never been a particularly great event for Mark. It&apos;s almost been a bogey circuit for him. So he won&apos;t be dwelling on Melbourne. He will be very, much focused on this weekend on a track where he has always gone well at.&quot; However, Button was also chipper. &quot;I think we&apos;re closer to Red Bull than we were last year at this point of the season, surprisingly,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be a runaway for them at all, which is great. &quot;They were out on their own, really, in the first race. I think here it will be a different story. In the heat and the humidity it will be lot more mixed up. So I think for the fans and the viewers and everybody involved it&apos;s going to be a much more exciting race than we saw in Melbourne.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/10/restaurant-review-manhattan-transfer", "sentences": ["I adore laksas \u2013 those chilli-spiked, coconut milk-slicked noodle soups from Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-09T23:05:00Z", "title": "Restaurant review: Spice Market, London", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants", "Restaurants", "Life and style", "Travel"], "article": "Spice Market, 10 Wardour Street, London W1 (020 7758 1088). Meal for two, including wine and service \u00a3140  At the southwestern corner of Central Park in Manhattan is a glorious restaurant called Jean Georges, where nothing bad can ever happen. It is the flagship, high-end outpost of the Alsatian chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten&apos;s empire and, while it costs about the same as a Portuguese bail-out to eat there, the food is so good it&apos;s hard to begrudge the bill. There is a very specific, clean palate to the cooking, which is full of perfectly balanced spice and acidity. Sadly, this is not a review of that restaurant. It is a review of Spice Market, one of Vongerichten&apos;s &quot;diffusion brands&quot; which has just been imported from New York to a flash new hotel on the corner of Leicester Square. Jean Georges is all subtle tones and grown-up elegance. Spice Market is meant to be all lounge vibe, downlighters and open kitchens, the food a Pan-Asian crash and clatter. Or, as the website puts it: &quot;with each new dish patrons are transported to the idealisation of a Vietnamese street market or a Thai food stall&quot;. Oh that this were true; time and again I wished I could indeed be transported to anywhere else but here. It feels as if it is targeted at those crashing the corporate plastic, or the sort of crowd who wouldn&apos;t care what they were being fed, as long as they were properly back lit. It comes with the usual stupidities of such places. There was, for example, the refusal to sell me a glass of sparkling water because they only do it by the large bottle. Our table in the downstairs bar area was so low that if I positioned my feet beneath my knees, I lifted the whole thing up five inches. We asked to be moved and were taken upstairs to the restaurant I assumed I had booked into, a space of heavy tables and curved booths filled with scatter cushions I immediately scattered so I could sit comfortably. We ate one good dish: crisp, warm samosas filled with a lightly spiced minced chicken and a mint raita for dipping. A bowl of ginger rice with a fried egg wasn&apos;t bad either. The rest worked on that carefully calibrated scale between awful and mediocre. The worst concoction was a salmon tartar with avocado and radish in a ginger broth. A version of this is a key dish at Jean Georges, where it features tuna. This was a\u00a0take on it, though only as if realised by someone who has merely read about it. The raw fish needs texture. Here the salmon is blitzed unto slop. It sits on a mush of avocado, surrounded by a dribble of the ginger broth which is one note rather than the operatic composition of the original. Eating it felt like meeting an old friend down on his luck. Yours for \u00a310.50. Four small slices of sea bass sashimi dressed with green chilli, pistachio and mint \u2013 \u00a318 \u2013 are one long gastronomic shrug. And so it goes on. I adore laksas \u2013 those chilli-spiked, coconut milk-slicked noodle soups from Singapore. A place in Farringdon does a brilliant one for \u00a38. Here it costs \u00a322 and is merely workmanlike. Two giant seared prawns, left to rest in the soup, had gone mushy. Onion and chilli-crusted beef short ribs with egg noodles and pea shoots sounds lovely. Sadly that menu description is the high point. The meat was tender, all right. Then again if you braised me long enough I would be, too. It was completely lacking in flavour. By dessert we had lost the will to carry on and so ordered their bag of cookies \u2013 three very large ones for \u00a36 which, unlike everything else, didn&apos;t feel like a total rip off. Plus the bag gave us the option of eating them elsewhere. With a \u00a328 bottle of South African sauvignon blanc, we had run up a bill of over \u00a3140. Far better versions of all these dishes can be found at a third of the price elsewhere in London. As we left I consoled myself with a single thought: this is one restaurant I will never have to visit again.

Faced with a threat of swingeing reforms, Britain&apos;s top financial institutions have been hinting they&apos;re in Britain out of choice, not duty, and could move elsewhere. A five-strong independent commission chaired by Sir John Vickers will tomorrow deliver its interim findings on the shape of the financial industry. The panel is likely to urge chancellor George Osborne to force a degree of separation between banks&apos; high-street branches and their City trading floors. HSBC is in the middle of a triannual review of where it wants to be based. Headquartered in London since 1992, is looking into a return to Hong Kong and is even reported to be receiving overtures from Paris. Chairman Douglas Flint says HSBC&apos;s review of where it wants to be based is a dispassionate one: &quot;If you were coming down from Mars with our business configuration, where would you seek to place the international headquarters?&quot; Meanwhile, Barclays, under US-born chief executive Bob Diamond, is being buttered up by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who declared that it would be &quot;great&quot; if the British bank relocated to the Big Apple. Analysts at UBS wrote last week that Barclays may soon have &quot;little option&quot; but to consider shifting its domicile. But Diamond says: &quot;London is where we want to be. Of course it&apos;s our obligation on behalf of shareholders to look at the alternatives, but this is home and where we want to stay.&quot; Lloyds and RBS would struggle to justify leaving as they are partly owned by British taxpayers. But Standard Chartered has no such obligation. Its chief executive, Peter Sands, said a year ago that the \u00a32.5bn levy on banks&apos; balance sheets meant relocation was &quot;something we have to think about&quot;. The departure of any bank is not to be taken lightly. Banks contributed \u00a353.4bn in taxes in the year to March 2010, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, and financial services support a million jobs. Even in business circles, a departure would be controversial: Andrew Witty of GlaxoSmithKline said recently that the disloyalty of businesses that regard themselves as &quot;mid-Atlantic floating entities&quot; dangerously erodes public trust in big corporations. Others are not worried. Ian Mulheirn of the Social Market Foundation says our economy has been &quot;lopsided&quot; for years, with a bulging financial sector keeping sterling strong to the detriment of exporters. &quot;The government should be ambivalent,&quot; he says. &quot;The tax take, in future, would come from other profitable industries which have been crowded out.&quot; So, as a public service to wavering bankers, we have put together a handy guide to alternative bases \u2013 including eateries where our relocated financiers could offload part of that hefty bonus. DUBAI PROS Spending money is Dubai&apos;s pleasure. Far from sneering at huge bonuses, Dubai celebrates such excess. The Mall of the Emirates is great for shopping \u2013 or for skiing; it houses an artificial slope. It was the world&apos;s largest shopping centre until the Dubai Mall opened three years ago. There are ultra-low taxes, great beaches and good golf, and Dubai is keen to attract investment: it has set up &quot;free zones&quot; exempt from corporation tax for 15 years. CONS The possibility of a jail term for indulging in public shows of affection is off-putting, but it is the night-time traffic in Dubai that is the city&apos;s most unappealing characteristic. The automated metro network is not yet fully operational and tailbacks make driving infuriatingly slow. Furthermore, the brittle nature of Dubai&apos;s rapidly acquired wealth was evident during the financial crisis when it needed a $10bn bailout from its neighbour, Abu Dhabi. And Dubai is not ideal for fair-skinned types prone to sunburn. WEEKEND GETAWAY The Maldives are a short hop away, and so too is Goa.

Alongside Ferran Adri\u00e0, head chef at El Bulli, and Carme Ruscalleda, of Sant Pau, Santamaria was one of the leading figures in the huge boom in Catalan cuisine over the past 20 years. Like them, he not only provided excellent food, but knew how to publicise his restaurants and books. Catalan cuisine is based on traditional Mediterranean cooking and Catalonia&apos;s position as a crossroads between France and Spain, with strong Italian influence. Its mountains run sharply down into the sea, which has created original combinations of food from land\u00a0and sea. Born in the small town of Sant Celoni, on the slopes of the Montseny hills some 40 miles north of Barcelona, Santamaria studied technical drawing, but was diverted quickly into cooking by his love of food. In 1981, he and Angels Serra (whom he married the following year) opened a restaurant in the 250-year-old farmhouse where Santamaria was born, El Rac\u00f3 de Can Fabes. It was just the moment for an haute cuisine restaurant. In Spain, emerging from 40 years of dictatorship, a new middle class with money to spend was out to throw off repression. Hedonism was on the menu. Can Fabes won its first Michelin star in 1988 and, in 1994, became the first Catalan restaurant to be awarded three stars. It was the first in a small chain of restaurants, which accumulated seven Michelin stars in all: Santceloni in Madrid (two stars), Tierra in Toledo (one star) and Evo in l&apos;Hospitalet (one star). Evo opened in the five-star Hesperia hotel designed by Richard Rogers and completed in 2006. The restaurant, beside the highway from the airport into Barcelona, fills the top floor under a\u00a0glass dome and enjoys panoramic views over the city. In 2008, Santamaria opened Ossiano, a restaurant in Dubai, where he mixed Arab and western tastes; and, last August, his final project, Santi, in Singapore, managed by his daughter Regina. The six restaurants employ 170 people. In his hyperactive decade since 2000, Santamaria put his name to nine books. These included three selections of the weekly articles and recipes he published in the Sunday supplement of la Vanguardia newspaper. He was also a cook with literary interests: his Santi Santamaria Entre Llibres i Fogons (Santi Santamaria Between Books and Stoves, 2005) selected 55 works of 20th-century Catalan literature with references to food, quoting the extracts alongside their recipes. Like all his books, it showed his strong pride in Catalan culture and his insistence that cuisine was a vital part of that culture. In 2008 he published La Cocina al Desnudo (Cooking Laid Bare), provoking huge controversy. Conventionally enough, he lamented the rise of fast food and the decline of healthy Mediterranean cooking. But then he attacked the &quot;molecular or techno-emotional cooking, promoted by Ferran Adri\u00e0 ... that fills our plates with gelling agents, stabilisers and laboratory emulgents&quot;. To Adri\u00e0&apos;s use of colorants and taste enhancers, Santamaria counterposed traditional Catalan cuisine, emphasising that Can Fabes used local, seasonal produce. Lamb and mushrooms came from the Montseny, truffles from Vic, fish from the daily auction at Blanes: he bought directly from local producers. The row with Adri\u00e0 split Spanish chefs and food journalists. Followers of Santamaria insisted on the ethics of traditional values, flayed the agro\u2011food industry and implied that Adri\u00e0&apos;s food could even be a health hazard; while Adri\u00e0&apos;s supporters underlined his originality and daring, even comparing his outrageous taste experiences with Salvador Dal\u00ed&apos;s art provocations. Santamaria was a bon vivant, passionate and hardworking, with a caustic humour that kept his feet on the ground. &quot;We chefs,&quot; he said recently, &quot;are a bunch of fakes who work to entertain snobs and make ourselves a fortune.&quot; Santamaria is survived by Angels, their son Pau and daughter Regina, all three chefs. They intend to carry on the family businesses. \u2022 Santiago Santamaria i Puig, chef, born 26 July 1957; died 16 February 2011"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/10/british-banker-killed-singapore-hotel", "sentences": ["A British banker has died after falling from the rooftop bar of a hotel in Singapore.", "William Hart, who is believed to have been the head of sales at Bank of China International in Singapore, fell from the seventh floor of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, in the city state&apos;s Marina Bay area, on Thursday evening.", "His body was found several hours later after emergency services searched the Singapore river, and he was declared dead at the scene.", "A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: &quot;We can confirm the death of a British national in Singapore on 7 April."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-10T18:22:33Z", "title": "British banker killed in fall from Singapore hotel rooftop bar", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "A British banker has died after falling from the rooftop bar of a hotel in Singapore.

Four decades after his songs became anthems for America&apos;s anti-Vietnam war movement, the folk legend appeared at a half-empty venue in Ho Chi Minh City. Dylan was making his first visit to the city once known as Saigon, performing at the 8,000-seat RMIT University. Although thousands of locals and ex-pats bought tickets for the concert, around half the tickets went unsold, according to the Associated Press. The singer is not well known among Vietnamese youth, the BBC reports, and half of the country&apos;s 87 million people are under 30. As in China, where Dylan appeared in Beijing and Shanghai last week, the 69-year-old had to vet his setlist with government officials. Vietnam&apos;s communist government does not often welcome major western acts, and maintains stringent controls over what music they perform. But though promoter Rod Quinton said no restrictions had been imposed, the songs Dylan chose were hardly controversial. Despite a handful of 60s classics, such as All Along the Watchtower and Highway 61 Revisited, there was no sign of Blowin&apos; in the Wind or The Times They Are a-Changin&apos;, and Dylan&apos;s setlist leaned heavily on recent tunes. He closed the show with a rendition of 1974&apos;s Forever Young. To the consternation of human rights groups, Dylan has refused to address political issues since arriving in Asia. &quot;[He] should be ashamed of himself,&quot; said Brad Adams, executive director of the US wing of Human Rights Watch. &quot;[Dylan] has a historic chance to communicate a message of freedom and hope, but instead he is allowing censors to choose his playlist.&quot; While Dylan made international headlines at Sunday&apos;s gig, a &quot;significant part of the concert&quot; was dedicated to Vietnamese songwriter Trinh Cong Son, according to the president of RMIT University. Local musicians opened the show with a performance of 15 of Son&apos;s compositions. &quot;As part of this year&apos;s 10th anniversary commemoration of the death of Trinh Cong Son, we felt it would be a very good way to introduce more foreigners and more of the younger generation of Vietnamese to one of Vietnam&apos;s great modern literary and musical figures,&quot; Merilyn Liddell explained.

While arguably well-intentioned, the previous Labour government&apos;s preoccupation with getting more young people to university may be partly to blame. For some, vocational routes such as apprenticeships are still seen as &quot;second best&quot; to academic qualifications. But the tide may be turning. The government is planning to open University Technical Colleges, where pupils can attend from the age of 14 to do work-based learning alongside core academic studies such as English, maths and science. It has also pledged to create more than 100,000 additional apprenticeships over the next five years and introduce nationally recognised standards (known as the Apprenticeship Standards for England) for all new apprentices. A recent debate on vocational skills, hosted by the Guardian in association with WorldSkills London 2011, discussed some of the key issues around vocational skills and apprenticeships in the UK and abroad. The discussion was held under Chatham House rules, which allow comments to be reported without attribution to encourage full and frank debate. The points raised included: the challenge of convincing employers, parents and young people to value apprenticeships and vocational learning; the importance of competitions in raising the profile of skills; the need to raise awareness of NVQ level 4 and level 5 (equivalent to degree level) awards; and the role of WorldSkills London 2011 in promoting vocational careers and qualifications. While the mainstream media is keen to report on so-called academic qualifications, there is often little interest in vocational courses. &quot;When you say things like BTec their [journalists&apos;] eyes glaze over,&quot; said one participant. &quot;They don&apos;t understand what these lists of qualifications are, so they think it&apos;s not something children do. It is part of the big social divide in this country, one that has held us back hugely.&quot; &quot;There are too many &apos;hidden secrets&apos; in our colleges and in our training system and we have to do something about it,&quot; said another contributor. A foundation for life One of the biggest barriers is the stereotype that vocational courses are for those who aren&apos;t very bright or have failed at school. One participant, a former apprentice, said that his mother (a senior teacher) was disappointed when he announced he wanted to learn a trade after his A-levels. But an apprenticeship is only the beginning, said one participant. &quot;It&apos;s actually the gateway, a foundation for the rest of your life. If you tell people that a third of the board at BT started as apprentices or that Terry Morgan, who chairs Crossrail, started off as a Land Rover apprentice, they start to see things differently.&quot; The roundtable heard that many people are unaware of the career prospects and earning potential of apprentices, which can far outstrip that of graduates. According to a Department for Education and Skills study carried out in 2007, those with a level-2 apprenticeship (equivalent to GCSE) earn in excess of \u00a373,000 more over their lifetime compared with those who have other level-2 qualifications or below. Young people and their parents are often unaware that vocational courses go beyond level 3 and 4 (A-level equivalent) because that is primarily what is on offer in colleges. In fact, there are opportunities to progress to levels 4, 5 and 6 (degree equivalent and beyond) and participants shared the view that promoting these qualifications could help boost the image of vocational careers. To encourage young people to consider vocational learning, it is necessary to reach out to parents and teachers, it was said. And to do that, they really need to see skilled people in action. &quot;Instead of having their mum and dad or an employer telling them not to be a welder because they will get dirty, we need them to see [someone doing the work] and say &apos;hey, that&apos;s really cool&apos;,&quot; said one participant. The WorldSkills London 2011 competition, from 5-8 October, is an opportunity to do just that. The event, which is expected to attract up to 150,000 visitors, brings together young people from across the globe to compete in their chosen specialism, from plumbing and plastering to jewellery making and web design. In the run-up to the competition, there will be opportunities to try out various skills at different locations in the UK, giving young people the chance to find out about vocational careers. The concept of competition should be at the heart of vocational learning \u2013 and not just for one-off events \u2013 said one participant. &quot;Skills competitions should not be an end in themselves, but part of the process. We need young people to be hooked on skills competitions, so colleges can use this to excite them about learning and raise\u00a0aspirations.&quot; But as another pointed out, only a relatively small number of colleges in England are regularly involved in competitions. This could be due to the UK&apos;s ambivalence about competition, which is embedded at an early age, the roundtable heard. One participant felt this was taking its toll. &quot;There is no competitiveness in youngsters now; it has been knocked out of\u00a0them.&quot; As well as capturing the interest of teachers, young people and their families, the WorldSkills London 2011 competition also offers an opportunity to generate interest among employers, a group that are notoriously difficult to engage, particularly those in small and medium-sized businesses, many of whom worry they will not see a return on their investment in training. &quot;So often the attitude is: &apos;I don&apos;t know anything about it, but I feel sure it&apos;s not right for me,&apos;&quot; said one participant. Social responsibility But this is changing, said another: &quot;There is real momentum gathering now around getting employers to understand that apprenticeships are not about youth unemployment or corporate social responsibility. It is about hard-nosed business decisions, about skilling your workforce to build a competitive advantage for your business.&quot; This is replicated in bluechip companies, where there has also been a big cultural shift, it was said: &quot;It used to be that the guy who looked after apprentices was the guy who had been there for 20 years and who was going nowhere. That has changed. Now it&apos;s part of learning and development and you&apos;ll find the graduate and apprenticeship manager have equal status.&quot; This shift in culture has been reflected in takeup. BT is said to be considering expanding its apprenticeship scheme after attracting almost 24,000 applicants for 221 positions last year. And both IBM and Nexus (the transport company that owns the Tyne and Wear Metro) have recently launched apprenticeship schemes. But there is a lot to learn from the competition, from countries such as South Korea, Singapore and Finland, which have an excellent record on skills, the roundtable heard. Korea gets more than 10,000 students involved in its regional skills competitions. Medal winners are treated like the stars of TV talent\u00a0shows. Singapore has worked hard to challenge the idea that young people have to go to university to get on in life. &quot;Now young people go and get a skill or a trade that ultimately might lead to university, because learning leads to learning,&quot; said one participant. Another spoke about Finland, which tops the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) rankings, which measures the performance of 15-year-olds in reading and maths. It recently developed a programme where young people were given a free backpack with information about vocational careers, which came with a train ticket to Helsinki to see skills demonstrations in action. The result was a 70% increase in vocational training. As one participant put it: &quot;It&apos;s all about going out there and telling the story; the dream, the struggle and the prize. Promote the prize and the struggle becomes less significant.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/apr/12/english-baccalaureate-ebacc-pressure", "sentences": ["Singapore is held up as a beacon."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-12T06:30:00Z", "title": "Ebacc is more pressure on children and parents", "tags": ["English baccalaureate", "National curriculum", "GCSEs", "Schools", "Education", "Education policy", "Politics", "Exams"], "article": "When I was 18, I went to America for a gap year. It was the dark ages in terms of modern technology and I spent 10 months without speaking to my parents, corresponding intermittently by post. True, I had left school, but this followed teenage years punctuated by equally rare moments of parental involvement. The occasional school meeting maybe, but nothing like the intense engagement parents today have with their children&apos;s lives. I pity today&apos;s parents. They seem to feel judged more than ever by their children&apos;s achievements. Sites like Mumsnet suggest this starts from birth, when subtle pressure over the &quot;right&quot; sleeping and feeding routines kicks in, followed by fretfulness over how many numbers or words their toddlers know, which primary reading scheme levels they are on, the range of extra-curricular activities they do, school, and even university choice. I can&apos;t think of a time when parents seemed so anxious and unconfident in their own instincts or their children&apos;s abilities. Does the government understand this? Public statements invariably focus on supporting and informing parents, but these seem to mask a subliminal desire to pile on the pressure, in the secret knowledge that this will help smooth the path for more extreme reform. Why else would ministers laud the educational success of other countries, then introduce the diametric opposite here? We must be like Finland, yet we devise ever more impenetrable league tables, when Finland has none, and phonics tests at an age when Finnish children have barely started formal education. Singapore is held up as a beacon. Yet life skills lie at the heart of its broad curriculum, while our children are now judged on a handful of exam passes in a limited range of subjects. This is laughingly called a &quot;baccalaureate&quot; even though it has nothing in common with other international qualifications bearing the same name, most of which offer varied pathways and stimulate personal growth and civic engagement. The English baccalaureate (Ebacc) and the response to it threaten to become the most deadly new development parents must wrestle with. Like so many proposals, it is superficially attractive, carrying in its wake the promise that schools will no longer play the league tables using GCSE-equivalent qualifications and that all children can be swept into high-status universities and academic degrees. In fact, it is already encouraging a different sort of game; schools all over the country are changing GCSE options in the middle of key stage 4, which means forcing pupils into twilight sessions in subjects they hadn&apos;t chosen to study and downgrading subjects they may want to. One parent emailed me in despair to say his daughter was being forced to take English baccalaureate subjects as her year 9 options against her wishes. &quot;We feel this is bullying on behalf of the school, using my daughter for their selfish ends to boost their statistics,&quot; he wrote. Professional organisations and even grammar school heads are now predicting where this might end, with the diminution of RE, creative arts and music, a reduced offer at A-level and possible redundancies. Some schools, like the Archbishop Sentamu academy in Hull, are refusing to make precipitous changes and are developing a &quot;suite&quot; of different baccalaureates, backed by an excellent new campaign, the Better Bac, which is trying to define what a more inclusive baccalaureate might look like. But others, like the government&apos;s flagship West London Free School, have headteachers who cheerfully boast that their curriculum may not be appropriate for all children. An honest appraisal, but unlikely to reassure parents choosing schools for 10-year-olds who may not have a clue about where their interests or aptitudes lie. And what about the children \u2013 should they have a say in what they might want to learn? Seemingly not. It could all be different. We could offer a measure of school accountability that embraces the full range of what schools do well, and demands a breadth of high-quality options so that no parent or pupil feels bullied or disadvantaged. Changes in education over the last 30 years mean that most schools are good enough and most children, if they are well supported, can flourish. We should be worrying less, not more, but that needs to be led from the top, and the signs aren&apos;t good at the moment."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/egypt-industry-workers-protest-barthe", "sentences": ["The shockwave from the Egyptian revolution has reached a skyscraper in Singapore.", "A throwback to the days of Nasserite socialism, the firm was privatised in 2007 and sold to Indorama, an Indonesian multinational based in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-12T13:06:13Z", "title": "Revolutionary spirit spreads to Egyptian industry", "tags": ["Egypt", "Africa"], "article": "The shockwave from the Egyptian revolution has reached a skyscraper in Singapore. Encouraged by the victory of the shabab (youths) in Tahrir Square and Hosni Mubarak&apos;s resignation on 11 February, thousands of Egyptian workers went on strike to demand better working conditions. Among them was the workforce at the mill at Shibin el-Kom, the main town in Menoufia province, on the Nile delta, 60km north of Cairo. A throwback to the days of Nasserite socialism, the firm was privatised in 2007 and sold to Indorama, an Indonesian multinational based in Singapore. The emphasis on flexible working imposed by the new management soon upset the workers, used to tough but regular work. They made a timid strike attempt in 2009, followed by a massive turnout this year. After a month&apos;s conflict they are going back to work having achieved unexpectedly favourable terms. Graffiti on the mill wall bear witness to the recent struggle: &quot;Indonesians, go home!&quot;. A sign marked &quot;Indorama Shibin&quot; has been replaced with one saying &quot;Misr Shibin&quot; (Misr being the Arabic word for Egypt). The firm is well known all over the province as the largest employer, with 3,200 jobs. &quot;Misr Shibin is like a monument,&quot; says import manager Yasser Shendy. &quot;Our fathers worked here. We are deeply attached to it. But the monument is in danger. The state had more consideration for us than these foreigners who don&apos;t understand our culture. It must return to public ownership.&quot; The trouble started on 5 March with the dismissal of 95 workers. Ever since it took over, Indorama has been drastically cutting costs. With operations in 13 countries on four continents, it reports $4bn annual revenue. Serving customers such as Nike, Esprit and Adidas, it has little concern for the remains of Egypt&apos;s welfare state. In the old days the workforce enjoyed almost complete job security, including health insurance and a pension, but new recruits were offered one-year contracts, with no welfare entitlement. Their renewal was dependent on the economic climate. &quot;The management even forced us to sign a letter of resignation, so if need be they could give us the sack without paying any compensation,&quot; says Mahmoud Abu Adel, hired four years ago. In the 1960s and 70s the state instituted various benefits in an attempt to compensate for hard working hours and low wages. Indorama set about dismantling these gains. &quot;I&apos;ve been working here for 38 years and I earn [$250] a month,&quot; says Muhammad Abdul Sattar, an old man who shows us round a huge shed full of bales of acrylic fabric and spinning machines. &quot;I have a liver condition because of the stink in the factory. The works doctor is a GP and doesn&apos;t know a thing about such ailments.&quot; Before the revolution, the protests by workers were low-key. But in March the wind changed. &quot;We reckoned the political balance had tipped and, with Mubarak out of the way and Amn al-Dawla [Mubarak&apos;s secret police] disbanded, we could at last say: &apos;No&apos;,&quot; Shendy recalls. So the workforce downed tools, organising marches and sit-ins outside the provincial governor&apos;s offices. Their action paid off. The deal negotiated with Indorama provides for half of the 95 redundancies to be reinstated, a rise in monthly bonuses, five-year contracts, yearly scope for promotion and payment by the state for part of the lost hours.

This morning there were quite a few items for the pain addicts among us to choose from, but the worst has got to be the news that the country is going to miss the International Monetary Fund recovery targets for the next four years by around \u20ac5bn.  Ajai Chopra, head of the IMF mission, flew to Dublin last Friday for the quarterly review and it looks as if everyone, including the Washington-based fund, has got it wrong \u2013 this week they almost halved their forecast for GDP growth in Ireland this year from 0.9% to 0.5%. And that&apos;s worrying because it&apos;s only a fraction of the 1.7% growth forecast by the department of finance whose figures informed last December&apos;s hellish budget. We all know what this means \u2013 Chopra is in charge and unless there is some Hungarian-style standoff between Ireland and the IMF, the disparity in figures can spell only one thing \u2013 more austerity, more pay cuts, more direct and indirect tax. See today&apos;s Irish Independent for more detail if you&apos;re a glutton for punishment.  So that&apos;s why even the vaguest of hints by Allied Irish Banks yesterday of a new debt forgiveness programme for struggling mortgage customers made so many headlines today instead of its appalling loss of \u00a310bn in 2010 \u2013 as guest blogger economist Stephen Kinsella said: that&apos;s the equivalent of a few brand new hospitals. Still, the executive chairman of AIB, David Hodgkinson, is no slouch \u2013 he spent the best part of 40 years working for HSBC \u2013 and has led banks around the world through severe property crashes. When he arrived last October he was immediately on fire-fighting duty, with a second bailout ordered by the IMF, and a scandal over bank bonuses, as well as coping with his day job: to come up with a survival plan for the bank along with new management practices and prudential controls.  &quot;I have never worked with quite as many problems as AIB had, particularly with property,&quot; he said.  &apos;Do you know how hard it is to rent in Ballsbridge?&apos; I caught up with him after the annual results news conference yesterday and he was remarkably upbeat about the future.  &quot;Do you know how hard it is to find a place to live here in Ballsbridge?&quot; he says by way of explaining a recovery in landlord&apos;s yields. He admitted that his experience of trying to find a home in Dublin 4, one of Dublin&apos;s wealthiest districts, may not be typical, but he is still optimistic.  He thinks Dublin, where house prices have fallen by as much as 53%, may have hit the bottom. But he is less convinced about areas outside the capital. &quot;Property in Dublin has stabilised. Properties are getting to investable yields. With gross yields of 6%, that may be worth buying again, but in some places it&apos;s going to take longer.&quot; He said he had worked through five property crashes \u2013 three in Hong Kong, one in Singapore and one in Saudi \u2013 but that Ireland&apos;s crash is probably the worst he has seen. &quot;It is the longest property boom I have seen. It went from the early 90s, then it stopped for a little bit and then the low interest rates from Europe made it even worse, and it just kept going,&quot; he said.  He says Singapore had a similar crash in the 1980s but it &quot;bounced back within 18 months&quot;.  This is no cause for optimisim, however: he is quick to note one key difference between Singapore and Ireland \u2013 land. In Singapore and Hong Kong, property values were driven skyward because of the lack of development land. &quot;The problem for Ireland is Ireland had plenty of space and built in areas where demand might not recover,&quot; he said in reference to the country&apos;s notorious ghost estates.  One in 10 buy-to-let customers in arrears The bank has made provisions to write off about \u20ac600m in mortgage debt this year alone and acknowledges the buy-to-let market is cause for deep concern with one in 10 customers behind payments for more than 90 days. Hodgkinson says &quot;there was a kind of collective madness,&quot; in Ireland during the boom with businesses and individuals chasing property investments like the gold rush. &quot;So when the crunch came it was very serious.&quot; Like the other banks in Ireland, AIB has two problems \u2013 it over-lent to customers for over-valued properties, but it also loosened its credit policy and started offering in tracker mortgages to head off upstarts such as Bank of Scotland that arrived in Ireland in the 2000s on an aggressive mortgage &quot;land-grab&quot;. AIB said yesterday that 54% of all its mortgages were trackers \u2013 all of which are loss-making as they are linked to the record low ECB base rate. Those who are struggling with mortgages were given some solace by the revelation that the bank is looking at debt forgiveness initiatives. But in reality this is just rhetoric. All the bank is really talking about is practices already adopted by other banks, including loan holidays, interest-only repayment periods and loan extensions. AIB, which is costing the taxpayer more than \u20ac20bn in bailout funds, certainly won&apos;t be in a position to offer what might be better described as &quot;debt burial&quot; \u2013 a US-style system where customers can hand back the keys and walk away from their homes safe in the knowledge the debt won&apos;t follow them.  &quot;It does depend on the situation of the customer, how transparent they are with us on their financial affairs and how deep a hole they&apos;re in,&quot; said Hodgkinson, confirming that debt rescheduling will be offered on a case by case basis. Talk of &quot;inter-generational mortgages&quot;, however, is a bit concerning \u2013 this was something the banks conjured up at the peak of the boom allowing first-time buyers to buy over such a long time that their children would end up with the mortgage.  But what was significant was that AIB, like Bank of Scotland, has said it is willing to work with landlords in the buy-to-let sector. This is something that the likes of KBC have steadfastly refused to do.  KBC boss John Reynolds said in February: &quot;We lend people money over a long period of time and we expect to get it back over a long period of time.&quot; Asked would AIB be willing to restructure/write-off debt for buy-to-let mortgages, Hodgkinson said: &quot;That is one of the options, yes.&quot;  Landlords, form an orderly queue now. &quot;My opinion is that both Ireland and AIB have serious issues to beresolved,&quot; he added. &quot;But I am convinced they both can and will recover. In AIB we are learning the lessons from past mistakes, but we must not get bogged down in despondency.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/apr/14/paralympic-500-days-blind-football", "sentences": ["To mark the 1,000 days to go mark, the then Olympics secretary, Tessa Jowell, announced that a sixth &quot;legacy promise&quot; would be added to those made in Singapore \u2013 to use the Games to deliver a major shift in the way society perceives disability."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-14T11:09:10Z", "title": "Will a million schoolchildren play Paralympic sport? | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Sport", "Paralympics 2012", "Olympic Games 2012", "Lord Coe", "J Sainsbury", "Business", "Olympic Games"], "article": "On Sunday, there will be 500 days to go until the Paralympics opening ceremony. If that fact has passed you by then you&apos;re probably not alone. Most press mentions of the Paralympics, which begin on 27 August a fortnight after the Olympics closing ceremony, have of late related to its part in the damaging, byzantine row between Games organisers and the British Olympic Association. The BOA&apos;s insistence that the Paralympics be considered separately from the Olympics for accounting purposes did little to promote the idea that the two events should be considered as part of an integrated whole. There is both danger and opportunity in the fact that the Paralympics follow hard on the heels of a home Olympics. The danger is that it will have an after-the-Lord-Mayor&apos;s-show feel, with the nation spent after putting so much energy and emotion into the Olympics. The opportunity lies in the fact that the Paralympics, for which 2m tickets will go on sale, can harness all the momentum of the Olympics and present an unrivalled opportunity. As is obligatory, a host of legacy aspirations have been loaded on to the Paralympics beyond their hoped-for impact on sport. To mark the 1,000 days to go mark, the then Olympics secretary, Tessa Jowell, announced that a sixth &quot;legacy promise&quot; would be added to those made in Singapore \u2013 to use the Games to deliver a major shift in the way society perceives disability. It vowed to &quot;change the lives&quot; of 10m disabled people by &quot;increasing participation in sport and physical activity; improving business, transport and employment opportunities; and changing attitudes and perceptions of disabled people in society&quot;. I recall speaking about the pledges on a crackly phone line from the World Cup draw in Cape Town to Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, who above anyone else is synonymous in the public mind with Paralympic success. She was encouraged they were being made but equally determined that government be held to account on them. At best, there is mixed evidence of any progress since. At Lee Valley athletics centre earlier this week, Lord Coe, the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Ellie Simmonds \u2013 one of the handful of Paralympic stars recognisable to the general sporting public \u2013 gathered with the obligatory gaggle of schoolchildren to launch an effort to change their perceptions of Paralympic sport. Sainsbury&apos;s \u2013 breaking with tradition by solely concentrating on sponsoring the Paralympics (a clever deal that may well deliver more bang for its buck) \u2013 is launching a drive to get 1 million schoolchildren (able-bodied and disabled) playing Paralympic sport. The idea is that all children will get an idea of how challenging sitting volleyball or blind football can be in sporting terms and therefore feel a connection with elite Paralympic athletes. Fine in theory, but will it work in practice? Coe, unsurprisingly, is firmly in the camp of those who believe the Paralympics will be a huge success and mark a pivotal moment. Unruffled by the fact that not a single one of the schoolchildren present knew who he was, he talks a good game. He speaks with justification about the &quot;proprietorial pride&quot; Britain feels in the Paralympics, deriving from their birth at Stoke Mandeville and Team GB&apos;s historical success. He passionately argues that Locog has always viewed the two events as an integrated whole, but also acknowledges that there needs to be specific focus on bringing Paralympic sport and its athletes to wider attention. There seems to be a natural tension between the British Paralympic Association \u2013 currently without a chief executive after Phil Lane stepped down suddenly earlier this year \u2013 and some of those looking to take the event to a wider audience. Channel 4 and Sainsbury&apos;s inevitably alight on the backstories of some of the athletes while the impression is that the BPA would rather focus solely on the sport. All of those involved are edging towards a mutually beneficial way forward that will need to coalesce around the point at which tickets go on sale later this year. Some will go to the Paralympics because they have genuinely engaged with the sports and the athletes, others will no doubt go for the experience and to see the 2012 venues. Locog, the BPA, Channel 4, Sainsbury&apos;s and all the other sponsors, the media and the government must find a way to reach out to both. For Channel 4 too, which took a gamble in outbidding the BBC for the rights, there are big risks as well as sizeable rewards on offer. Coe, for one, is typically bullish. &quot;This is our time, this is our moment. Of all the things we are doing, this is the one that can make the difference,&quot; he says.

More than 1,000 varieties, pretty much every scotch currently available in Britain, plus some that aren&apos;t, at least not anywhere else. Anyway, says Urquhart, who was working in the shop at the time, the fourth generation of his family to join the firm, this chap walked in, more or less off the street: &quot;He knew what he wanted, mostly. A specific Ardbeg, an older Macallan. I steered him a wee bit for the others. He bought four bottles of whisky. For \u00a320,000. He was Taiwanese.&quot; Connoisseurs will come in here, says David, a third generation Urquhart, standing in said shop \u2013 a solid, reassuring sort of place in a solid, reassuring sort of town at the top of Speyside, home to half of Scotland&apos;s 100-plus whisky distilleries \u2013 and every month, some of them will drop \u00a35,000. &quot;Nothing,&quot; he says, &quot;surprises me any more.&quot; It would, I think, be hard not to spend money here, if you have it and you like whisky. There are your staples, naturally, your Glenfiddich 12-year-old (the best-selling single malt in the world), your Laphroaig 10, your Glenlivets (the biggest in America, and world number two) and Lagavulins, your Taliskers, Glenmorangies and Cardhus, mostly around the \u00a325-50 mark. There are more unusual whiskies, from distilleries you very probably have never heard of: Caol Ila, Mortlach, Auchentoshan, BenRiach, Pulteney. There are single-cask bottlings, taken from (as the name implies) one, rather than \u2013 as is customary \u2013 multiple casks from the same distillery, &quot;vatted&quot; together and married. There are powerful cask-strength bottlings. There are exotic finishes, when a whisky has spent a bit of time in a barrel that once held port, madeira, rum or Italian red wine. There are bottles at \u00a3200, \u00a3350, \u00a3400. There&apos;s also a 55-year-old Dalmore, for \u00a37,700. And on a pedestal in the middle of the room, with a price tag saying \u00a313,000, there&apos;s a bottle of 1940 Gordon &amp; MacPhail Glenlivet, one of only two 70-year-old Scotches on the market (the other was a Mortlach 70 the company launched last year; at just \u00a310,000 a bottle, it sold out within a fortnight.) There are, it seems, plenty of people who have money, and who like whisky. Not least outside Scotland: according to the Scotch Whisky Association, its members sold enough of the amber nectar last year to add a heartwarming \u00a33.45bn to the value of UK exports \u2013 10% more than 2009, and 60% more than a decade ago: every second, \u00a3109 of Scotch whisky is sold. Scotch has become a multi-billion pound, global phenomenon. A whole world of its own, of books, magazines (Whisky Magazine, Whisky Passion, Malt Advocate), websites (dozens of them, from maltmadness to whisky- intelligence, spiritofislay to whiskywhiskywhisky), of festivals from Speyside to San Francisco, Stockholm to Singapore. Names such as Dramfest, Whiskygalore, Maltstock. Its own experts, too: maltheads, whisky geeks. They rival anything the wine world has to offer by way of rarefied prose: the Malt Whisky Yearbook describes Ardbeg as &quot;soft peat, carbolic soap and Arbroath smokies . . . with a touch of liquorice&quot;, and Glenlivet as &quot;freshly chopped apple, rhubarb and gooseberries&quot;. Talisker is &quot;grilled oily fish in lemon oil&quot;; Benromach &quot;wet grass, butter, ginger and brittle toffee&quot; followed by &quot;lemon custard creams, apricots and pine table polish&quot;. And there are bars that specialise in nothing but. In Craigellachie, a few miles south of Elgin, Duncan Elphick, genial proprietor of the Highlander Inn, and his expert (if somewhat unlikely) whisky manager, Tatsuya Minagawa, offer 280 different whiskies by the nip, plus a menu of six-snort Tasting Trays with names such as Highland and Islands, The Balvenie Vertical Flight, Some Great 18-Year-Olds, Aperitif Malts and The Ultimate Tour of Scotland (at \u00a3136). &quot;People come here,&quot; says Minagawa, who himself came to Scotland from Japan years ago now, &quot;from everywhere. Absolutely everywhere. Aye.&quot; (He really does say &quot;Aye&quot;.) &quot;Scots, obviously, and English. Also Germans, Dutch, French. Scandinavians, hugely knowledgeable. Americans, lots; Canadians. Japanese. Taiwanese, now. And places you don&apos;t expect. There was a Czech guy in the other week, knew more about Scotch than most Scots.&quot; All a long way, really, from the small stone cairn at Upper Drummin, in the hills above the valleys of the rivers Avon and Livet, which marks the spot where in 1824 one George Smith built the distillery that&apos;s now widely considered the cradle of the modern industry (though not by everybody. Age and tradition are valuable commodities in single malt-land; the longer and better your backstory, often, the bigger your sales). At any rate, Smith, third of seven children, banged in an application to build a distillery within months of the 1823 Excise Act that made the whole business legal. &quot;It&apos;s safe to assume he learned it from his farmer father and grandfather,&quot; says Ian Logan, an international brand ambassador for Glenlivet, now owned by French drinks giant Pernod-Ricard. &quot;Illegal stills and whisky smuggling were everywhere, had been since the 15th century, doubtless before. They earned cash in what was often a hard existence. It was quite sophisticated, organised networks, long-distance signals for when the soldiers were spotted, all that. Quite a game. People would tell Customs about an illegal still, but only when it was worn out. That way they could buy a new one with the reward.&quot; We&apos;re standing by Smith&apos;s cairn, looking down the hill. Below is today&apos;s Glenlivet distillery, a monument even in a region where big distilleries are two a penny: rows of long warehouses holding tens of thousands of maturing barrels; a visitor&apos;s centre welcoming 45,000 people a year; a spectacular \u00a310m glass-and-timber extension opened last year. With just 10 people involved in each actual production cycle, Glenlivet could now produce, should it so wish, 10m litres of whisky a year. (&quot;Think of it,&quot; says Logan. &quot;Those guys can go on holiday almost anywhere in the world, walk into almost any bar, and see something they&apos;ve made. Amazing.&quot;) Like many things, Logan says, making whisky isn&apos;t particularly difficult; making good whisky is \u2013 very. First, you malt your barley, soaking it in water and then drying it. (At Gordon &amp; MacPhail&apos;s pretty little Benromach distillery in Forres, Speyside&apos;s smallest, Sandy Forsyth, 40 years in the business, explains that it&apos;s the peat used in the drying that gives some whiskies \u2013 from Islay, for example \u2013 their characteristic smokiness. &quot;The nose and the taste will actually change depending on where you cut your peat from,&quot; Forsyth says. &quot;Peat from down near the shoreline will produce notes like iodine, TCP. Laphroaig&apos;s character, that&apos;s from the seaweed in the peat. Speyside whiskies are fruitier. Unpeated.&quot;) Next you crush the malted barley in a mill: &quot;Like taking the wrapper off a candy,&quot; says Glenlivet&apos;s Logan. Then you mash the grist, adding hot water and stirring until the starches turn to sugar. Then you pump the resulting liquid, called wort, into a large vat called a washback, and add yeast. Sugar turns to alcohol. Last come the stills, shapely affairs of shining copper. The new still room at Glenlivet is a soaring, almost church-like space, all lofty ceiling and plate- glass windows overlooking the valley. (&quot;It does,&quot; agrees Logan, &quot;feel a bit religious. In fact, the production manager&apos;s daughter got married here.&quot;) Stills work in pairs. In the first, you heat what comes out of the washback until the alcohol rises as vapour (or the whole lot can simply froth over, ruining everything. &quot;Do that once,&quot; says Forsyth at Benromach, &quot;and you might survive. Twice, and you&apos;ll be rolling casks in the warehouse.&quot;) In the second, or spirit still, you reheat what comes out of the first. The early product, known as foreshots or heads, is no good. Nor is the stuff that comes out towards the end, known as feints or tails. What you&apos;re after is the heart or middle cut, and where you take it will determine the character of the whisky as surely as the cask it&apos;s matured in. Forsyth splashes a little on to the palms of my hands: rub and it smells of pure alcohol; let it dry and it&apos;s woodsmoke and fresh-cut flowers and, well, whisky. &quot;It&apos;s like doing a jigsaw,&quot; says Ian Chapman, an associate director at Gordon &amp; MacPhail, which reopened Benromach in 1998, some 15 years after it was closed by the previous owner during an industry-wide slump in the 1980s. &quot;When you&apos;re putting together a whisky, every tiny little thing counts. The barley, the water, the yeast. The timing. Wooden or steel washbacks. How you heat the stills. And, of course, the cask.&quot; Whiskymen love their casks. To be called Scotch whisky, the spirit must be matured in oak casks for at least three years. A whisky&apos;s quality is determined by the quality and type of that cask. The quality and character of the spirit and the time spent in the cask count too, but less so. Used and re-used, every barrel (Scotch distillers use mainly charred American bourbon casks, plus some Spanish sherry casks) affects a whisky differently, adding and subtracting and intermingling flavours, aromas, colours. At this point, it has to be said, the overwhelming majority of whisky distilled in Scotland will be mixed, either with other single malts or \u2013 much cheaper \u2013 with whisky made from grain. These are blends, your White &amp; Mackays, Dewars, Ballantine&apos;s, Johnny Walkers, Chivas Regals and the rest. Some are very high quality, aged drinks, others less so. But in any case, 90% of the Scotch whisky sold around the world is blended. Single malt, virtually unknown outside Scotland until the early 1960s, when it was floated almost as a gimmick, may be sacred among connoisseurs in mature whisky markets, and status-seekers in newer ones, but the real volume in whisky is blends. &quot;They&apos;ll be around for a long time to come,&quot; says Campbell Evans of the Scotch Whisky Association. &quot;The economics of the distilleries rely on them, and they&apos;re the way people get into Scotch, often mixed, with cola in Spain, green tea in China.&quot; So why has Scotch exploded, to an extent no other spirit has? It got a kick start when the phylloxera pest hit cognac and the Victorians had to find a substitute for brandy. Empire, then the Commonwealth, helped it along. But the biggest consumers, in value and volume, have long been the Americans, worth nearly \u00a3500m, and the French, who get through about 180m bottles a year. And these days the fastest-growing markets \u2013 and those, says Evans, with &quot;huge potential&quot; to sell more \u2013 are Brazil, Russia, China and India. Last year they imported an average 35% more than the year before; India is now the world&apos;s biggest whisky market, but most of it is locally distilled, and import duties on the genuine article, though falling, are still prohibitive. For Logan, Scotch is, along with champagne, &quot;one of the most aspirational drinks in the world. In lots of countries, it&apos;s a sign that you&apos;ve made it, and you want to share that, and show it.&quot; Michael Urquhart, joint managing director of Gordon &amp; MacPhail \u2013 whose independent bottling business, which has matured and bottled whisky from some 70 distillers for more than a century, saw exports soar by nearly 60% last year \u2013 says increased affluence is obviously a driver. &quot;But it&apos;s also a quality product, let&apos;s not forget. It tastes great. And it has a great heritage; that&apos;s increasingly important to people, the story of a product, its provenance.&quot; And once you&apos;ve started drinking it, he adds, Scotch is a rich seam: &quot;Each distillery is like a different grape variety. If you&apos;re looking for different tastes, different sensations, Scotch can really give you that experience. All the distilleries, the expressions, the ages, bottlings, finishes \u2013 there&apos;s real discovery out there.&quot; Mostly, though, I think the distillers (and the drinks multinationals, the Diageos and Pernod-Ricards who now own many of them) have been canny. Slowly and steadily, they&apos;ve &quot;premiumised&quot; their product, getting more for a single bottle by raising the quality of their blended whiskies, and making every single malt more distinctive, more boutique than the last (Benromach, for example, now produces the world&apos;s first fully certified organic whisky). But whisky&apos;s real secret is that in a world where the quick buck rules, its makers are forced, by the very nature of their business, to think long, long term. Their decisions now will determine what they can sell in 15, 25, 50, 70 years&apos; time. &quot;It&apos;s the foresight of my great-grandfather, grandfather and father that means we can now sell a 70-year-old malt,&quot; says Neil Urquhart, 35. &quot;At the time, everyone else thought it was absurd. But it does feel odd to think that some of what we&apos;re doing now may not see the light of day until after I&apos;ve retired.&quot; Before I leave the Glenlivet, Logan takes me to the calm of the library for a so-called vertical tasting: the 12 (spicy, nutty, sweet); the Nadurra 16-year-old (apple pie, cream, cinnamon); the 18 (toffee, milk chocolate, ripe pears) and the 25 (Christmas pudding, almost chewy). Then he nips out. &quot;I can&apos;t give you a bottle of this,&quot; he says, returning, &quot;because it&apos;s worth \u00a32,000. But have a nose. Have a sip. Think about what was happening when it was distilled, what&apos;s happened since. It&apos;s a 1959. That&apos;s when it gets really interesting, drinking a Scotch that&apos;s older than you are.&quot; \u2022 In Venezuela, China and India, drinkers can&apos;t get enough \u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2011. The original referred to the making of a single malt as coming from several casks distilled in the same year, &quot;vatted&quot; together and married. This has been corrected."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/apr/15/april-new-music-map", "sentences": ["SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...DJ Koflow - Make Your Hands Clap, Toes Clap  DJ Koflow is one of Singapore&apos;s most celebrated DJs."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-15T14:37:00Z", "title": "April's best new music from across the MAP", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Electronic music", "Culture"], "article": "Each month, the Music Alliance Pact \u2013 a group of 36 music blogs from around the world, including this one \u2013 simultaneously post tracks chosen by each blog.

What you&apos;re left with is music like Touch: slow, drifting electronica, marked by glitches, with an almost church-like atmosphere that has led some to describe it as &quot;ambient goth&quot;, an affecting mix of spectral sonics and ghostly vocals, as un-earthy as it is unearthly. ARGENTINA     The flag of Argentina     ZonaindieVioleta Castillo - La Batalla Del Movimiento  Violeta is a young and promising singer-songwriter from Buenos Aires who just released her first recordings in the form of two EPs, Uno and Otro. La Batalla Del Movimiento is a sweet pop ballad with great arrangements, thanks to her collaboration with a great band called Monoambiente. You can listen to both EPs and buy the MP3s from her Bandcamp page. AUSTRALIA       Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Khancoban - Until It Takes You Over  Sure there are big drums and meandering atmospherics that do tab out a few pages of Neon Bible, but Khancoban manage to verge on &apos;epic&apos; without coming out too overtly pomp. For what it lacks in lyrical diversity, it makes up for in delivery - a steady build that abruptly cuts off after only three minutes. New album Arches Over The Sun drops in July. Until then, this one will be a good excuse to wake up early and mull over my cereal to. BRAZIL       Meio DesligadoLu\u00edsa Maita - Lero-Lero  Lero-Lero is the minimalist samba that opens the debut album from singer Lu\u00edsa Maita. It&apos;s a song that calmly grows, almost without you noticing - her soft voice takes you to a special place in your head and suddenly you&apos;re just dancing and singing along with her. This track is also available for free download on Bandcamp. CANADA       I(Heart)MusicDora Alexander - Travelers  Yes, Dora Alexander sound just like a version of Radiohead that ceased to exist somewhere between The Bends and OK Computer. But you know what? It&apos;s been about a decade and a half since then, so it&apos;s probably safe for someone else to claim that sound. And, as Travelers - both this song and their debut EP of the same name - demonstrates, Dora Alexander are ready to pick up that mantle. Here&apos;s hoping they stick with it a little longer than the originators. CHILE       Super 45DeMentira - Post-Tbc  Ariel Altamirano, the DJ and producer better known as DeMentira, is the founder of Chilean netlabel Discos Pegaos, specializing in electronic music and abstract beats. The label was responsible for debut albums by Vaskular and Motivado as well the release of Chinpanc\u00e9 EP, first solo effort from DeMentira since his introduction as producer and rapper for the trio Iris in 2006. Post-Tbc is the first single from Chinpanc\u00e9 EP where we find mysterious beats, not dissimilar to dubstep, as well the experimental nature of the wonky sound. CHINA       WooozyFriend Or Foe - Snorting Clorox  Friend Or Foe are a secretive, occasionally masked rock trio who have been tearing up the Shanghai scene lately with their brand of fun-filled, balls-out rock. Preferring to keep their identities a secret, the band promulgate the myth that they are in fact three illegitimate demons, raised in Heaven: guitarist and vocalist Rabshakeh and often topless drummer Mahanehdan are joined by bassist Bill. COLOMBIA     Flag of Colombian      Colombia UrbanaJiggy Drama - Me Vale  Jiggy Drama is a musical phenomenon in Latin America. His &apos;Nerdside&apos; style has the total attention of radio stations and nightclubs, generating an internet boom with his urban alternative music. His most recent single, Me Vale, is a Cumbia fusion with some Caribbean sounds. DENMARK       All ScandinavianFrederik Teige - You Always Tried To Pull Us Down  He&apos;s been touring with Efterklang since 2007, but thankfully singer, songwriter and guitarist Frederik Teige has also found time to write and record material of his own. The climax so far is his self-released full-length debut Body God - nine songs worth of awesome alternative pop - which you can get for as much as you feel like paying (free is even an option) on Bandcamp. ESTONIA       PopopMimicry - Godspeed  Aggressive and arrogant, otherworldly and expressive, Mimicry fuses electroclash with psychedelic techno, ethnic beats and garage rock. Their aim: to produce perfectly mindblowing party music and provoke emotions never felt before. FINLAND       GlueNT&apos;s White Trash - Whistle  The most recognizable Brit in Finnish indie, Nick Triani, put together NT&apos;s White Trash with the aim of making some noise, which is captured in the band&apos;s debut Mourning Becomes Electric due in May. Whistle is a catchy two-and-a-half minute guitar-pop song, with an uplifting\u2026 well, whistling. It is a smooth exception on an album that promises some edgier sounds. FRANCE       Yet You&apos;re FiredThomas Kieffer - Summertime  Thomas Kieffer is a talented songwriter, offspring of the Strasbourg rock scene. At 15 years old, he was hugely impressed by bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple and started playing in different bands. Today, at 35, his resum\u00e9 is very impressive: he has opened for legendary artists such as Canned Heat, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Gary Moore, NOFX and Scorpions. He started a solo career two years ago, giving up on hard rock and metal, and should succeed with it and his album Beautiful Hands. GERMANY       BlogparteiJoasihno - Von  Joasihno&apos;s songs benefit a lot from his percussionist skills and his open-mindedness for playful but cautious arrangements. His wanderlust is almost tangible as he sings, although he is deeply rooted in Bavaria. Von is taken from his forthcoming debut We Say: Oh Well which is being released on Kyr Records. GREECE       Mouxlaloulouda2L8 - Don&apos;t Follow Me  2L8&apos;s music lurches deftly between emotional intimacy, ambition and experimentation. Their two well-received previous releases (download them for free here) proved they are one of the most creative and compelling acts in the musical underground. They are running a campaign on Pledge Music to help them unleash their forthcoming double album, New Battles, Without Honor And Humanity. The magnificent Don&apos;t Follow Me, a Music Alliance Pact exclusive, drips with melancholy. It blends warmth and brooding, existential contemplation with a repetitive but mesmerizing acoustic guitar melody full of subtlety and distinct sonic accents, and swims in gorgeous sheets of trembling, passionate vocals. ICELAND       Icelandic Music MaffiaSk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld - Kva\u00f0ning  Sk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld is a metal band formed in August 2009. The six members had been formerly active in other bands, not all metal. Their music can be described as powerful, melodic and epic Viking metal, along with various folk influences. The lyrics follow the strict rules of traditional Icelandic poetry. Kva\u00f0ning is featured on last year&apos;s debut record Baldur, a concept album telling the epic and dramatic tale of the viking Baldur. INDIA       IndiecisionPentagram - Tomorrow&apos;s Decided  Pentagram is one of India&apos;s biggest acts. The band has been around for the better part of the past two decades, creating music that&apos;s always been a contemporary, cutting edge reflection of the generation it is part of. The band recently released its fourth studio album Bloodywood, arguably its most evolved work yet. Tomorrow&apos;s Decided uses a traditional, folk-based drum beat and surrounds it with quintessential, soaring Pentagram electro-rock goodness to create four of the most intensely exciting minutes you&apos;re going to have today. INDONESIA       DeathrockstarGugun Blues Shelter - White Dog  Gugun Blues Shelter is probably one of Indonesia&apos;s best exports, with recognition from the blues community in Europe, USA, Asia and Australia. The band have played at international events such as the Belfast Big River Blues and Jazz Festival and Great British R&amp;B Festival. And no big festival in Indonesia would be complete without them. IRELAND       Nialler9SertOne - Past Present Future  Reminscent of RJD2, J Dilla and all those fine beat maestros that no doubt inspired him, Liverpool via Portadown&apos;s SertOne aka 21-year-old Gareth McAlinden is certainly a producer to watch. This tune contains a unique Belfast sample, twisted brass and a head-nodding beat that makes you sit up and take notice. You can find it on the recent seven-track The View From Above EP through Melted Music. ISRAEL       Metal IsraelGevolt - Bay Mir Bistu Sheyn  Yiddish metal pioneers Gevolt took this 1932 Yiddish musical track (that incidentally was a big hit in Nazi Germany until they figured out it was Yiddish) and made glorious metal out of it. Their sound resembles a happy-go-lucky Rammstein/Linkin Park hybrid with violins. But since a lot of their songs are versions of the old ones my grandmothers sing, they have an unmatched nostalgic beauty. Download their second album Alef Base for free while you still can at their site. ITALY       PolaroidLove Boat - You Know I Really Want You  These guys from Sardinia are probably more known around Europe than in Italy. That&apos;s how bad this country has gotten. Anyway, they have a new album on the German label Alien Snatch and a 7&quot; EP on Shit Music For Shit People. This song comes from the latter&apos;s B-side. Grab everything and start to dance a wild garage party - this is good rock &apos;n&apos; roll. MEXICO       Red Bull PanameriKaToy Selectah - No Pasma feat. Isa GT  In the last decade, Cumbia has become the &apos;lingua franca&apos; to fill Latin-oriented dancefloors worldwide. Its saucy rhythms and nasty grooves easily adapt to many other musical forms: from techno to reggae, passing through favela-funk or dubstep. With a career spanning 15 years (and dreadlocks nearly that long), Toy Selectah has earned respect as a Cumbia-lord, trading the genre and cross-pollinating it with his constant travels and after-hours gigs. His Mex Machine EP out on Diplo&apos;s Mad Decent label is an infectious state of affairs. On No Pasma, the Colombia-born, London-dwelling singer Isa GT throws some cocksure chants on a perfect groundshaking Cumbia. NETHERLANDS       Unfold AmsterdamDeath Letters - Your Heart Is Upside Down  It&apos;s nice to see a bit of international buzz building for a young Dutch band. This duo aren&apos;t even legal to enjoy a good piss-up in Texas, which is where they headed last year to record an album with Chris &apos;Frenchie&apos; Smith (Jet, The Dandy Warhols, Smog) and where they returned to for SXSW last month. The resulting album, Post-Historic, isn&apos;t the band&apos;s first effort but it&apos;s markedly different from their self-titled debut. Here they leave behind their original blues-rock trappings and fire through Glassjaw post-hardcore, Biffy Clyro post-grunge and ...Trail Of Dead post-rock &apos;n&apos; roll. That may be a lot of &apos;posts&apos; but they make an incredibly energetic yet refined racket on stage. NEW ZEALAND       Einstein Music JournalGhost Wave - Sunsetter  Ghost Wave hits you like a motorik wall of noise, with its hypnotic waves of reverb guitar, mechanical drums and atmospherics. Matt Paul&apos;s project started after his solo electronic act Street Beat gave way to this united front, with drummer Eammon Logan, guitarist Rikki Sutton and bassist Alex Grant. Live they&apos;re enigmatic with tightly wound, ravaged Clean-style hooks and perfectly warped pop songs. Their debut EP was released earlier this month on Arch Hill. NORWAY       Birds Sometimes DanceBeatbully - B\u00f8lleboogie  Beatbully is an offspring of the Norwegian skweee label D\u00f8dpop. Skweee is a genre of Nordic heritage, based on classic hip hop beats with heavy influence of modern electronica. Although mainly composed for a live audience, Beatbully invites skweee to your living room as well. This winter, he released Kosmisk Regn (&quot;Cosmic Rain&quot;), the first solo album in D\u00f8dpop&apos;s history. B\u00f8lleboogie has an irresistible beat that leaves no one behind on the dancefloor, and the juicy melody won&apos;t release you till its over. It&apos;s a three-minute piece of bliss that will make even your grandmother dance. PERU       SoTBKuraka - Fuego Negro  Kuraka is a rock group that spawned from the collaboration of renowned musicians of local bands such as Emergency Blanket, Zen, M.A.S.A.C.R.E. and Inyectores. The diversity of styles seemed an obstacle to assemble their ideas, but the bonds of friendship led to them making something interesting. In 2009, they released a few singles that whetted the appetite for their debut album Fuego Negro, which came out in August 2010 on Mundane Records. Take a listen to the great song that gives the album its name. PORTUGAL       Posso Ouvir Um Disco?They&apos;re Heading West  - My Case Is A Different One  They&apos;re Heading West are three singers/composers (Jo\u00e3o Correia, Francisca Cortes\u00e3o, Mariana Ricardo) and a drummer (S\u00e9rgio Nascimento) who decided to get together and play songs from their bands and solo projects. They only have one set of songs, recorded live at a national radio station, which is not yet available commercially. The song featured this month is, therefore, a MAP exclusive as a free download. ROMANIA       Babylon NoiseParachute Pulse - Hopscptch  Parachute Pulse is the brand new project of Ana Roman. Her debut album, Kingdom, is a collection of cinematic sounds, moods and emotions. The album is available for free download on her label&apos;s page, Asiluum. Hopscptch is a collaboration with Res Es of Semiosis, who were featured in the Music Alliance Pact back in May 2009. SCOTLAND       The Pop CopSebastian Dangerfield - You Played Your Part, Singer!  Sebastian Dangerfield are a four-piece from Edinburgh who are little-known even in their home city. But that shouldn&apos;t be the case for much longer if the band continue to show such an accomplished grasp of Americana-tinged folk-rock amplified with a healthy dose of scuzzy-pop zest and various stringed instruments. The wonderfully-named You Played Your Part, Singer! is taken from their new EP, The Sound Of The Old Machines, which you can find on Bandcamp. SINGAPORE       I&apos;m Waking Up To...DJ Koflow - Make Your Hands Clap, Toes Clap  DJ Koflow is one of Singapore&apos;s most celebrated DJs. His claim to fame started when he won the national DMC Championship in 2003, and he continued to skyrocket by receiving many honourable mentions in local and international media. He dropped his debut album The Turntable Instrumentalist despite a heavy production and performance schedule, with the record speaking volumes of his myriad influences. Jazz, hip hop, funk and soul all seamlessly flow together in the hands of one of the country&apos;s brightest mix masters. SOUTH AFRICA       Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Battle Beyond The Stars - The Desert  Philip Kramer, aka Battle Beyond The Stars, is a Cape Town-based DJ and producer. He is best known for his unique blend of electro, French house and unusual tracks that no DJ in their right mind would play in public. He recently released an EP entitled Memory which gave his awaiting fans a concrete collection of songs. With his new offering The Desert, he injects his signature sound to create a shimmering, synth-infused song that shows off his immense talent with its subtly. For his latest work download and have a listen to Drifter&apos;s Theme. SOUTH KOREA       Indieful ROKNeon Bunny - Long-D  Yoojin Lim is the sole member of Neon Bunny, who debuted with an album called Seoulight in late March. Having been a session keyboardist for successful power-pop act The Black Skirts - the very first South Korean MAP contribution - her own sound is on the electro side, influenced by Ladyhawke and Phoenix. Long-D is a semi-catchy track with something of a retro sound. SPAIN     Flag of Spain     MusikornerDisco Las Palmeras! - La Casa Cuartel  Disco Las Palmeras! are a three-piece band from Galicia, hometown of related acts such as Franc3s, Mequetrefe or Tri\u00e1ngulo de Amor Bizarro and cradle of the new Spanish noise wave. La Casa Cuartel opens their debut album, Nihil Obstat, released earlier this year. The song is about a terrorist strike on a police station and features hypnotic drums and suffocating guitar riffs that recall exactly the same feelings the lyrics talk about: fear and anxiety. SWEDEN       SwedespleaseSummer Heart - Please Stay  It&apos;s almost spring which means summer is still a while away. But we can dream, can&apos;t we? That&apos;s where this song from Malm\u00f6-based band Summer Heart comes in. It&apos;s called Please Stay, but with its Beach Boys harmonies, groovy beat and summer feeling, it may as well be the band&apos;s coup d&apos;\u00e9tat. SWITZERLAND       78sPamela M\u00e9ndez - Bubble Bubble  Bubble Bubble is the first single from Pamela M\u00e9nedez&apos;s critically-acclaimed debut album I Will Be Loved, released in February. The Bern resident, whose father is Mexican, belongs to a new breed of female singer-songwriters popping up in nearly every Swiss town. Heidi Happy, Sophie Hunger, Lena Fennell and Lea Lu are others to check out. UNITED STATES     Flag of the USA     I Guess I&apos;m FloatingSupreme Cuts - Amnesia  Chicago&apos;s Supreme Cuts describe their sound as &quot;future R&amp;B&quot; - a perfect name for the sample and bass-heavy slow grooves they weave into their songs. Amnesia is perhaps their most supreme cut, a ridiculously addictive head trip that could soundtrack a nightclub as easily as it could an R Kelly video from the 90s. VENEZUELA       M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sUnos Infames - Pagando Es Que Se Puede  You could say that Unos Infames is just another rock band. But no. To hear and see them live you will realize that their strength on stage belongs to a mega band. Unos Infames, who formed in Barcelona, Anzo\u00e1tegui, is made up of experienced musicians who fuse some blues influences with controversial lyrics. They are currently recording their debut album."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/apr/15/2", "sentences": ["Mystery Bird photographed in the Republic of Singapore.", "This lovely mystery bird has a large range but is seldom common anywhere in its range and it is a rare resident of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-15T20:44:00Z", "title": "Today's mystery bird for you to identify", "tags": ["Science", "Zoology", "Birds"], "article": "Mystery Bird photographed in the Republic of Singapore.

Of course, you will earn extra smug points by correctly identifying this species and telling me if this is a male or female.  About the Daily Mystery Bird:  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in 24 different time zones, and some people are following on their iPhones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours.2. If you know the bird&apos;s identity, provide subtle hints to let others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful as small clues to less experienced players. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones.4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too).2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all.4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

Three cheers!", "tags": ["Work-life balance", "Work & careers", "Money", "Society", "Guardian Careers", "Jobs"], "article": "It&apos;s as if the planets are aligned \u2013 a late Easter has coincided with the royal wedding and the May Day bank holiday to give us a rare run of days off. In case you hadn&apos;t noticed, the next three weeks comprise two or four days, with a three-day week sandwiched between. The canny among us will have recognised the multiplier effect (&quot;Take 11 days of annual holiday allowance and get 23 days out of the office!&quot;) and got their holiday requests in early. What will the rest of us do with a series of four- and three-day weeks? Oddly enough, the four-day week was once envisaged as the future. As Prime Minister in the 1950s, Winston Churchill saw a time when accelerating technological advancement would enable us to &quot;give the working man what he&apos;s never had \u2013 four days&apos; work and then three days&apos; fun&quot;. This did not seem as improbable then, as it sounds now. After all, the weekend was a comparatively recent and expanding invention. &quot;What&apos;s a weekend?&quot; asked the (fictional) Edwardian Dowager Countess of Grantham quite plausibly in Downton Abbey, set at a time when Saturday mornings were still worked. Thirty years ago, as a schoolboy, I spent a summer working as a warehouseman in the London district of Moorgate. We had a practice of doing no work after tea-break on a Friday afternoon, sitting around playing word-games until it was time to clock off. &quot;You&apos;ll see,&quot; the foreman said to me. &quot;Soon, everyone will get Friday afternoons off.&quot; Now the warehouse is a bank with a fleet of chauffeured Mercedes parked outside at all hours. I&apos;m sometimes nostalgic about my conversation with the foreman, as I am about the horse-drawn cart that still delivered beer from the nearby Chiswell Street brewery. So where did it all go wrong? Not only has the concept of the three-day weekend evaporated, but, for many, the two-day weekend is in jeopardy. A survey of 4,000 workers conducted by Premier Inn last November found we don&apos;t unwind, on average, until 12.38 on Saturday night; by 3.55 on Sunday afternoon we are beginning to worry about work again and 53% of us are &quot;too tired&quot; to enjoy the weekend fully. Nearly half check our work emails over the weekend. Most of my peers in corporate life are welded to their BlackBerrys all weekend, leaping upon each message as it arrives. This crowding out of leisure time is due to something of a perfect storm: hurtling advances in communications technology colliding with changes in attitude to activity. Partly as a result of the available technology, we have stripped ourselves and our offices of many of the old indicators of hierarchy, such as PAs and corner offices. Instead, we have conflated activity with status, so that how busy we are has become an indicator of our importance. Enabled by the technology, we are now able \u2013 and often required \u2013 to compete globally. The day might start with a 6am conference call with Singapore and end at 10pm with one with the west coast of the US. A new client in the Gulf might have us emailing all Sunday \u2013 for them, a working day. Then there&apos;s the villain of the piece \u2013 the technology itself. My own research into the use of a BlackBerry, and other smartphones, took workers from all over the world in a variety of organisational sizes and contexts, and measured email behaviours. I compared those that used BlackBerry (or similar &quot;smart&quot; devices with &quot;push&quot; functionality) with those that checked email through other means (an older phone or a laptop). Those with BlackBerrys, or similar, had 13% higher email volumes but spent two and a half times as long as the second group checking their emails outside working hours. It is as if simply owning a BlackBerry, or similar device, drives this compulsive checking behaviour. Of course, our brains are &quot;wired&quot; to seek out new information \u2013 in our ancestral environment information about a food source or the presence of an enemy might have made the difference between life and death. Today, it is more likely to be a mundane email about somebody losing their keys in the office. Yet the vibrating device, with its flashing light, stimulates our brain&apos;s dopamine system in much the same way as the flashing lights of a fruit machine do to a gambling addict. The weary jokes about &quot;CrackBerry&quot; and email &quot;addiction&quot; have more than a grain of truth. To feed our increasingly fervent need to remain attached to our inboxes, BMW and Research In Motion \u2013 the manufacturers of BlackBerry \u2013 have collaborated to enable you to &quot;sync&quot; your BlackBerry with your car. So that clever panel on the dashboard that helps you manage your in-car stereo and your satnav can now read each email to you as it arrives. It might feel as if email and BlackBerry have crept into our lives gradually, but, in the context of 5,000-year history of written communication, their arrival has been sudden and disruptive. Whether you were dictating a contract to be inscribed on a clay tablet in Babylon in 3000BC or hand writing an internal memo to be typed up by a secretary in the 1980s, the complexity of sending formal written communication meant you were selective in its use. Now that the barriers have been removed, so have the filters that weeded out messages that were either too urgent, or too trivial, to be committed to writing. As a result, a large proportion of the messages we send and receive are unproductive \u2013 it is easier to send, forward or &quot;reply all&quot; than it is to think for a moment if there might be a better way. Research by the University of Toronto suggests that 12% of the average company&apos;s payroll is soaked up by the unproductive use of work email. While the way we work in the 21st century may be long on hours, but short on productivity, there are other ways in which the culture of frenetic activity actually works against us. We are not, after all, production workers like Churchill&apos;s &quot;working man&quot; of the 1950s. A far higher proportion of us \u2013 men and women \u2013 work with our brains doing tasks of cognitive complexity. Our job titles include words such as analysis, knowledge and intelligence; almost all of us are required to do some level of deep thinking. And yet the unintended result of our busy way of working, straddling evenings and weekends, is that we have crowded out deep thinking. If, even in our time in the car, we are in thrall to the inbox, there is a risk that we simply do not give ourselves the space for problem-solving, reflection and creativity. How often have we stumbled upon the answer to a problem when doing something else altogether such as showering, gardening or taking a walk? There have been a number of recent advances in the understanding of the way or brain works \u2013 or doesn&apos;t work. Most of the cognitively complex work we are required to do is highly dependent on the brain&apos;s pre-frontal cortex, and neuroscientists, such as Russell Poldrack of the University of Texas, have observed that too much dopamine \u2013 perhaps the result of over-stimulation from our flashing BlackBerrys \u2013 can cause the functioning of the cortex to falter, leaving us frazzled, forgetful and finding it difficult to focus. Is it any wonder that attention deficit disorder specialists are observing that we can invoke the symptoms of this malaise simply by the way we work? Worse still, for those in senior positions, the frenetic way we work can affect our leadership capabilities. As we fire from the hip as each email arrives, we risk losing the art of delegation \u2013 thereby taking yet more work on our own shoulders \u2013 but also start to slip on many of the other pre-frontal cortex functions such as the treatment of people. We lose our sense of decency and courtesy as our 24/7 way of working leads to irascibility. It has long been recognised among occupational psychologists and physicians that proper rest and recovery is important, not just for long-term health and happiness but also for resilience at work, productivity and performance. The sad truth is, most of us are simply too busy to wake up to the facts. So while we are further than ever from enjoying a four-day week as a permanent fixture in the calendar, the period about to unfurl before us offers us an opportunity to feel what it might be like. So treat this bounty of bank holidays as a chance to unplug from work and allow time for recovery, reflection and deep thinking. Who knows \u2013 we may end up reclaiming the two-day weekend.

Sanjeev Kapoor, India&apos;s best-known chef, has his office in Andheri West, one of the sprawling suburbs. Kapoor&apos;s pioneering Khana Khazana, started 18 years ago, is the longest-running TV cooking show in Asia, and he has just launched India&apos;s first 24-hour Hindi-language cooking channel with 40 shows. This success has brought awards, government advisory contracts, jobs with foreign airlines and an appearance on CNN alongside Heston Blumenthal, Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver and Wolfgang Puck as one of the top five celebrity chefs in the world. Kapoor&apos;s website gets 25m hits a\u00a0month, and his 36 books have sold an estimated 10m copies. I stop at the stalls in the street where he works. They serve office workers, and it is 3 o&apos;clock and there are many having a late lunch. At the corner of the main road is a stall selling samosas and pakoras. There is a woman with piled tins full of Tibetan dumplings, served with chilli or soy sauce, and next to her, at last, something authentically Mumbai: pav bhaji, a\u00a0mix of spiced vegetables and yeasty soft bread. Further down, in front of a\u00a0McDonald&apos;s and a drain from which a\u00a0crew of women is hauling foul black muck with their bare hands, I buy a\u00a0masala dosa, the classic south Indian pancake stuffed with beetroot as well as the usual mildly spiced potato. Four office workers standing next to me in neat nylon-mix white shirts eat theirs from steel trays. Kapoor \u2013 like the McDonald&apos;s and the malls and the office workers \u2013 is in part a product of the new &quot;Shining India&quot;, the India of the near double-digit economic growth, information technology and a new sense of being an emerging power. The big break for Kapoor, now 46, came in 1993, as economic reforms and satellite television transformed the Indian social, political and media landscape after decades of socialism. A successful hotel chef in Mumbai, he was asked to host a cooking show on the best-known of the new TV channels. He chose to make a homely but attractive dish of cheese-filled spinach dumplings and a complicated stuffed chicken breast with saffron and orange liqueur. The former \u2013 shaam savera \u2013 is now established as his signature dish. No one remembers the chicken. But as much as the cooking, it was the medium that Kapoor mastered so rapidly. Television is what gets you noticed, Kapoor explains early in our interview when I&apos;ve finished my dosa and he&apos;s finished switching his new channel&apos;s data banks. Its power was made clear to him, he says, when he went searching with his wife for dried soya grains in Mumbai many years ago and found all the shops had sold out. Only then did he remember that he had cooked a dish with them earlier in the week. His television channel is doing very well, he says, and quotes numbers which, as ever in India, are eye-popping. Of 120m households with cable or satellite in India, more than half are Hindi speaking (rather than English speaking), and Kapoor&apos;s channel is being watched by around 12%. A quick back-of-the-envelope scribble shows that this means around 8m homes. This month Kapoor is in the US to launch a new book, which he will then bring to the UK: Mastering the Art of Indian Cooking. &quot;Indian cooking is in-your-face food,&quot; says Kapoor. &quot;But maybe some subtlety is coming in now.&quot; He launches into a brief history of recent evolutions in Indian cuisine. He has an interesting perspective, not least because his television show, for which he has cooked three dishes a week for 18 years, has played a significant role in changing what is being cooked in several hundred million kitchens. &quot;This is a hot, tropical country,&quot; says Kapoor. &quot;Sixty years ago there were no refrigerators. Food was cooked in the morning and had to last all day. So the principles of pickling were used: spices, fats, salt, preservation in sugar, all to keep it safe and edible when you couldn&apos;t keep it cold. Now that is beginning to change. Our vegetables are beginning to look like vegetables when they are cooked.&quot;     Sanjeev Kapoor meets his public at the market in Mumbai. Photograph: Olivia Arthur for the Observer    In India, food still plays a significant role in establishing status. Take the local English- language news magazine Outlook. The cover story earlier this month was headlined &quot;Eat Street&quot; and was essentially a rediscovery of the joys of street food. &quot;No more humble fare, the rich variety is wooing ever more patrons,&quot; the magazine tells its largely middle class readers who now, for the first time, are able to look at cheap roadside cooking as something if not exotic, then deliciously authentic. The following issue featured recipes for the aspiring chef. They included a &quot;surf and turf&quot; with beef fillet and prawns. Beef, of course, is traditionally banned for Hindus, and high-quality cuts are almost impossible to procure in India unless you have the supply chain of a 5-star hotel. And prawns, unless they are straight from the sea, involve risking a patchy refrigeration chain. Other recipes were for chocolate mousse \u2013 though all chocolate is imported and impossibly expensive \u2013 and black pepper chicken with a sauce made with red wine (the cheapest bottle of local plonk costs six times a labourer&apos;s daily pay) and a tin of tomatoes. Tomatoes \u2013 another ingredient introduced, like chillis, around 400 years ago \u2013 are readily available, but canned, and only found in high-class grocery shops in major cities where, shipped in from America or Europe, they cost a fortune. These recipes are, of course, aspirational. Only the smallest fraction of Outlook readers have the skill, kitchen or cash to follow such recipes. They are there in the magazine like the features on watches or cars or the hundreds of full-page advertisements selling new apartments where the water is clean, the power never goes off, the flat-screen TV (perhaps showing Kapoor&apos;s food channel) hangs on a clean white wall and there&apos;s a view of a golf course. Part of that dream exists, of course \u2013 for those with money. There is somewhere between five and 10 times more wealth in India now than there was 20 years ago. Roughly two-thirds of the country has seen only incremental benefits, if any at all, during this period, which means that the cash is concentrated at the top. One of the things those at the top are now spending their money on is food. On the TV screen in Kapoor&apos;s office, a starlet is standing with contestants at a stove. Programming is all about participation: there are local versions of Ready Steady Cook and a show devoted to foreign cuisine. For a long time the latter was &quot;continental&quot;, which meant anything vaguely European but adapted for an Indian palate. This is dying now, says Kapoor, and the &quot;Indian pasta&quot; \u2013 penne with tomatoes, chilli, coriander and masala spices, for example \u2013 is taking over. The key for Kapoor is not just the change in people&apos;s taste but the change in their cooking habits. The irony in India is that those interested in cooking are those who have the least need to do it. Most Indian middle class homes have both a full-time maid and cook. This means complicated architecture for new apartments, with two kitchens built into many designs: an open American kitchen for the owner and a\u00a0closed-off Indian kitchen for the staff. &quot;The affluent classes have their maids do all the washing and chopping,&quot; says Kapoor. &quot;Then they kind of put it together and say: &apos;Look what I cooked.&apos;&quot; The coming trend in Indian food in India, Kapoor believes, is rooted in a reaction against globalisation. &quot;People are much prouder of everything Indian. We are seeing that with regional Indian food that is beginning to get genuine recognition,&quot; he says. &quot;It will get healthier; hybridisation will continue. It will be more inventive, more bold. It will change as we change, and people will continue to worry if it&apos;s authentic or not.&quot; And street food? &quot;Well, it&apos;s cheap and convenient, and that&apos;s why people eat it. But there isn&apos;t a very large repertoire and there&apos;s not much that is really street food. A dosa is actually quite an involved dish, and the roadside is not really the place to do it.&quot; Outside, the office workers are going home and ceding the space on the street to teenagers heading to the local cinema and its attached Cafe Coffee Day, one of the new coffee bars that are springing up all over India. I head towards the sea, to the famous Juhu beach, where I find hundreds of Mumbai families out taking an evening stroll. Spitting seeds on the wet sand, dropping shiny wrappers, belching with abandon, they tuck into chaat, bhel puri and potato fritters and sip their fluorescent-green syrup drinks. I pick up a plate of Singapore noodles with fat, deep-fried green chillis and a\u00a0fresh lime soda and join them."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/17/glencore-unknown-corporate-giants", "sentences": ["Noble Group is listed on Singapore&apos;s stock market and reported revenue of $56.7bn last year."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-16T23:06:00Z", "title": "After the Glencore $60bn float, 10 more firms you've barely heard of", "tags": ["Business", "London Stock Exchange", "Commodities", "IPOs", "Stock markets", "FTSE", "Glencore"], "article": "To the average punter, its name means nothing. But Glencore, a vast trader in minerals, metals, grain and energy, has burst into the public domain with plans for the biggest flotation in the history of the London Stock Exchange, attracting a likely price tag of $60bn and creating 485 instant millionaires. So how many other corporate megaliths pass under the public radar? Based in the small Swiss town of Baar, near Zurich, Glencore has long preferred to keep itself quiet. Its chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, gave his first press interview in a decade last week. Globally, it employs 55,000, generated turnover of $145bn last year, and has assets of $79.8bn. Its business revolves around buying and selling commodities, transporting them around the world and adopting &quot;arbitrage&quot; positions to find a profit through differences in geography, time or produce. In business circles, success clearly does not necessarily mean visibility; in fact, immense wealth and a desire for privacy often go hand-in-hand. So the Observer has compiled a list of some of the other powerful business multinationals you&apos;ve barely heard of \u2013 and who like it that way. Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia A quarter of the world&apos;s conventional oil reserves are controlled by Saudi Arabia&apos;s state-owned energy firm, which is widely considered to be the planet&apos;s most valuable company. Saudi Aramco can trace its origins back to 1933, when it was founded as the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. It has 55,066 employees but ran into controversy recently when WikiLeaks cables revealed suspicions among US diplomats in Riyadh that it was exaggerating claimed reserves of as much as 716bn barrels of crude oil beneath the Arabian peninsula. Former Shell chairman Sir Mark Moody-Stuart is a director. Cargill, United States Founded by the son of a Scottish sea captain in Iowa during the US civil war, Cargill has grown into a sprawling agribusiness empire, stretching from grain and commodities to meat, eggs and processed-food ingredients. The Minnesota-based firm&apos;s sales for the nine months to February topped $84bn (\u00a351.5bn) but Cargill is still 88% owned by descendants of founder WW Cargill, seven of whom are ranked by Forbes magazine as billionaires. Cargill was an early supporter of genetically modified foods, which remain unpopular in Britain: one Cargill director lamented the UK had &quot;more distrust of science&quot; than any other nation. ISS, Denmark The least known even among the largely anonymous ranks of outsourcing companies, Copenhagen-based ISS cooks meals at all of the RAF&apos;s British airbases, cleans branches of RBS, provides housekeeping staff for hotels and runs security at many hospitals. The firm is the fifth largest private employer in the world with 520,000 on its payroll \u2013 a workforce the size of the population of Sheffield. It is owned by Goldman Sachs and Swiss buyout firm EQT and was planning to go public on the Danish stock market last month, but delayed its offering at the last minute. Its chief executive, Jeff Gravenhorst, recently remarked: &quot;From a brand exposure perspective, we&apos;re probably the best-kept secret around.&quot; Ineos, UK/Switzerland The chemicals multinational Ineos was Britain&apos;s biggest private company until it shifted its domicile to the tiny Swiss town of Rolle to avoid tax. With annual sales of $28.4bn, the firm is best known as the part owner of Scotland&apos;s Grangemouth refinery (PetroChina bought a 50% share last year). Ineos is run by Jim Ratcliffe, a Mancunian millionaire, who is unapologetic about quitting Britain: he was furious that government ministers refused to give him a temporary break on VAT payments to ease Ineos through a liquidity crisis. Bridgewater Associates, United States The world&apos;s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates manages an eye-watering $90bn of investments \u2013 a sum roughly equivalent to the GDP of Morocco. Based in Connecticut, the fund focuses on currency speculation, trading government bonds and fixed-income debt and has achieved remarkable returns of 18% annually over a decade. It is run by Ray Dalio, a fan of transcendental meditation, whose published &quot;daily observations&quot; are keenly followed on Wall Street and who banned office gossip last year, introducing a &quot;three strikes and you&apos;re out&quot; policy for anyone caught out. Permira, UK A sprawling, London-based private-equity firm, Permira grew out of the investment bank Schroders in the 1980s and is the owner of household brand names including Hugo Boss clothing and Birds Eye foods, the AA, Saga and retailer New Look. It has capital of \u20ac20bn (\u00a318bn) and is the largest private equity fund to be focused on Europe. Like all such buyout firms, it tends to stay well below the public radar but has 12 offices around the world and was run for a decade by Damon Buffini, the son of a single mother from Leicester, who was a business adviser to Gordon Brown. Now co-run by an American, Tom Lister, and a Finn, Kurt Bj\u00f6rkland. Noble Group, Hong Kong An Asian version of Glencore, this Hong Kong-based empire buys, sells and ships anything from Turkish cotton to Colombian coffee and Australian coal. It has 11,000 staff and was founded by Brighton-born Richard Elman, a former scrap-metal dealer who named the company after a fictional 19th-century trading company in James Clavell&apos;s novel Tai-Pan. Noble Group is listed on Singapore&apos;s stock market and reported revenue of $56.7bn last year. Elman, whose wealth is estimated at \u00a31.5bn, told Forbes his business principles were: &quot;Don&apos;t forget where you came from\u2026 don&apos;t forget you&apos;re fallible.&quot; Koch Industries, United States With interests ranging from fertilisers to chemicals, toilet rolls and ranching, the second largest private company in the US is run by ultra-conservative billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, who are major bankrollers of the Tea Party movement. The Kansas-based conglomerate operates key oil pipelines across North America, makes the stretchable fabric Lycra, and has a handful of brands in the UK, including Lotus toilet roll. It employs 70,000 people and has made $32bn of acquisitions since 2003. Sinopec, China The biggest company in the world&apos;s most populous country, Sinopec is described on its website as a &quot;super-large&quot; petrol group owned by the Chinese government. It has petrol stations and refineries across China, plus extensive exploration operations. International ventures include a stake in a Canadian oil sands extractor, Syncrude. Ranks seventh in Fortune&apos;s list of the planet&apos;s biggest companies with revenue of $187bn.  Renaissance Group, Russia Run by a New Zealander and based in Moscow, Renaissance Group has quietly emerged as one of the world&apos;s leading banks focused on emerging markets. It includes a consumer finance arm in Russia and an investment bank, Renaissance Capital, with operations spanning central Asia, eastern Europe and pushing hard into Africa. Founder Stephen Jennings, a former economist at New Zealand&apos;s treasury, jets around the world to follow the All Blacks and has been dubbed the &quot;kiwi oligarch&quot;. Renaissance&apos;s finances are kept under wraps, although Jennings sold a 50% stake in Renaissance Capital to a Russian billionaire, Mikhail Prokhorov, for a reported $500m in 2008."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/apr/17/james-smith-obituary", "sentences": ["A strong supporter of Christian Aid, Legal Aid and the Liberal Democrats, he took mischievous pleasure in rebuffing any canvasser who asked &quot;How are you going to vote?&quot; with the reply: &quot;Have you ever heard of the Secret Ballot Act of 1872?&quot; This was typical of his quiet but deep intelligence, his sense of history and his support for peace and justice on a local, national and international scale \u2013 his father had been a prisoner of war after the fall of Singapore and James inherited his attitude of &quot;never forget but try to forgive&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-17T16:51:44Z", "title": "James Smith obituary", "tags": ["Law", "Christianity"], "article": "My father, James Smith, who has died of a heart attack aged 63, was a solicitor for more than 40 years, specialising from the 1980s onwards in the unglamorous but vital world of criminal defence.

He was born in Gosport, Hampshire, the son of Jack, a Royal Engineer recently demobbed from the regulars, and his wife Marion, a loquacious daughter of the Malvern Hills. Growing up in a prefab with a love of languages and history, he studied the latter as part of the first intake at the University of Kent at Canterbury in 1965. For a profession he chose the law, learning his trade in Hereford and then moving to Hastings and finally Deal, in east Kent. For hobbies he chose cricket, steam trains, Edward Elgar and amateur dramatics. In one 1980 show he played a morose student in a long wig and borrowed jeans so convincingly that one female spectator&apos;s first reaction was: &quot;He can&apos;t be a solicitor, he&apos;s too dim.&quot; And, reader, he married her.

In the subsequent 200 years, 40% of the species in coastal waters collapsed, showing falls in their population by 90% or more. There was a pattern to this story of decline. There was a much-less marked attrition in coastal regions with richly diverse marine ecosystems than in regions exhibiting low levels of diversity. What does this have to do with economics? Quite a lot, as it happens. In recent years, as the limitations of the rigidly mathematical approach to economics have been exposed, there has been interest in what the dismal science can learn from biologists, ecologists, geneticists, physicists and psychologists. Two years ago, Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England&apos;s executive director for financial stability, published a paper in which he used global fish stocks, the spread of epidemics, and the destruction of the rain forests to explain why the system collapsed so dramatically. The March edition of Central Banking contains a fascinating piece by its editor, Claire Jones, on how the work of the scientist Robert May on the stability and complexity in ecosystems supports the case for deep structural reform of finance. This is, of course, a topical issue in the light both of the preliminary report by the UK government&apos;s independent commission on banking (ICB) and the setting up of a financial policy committee (FPC) at the Bank of England to keep tabs on what the City is up to. Both the ICB and the FPC seek to strike a balance between preventing another financial crisis and ensuring that the growth prospects of the economy are not impaired by over-zealous regulation. As Paul Tucker, the Bank&apos;s deputy governor put it in a speech in New York last week: &quot;The government has proposed that the FPC be subject to a constraint that it should not act to preserve stability at the cost of significantly impairing the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to medium-to-long term economic growth. What this means in practice is that when faced with an immediate or incipient threat to stability, we must try to find a solution that avoids damage to long-term growth. That discipline is welcome by the Bank.&quot; But perhaps it shouldn&apos;t be. A light-touch approach could make the financial system less safe and increase the chances of a second financial crisis. It needs to be remembered that as a result of the first blow-up the UK economy is operating 10% of GDP below where it would be had the pre-crisis trend of growth continued. Haldane&apos;s analysis certainly suggests that leaving the status quo largely untouched is risky. Judging reforms by whether one or more big UK bank might relocate in the US, Switzerland, Dubai or Singapore misses the point entirely. Seen from an ecological viewpoint it is a bit like asking whether half a point off Brazil&apos;s GDP for the next 10 years is more important than protecting the Amazon rain forest. Pr\u00e9cis of the argument goes like this. In the decade or more leading up to the crisis, the financial sector became bigger, more complex and more homogeneous. Mutual institutions became banks, commercial banks dabbled in investment banking, and investment banks set up in-house hedge funds . What had been a diverse financial ecosystem became a monoculture. &quot;In consequence, the financial system became, like plants, animals and oceans before it, less disease-resistant&quot;, Haldane noted. &quot;When environmental factors changed for the worse, the homogeneity of the financial ecosystem increased materially its probability of collapse.&quot; Those running the system did not think for one minute this was going to happen. They thought that the system was strong and durable because risk had been spread. They were also reassured by the way global finance had withstood the Asian crisis of 1997, shrugged off the dotcom collapse of 2001 and had continued to expand despite rising oil prices and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The rationale was that complexity equalled stability, which was what biologists believed about ecosystems until the 1970s. Then, research showed that some simple ecosystems, such as the Savannahs were robust while more complex systems such as rain forests were vulnerable. For a while, this vulnerability lay hidden, with the system able to absorb a considerable amount of strain without appearing to suffer. But eventually, a tipping point was reached: the moment when fractionally more over-fishing caused irreparable damage to the stocks of cod on the Grand Banks. Seen from this perspective, it becomes easier to explain why seemingly minor problems triggered a systemic crisis in global finance. Few could understand why the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 could lead within a month to a situation where no bank in the world appeared safe, but that was because none of those responsible for the system \u2013 the bankers, the politicians and the regulators \u2013 understood that complexity plus homogeneity spelt danger. Haldane noted in his paper that &quot;in just about every non-financial discipline \u2013 from ecologists to engineers, from geneticists to geologists \u2013 this evolution would have set alarm bells ringing. Based on their experience, complexity plus homogeneity did not spell stability: it spelt fragility.&quot; In an echo of the loss of fish stocks after 1800, by early 2009, 23 of the biggest European and American banks had lost 90% of their market value. All this is highly relevant to the debate about how to fix the financial system. Up until now, the focus has been on curbs on pay and on ensuring that banks have bigger capital buffers to limit their leverage and their exposure to risk. Neither is likely to do the trick. The root of the problem before the crisis was that bankers did not know the risks they were taking. If, in the years ahead, they still do not appreciate those risks, they will try to find ways to sidestep new capital constraints, no matter how much they are paid. The task of the FPC is to ensure that the City is aware of those risks. Better information would help to reduce the risks of another crisis, particularly if information was shared across borders. Haldane cites the example of the World Health Organisation, which set up a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network in 2000 to provide a co-ordinated global response to fighting epidemics such as bird flu and SARS. But more transparency won&apos;t be enough on its own, because what the financial system needs is more diversity and more simplicity. That means a richer ecosystem: mutuals, commercial banks, investment banks, state-owned banks, banks dedicated to funding environmental industries. It also means greater simplicity to ensure that shocks do not lead to system collapse. That is why it is a mistake to accept, at the first sign of resistance from finance sector, that there can be no Glass-Stegall-style separation of retail and investment banking. We need to be clear what an insufficiently robust response to the crisis means. It means allowing the City and Wall Street to hoover up all the fish and chop down all the trees.

His offending remark was made in an exchange with Andrew Marshall, a senior editor on the Asia desk in Singapore. He was reprimanded and given a written warning. Other journalists, mostly in other regions, were also in the chatroom, which was created specifically for Reuters staff involved in the Japan disaster story. Fox, a Zimbabwean who has served many assignments in war zones, was dismissed without possibility of appeal. He is thought to be consulting lawyers. Many staff are said to be upset about his departure, arguing that he was involved in typical newsroom banter.

Noma Copenhagen, DenmarkLast year&apos;s position: 1 Noma is best known for its fanatical approach to foraging but there is much more to this ground-breaking restaurant than the mere picking of Mother Nature&apos;s pocket. It&apos;s the entire package, from its ingredient ingenuity to flawless execution, that makes it a beacon of excellence and which leads to an emotive, intense, liberating way of eating, unlike any other. Many have copied chef Rene Redzepi&apos;s approach, most have failed. For the best in class, Noma really is the number one place to go.\u2022 noma.dk 2. El Celler de Can Roca Girona, SpainLast year&apos;s position: 4 El Celler de Can Roca is possibly the least well-known restaurant to have ever held the much-vaunted number-two spot on the list, a quirk which, far from being a hindrance, has allowed the three brothers Roca to get on with what they do best. Their &quot;emotional cuisine&quot; with different ingredients and combinations can trigger childhood memories or take you back to a specific place in your past.\u2022 cellercanroca.com 3. Mugaritz San Sebasti\u00e1n, SpainLast year&apos;s position: 5 Mugaritz has two d\u00e9gustation menus that change daily according to what chef Andoni Luis Aduriz can get his hands on at the street markets and what&apos;s growing in the restaurant&apos;s herb garden. Whatever happens, you can expect to sample the team&apos;s intricate dishes that seek to reconnect diners with nature. His self-dubbed &quot;techno-emotional&quot; approach sees the appliance of science and a rigorous understanding of ingredients jostle with produce-driven cuisine. \u2022 mugaritz.com 4. Osteria Francescana Modena, ItalyLast year&apos;s position: 6 Much of the food at Osteria Francescana takes its inspiration from the art world, but this is only half the story. The unrivalled culinary heritage of the Emilia\u2013Romagna region is chef Massimo Bottura&apos;s other great muse, and the kitchen offers a menu of traditional food alongside more left-field creations. The cooking is exciting and gratifying, the overall experience progressive and relaxed. \u2022 osteriafrancescana.it 5. The Fat Duck Bray, UKLast year&apos;s position: 3 Heston Blumenthal&apos;s world-famous, but still tiny restaurant in Bray, has blazed a trail for experimental cooking in this country, but one of its enduring features is also that it is brilliant fun. Sure, guests&apos; sensory perceptions are challenged, their notion of possibility expanded, but never in a po-faced way. Instead, gourmand pilgrims can be witnessed smiling and laughing their way through a foodie marathon. \u2022 fatduck.co.uk 6. Alinea Chicago, USALast year&apos;s position: 7 Alinea represents one of the most radical re-imaginings of fine food by any chef in American history and has propelled Grant Achatz to chef superstardom. Everything about his restaurant is unique, from the deconstructed food, unfamiliar flavour combinations and theatre to the tableware, with dishes served in and on all manner of implements: test tubes, cylinders, multi-layered bowls that come apart. It&apos;s boundary-shifting stuff.\u2022 alinea-restaurant.com 7. D.O.M. S\u00e3o Paolo, BrazilLast year&apos;s position: 18 D.O.M. has become a priority destination for all globe-hopping gastronomes, not that chef Alex Atala is resting on his laurels. Instead he scours the Amazon to pepper his with indigenous ingredients, from the staple manioc tuber and its tupuci juice to Amazonian herbs and the huge white-fleshed pirarucu fish to ensure his restaurant is unlike any other on the list.\u2022 domrestaurante.com.br 8. Arzak San Sebasti\u00e1n, SpainLast year&apos;s position: 9 If you like your food pretty, this is the place. Father-and-daughter team Juan Mari Arzak and Elena Arzak Espina&apos;s plates look fantastic: striking, colourful and imaginative, yet for the most part unfussy. The pair run the kitchen as equals and are a major presence in the dining room. Like the food, it pulls off the neat trick of balancing tradition and innovation, with warm, familiar service.\u2022 arzak.es 9. Le Chateaubriand Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 11 It&apos;s hard not to be excited by Le Chateaubriand. It is effortlessly cool, understated yet accomplished, democratic, affordable and, perhaps most importantly, fun. Its lack of airs and graces - hard chairs and bare tables, the take-it-or-leave-it five-course fixed-price menu and the championing of natural wines \u2013 is not to everyone&apos;s tastes, but Le Chateaubriand doesn&apos;t really care.\u2022 +33 (0)1 43 57 46 95 10. Per Se New York, USALast year&apos;s position: 10 Per Se, Thomas Keller&apos;s &quot;urban interpretation&quot; of his French Laundry in California, has changed its menu every day of its nearly eight years \u2014 that&apos;s something like 30,000 different dishes, some re-introduced from prior seasons but continuously refined. With three Michelin stars it has succeeded as much by consistency as by creativity and remains one of the US&apos;s true destination restaurants. \u2022 perseny.com 11. Daniel New York, USALast year&apos;s position: 8 Daniel Boulud&apos;s desire to meld unexpected ingredients and create dishes you won&apos;t see on any other menu make for one of Manhattan&apos;s most exquisite eating-out experiences. Today his restaurant empire is blossoming, with openings across the world, but for a true taste of the Lyonnaise lion, to Manhattan you must go.\u2022 danielnyc.com 12. Les Cr\u00e9ations de Narisawa Tokyo, JapanLast year&apos;s position: 24 Much has been made of the fact that the first Japanese restaurant to make this list has a distinct French accent, but chef-owner Yoshihiro Narisawa is not just producing Gallic haute cuisine with a Pacific edge. Themes of soil, water, fire, charcoal and forest permeate the menu to reflect Narisawa&apos;s bringing of nature to the plate, resulting in dishes complete with the smell, aspect or texture of the landscape from which they were drawn.\u2022 narisawa-yoshihiro.com 13. L&apos;Astrance Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 16 Pascal Barbot opened L&apos;Astrance after making his name at Alain Passard&apos;s L&apos;Arp\u00e8ge. That was back in 2000, and since then he has built up a serious reputation and is now regarded as one of the most innovative and distinct chefs in France. There&apos;s no menu as such \u2013 just tell him what you can&apos;t or won&apos;t eat and he&apos;ll prepare a bespoke succession of wildly creative dishes. \u2022 +33 (0)1 40 50 84 40 14. L&apos;Atelier Saint-Germain de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 29 With its emphasis on conviviality, L&apos;Atelier moved Jo\u00ebl Robuchon from fine dining into fun dining. Interaction between diners \u2013 seated at a sushi-bar \u2013 and chefs, who performed in an open-plan kitchen, was encouraged and kitchen theatre quickly became the rage. That the original remains so popular is largely the result of Eric Lecerf and Philippe Braun, two of Robuchon&apos;s most trusted lieutenants, who man the Parisian fort while Robuchon trots the globe.\u2022 joel-robuchon.net 15. Hof van Cleve Kruishoutem, BelgiumLast year&apos;s position: 17 Chef-patron Peter Goossens lives and breathes local produce, and a meal at Hof van Cleve shows both the considerable extent of his regional larder and his talent at exploiting it. Fish and shellfish feature prominently, suiting Goossens&apos; style of cuisine, in which he highlights freshness of flavour and reminds you of the source of your food. That said, he&apos;s no one-region pony and has an increasing interest in Asian cuisine.\u2022 hofvancleve.com 16. Pierre Gagnaire Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 13 Pierre Gagnaire&apos;s eponymous restaurant in Paris is still one of the most vaunted places to eat in the French capital, demonstrating the resilience of one of the food world&apos;s true greats. Gagnaire&apos;s approach to cooking combines a touch of the poetic with a dash of simplicity and a soup\u00e7on of wistfulness for dishes that appear as mini art forms. \u2022 pierre-gagnaire.com 17. Oud Sluis Sluis, Netherlands Last year&apos;s position: 19 Oud Sluis has run for three generations and current patron, Sergio Herman, has remained true to its founding principles \u2013 capitalising on the Zeeland coast&apos;s fresh fish and oysters. This is no ordinary seafood restaurant, however. Herman&apos;s quest for flavour-matches of Italian and Japanese influence, such as langoustine with artichoke, Iberico ham and makrut lime leaves, has earned him a reputation as one of the country&apos;s most inspiring chefs.\u2022 oudsluis.nl 18. Le Bernardin New York, USA Last year&apos;s position: 15 Fish is the star of the show at Le Bernardin but only when you eat there do you fully realise the high regard chef Eric Ripert holds for our underwater friends. The menu is a who&apos;s who of the sea, with red snapper, monkfish, fluke, turbot, salmon, king fish, halibut, lobster, bass, skate and kampachi in forms including &quot;almost raw&quot;, &quot;barely touched&quot; and &quot;lightly cooked&quot;. \u2022 le-bernardin.com 19. L&apos;Arp\u00e8ge Paris, FranceRe-entry Alain Passard cut red meat from his menu back in 2001, but the Breton-born chef is no drum-banging vegetarian: the menus at this elegant restaurant, close to the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, still include top-notch game, poultry and seafood. However, L&apos;Arp\u00e8ge remains veg-centric and is a haven for pescetarians, vegetarians and even \u2013 whisper it \u2013 vegans. It&apos;s also hallowed ground for chefs and Passard&apos;s light touch and flawless presentation has made him a true French master.\u2022 alain-passard.com 20. Nihonryori RyuGin Tokyo, JapanLast year&apos;s position: 48 The menu at Nihonryori RyuGin is built around the seasons and chef Seiji Yamamoto takes great care to retain the integrity of traditional Japanese ingredients and cooking methods while pushing the boundaries of the cuisine. Yamamoto delights in avant-garde techniques \u2013 he&apos;s not afraid to flex his Arnie-like culinary muscles at times \u2013 but his overall approach doesn&apos;t overlook tradition. One dish features 30 kinds of Japanese spring vegetables and 10 types of shellfish.\u2022 nihonryori-ryugin.com 21. Vend\u00f4me Bergisch Gladbach, GermanyLast year&apos;s position: 22 The minute you turn into the drive of the imposing Schloss Bensberg \u2013 the hotel in which Vend\u00f4me is housed \u2013 you know you&apos;re in for a treat. Here, chef Joachim Wissler invites diners to accompany him on a small or grand &quot;expedition&quot;, where they can feast on simply prepared dishes that come thick and fast. It&apos;s a surreal Alice in Wonderland-like jaunt through Germany&apos;s forgotten culinary landscape: fun, but with an underlying seriousness.\u2022 schlossbensberg.com 22. Steirereck Vienna, Austria Last year&apos;s position: 21 Steirereck, housed in a beautiful Art Deco building in Vienna&apos;s central city park, is a grand affair with a 35,000-strong wine list and stunning views over the river Wien. Yet the food has stayed true to its old-world heritage with chef Heinz Reitbauer using national and regional Austrian cooking to create small moments of surprise through the discovery of previously unknown ingredients or the resurrection of those long forgotten.\u2022 steirereck.at/wien/restaurant 23. Schloss Schauenstein F\u00fcrstenau, Switzerland Last year&apos;s position: 30 With only 26 covers, Schauenstein is one of the smallest restaurants in the list and since being awarded three Michelin stars last November is even harder to get into than previous years. Its chef, Andreas Caminada, is a serious talent who eschews the whizz-bang style of cuisine. Instead, he prefers to tease out the extraordinary potential of simple ingredients to create masterpieces of craft, taste, colour and precision. \u2022 schauenstein.ch 24. Eleven Madison Park New York, USALast year&apos;s position: 50 Eleven Madison Park is increasingly making waves within international circles and is the second-highest climber on this year&apos;s list. The restaurant recently underwent considerable change with chef Daniel Humm and general manager Will Guidara reducing capacity from 114 covers to 80 and completely revamping the menu. There&apos;s no more \u00e0 la carte. Instead, a card printed with a grid of 16 ingredients hints at the dishes available.\u2022 elevenmadisonpark.com 25. Aqua Wolfsburg, Germany Last year&apos;s position: 34 Aqua&apos;s location is corporate in the extreme \u2013 the Wolfsburg Ritz-Carlton overlooks Volkswagen&apos;s Autostadt visitor attraction \u2013 but this is no soulless, carbon copy, could-be-anywhere, hotel fine-dining joint. Sven Elverfeld applies his considerable skills to peasant food, resulting in avant-garde re-workings of boiled lamb fillet with Frankfurt green sauce and beef with sour cream, gherkins and beetroot. In a place where you&apos;d expect absolutely no reference to location, it&apos;s here in spades. \u2022 restaurant-aqua.com 26. Quay Sydney, AustraliaLast year&apos;s position: 27 Long before it was so deeply fashionable, chef Peter Gilmore was perfecting his &quot;nature-based cuisine&quot; at Quay with his dazzling array of dishes. The restaurant has retained the coveted &quot;Three Hats&quot; from the Australian Good Food Guide for a ninth consecutive year and Gilmore recently published his first book \u2013 Quay: food inspired by Nature \u2013 a visually sumptuous but deeply informative exposition of his work.\u2022 quay.com.au 27. Iggy&apos;s Singapore Last year&apos;s position: 28 Iggy&apos;s made the move from The Regent Singapore hotel to new premises at The Hilton late last year, doubling the size of the original restaurant, but owner Ignatius Chan has resisted the temptation to use this as a way of ramping up the number of covers for the sake of more Singaporean dollars. The kitchen has lost none of its flair and precision with flavours strong and uncompromising, with dishes that have a true international grounding.\u2022 iggys.com.sg 28. Combal Zero Turin, ItalyLast year&apos;s position: 35 Anyone somewhat fatigued by samey high-end restaurants should definitely consider a trip to Combal Zero, where its hyper-creative, conceptual tasting menu will be equivalent to a round of electric shock therapy, stimulating mind and body alike. Chef-proprietor Davide Scabin is out to blow his customers&apos; minds and challenge perceptions with cutting-edge dishes served with incredible creativity - including Around the World in Five Soups and a helium balloon, supplied with Campari and soda-water capsules.\u2022 combal.org 29. Mart\u00edn Berasategui San Sebasti\u00e1n, SpainLast year&apos;s position: 33 Mart\u00edn Berasategui may have taken a bit of stick for being the only heavyweight Basque chef to take his brand of cooking worldwide (he has an outlet in Shanghai), but the food at his flagship continues to impress. The menu comprises 13 tiny, neatly presented dishes and foams, jellies and spherified balls abound, but Berasategui stays true to his roots: he uses very little non-regional produce and all his plates reference traditional dishes. \u2022 martinberasategui.com 30. Bras Laguiole, FranceRe-entry Working on the top of a hill in a remote slice of the French countryside, Michel Bras (pronounced Brahs) forages little-known herbs and vegetables and gently coaxes the best out of them, creating beautiful, organic plates such as his signature dish of Gargouillou containing more than 50 varieties of vegetable, herbs and flowers. Bras has never worked in anyone else&apos;s kitchen (aside from his mother&apos;s) and this is reflected in his simple, distinctive cooking. \u2022 bras.fr 31. Biko Mexico City, MexicoLast year&apos;s position: 46 If you&apos;re hankering after a taste of techno-emotional Spanish cuisine but can&apos;t stomach the inevitable \u20ac300 bill, you might consider a trip to Mexico City&apos;s Biko, where a tasting menu is a snip at just under \u20ac40. At Biko, Mexican food gets the modern Basque treatment: the gentle appliance of science to get the best out of local produce, combined with deft use of big, concentrated flavours in complicated, artfully presented dishes. \u2022 biko.com.mx 32. Le Calandre Padua, ItalyLast year&apos;s position: 20 Le Calandre represents contemporary Italian cooking&apos;s middle ground. That&apos;s not to say that Massimiliano Alajmo&apos;s cooking is in any way average, but his cuisine is not extreme; it doesn&apos;t seek to challenge or confuse but is rather grounded in what is in season and what tastes good. Last year the restaurant underwent a major refurbishment, doing away with tablecloths in the process, to better reflect the philosophy of the kitchen. \u2022 calandre.com 33. Cracco Milan, Italy Last year&apos;s position: Re-entry Carlo Cracco is often credited \u2013 and occasionally derided \u2013 as being the ringleader of a small but important group of Italian chefs attempting to break away from the constraints of cooking &quot;traditional&quot; food. At his eponymous Milan restaurant he creates challenging cuisine that has won him considerable acclaim from the major Italian guides and two stars from Michelin. If you&apos;re not a fan of sea urchins, snails and slugs, though, it may be one to swerve.\u2022 ristorantecracco.it 34. The Ledbury London, UK New entry Tucked away in the affluent but relatively off-piste Notting Hill neighbourhood of west London, Brett Graham&apos;s small but perfectly realised restaurant has become one of the city&apos;s ultimate dining destinations. The tone is set by impeccable service, with the largely Antipodean front-of-house staff successfully walking the tightrope between formal and relaxed. Graham&apos;s equally outstanding food combines elements of French cuisine using traditional British ingredients, presented with charm and personality.\u2022 theledbury.com 35. Chez Dominique Helsinki, Finland Last year&apos;s position: 23 Chef-patron Hans V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki has been flying the flag for Finland&apos;s cuisine since 1998 at Chez Dominique, regularly voted the country&apos;s best restaurant for its innovative cooking based around Nordic and French flavours. The idea behind V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki&apos;s cooking is to surprise by providing an experience unlike any other restaurant \u2013 an act he achieves through offering mystery menus where the diner places their trust at his mercy. It&apos;s a gamble well worth taking.\u2022 chezdominique.fi 36. Le Quartier Fran\u00e7ais Franschhoek, South AfricaLast year&apos;s position: 31 Part upmarket auberge, part award-winning restaurant complex, Le Quartier Fran\u00e7ais nestles in a corner of the Cape winelands. Dutch-born chef Margot Janse&apos;s nine-course African-inspired Surprise Menu, paired with local wines, takes diners on a gourmet safari, highlighting southern African flavours, many of which are sourced from Le Quartier&apos;s gardens. Others, such as Kalahari salt, hail from Namibia. Janse&apos;s aim is to be 100% African in all her produce \u2013 she&apos;s 80% there.\u2022 lequartier.co.za 37. Amber Hong Kong, China New entry Dutch-born Richard Ekkebus is at the helm of newcomer Amber, the signature restaurant of Hong Kong&apos;s five-star Landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and is perfectly placed to procure the best Japanese line-caught fish and other produce that passes through the former silk and spice crossroads. The restaurant has high standards of on-plate artistry and imaginatively explores French conventions and combinations of tastes and textures, amplified by a daily-changing wine list. \u2022 amberhongkong.com 38. Dal Pescatore Mantua, Italy Last year&apos;s position: 36 This family restaurant notched up a Michelin first when it was awarded three stars in 1996: Nadia Santini became the first female chef in Italy to gain top marks. Even now, it&apos;s easy to see what attracted the little red book to this out-of-the-way corner of Mantua \u2013 the setting is luxurious and while the cuisine is still rigorously authentic Italian, the kitchen remains ever-receptive to new ideas or ingredients. \u2022 dalpescatore.com 39. Il Canto Siena, ItalyLast year&apos;s position: 40 Working out of a former Carthusian convent, Paolo Lopriore boldly offers decidedly non-traditional food in a region with one of the most fiercely protected culinary identities in Italy. He may use Tuscan classics such as ribollita and tonno e fagioli as a jumping-off point, but from there it&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess what will happen next. A few diners report &apos;challenging&apos; flavours but the vast majority come away raving about the confidence of the chef&apos;s direction. \u2022 certosadimaggiano.com 40. Momofuku Ss\u00e4m Bar New York, USALast year&apos;s position: 26 Pork takes a starring role at David Chang&apos;s informal and buzzing restaurant, either slow-cooked shoulder or braised and grilled belly served in steamed buns or wrapped in lettuce (Ss\u00e4m means wrapped). There are small plates, too, that reflect Chang&apos;s eclectic approach: Short Rib Sandwich \u2013 Taleggio, Beet Slaw and Bacon or maybe Spicy Honeycomb Tripe with Ginger, Scallion, Celery and Pickled Tomatoes. Think of it as a Pan-Asian St John. \u2022 momofuku.com 41. St John London, UK Last year&apos;s position: 43 Founders Trevor Gulliver and Fergus Henderson have been busy becoming hoteliers this year but it&apos;s business as usual at their stalwart British restaurant-cum-canteen. Here you can eat some of the best meat dishes in London, from whole suckling pig to roast mutton, in refreshingly unfussy surroundings. What&apos;s lacking in pomp is more than made up for in technical ability. Its Welsh rarebit is easily one of the finest of its kind in the world. \u2022 stjohnrestaurant.com 42. Astrid Y Gast\u00f3n Lima, PeruNew entry Gast\u00f3n Acurio&apos;s flagship restaurant in the Peruvian capital may be a newcomer to the list, but its chef-owner is already a well-established star of international gastronomy. At Astrid Y Gast\u00f3n, Acurio uses myriad indigenous ingredients, led by Pacific seafood, and traditional cooking methods fused with the international influences for beautifully conceived dishes such as Warm Amazonian Ceviche, Suckling Goat with Loche Pumpkin and Lucuma Panacotta on Cocoa Alfajor. \u2022 astridygaston.com 43. Hibiscus London, UKLast year&apos;s position: 49 Claude Bosi moved Hibiscus to London from Ludlow four years ago and his intense focus has paid increasing dividends with discerning diners. Bosi&apos;s dishes tread the fine line between classic and modern. He is not interested in bizarre flavour combinations or hi-tech methods that change the intrinsic nature of ingredients, but instead focuses on originality and flair. The result is a restaurant that stands proud among its peers not only in the UK, but across the globe.\u2022 hibiscusrestaurant.co.uk 44. Maison Troisgros Roanne, France Last year&apos;s position: 44 Maison Troisgros has held three Michelin stars since 1968 and is currently under the control of Michel Troisgros, who picked up the reins in the late &apos;80s. Though very much grounded in classical French food, Michel Troisgros has embraced other influences, most notably Japanese and Italian, for an unfussy and distinctly modern cuisine, yet in a nod to its mighty gastronomic heritage, its Escalope of Salmon with Sorrel signature dish has remained on the menu unchanged since 1965. \u2022 troisgros.fr 45. Alain Ducasse au Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Paris, FranceLast year&apos;s position: 41 Alain Ducasse has gone back to basics at his eponymous flagship restaurant. There&apos;s now much less going on in his dishes \u2013 just two or three main ingredients presented simply, yet artfully \u2013 and his key aim is to strike a balance between acidity, bitterness and sweetness. He&apos;s using less salt and fat too, confident in his team&apos;s ability to introduce great flavour by other means \u2013 although the presentation remains as flamboyant as the interior. \u2022 plaza-athenee-paris.com 46. De Librije Zwolle, NetherlandsLast year&apos;s position: 37 Twenty-five years before it became fashionable, a passion for local, seasonal ingredients was the foundation upon which chef Jonnie Boer built his career and De Librije regularly features perch, eel and gurnard on its menus. The kitchen has a philosophy of simple purity, with Boer stating &quot;it is not a laboratory&quot; and the current menu features plenty of robust, earthy flavours, perfect to ward off winter&apos;s lingering chill. \u2022 librije.com 47. Restaurant de l&apos;H\u00f4tel de Ville Crissier, SwitzerlandLast year&apos;s position: 14 While many restaurants take a shock-and-awe approach of pairing unusual ingredients as an obstacle course for the palate, chef patron Philippe Rochat&apos;s cooking is refreshingly straightforward, dare we say old-school. Attention to detail plays a major part of the dining experience and the kitchen sources the very best caviar, truffles and cheeses, whatever the price; bread is baked daily on-site and each dish contains only three main constituent flavours. \u2022 philippe-rochat.ch 48. Varvary Moscow, RussiaNew entry Chef Anatoly Komm is turning heads with an approach that is unashamedly &quot;traditional Russian&quot; on the one hand, but exciting and contemporary on the other. Fans of Komm include Ferran Adri\u00e0, who praises the chef for turning clich\u00e9d Russian cuisine on its head by combining traditional dishes and contemporary techniques with spectacular results. His 12-course &quot;Gastronomic Show&quot;, for example, features Borscht with Foie Gras and a Russian Salad using ingredients sourced in Russia. \u2022 anatolykomm.ru 49. Pujol Mexico City, MexicoNew entry Head chef Enrique Olvera has switched from fancy dining to Mexican food &quot;with soul&quot; at Pujol with market-inspired dishes that nod to a strong cultural legacy. Cooking in clay pots has ousted the water bath but the food is no less modern \u2013 think coffee, corn and flying ants toasted and ground into a powder, stuffed into a dried pumpkin and wrapped in corn leaves, then heated to evoke a balmy Mexican street scene. \u2022 pujol.com.mx 50.

Being one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world (out of a population of 48.6 million, 39.4 million use the internet), the country&apos;s music industry suffered from rampant piracy for most of the past decade. There was little revenue to be collected internally, and there wasn&apos;t much demand for Korean artists outside the territory. Though Universal Music Group opened an office in the country over a decade ago, the only local artists it would invest in were classical ones. But about four years ago \u2013 when, perhaps not so coincidentally, South Korea introduced anti-piracy legislation \u2013 Pelle Lidell, European A&amp;R executive of the company&apos;s publishing arm, turned his attention to pitching songs written by his roster of largely Scandinavian and British songwriters to Korean artists. Today UMG considers Korea to be one of the most important territories \u2013 and it&apos;s all because of K-pop. The K-pop phenomenon emerged at the beginning of the last decade, with Korean music production houses taking the concept of pop factories to levels way beyond The X Factor. Companies such as SM Entertainment and Play Cube Entertainment tapped into the 360 degree model way before the major labels \u2013 being independent record labels, talent agencies and publishers with their own academies where they groom young teenagers to be pop stars. SME even has its own merchandise store in Seoul. The SM Entertainment building, set in what Lidell calls &quot;the coolest youth district&quot; of the city, contains a coffee shop, luxury restaurant, a section where you can take pictures that look like you&apos;re sitting with the SME stars, and a store for SME artist memorabilia. Though 55% of Korean music sales are digital, the company makes sure that physical CDs are attractive enough for the fans to splurge on them as well. It doesn&apos;t release records in ordinary CD cases; they&apos;re all in glossy luxury packaging. They&apos;re often released in up to five different packages \u2013 and the fans buy them all. To call SME an independent is almost misleading, as the company has 250 employees and has sold more than 59m records in the last year alone. &quot;What UK label sells that many records of local repertoire in a year?&quot; asks Lidell. &quot;They&apos;re the biggest in Korea. Today, many of the biggest US artists and songwriters, like will.i.am and Sean Garrett, shuttle back and forth to work with Korean acts.&quot; He adds: &quot;I&apos;ve never had a single release [in Korea] that has sold less than 400,000. Mirotic, a single by the group TVXQ sold around 2m in Korea and Japan (the group call themselves Tohoshinki in Japan). SME boy band Super Junior is Korean, but they&apos;ve also put together a Super Junior in China. So sometimes when I get a cut with a song I&apos;ll make three different adaptations: Korean, Japanese and Chinese.&quot; There&apos;s also a lot of sync income in Korea. The song Top Billing Love \u2013 written by Karen Poole, Bloodshy and Avant, responsible for hits for artists like Kylie and Britney \u2013 almost made it onto a Britney Spears album in 2002. SME did a deal with mobile phone manufacturer LG and its biggest girl groups, Girls&apos; Generation and FX, did a version each of the song, calling it Chocolate Love, since LG were launching a new brown phone. Girls&apos; Generation&apos;s version went straight to number one. A few weeks later they released the FX version , which also went to number one. Then they released a joint version for LG, which also went to the top of the charts. It took a bit longer for the recording side of UMG to get involved with K-pop. &quot;It&apos;s only in the past two years that we&apos;ve seen proper growth in revenue from Korea,&quot; says Sandy Monteiro, the president of UMG International in South East Asia. &quot;Investing in this kind of artist development is not cheap. Though local classical artists are more niche, they&apos;re a safer bet and require a tiny investment compared to K-pop acts. There are so many companies working with what we call &apos;the Idol format&apos;, so you&apos;ve got a fight on your hands. But on 1 January last year we took the plunge.&quot; That&apos;s when UMG decided to invest in Play Cube Entertainment, resulting in the label&apos;s K-pop sales jumping from 9% of total Korean sales to 29% in 2010. But K-pop isn&apos;t just a success in its country of birth. It&apos;s also big in countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan, Singapore, China and Japan. While Play Cube&apos;s biggest act, boy band Beast, reached six-times-platinum sales in Korea alone, it also sold gold in most other south-east Asian markets. Its biggest girl group, 4Minute, isn&apos;t far behind. &quot;Beast are as big in South East Asia as Backstreet Boys were in the west, 15 years ago,&quot; says Monteiro. Idol sales represent about 40% of all music sales in Korea, but they make up the bulk of all sales of Korean music in the rest of south-east Asia. That&apos;s why UMG is now also licensing Korean repertoire that is not signed to the label, including some of SME&apos;s acts, to countries outside Korea. &quot;[The K-pop production houses] tend to be quite mercenary. But they&apos;ve realised the value of partnering with a stable set-up like ours.&quot; Monteiro doubts K-pop will ever become as big in countries like the US and UK, as music fans in those markets would just be too critical about the lyrics and the acts&apos; accents when singing in English. That, however, doesn&apos;t seem to be a major problem considering that while UK revenue from record sales shrunk by more than 11% in 2010, Korean overall sales were up 11.7%. This is why, at a recent industry event in Abu Dhabi, UMG&apos;s head of digital, Rob Wells, indicated that K-pop was high on the label&apos;s list of priorities, and Monteiro says UMG is planning to double its investment in Korea. The fact that South Korea has very strict anti-piracy laws \u2013 including a three-strike rule for illegal downloaders \u2013 has helped turn around the fortunes of the country&apos;s music industry. But UMG&apos;s Korean managing director, Beom-Joon Yang, believes that there&apos;s more to it. &quot;We think the combined popularity of Korean megastar icons like Rain, Korean television soap dramas, top-quality music production in Korea, and a genuine love for Korean culture overall around Asia, have attributed to making K-pop part of mainstream pop culture.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/21/malaysia-fights-brain-drain", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;ll likely go to Singapore for a few years, and then after that maybe Canada or New Zealand,&quot; he said.", "By moving to countries such as Singapore, Australia and the UK, these migrants are creating a considerable brain drain that threatens the country&apos;s economic progress.", "&quot;Brain drain is hurting the country&apos;s drive to move up the value chain,&quot; said Dr Ooi Kee Beng, senior fellow at the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore.", "&quot;The fact that Malaysians fill many of the top and middle management posts in the region, from Shanghai to Singapore, tells us that the country is bleeding talent.&quot; The problem has been getting worse in recent years."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-21T17:47:49Z", "title": "Malaysia at economic crossroads as it fights the great brain drain", "tags": ["Malaysia", "World news", "Global economy", "Global development"], "article": "Sheng Cai Lim is a skilled and experienced IT professional, an asset to a country that aspires to grow into a fully developed nation by the end of the decade. There&apos;s only one problem. Lim, 29, isn&apos;t sure he wants to stay in Malaysia. Lim says it&apos;s 50/50 that he&apos;ll leave. &quot;I&apos;ll likely go to Singapore for a few years, and then after that maybe Canada or New Zealand,&quot; he said. He&apos;s on a six-month sabbatical from work and recently registered with head hunters who place candidates abroad. &quot;My friends overseas wonder why I&apos;m still in Malaysia. They say there are better opportunities abroad,&quot; he said. If Lim does make the move, he&apos;ll join the 1.5m Malaysians, or 5.3% of the population, who live and work outside of the country, according to the World Bank. By moving to countries such as Singapore, Australia and the UK, these migrants are creating a considerable brain drain that threatens the country&apos;s economic progress. &quot;Brain drain is hurting the country&apos;s drive to move up the value chain,&quot; said Dr Ooi Kee Beng, senior fellow at the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore. &quot;The fact that Malaysians fill many of the top and middle management posts in the region, from Shanghai to Singapore, tells us that the country is bleeding talent.&quot; The problem has been getting worse in recent years. More than 300,000 Malaysians left the country between March 2008 and August 2009, compared to nearly 140,000 in 2007, the deputy foreign affairs minister, Tuan A Kohilan Pillay told parliament. Many work in key sectors such as finance, technology and engineering. Two factors are driving the exodus, said Tony Pua, MP and member of the opposition committee on the ministry of higher education. &quot;First, there&apos;s simple economics. You can make more money overseas,&quot; he said. The other cause is the country&apos;s race-based affirmative action policies, Pua said, which favour ethnic-majority bumiputra, or sons of the soil, over minority Chinese and Indians, who make up 24% and 7% of the population, respectively. &quot;The two problems exacerbate each other. The economy has not been growing, and there&apos;s an increasing demand for a bigger piece of the pie among bumiputra. As a result, the government is more prone to implement policies that favour them, and minorities feel excluded. It&apos;s a vicious cycle,&quot; Pua said. Malaysian law provides bumiputra benefits such as rebates on property prices, quotas for university enrolment and civil-service jobs, and preferential treatment for government contracts, among other advantages. The laws, which were enacted in 1971 in an attempt to redistribute wealth in the wake of race riots in 1969, distinguish Malaysia from other Asian countries with brain-drain problems, such as the Philippines. In interviews with Malaysians living in Kuala Lumpur and overseas, frustration with these laws and worries about rising racial tension and Islamic conservatism have led many to reconsider their futures in their country of birth. &quot;Malaysia is a very controlled and fanatic country,&quot; said Janath Anantha Vass, 29, an ethnic Indian accountant in Kuala Lumpur who plans to move to Australia. &quot;Melbourne suits my lifestyle the best, and I feel that&apos;s the place for me.&quot; The Malaysian government is attempting to respond to the problem with an array of programmes, including 1Malaysia, a campaign designed to ease racial tensions. In January, Prime Minister Najib Razak launched the Talent Corporation, which seeks to lure back skilled Malaysians. But many are sceptical that these programmes will address the systemic problems driving brain drain. &quot;I&apos;m not sure how effective Talent Corporation will be. Past programmes like this have not worked, and I&apos;m not sure how this one is different,&quot; said Evelyn Wong, an ethnic Chinese economics student at Scripps College in California, who blogs about brain drain. But Dr Kim Leng Yeah, an economist at Ram Holdings in Kuala Lumpur, said Talent Corporation did at least demonstrate the government&apos;s willingness to address the issue. &quot;There has been a lot of public scepticism,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is a proactive move.&quot; Representatives at Talent Corporation declined to comment. As Lim, who is ethnic Chinese, considers his future, he has spent time thinking about his place in multicultural Malaysia. &quot;I do realise that I am a minority in this country,&quot; he said. &quot;My family is encouraging me to leave. They say, &apos;Malaysia doesn&apos;t want us anymore, so why stay?&apos;&quot; And while he hasn&apos;t given up on eventually returning, he would have to see significant changes before doing so. &quot;It doesn&apos;t feel like the country is mature enough to tackle its problems right now. When we are ready to face our problems, I&apos;ll be ready to come back,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/apr/24/gavin-henson-rugby-bust-ups", "sentences": ["He jumped ship in Singapore and disappeared into the Australian outback."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-23T23:05:00Z", "title": "Gavin Henson brings a whole new brawl game to rugby's boozy bust-ups | Eddie Butler", "tags": ["Gavin Henson", "Rugby union", "Sport"], "article": "Rugby is, it seems, bingeing its way into the headlines, and not just through the well-oiled conduit of booze.

The Welsh No8 Andy Powell is in trouble with Cipriani&apos;s old club, Wasps, not so much apparently for being beaten up by a gang of QPR fans and having 10 stitches inserted in his head, as for revealing all to the media first, rather than to his club. Perhaps the player, whose form included his 2010 classic drive in a golf buggy down the hard shoulder of the M4 to a service station for breakfast, couldn&apos;t resist his Glasgow kiss and tell. Nobody, however, compares with Gavin Henson. The Welsh exile is making his own attempt to start afresh, in France, but has been banned for allegedly scrapping with his Toulon team-mate Matt Henjak, an Australian scrum-half with a bit of previous himself. He was fired in 2008 by Western Force, the Perth-based Super 15 franchise, for breaking the jaw of a team-mate, Haig Sare. What made Henson&apos;s latest lapse utterly despicable wasn&apos;t the fight, but the taunts he aimed at Jonny Wilkinson, which would turn a Buddhist bellicose. To be heard picking on Jonny is like being caught nailing Bambi into a veal crate. Where has it all come from, this descent into alcoholic abusiveness? The tendency probably never went away. As long as you have a sport fuelled by adrenaline on the field, the temptation to top up with alcohol off it will always be there. There was a time, in the puritanism of early professionalism, when all traces of the ancien regime&apos;s amateurism had to be expurgated. Having a few pints as a social networking tool gave way to the tying together of logs on corporate away days. Rugby players went to the same bonding agencies as yuppies. The trouble with such activities is that they didn&apos;t necessarily work. The tours on which science was placed before tradition \u2013 Graham Henry&apos;s 2001 Lions tour to Australia and Clive Woodward&apos;s in 2005 to New Zealand \u2013 have gone down as fractured adventures. The 2009 tour, coached by Ian McGeechan, was loved by the players and they went within a whisker of beating South Africa, the world champions. Beer was their glue. The danger is that little can be kept behind closed doors. And Lions tours are the most carefully monitored, with a media pack numbering three figures on their trail. In 1971, the one and only Lions tour to win in New Zealand, there was no live TV coverage of the games, either there or here. The story of the tour was delivered first by newspaper, from a contingent of eight journalists from overseas and seven from NZ. They were all, according to their own writing, far too busy packing their own picnic hampers with fine fare and lashings of fizz to worry about what the players got up to off the field. If they knew, they never said. The All Blacks of that time learned just how unruly the Lions could be. When New Zealanders were invited to South Africa to play for a world team in 1976 they were surprised to find their hotels had almost no furniture. They were told that the Lions had wrecked so much on the tour of 1974 that it was deemed wiser to remove temptation. By way of contrast, All Blacks who transgressed in those days did not merely have their decor confiscated. When Keith Murdoch, giant prop of Otago and known to be a handful in drink, punched a security guard who tried to put a stop to his late-night raid on the kitchen of the Angel Hotel in Cardiff after Wales v New Zealand in 1972, he landed himself in deep trouble. The other All Blacks, led by Ian Kirkpatrick, vowed that any disciplining should be an internal matter, but the wheels of the blazers&apos; establishment had begun to turn and Murdoch was soon on his way home. He jumped ship in Singapore and disappeared into the Australian outback. It is hard to see Cipriani or Henson ever ending up as neighbours to Murdoch. But if they step out of line they step into a glare of exposure. Perhaps they should follow the example of Sonny Bill Williams, the All Black centre whose physique makes Murdoch look flimsy and who once had alcohol-related incidents of his own, including being caught in flagrante with the Australian model/ironwoman, Candice Falzon. He converted to Islam. There, easy. We should raise a glass to Gavin and Danny and Bradley and Ben and Sonny Bill in a new caliphate of rugby."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/24/rangers-celtic-spl-live", "sentences": ["How often do you hear people ask how a team from Turkmenistan or Singapore both similar in population to Scotland would fair in the Premier League?&quot; You&apos;re right, Phil."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-24T10:30:00Z", "title": "Rangers v Celtic \u2013 as it happened | Rob Bagchi", "tags": ["Scottish Premiership", "Rangers", "Celtic", "Football", "Sport", "Scottish Premier League 2010-11"], "article": " Good afternoon all:  An Old Firm title decider to whet the appetite this Easter Sunday and with all the off-field events, featuring parcel bombs and arrests, it must be a relief to get the ball out at last. Roddy Forsyth was on Sportsweek this morning and reporting that Walter Smith has reflected that he&apos;s glad to be getting out of it. And who could blame him at this point? Not me, certainly. I used to watch loads of Scottish football in the 90s but since having children my non-work football watching has been rationed so I&apos;ve seen very little of these two sides outside OF and European games. I&apos;ve been to a couple of Old Firm games myself, both at Parkhead, and at the last Rod Stewart was in the car park and Francis Jeffers and Hamed Namouchi might as well have been.  The teams: Rangers: McGregor Whittaker, Bougherra, Weir, Papac, Lafferty, Davis, Edu, Wylde, Jelavic, Naismith. Subs: Alexander, Fleck, Foster, Healy, Diouf, Kerkar, Hutton. Celtic: Forster, Wilson, Majstorovic, Mulgrew, Izaguirre, Brown, Kayal, Ki, Ledley, Hooper, Samaras. Subs: Zaluska, Ljungberg, Stokes, Maloney, Commons, Rogne, Forrest. Referee: Craig Thomson  Reflections on the teams:  I&apos;m surprised that Kris Commons hasn&apos;t made it into the starting XI, having scored five goals in his past five games. Giorgios Samaras again gets the nod for the OF game, Neil Lennon believing that he has the character and experience to make a difference today. No surprises in the Rangers team. With Celtic having a game in hand Neil McCann and Charlie Nicholas in the Sky studio seem to be hinting that they will look to keep it tight and try to secure the point that will give them the advantage in the run-in. That seems quite a bold strategy but looking at the table \u2013 they have only conceded eight goals in 14 away games to date \u2013 they have the defence to do it.  A pre-match email: From Gary Naylor: &quot;It&apos;s like two bald men - well, two 70s skinheads - arguing over a comb.&quot; The Falkland Islands metaphor with a twist, eh Gary? In the grand scheme of world football I can see your point. But each of these games has its own drama which makes them compelling. We watch, often with mouths agape, but still we watch. Ryan Dunne suggests we could make it more interesting if we gave the match a makeover: &quot;The Old Firm&apos;s reputation could be improved if they gave the clash a new, Clasico style cosmopolitan name. Le Superrammy?&quot; I like it, Ryan. Le Superrammy it is, unless, of course, you can do better.  Atmosphere: &quot;Walk in silence, don&apos;t walk away \u2026&quot; Er, wrong atmosphere. The pundits reckons its the most electric vibe at Ibrox for a good while. Extremely loud. Sorry, David Hill, but I can&apos;t fix the autoupdate button \u2013 see Bolton v Stoke and Tottenham v Arsenal MBMs this past week for numerous gripes about the situation. I managed to deliver 11 goals in those two but they came via F5 I&apos;m afraid. It&apos;s being worked on but it&apos;s still not ready to live. Apologies.  1 min: Huddle over and Rangers kick off. And almost immediately Mulgre takes Lafferty&apos;s legs in a sliding tackle from behind and Rangers have a free-kick, taken by Wylde to the near post and Celtic eventually bundle it clear to Izaguirre.  2 min: Ki goes in studs showing and poleaxes Lafferty on halfway. Another &quot;over enthusiastic tackle&quot;, unpunished by the referee.  4 min: Rangers have started much the stronger, Edu getting the ball centrally and tucking it out to Wylde on the right with the Celtic centre-backs pulled out of position. His cross, though, is knocked out by Izaguirre who covers well. The corner loops to the far post and Celtic half clear.  6 min: Wylde looks to be the outlet ball for Rangers midfield. They&apos;ve pinged a couple of passes just in front of the wide midfielder, inviting him to run into the outside left channel. Now Celtic string some passes together and free Izaguirre on the left. He hits his cross first time and Rangers nod it out for a corner, that comes to nish.  8 min: Joe Ledley appeals for a penalty after good work from Samaras, dropping deep into midfield and linking up with Izaguirre. Whitaker blocks his run into the box and Ledley looks as though he&apos;s run into a brick wall. The referee tells him to get up. It did look like obstruction.  10 min: Better from Celtic, with Samaras making a five in midfield to help out and keep possession. Davis whips in a cross from the left just in front of the penalty spot but Foster gets it second time. Then up the other end Hooper beats Bougherra on the outside but scuffs his shot. All the cliches about 90mph and end-to-end action ring true so far.  12 min: Edu fouls Kyal inside Celtic&apos;s half and they can both get a breather. Kyal spins and passes to Brown who finds Izaguirre, His cross looks dangerous but as Hooper goes up to head he either fouls Weir or was marginally offside, perhaps both.  14 min: Celtic begin probing up the right for the first time and win a throw but go backwards to hold possession such is the fury of Rangers pressing. Hooper forced into mishitting his pass to Samaras by the close attention of Davis.  16 min: Lafferty has a chance at the far post, and he&apos;s squeezed out by Wilson and Majstorovic, then Edu dallies over a shot on the edge of the box that loops wide after a deflection. Rangers have two corners in succession but Foster gets a strong punch to the last one. Edu really should have shot first-time instead of taking a touch.  18 min: Another Rangers corner and Foster misconnects with his punch and knocks it out for a throw. Phil Withall has a thought: &quot;A couple of suggestions for the renaming. &quot;The Zugzwang deby&quot; after the chess move where making your move leaves you at a serious disadvantage or &quot;the Vituperation&quot; bitter and abusive language. As for the auto-refresh situation heaven help us when the batteries go in the TV remote.&quot; Rangers free kick 25 yards out on the right of the D. Jelevic hits the wall and Izaguirre breaks at pace but he delays the pass and Hooper is caught offside.  20 min: It&apos;s put the boot into Scottish football time from Tom Shaw: &quot;As Rangers and Celtic have won 95 league titles between them, leaving only 19 that have been won by other clubs perhaps the SPL should be re-named La Crappico.&quot; Celtic fans are singing &quot;One Neil Lennon&quot; sparking whistles from the home support.  21 min: Bouncing ball into the box from the Celtic left and Samaras gets around the first defender then nods it too far ahead and has to challenge the keeper. The latter wins. Samaras then pushes Weir as the Rangers captain protests that Smaras went into McGregor with his foot up. Samaras is booked.  23 min: Lovely move from Rangers, with Jelevic the architect. He controls an over-vigorous pass brilliantly on his chest then plays in Lafferty wide on the right with a deft left-foot pass. Lafferty drills the cross low across the area but Foster dives and gathers.  25 min: Rubbish throw from Papac, trying to find Wylde, but he chucks it straight to Brown instead, then Wylde fouls Brown.  26 min: Scott Brown shoots wide when in a good position on the right of the Rangers box. He almost sliced it. Then Naismith up the other end gets a free shot almost in Van Basten v the USSR territory and understandably blasts it over.  29 min: Gary Naylor suggests: &quot;In recent years, lots of old firms have relocated to China. Any chance of this Old Firm doing the same thing? Please.&quot; Press five to speak to a human being, that sort of thing?  30 min: Izaguirre looks a real talent and Wylde&apos;s pace a constant menace. Good game so far. Well, an exciting game at least. A robust defence of the SPL and OF from Ryan Dunne. And he has a point, until the end: &quot;Wouldn&apos;t a plethora of diddy Teams winning a lague title be an argument against, not for, that league? The quasi-socialist situation in US sports that ensures a frequent change in winners is about as consistent with the spirit of sport as putting weights on favourite horses to make it &quot;fairer&quot; for everyone else. Would the Spanish League be better this year if it had a random, diddy team winner, instead of one of the greatest club sides of all time managing to outstrip even the genius of Jose Mourinho and C.Ronaldo? Of course not. Rangers v Celtic is a titanic, compelling struggle of Good v Evil, like Christianity or the Star Wars saga ;)&quot;  32 min: Now, where were we? Jelevic takes a quick free kick just inside Celtic&apos;s half and tries to catch Majstorovic napping as Lafferty makes a strong run down the middle. Mulgre is awake, though, and nicks the ball off Lafferty. Then Celtic pile forward and Hooper and Samaras end the move with a one-two on the edge of the box, Samaras with his back to goal hitting the perfect lay-off to Hooper who thwacks his shot a good ten yards over the bar.  34 min: Edu and Izaguirre involved in a leg-flying challenge. Edu, with studs up, gets a talking to but no card.  36 min: Ki pulls back Bougherra who tries to skin him down the right. Wylde takes the free kick to the back pots and Samaras opts for safety and heads it out for a corner.  38 min: Another wasted corner into a crowded area. From the goalkicvk Samaras challenges Weir on the edge of the Rangesr box and rather daftly sticks his shoulder into Weir before the ball drops. Rangers free kick. Lafferty holds the ball in the corner from the free kick, waiting for Celtic to concede a corner, which they do.  40 min: Davis takes it to the far post but Bougherra and Lafferty get in each other&apos;s way and it&apos;s headed out for a goalkick.  42 min: The one thing that is apparent here is the amount of petulant, niggle fouls where someone loses patience or tries to hoodwink the referee by nudging their marker when the ball is floated up to them.  44 min: Here&apos;s my attempt at Weegie lingo. Davie Provan is giving Samaras pelters. Will that pass the Scott Murray muster? Any road, he thinks the Greek is off the pace and that Stokes should replace him in the second half. I think what I meant about the niggle fouls was the lack of subtlety. It goes on everywhere but it&apos;s blatant today.  45 min: Rangers appeal for a hand ball when it strikes Majstorovic on the shoulder when Jelevic attempts to turn it into the box from the 18-yard line. And that&apos;s half time. Tom Shaw writes: &quot;Ryan Dunne misses the point about the SPL. It IS won by diddy teams every year, as shown by the champions consequent performance in Europe. The teams outside the top two are &apos;below diddy&apos;. I doubt if either Rangers or Celtic would survive a Premier League season in England without the constant threat of relegation haunting them.&quot; I agree, Tom, now. But 15-20 years ago they wouldn&apos;t have struggled. It&apos;s the discrepancy in revenue not some inherent rubbishness about Scottish football that has made it look inferior.  That was half time: By the way. The perfect opportunity for this. &quot;Why don&apos;t SPL and EPL referees pool their resources and have each league draw from that wider group,&quot; writes Gary Naylor. &quot;This fixture could have an English referee and Manchester United vs Liverpool could be allocated a Scottish referee? I don&apos;t think refs are biased, but there&apos;s enough who suspect it and the players, media and even boardrooms aren&apos;t above making capital from such misapprehensions. It might draw at least some of the sting.&quot; It would at first, but given the number of Scottish managers down south, how soon before they looked to something in their or the referee&apos;s past to blame? Ryan Dunne makes another fair point: &quot;I also think it could be argued that a record of the best Rangers and Celtic players in the last 20 years - Laudrup, Larsson etc etc - would compare favourably with that of non-Big Four English teams. And Super Ally McCoist won the European Golden Shoe two years in a row! (And, no, it wasn&apos;t in the years before they started awarding points based on the relative toughness of the leagues). &quot;  46 min: Celtic kick off and after a spot of meandering give the ball away and Jelevic tussles with Izaguirre on the right. Rangers throw in and Davis puts pressure on Izaguirre who concedes a corner. Davis pops it on to Weir&apos;s head, unmarked, and he heads over.  48 min: Whitaker hits a weak cross into the box and Celtic break quickly, switching to Wilson up the right but he loses momentum and checks back.  50 min: Gerard Cullen writes as Celtic have a spell of possession: &quot;Rob, I&apos;m not sure if Tom Shaw (45 mins) really gets it. If Rangers and Celtic were transposed to the EPL they would instantly have access to the cash that EPL clubs have and therefore would improve overnight. And remember they&apos;re much bigger than most English clubs (only Man Utd and Arsenal would have higher attendances) so they would instantly become part of the elite. Nevertheless, the idea that a club from Glasgow could become Champions of England is utterly preposterous.&quot; Several nails on the head.  52 min: Rangers come very close after fine work from Wylde up the left. He puts in a vicious cross and Lafferty makes a well-timed run to the six-yard box and just glances it wide. Then up the other end Kyal shoots from 25 yards but skews it wide.  54 min: It&apos;s time for Commons soon, I would think. He can hold the ball and beat a man, something they&apos;re lacking at the moment. Naismith brings down Ledley and this may be the opportunity as the Welshman&apos;s hamstring seems to have pinged again.  55 min: And Commons comes on for Ledley. Celtic free-kick on the left of the Rangers penalty area. Floated on by Ki to the far pots and its nodded back to Majstorovic who powers a header towards the top corner and McGregor leaps to palm it away superbly.  57 min: After two corners from Celtic, both dealt with well by Rangers, Commons makes his first intervention and spins a pass up the touchline to Samaras who is outmuscled. Here&apos;s Phil Withall: &quot;The comparison between the &quot;Old Firm&quot; clubs and the premier league always amazes me. Scotland&apos;s population is a tenth of England&apos;s. Therefore revenue will be lower. How often do you hear people ask how a team from Turkmenistan or Singapore both similar in population to Scotland would fair in the Premier League?&quot; You&apos;re right, Phil. But what galls is the comparison between apples and pears, to use the standard of English football as a stick with which to batter the Scots.  59 min: An accidental trip by Edu on Commons bursting through the middle stalls a promising Celtic move. Rangers are asleep initially at the free kick but Celtic shoot from range straight to McGregor when they had numbers in the box or on its peripheries.  61 min: Now Jelevic launches an attack fro Rangers, beasting Majstorovic in a sprint and Kyal hacks him down and gets yellow-carded. Rangers free-kick 25 yards out.  62 min: Lafferty goes for power and smacks it wide of Celtic&apos;s left post, speaking of which, Rob Moline writes: &quot;Notice you&apos;ve typed &apos;far pots&apos; twice thus far. I find I often make the same error typing &apos;tets&apos; for test. Also &apos;fro&apos; for for... what does it all mean?&quot; My other one is Newcsatle for Newcastle. I do it so often I&apos;ve started to think of them as Newcsatle.  64 min: Naismith flashes a shot with his left foot just wide after making a fine run across field. He was given that chance by Majstorovic again being done by Jelevic. He&apos;s standing too close to the attacker and keeps getting spun. LH Roper joins the debate: &quot;With respect to the &apos;Old Firm&apos; observations made on the half-hour, sport neither the contrived &apos;socialism&apos; [sic] of American sport nor the duopolies securely in place in Scotland and Spain are helpful scenarios. While respecting success (and not wishing to reward hapless ineptidude where it exists as at, for instance Easter Road), is it too much to ask the overly successful to share a bit more of their match-day revenues, for instance, as the start of a pursuit of balance? After all, might not the sight of two supreme/over-hyped teams playing with themselves for the title every year turn more and more supporters to other pastimes.&quot;  66 min: Wilson and Brown link up well on the right and Brown gets the ball back and dribbles into the box. He knocks the ball a tad too far ahead of his run and Rangers belt it out for a throw.  68 min: After a spell five minutes ago where Rangers seemed to be in the ascendancy, Celtic are now knocking on the door by the simple virtue of stringing a few passes together.  70 min: Am I right in thinking that the current trend of referring to this match as the OF derby is wrong. I can never remember it being called a derby in the past, even though it ostensibly is. Just the Old Firm game. Papac makes a rare run in support of Wylde and is eventually snookered by Wilson in the Celtic box.  72 min: Celtic corner, header by Hooper and McGregor tips it around the post. From the corner, Rangers give away a free-kick when it&apos;s taken short. They have a better angle for Mulgrew&apos;s left foot from the corner of the 18-yard box. Uh oh, it floats straight into McGregor&apos;s arms.  74 min: Fleck on for Rangers, Wylde off. Hooper gets free wide on the right but fails to spot Samaras&apos;s near-post run and wastes his hard work.  74 min: Edu then slices a shot miles wide after Fleck and Lafferty worked him an opportunity. Celtic substitution: Stokes on for Hooper.  76 min: Izaguirre makes a very good run with the ball from halfway, finds Samaras who holds it up, turns and feeds it back to the onrushing left-back who shoots, fairly tamely, attempting to chip McGregor who dives backwards to palm it over the bar. Celtic corner. Nothing doing.  78 min: Rangers throw in their own half to Fleck who isn&apos;t strong enough to hold it and Kyal robs him and nutmegs Weir with his pass through to Samaras who smashes it over from 25 yards when Stokes and Brown were either side of him and better positioned.  80 min: Papac is booked for cynically stopping Samaras in his tracks when Celtic outnumbered Rangers. The free kick, though, is useless and Rangers break quickly and Naismith and Jelevic combine to create a shooting chance for the latter. The whistle goes and he is given offside. Not sure he was.  Penalty for Celtic!  Saved! It was a very dubious award as Stokes dribbled into the box and ran into Davis who didn&apos;t make much of a connection and if anything Stokes ran into him by the touchline. Samaras hit it to McGregor&apos;s right, just inside the post but at a nice height, as they say, and he parried it wide. Good save.  84 min:  Alistair Elder writes: &quot;Was Edu the inspiration of the expression &apos;worse than a man short&apos;?&quot; He&apos;s off now, Alistair, after a poor performance. Diouf replaces him.  86 min: Celtic taking their time now, happy with the draw, but Commons gives a throw away and then Naismith is fouled. All the defenders go forwardas Davis chips it forward. Foster catches easily.  88 min: McGregor is named man of the match after three outstanding saves. Celtic have a corner, taken by Ki, a bobbler to the front post that comes back to him and he crosses again then Papac clears and ruins the possible break by hitting his pass to Diouf too wide and he has to check to come and get it.  90 min: Stokes is booked for diving in the Rangers area. The penalty, as Roy Allen points out, was t McGregor&apos;s left, Samaras&apos;s right. Sorry  90 +1 min: Three minutes added and Rangers have a free kick for Mulgrew holding Jelevic in an aerial challenge. About 20 yards out, taken by Diouf. About two feet wide, it flies, but Foster&apos;s feet betray his nerves as he scrambled across to make sure.  90 +3 min: Naismith is free with seconds to go, wide on the right but he overhits his cross and Celtic clear.  Full time:  Rangers 0-0 Celtic.  Conclusion: Celtic could have nicked it with that penalty but I thought Rangers created decent chances too, even though they didn&apos;t force Foster into the kind of action that was needed from McGregor to save the home side. So Rangers are a point ahead but Celtic have a game in hand. The post-match interviews will mention &quot;twists and turns&quot; to come as they all do these days. Thanks to all for your emails. Get stuck into your chocolate, then join Simon Burnton at 3.30pm for Arsenal v Bolton.

India, Singapore and Thailand can offer high quality medical procedures with English-speaking doctors at a fraction of the cost incurred in the west. However, despite its benefits in generating income, one prominent Thai economist, Ammar Siamwala, has described the intention to create an international medical hub in Thailand as an &quot;evil plan&quot; that will adversely affect health treatment for the poor. More than 1.6 million foreigners are treated in Thai hospitals annually, with an estimated 500,000 travelling specifically for medical treatment. These are phenomenal figures given the nascent state of the medical tourist industry only a few years ago. The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra initially proposed making Thailand an international leader in medical tourism in 2003 through aggressively marketing the country as a medical hub and curbing restrictions on foreign doctors practising there. Proponents for this policy argue that it will provide huge financial benefits for Thailand. Indeed, the foreign medical services sector is already expected to make 100bn baht ($3.3bn) by 2015. The government also states that it will create more medical expertise and greater accessibility to new medical equipment. Additionally, it could help reverse the &quot;brain drain&quot; away from western countries by attracting highly qualified Thai doctors living abroad back to Thailand. However, Ammar has described the medical-hub plan as &quot;the worst policy that the government could ever think of&quot;. The salary for doctors is about 8-10 times more in a private clinic than in a state hospital, so Ammar warns that private expansion will result in even greater wage inflation in the state sector. &quot;The ministry has already increased their salaries again and again [but it&apos;s] never enough. How can they compete with the private sector?&quot; Dr Amphon Jindawattana, secretary general of the National Health Commission of Thailand (NHC) agrees, saying: &quot;The medical-hub policy is the accelerator causing the brain drain of doctors, super specialists and other medical workers to private hospitals.&quot; Thailand already has a shortage of doctors compared with other countries in the region, and health reforms to expand provision to the low paid have put a greater burden on the public health system. However, in 2005 the government only managed to train 1,300 doctors, and saw nearly 700 doctors resign in the same period \u2013 many to work in the expanding private sector. The Rural Doctors Society is also scathing in its criticism of foreign medical expansion. Bangkok already has eight times as many doctors per capita as the worst served rural regions, and the RDS points out that concentrating resources in the large cities will simply worsen these discrepancies. There are also concerns over the growing divergence between state and private health provision. Some of the big private hospitals now resemble five-star hotels. Doormen will guide you to a gleaming marble foyer before elevator attendants take you to your waiting room. These &quot;hotel-spitals&quot;, designed specifically for the needs of foreign patients, mean that the Thai middle classes are increasingly unable to afford private healthcare provision at these centres. Erik Cohen, an emeritus professor in the faculty of social sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, predicts that the big private Thai hospitals will inevitably expand to become greater regional providers of services, and that western governments and insurance companies will increasingly look to outsource patients to reduce costs and waiting lists. Indeed, one academic projection estimates that by 2015 foreign patients will require resources equivalent to between 23%-34% of the total number of doctors currently working in the private sector. One possible solution for Thailand will be to exploit the upcoming liberalisation of doctor movement between south-east Asian nations and import doctors from other countries in the region. However, this will have an adverse affect on countries such as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia \u2013 and Thailand may soon become responsible for causing a regional brain drain of its own. The explosive growth in medical tourism will have a significant impact on the healthcare systems of countries like Thailand. However, more important than either private sector lobbying or the benefits for medical tourists are the health needs of the local populace. Strong safeguards, such as a significant medical services tax and greater investment in medical training, need to be in place to ensure that they too benefit from the globalisation of healthcare and the medical tourism revolution."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/singapore-sustainable-data-centres", "sentences": ["On 31 March, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore and other government agencies hosted a green data centre forum.", "This forum at the Singapore Management University epitomises Singapore&apos;s emergence as a leader in the green ICT economy.", "While Singapore&apos;s government has emphasised the need for clean and green cities since it declared independence, sustainability initiatives within both the private and public sectors have ramped up in the last five years.", "Singapore&apos;s success can be credited to its curious hybrid approach of free-market economics with rigorous long-term central planning by the government.", "According to Eugene Tay, editor of Singapore&apos;s Green Business Times, Singapore&apos;s political leaders have responded to the growing global concern over climate change with a three-pronged programme that emphasises the environment, water, and clean energy.", "Government agencies such as Singapore&apos;s National Environment Agency (NEA) have partnered with Hewlett Packard to design a new set of energy efficiency benchmarks.", "This development has its origins in Singapore&apos;s emergence as an ICT economic tiger in the past 20 years because of a highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate, seamless logistics, and central location.", "Those same companies confronted an issue, however, that no tax credit or business-friendly law could solve: Singapore&apos;s year-round tropical climate, which causes energy bills to soar.", "Still, with Singapore&apos;s reliance on imported fuel, the collaboration between HP and Singapore&apos;s government could result in a new standard for data centre efficiency.", "In addition to the green data centre standards initiative, Singapore&apos;s government is pushing for increased energy efficiency measures from both manufacturing facilities and business offices throughout the country.", "With the ongoing concern over increased energy prices, Singaporean leaders hope that a green, ICT-driven economy can foster an environment of even more innovation and, of course, investment.", "Finally, Singapore&apos;s investment in the water technology area has made the densely populated country of 5 million a global &quot;hydrohub,&quot; explained Tay.", "The need to achieve water self-sufficiency at an effective cost drives further experimentation and innovation by Singaporean engineers.", "With Singapore&apos;s water agreement with neighbouring Malaysia set to expire in 50 years, engineers and nanotechnology experts are in a race to guarantee the country&apos;s water security.", "In turn, that talent will contribute to Singapore&apos;s growing reputation as a global centre that combines both energy and technological innovation.", "Singapore&apos;s work on its energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives is a lesson on how the government and private sector can be partners, not opponents \u2013 meanwhile attracting talent from around the world for both its clean tech and ICT sectors, leaving other countries green with envy."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-28T09:00:00Z", "title": "Singapore, the model of a low carbon, ICT-driven economy", "tags": ["Low carbon ICT", "Data centres", "Guardian sustainable business"], "article": "On 31 March, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore and other government agencies hosted a green data centre forum.

Singapore&apos;s success can be credited to its curious hybrid approach of free-market economics with rigorous long-term central planning by the government. According to Eugene Tay, editor of Singapore&apos;s Green Business Times, Singapore&apos;s political leaders have responded to the growing global concern over climate change with a three-pronged programme that emphasises the environment, water, and clean energy. Linked to this focus is the government&apos;s recent interest in green ICT. Collaboration between government agencies, industry associations, ICT companies, and service providers could result in a new global green data centre standard that will rank with ISO 26000 for corporate social responsibility, the Global Reporting Initiative for sustainability reporting, LEED for green building, and the Forest Stewardship Council&apos;s ratings for paper and packaging. Government agencies such as Singapore&apos;s National Environment Agency (NEA) have partnered with Hewlett Packard to design a new set of energy efficiency benchmarks. This development has its origins in Singapore&apos;s emergence as an ICT economic tiger in the past 20 years because of a highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate, seamless logistics, and central location. Companies, including HP and IBM, have flocked to the 710-square kilometre (242-square miles) city-state to have their products manufactured and data stored there. Those same companies confronted an issue, however, that no tax credit or business-friendly law could solve: Singapore&apos;s year-round tropical climate, which causes energy bills to soar. Still, with Singapore&apos;s reliance on imported fuel, the collaboration between HP and Singapore&apos;s government could result in a new standard for data centre efficiency. In addition to the green data centre standards initiative, Singapore&apos;s government is pushing for increased energy efficiency measures from both manufacturing facilities and business offices throughout the country. One programme trains energy managers to implement energy efficiency measures throughout their respective companies. With the ongoing concern over increased energy prices, Singaporean leaders hope that a green, ICT-driven economy can foster an environment of even more innovation and, of course, investment. Finally, Singapore&apos;s investment in the water technology area has made the densely populated country of 5 million a global &quot;hydrohub,&quot; explained Tay. The need to achieve water self-sufficiency at an effective cost drives further experimentation and innovation by Singaporean engineers. The country has one desalination plant, with another larger one slated to open in 2013. With Singapore&apos;s water agreement with neighbouring Malaysia set to expire in 50 years, engineers and nanotechnology experts are in a race to guarantee the country&apos;s water security. In turn, that talent will contribute to Singapore&apos;s growing reputation as a global centre that combines both energy and technological innovation. The debate over climate issues often volleys between the argument between increased government regulation versus self-regulation by business. Singapore&apos;s work on its energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives is a lesson on how the government and private sector can be partners, not opponents \u2013 meanwhile attracting talent from around the world for both its clean tech and ICT sectors, leaving other countries green with envy.

City speculation suggested that China Investment Corporation (CIC), Temasek of Singapore, and Korea Investment Corporation have agreed to underpin the float by buying large tranches of shares. The identities of the sovereign investors, as well as detailed financial information about the hitherto secretive Swiss-based company, will be revealed in the flotation prospectus, expected to be published next week. Glencore&apos;s disclosure that sovereign wealth funds are planning to come aboard will be a fillip for the gaffe-prone company, which has this week drawn fire over corporate governance and sexist remarks by its chairman, Simon Murray. The prospectus, prepared by the company&apos;s financial advisers and lawyers, will reveal details of Glencore&apos;s contingent liabilities, ongoing litigation and risks that could face the business in the months and years ahead. Glencore&apos;s new board, with Murray at the helm, is thought to have met for the first time in Baar, Switzerland, on Wednesday and to have signed off the prospectus. Analysts said that demand for Glencore stock would be strong among state-owned Chinese and Asian institutions, which are keen to diversify out of US government debt and to secure supplies of vital raw materials. Jan Randolph, head of sovereign risk at IHS Global Insight, said: &quot;The Chinese want to lock in supply chains and reduce their exposure to the dollar. They are seeking to buy mining companies outright in Brazil, Australia and elsewhere. Purchasing equity in Glencore is another way of acquiring influence over the supply of commodities, from copper to aluminium.&quot; Randolph said that, over time, Chinese funds could build their stakes to between 10% and 15%, at which point they were &quot;quite entitled to ask for board representation&quot;. He described CIC as &quot;sitting on the top of the Christmas tree when it comes to investment institutions mandated by Beijing to invest abroad&quot;. CIC is shortly to receive another $200bn to funnel overseas, on top of the $100bn it already has in its coffers. In 2009, the Chinese fund invested $800m in Noble Group, a Singapore-listed commodity trading and shipping company that bears similarities to Glencore. Glencore has been dogged by controversy since it announced its plan to float two weeks ago. There was confusion after Lord Browne, the former BP chief, was chosen as chairman, only for him to drop out at the last minute \u2013 after his name had been leaked to Sky News and the BBC \u2013 apparently because of concerns about corporate governance. The baton was then passed to Simon Murray, a Hong Kong businessman and former soldier in the French Foreign Legion, who sparked uproar when he said that he was reluctant to employ women in senior positions because they tended to go off on maternity leave. He later retracted his remarks after facing accusations of sexism from the business secretary, Vince Cable. In the City, eyebrows have been raised over the appointment of Tony Hayward as senior independent director: he was head of BP at the time of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster and is hugely unpopular in the US. Standard Life was reported as saying that the Glencore board looked as if it was cobbled together at &quot;the eleventh hour&quot;. Pre-IPO research from banks such as Citigroup and Credit Suisse has surfaced that showed Glencore has been paying virtually no tax on its huge profits, thanks to an elaborate partnership structure and Swiss domicile."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/29/another-bride-royal-wedding", "sentences": ["Alex is in Singapore, my other bridesmaid, Emily, in Cardiff."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-29T06:00:00Z", "title": "Here comes another bride", "tags": ["Weddings", "Royal wedding", "Relationships"], "article": "16 November 2010 Breaking news! Two 28-year-olds who have been together since 2001 are getting married! Oh Christ. I am staring at a man with teeth like a horse, and a girl dressed in blue. William Saxe-Coburg-Windsor-Wales and Catherine Middleton. The date below the photograph says 29 April, my 33rd birthday \u2013 and the day my boyfriend, Dan, and I are getting married in London. Not, like them, in Westminster Abbey, but a small register office a few miles up the road. &quot;You should change it,&quot; says my mother. &quot;You shouldn&apos;t change it,&quot; says my father. &quot;Fucking royals,&quot; says Dan, never the monarchy&apos;s biggest fan. We debate the hotels and streets full of crazy people, but decide not to change plans. Everyone will get the day off; that other lot won&apos;t have Auntie Janet and Uncle Alan leading the conga. It makes us determined to keep our plans personal. This bolshie pit pony from Swansea and her Dan from Bishop&apos;s Stortford will be the real Prince and Princess of Wales. 18 December  I&apos;m sitting in a slimming club next to an old lady called Ivy, stripping to her vest for the scales, and two young mums debating how much bread they can gorge on after weigh-in. Dan and I spent last night trying out pork belly at the pub that will be our reception venue. The Great Weight-Loss Project is now on. But as a happy pint-slurping girl for the bulk of my life I feel I&apos;m becoming a cliche. Why do I want to whittle myself away? After all, Dan has loved all of me for seven years. I can tell you why. An image in my dreams of a waddling Welsh bride, her face fat with blusher, running out of breath before she reaches the registrar. &quot;One and a half stones off since September!&quot; our instructor hoorahs. The room erupts, as if I&apos;ve just been made Queen. I think of Kate&apos;s skinny frame, and wonder if she&apos;s feeling the same \u2013 then accidentally eat a bacon sandwich for my dinner. 20 January 2011 It&apos;s dress shopping day. Dan&apos;s bespoke suit is sorted. This leaves him more time to rant at pictures of Prince William, and worry about whether to keep his beard or not. My mother is in town, her eyes glittering like big Welsh pools of diamante. I have a few choice phrases primed: &quot;No sparkles, Mam&quot;, &quot;nothing princessy, Mam&quot;, and, my personal favourite, &quot;Mam, I&apos;m 32.&quot; I tell her we have an appointment at a vintage shop at 11. &quot;There&apos;s lovely,&quot; she replies, unconvincingly. I wonder if Carole Middleton, a woman brought up in a similar working-class world, feels the same. Then I feel sorry for Kate for the first time. Is she also cowering at fascinators that look like gutted swans? We arrive an hour early, and meet my bridesmaid, Alex \u2013 a tactical move on my part, as she is a vintage-loving, married lesbian. Then I realise the early arrival was a tactical move of my mother&apos;s. &quot;Why don&apos;t we have a look in this Bridal Room?&quot; she says, sweetly. Visions of the Welsh Wedding Barbie swim into my mind, my arse caged with Swarowski, my face drowned in tulle. We pass a pouting, tiny mannequin in flouncy underwear \u2013 brown hair, blue eyes, tr\u00e8s Middleton \u2013 and the room opens before me, bright white and terrifying. I scour the racks, try not to be sick, and then hear Alex&apos;s voice. &quot;This is nice.&quot; I heave the dress into a changing room as big as my lounge, and a woman called Maria does up the buttons. Somewhere underneath the boning, I feel my heart pound. I walk out; Alex gasps; my mum starts to cry. Oh Christ, I think, as I fall in love with a dress that costs nearly a month&apos;s wages. I am becoming one of those women. 20 February  &quot;Oh Christ&quot; is becoming a phrase as natural to me as &quot;hello&quot;. The Royal Situation continues to render Dan ranty. I am the model of CALMNESS AND EFFORTLESS GRACE. We are in the midst of Invitegate. &quot;We seem to have 347 guests.&quot; &quot;Well, we can&apos;t have all of those.&quot; &quot;We need matt finish for the invites.&quot; &quot;Well, I can&apos;t find any online for less than \u00a34,392.&quot; &quot;You&apos;ve spelt the name of the pub wrong \u2013 or should I say, &apos;pbub&apos;.&quot; &quot;Do you mind if I paper-cut myself to death, dear? You go first.&quot; A company promising stress-free invitations delivers bent cards, bleeding edges and a finish so glossy that the reflection of my gritted teeth nearly blinds my fiance. We finally get it sorted, amazingly without cancelling the wedding. Then Dan has an idea so ridiculous that we cannot resist. Dear Mr President, our letter begins. After hearing that you were rudely missed out from the royal wedding guest list, we would like to invite you, and your first lady, to another ceremony happening in London on the same day. We appreciate that it is unlikely that you will be simply &quot;hanging about&quot; in N1, but if you would like to attend with your entourage, please let us know; we will tell at least 20 of our guests to stay home. We end with a flourish that we hope underlines that we&apos;re doing this to get a polite no to read at the reception, rather than a stay at a sanitorium. We pop an invite in, too \u2013 red and white, finally ready \u2013 but leave the Trailfinders gift list out. Now that would be silly. 29 March  My dress is late. Well, OK, it&apos;s due. I am calm. I have not lost another half-stone from the jitters. Every morning, I look at the doormat; no Barack and Michelle yet. Every evening, I plough through books of love poems, grimacing at verses that are too cheesy, or too saucy, or end with a woman being thrown down a well. Dan has decided to keep his beard, and has joined Republic. Our living room is full of plastic champagne glasses, spreadsheets and jaunty acceptance cards. My favourite is a ghoulish Photoshopped postcard of the royal couple, looking almost as bonkers as we feel. 14 April  I. STILL. HAVE. NO. DRESS. On my last day at my work until June, I am screaming down the phone at a confused man in a depot. It is clear that I have finally become That Woman. Two hours later, a call: it has arrived. Alex is in Singapore, my other bridesmaid, Emily, in Cardiff. I call my best male friend, Danny, who works nearby, who tells his boss that he has a &quot;pink emergency&quot;. At 4pm, I am standing in ivory silk, the dress hanging off me, Danny handing Maria pins to slot into place. The weight on my shoulders disappears; everything is heavenly. Danny takes a picture of me, grinning wildly. Later, I notice my trainers and knickers in the corner of the frame. 27 April Our hens and stags have come and gone \u2013 Dan&apos;s a riot of real ale, AV debate and chargrilled kebabs, mine an orgy of Welshness and pink wine in Swansea. It also involved a Kate Middleton mask, which I wore for 10 seconds, my glasses on top of it, and a commemorative mug, made by Alex, which is extraordinary \u2013 Lady Jude of Swansea, it says, sitting next to my Right Honourable Husband, our royal crest decorated with lovespoons and laptops. And here is our post \u2013 a gas bill, Private Eye, a takeaway menu . . . but no presidential reply. Oh well, he has been busy. When we are on our honeymoon in America next month, maybe we will pull up at the White House, accost POTUS for his impoliteness, then drive off into the sunset. Or perhaps we will just let the last six months of madness retreat in the rear window, look at each other and laugh."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/may/01/williams-f1-turkish-grand-prix", "sentences": ["The early fly-aways are over, and this exorbitant circus will not make another long eastern journey until the Singapore race at the end of September."], "publicationDate": "2011-04-30T23:07:06Z", "title": "Williams look to overturn worst-ever F1 start at Turkish Grand Prix", "tags": ["Williams", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "There is nothing European about the Blue Mosque, with its many minarets dancing in a heat haze, or the ridiculously opulent Topkapi Palace. But in Formula One, the Turkish Grand Prix is viewed as the sport&apos;s return to Europe, even though the track is on the Asian side of the great city that straddles the Bosphorus and is the meeting place for east and west. The early fly-aways are over, and this exorbitant circus will not make another long eastern journey until the Singapore race at the end of September. For the summer season, the sport concentrates on Europe. The championship will not be won here but it can be lost. And this is where the failures of early season will have to make up ground quickly to prevent the year ending in ruins. At the top end, Ferrari and Mercedes must recover from poor starts, even though the German giant gave some signs of stirring in the last outing, in China, when Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher finished fifth and eighth respectively. For Williams, though, this is crisis point. This, remember, is one of the great teams. Seven times they have won the drivers&apos; championship, and between 1980 and 1997 they won nine constructors&apos; titles; a record, until surpassed by Ferrari in 2000. They have been graced by \u2013 among others \u2013 Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Alan Jones, Nelson Piquet, Jacques Villeneuve and the British pair Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill. But Williams have not won for more than 100 races; they have gone 42 rounds without a podium position and they have just made their worst start to a season, without a point after three outings; the hugely experienced Rubens Barrichello and the new boy Pastor Maldonado have both managed to finished only one race, in China. Their share value has stalled on the stock market and the pressure is intensifying on the company chairman Adam Parr, the technical director Sam Michael, the aerodynamics head Jon Tomlinson and the chief designer Ed Wood. Michael is in danger of being made the scapegoat for a wider and deeper malaise. But his optimism before next Sunday&apos;s race borders on rhetoric. &quot;I feel we can turn around our season over the next three or four races, through Turkey, Barcelona, Monaco and Canada,&quot; he said. &quot;Istanbul is a very good track, a drivers&apos; track, and we are going there with a new front wing, a new rear wing and a new rear brake duct and with a lot more to come. There is no shortage of ideas and there will be a big difference in the coming weeks. &quot;Some of the gaps between the teams look very big. But I think they will close over the next few races, as the teams gravitate towards the best designs.&quot; In an interview with Autosport week, Parr said: &quot;I&apos;m not happy because I think we can do better. My goal was to make progress. We&apos;ve finished eighth, seventh and sixth in the last three years and I wanted to take another step. So fifth, minimum would be good. We are only three races in, this is a long season and it&apos;s not game over yet. He added: &quot;I would love to see more progress. The things that we are bringing are not developing so much. The morale in the team is not as high as it should be because we were expecting greater things and it&apos;s the same for me. I&apos;m here to drive fast and to motivate people, but I would like to see the team perform better.&quot; The shadow of Adrian Newey flickers over Williams, as it does over McLaren. Every team he leaves, it seems, suffers a dip in form. He had made up his mind to leave McLaren. But, before that, it was within Williams&apos;s gift to keep the design wizard, who is the best in the game. Newey only wanted a bigger role in Sir Frank Williams&apos;s organisation. The last Williams car to carry Newey&apos;s fingerprints was the 1997 version, and that was the year they last won the drivers&apos; and constructors&apos; titles. There is no corner in Formula One more exciting than the high-speed, multi-apex T8 at Istanbul Park; it may just be the place, next Sunday, where Williams turn their season around."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/osama-bin-laden-stock-markets", "sentences": ["The global reaction was muted, with markets in Britain, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand closed because of holidays."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-02T17:51:00Z", "title": "Osama bin Laden's death boosts stock markets", "tags": ["Osama bin Laden", "Stock markets", "US news", "Japan", "Al-Qaida", "World news", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Shares on Wall Street and around the world were lifted by news that Osama bin Laden had been killed but later erased some of their gains as the euphoria evaporated.

It is an ideology, which is not going away. If there are no reprisals in the Middle East, then all well and good. However, if equities crack on, will the US treasury market suffer?

But analysts said they expected them to fall further. &quot;If Osama is taken out, you are going to see risk premium being wiped out from the market. It is going to bring down oil prices by $5 to $10 if people warrant that risk premium is important,&quot; said Jonathan Barratt, the managing director of Commodity Broking Services, based in Sydney. This week brings a flurry of economic news: a run of economic data in the US, culminating on Friday with unemployment numbers (non-farm payrolls) for April, as well as interest rate decisions from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank on Thursday.

He believed that children have intellectual, emotional and aesthetic capacities that few adults realise and too few schools exploit. For more than 50 years, he made a major contribution to our understanding not only about how children learn, but about how to put that knowledge into practice. As founder headteacher, in 1968, of Prior Weston primary school in London, he established a model that aroused international interest and admiration. He was also a prolific author, editor, journalist and lecturer on educational and other subjects. Born in an impoverished part of Lambeth, south London, Henry \u2013 as he was known to pupils, as well as to friends and colleagues \u2013 spent his first six years, as he recalled, &quot;in a tiny second-floor flat (running cold water, gas for lighting and cooking, outside toilet, no bath)&quot;. His mother suffered &quot;emotional instability&quot; and he was largely brought up by his older sisters, who read to him from their homework, and taught him to recite passages from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&apos;s Hiawatha and other poems in infancy. He became a chorister at Southwark Cathedral and, after national service in the Royal Army Education Corps, qualified as a teacher at the College of St Mark and St John in south-west London. In 1959 he began teaching at John Ruskin primary school in south London and his classroom soon resembled an artist&apos;s studio, buzzing with activity and creative energy. Arts in the broadest sense formed the basis of his curriculum: not just art and craft, though they were most in evidence, but\u00a0also drama, music, poetry and dance. He gave particular emphasis to direct personal experience, taking children to museums, art galleries, churches, historic buildings, woods, fields and parks. While teaching, he began to write regularly for professional journals and newspapers such as Primary Education and Teachers&apos; World, and was asked to lead workshops and seminars at the University of London&apos;s Institute of Education. In 1961, he met Frank Waters, then editor-in-chief at the Oldbourne Press in Fleet Street, who invited him to write for the Modern Education Library series. His Picture Making With Juniors and Free Crafts for Juniors (both 1963) were the first of many books that shared his classroom ideas and techniques with a generation of primary-school teachers. Increasingly, he contributed to in-service training courses. His workshops for teachers, like his classroom, overflowed with paints, dyes, glues, pastels and numerous other modelling materials, many of them begged or borrowed by him personally from the manufacturers. But as Frank Peacock, his head at John Ruskin, put it in an introduction to Henry&apos;s Creative Arts and Crafts (1966): &quot;He is not an &apos;art-specialist&apos; nor a &apos;craft-specialist&apos;. Like all good primary-school teachers, he is a specialist in one thing only \u2013 children.&quot; He joined Prior Weston \u2013 a brand new school on the edge of the City of London&apos;s Barbican development \u2013 as headteacher in 1968. To an unusual extent, it recruited children from very poor homes alongside the children of the metropolitan liberal elite. In the wake of the 1967 Plowden Report, which gave an official imprimatur to fresh thinking in primary education, it became a mecca for those committed to innovative teaching and more open forms of learning. Henry never claimed to be an educational theorist, preferring to call himself a &quot;journeyman-teacher&quot;. But that was too modest: his genius was to bring together a wide range of ideas \u2013 from the philosopher John Dewey, the leaders of the &quot;child art&quot; movement, such as Franz Cizek in Vienna, Christian Schiller in London and Robin Tanner at the Ministry of Education, and psychologists such as Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner and Lev Vygotsky \u2013 and combine them with his intuitive understanding of how children learn. Despite the responsibilities of headship, he continued to write and edit at an astonishing pace, producing books on history and environmental studies for teachers and many children&apos;s books, including a series for Mills and Boon entitled On Location (1973 onwards), as well as writing for the educational press and giving lectures and organising workshops across Britain. His Open School, Open Society (1975) was the major statement of his educational approach. He wished, he wrote, to extend the schools&apos; &quot;human dimension&quot; and to make them &quot;more open to the society they served&quot;, not only involving parents but also becoming the focal point in the lives of their local\u00a0communities. At the time, the vision of education created by him and other gifted teachers and administrators seemed likely to carry all before it. But the authors of the educational pamphlets the Black Papers \u2013 who wanted a return to more traditional styles \u2013 were already making waves. In 1976, a speech at Ruskin College, Oxford, by James Callaghan, the Labour prime minister, marked a change in official thinking. Schools, it was argued, had moved too far from rigorous learning and basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills. Though left of centre politically \u2013 he was proud of being &quot;handbagged&quot; by Margaret Thatcher at a publisher&apos;s party during her term as education secretary \u2013 Henry struggled to find a comfortable space in conventional British politics. He was so committed to the children in his charge that he felt an almost physical\u00a0revulsion against industrial action, and joined the &quot;no-strike union&quot;, then called the Professional Association of Teachers. He might best be described as a radical individualist, and his favourite politicians were maverick, principled Labour MPs such as Joan Lestor and Ren\u00e9e Short. They were among the informal group he formed to oppose \u2013 or at least modify \u2013 the educational counter-revolution, holding frequent meetings at the House of Commons. Largely as a result of its deliberations, he edited two books (their original working titles were &quot;light-grey papers&quot;) with Peter Wilby, then education correspondent of the Sunday Times, The Condition of English Schooling (1979) and Education 2000 (1980). By\u00a0then, Thatcher was in No 10 and the books were only modestly successful. Yet Henry&apos;s international reputation continued to grow. A Swedish television documentary, made at Prior Weston, struck such a chord in Sweden that Henry became something of a national\u00a0celebrity there, in enormous demand as a guest lecturer. As he recalled\u00a0(with some hilarious anecdotes) in The Travels of a Journey-Man Teacher\u00a0(2007), government agencies invited him to lecture and advise teachers in Canada, the US, France, Italy, Germany, Serbia, Bulgaria, Singapore and Hong Kong. In 1984, he left Prior Weston, initially to complete an MPhil. He did not return to full-time teaching or headship but served on such bodies as the Council for National Academic Awards, the National Book League, the National Trust, the Royal Ballet and the Civic Trust. In 1986 he joined the staff of the Royal Opera House&apos;s education department, finally retiring in 1999. By then, he had published more than 300 books and touched the hearts\u00a0and minds of thousands, perhaps\u00a0millions. He was already showing the first signs of a rare form of Parkinson&apos;s disease, an affliction he bore with great courage, even starting to write poetry, of which two volumes \u2013 More Than Words Can Tell (2006) and\u00a0Word Shaping Tongue and Listening\u00a0Ear (2008) \u2013 were published. &quot;I have discovered,&quot; he said,\u00a0&quot;the joy which comes from having time to stand and stare.&quot; He is survived by his wife, Helen, from whom he was separated, by their children, Elspeth, Hilary and Patrick, and by his partner, Hilary Devonshire. \u2022 Henry Arthur Pluckrose, teacher and author, born 23 October 1931; died 6 April 2011"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/may/04/cambridge-second-in-world-for-medicine", "sentences": ["Melbourne is rated 15th, the National University of Singapore ranks 18th, and the University of Tokyo 20th."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-04T06:00:04Z", "title": "Cambridge second in the world for medicine", "tags": ["Medicine", "Education", "Biology", "Science", "Psychology", "University of Cambridge", "Higher education", "UK news", "Harvard University"], "article": "Cambridge comes second and Oxford fourth in a new global ranking of medicine courses, in which universities in Asia and Australia also perform well.

The data also shows that the Asia-Pacific region is the largest market for smartphones, having almost doubled in size over the past year and taking just under 40% of all units shipped worldwide, with mainland China, South Korea and India seeing particularly strong growth. The figures, released on Wednesday, also show that smartphones outsold PCs for the second quarter in a row, underlining the dominance of the new devices. Canalys, which has bases in California, the UK and Singapore, says that 101.0m smartphones were shipped in the first quarter of 2011, compared to between 80m and 84m PCs as estimated by research companies IDC and Gartner for the same period. Smartphones first outsold PCs in the fourth quarter of 2010, when 100.2 were sold compared to 92.5m PCs. Highlights from the report: \u2022 Phones running Android made up 35% of those sold, increasing Google&apos;s share, said Canalys.  \u2022 Nokia saw market share for its Symbian OS - which is under a death sentence from chief executive Stephen Elop - cut from 39% a year ago (ie 21.5m sold) to 24% now (24m sold), principally by focussing its sales efforts in the Asia-Pacific countries where it is strongest. More than half of the 24m smartphones Nokia sold in the quarter went there, with around 9m going to China. Elop said in February that Nokia would sell roughly 150m more Symbian smartphones as the OS is phased out in favour of Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone platform. \u2022 Apple thrived on the growth in the Asian and US markets, with the Chinese New Year and the launch of CDMA-equipped iPhones through Verizon from February helping it to an 18% share worldwide. \u2022 Overall, sales in the APAC (Asia Pacific) region grew 98% to 37.3m units, said Canalys, which puts it ahead of the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region for the first time since the third quarter of 2007.  However the US remained the largest country for smartphone shipments: \u2022 Android remained the leading smart phone platform in the US for the third consecutive quarter, with a 49% share.  \u2022 More than tripling sales HTC became the leading Android vendor in the US and the second-placed smartphone vendor in the country overall. \u2022 Apple was the single biggest vendor in the US, with a share of 31% and growth of over 150% year-on-year. Worldwide: \u2022 RIM&apos;s worldwide share dropped to 14% compared to 19% a year ago, and sales of its BlackBerry handsets saw a quarter-on-quarter fall - the first in its history. &quot;RIM&apos;s always going to be struggling compared to other vendors,&quot; said Pete Cunningham, principal analyst for Canalys. &quot;Because it&apos;s so strong in the enterprise space, people often get their first experience of them through locked-down devices - and then they try a friend&apos;s Android or iPhone and like that much more, even though their BlackBerry could do the same if it weren&apos;t locked down.&quot; \u2022 Overall, Android shipments were helped by strong sales by its vendors including HTC, Samsung, LG, Motorola and Sony Ericsson.  \u2022 Samsung shipped nearly 3.5m phones running its Bada OS - which Canalys says outstripped total shipments of Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone OS, launched in the fourth quarter of 2010, by 1m units. &quot;Samsung&apos;s own operating system development, combined with the branding and investment in its Wave smart phones at mid-tier prices, has led to good uptake in developed markets, such as France, the UK and Germany,&quot; Cunningham said. &quot;This shows that there is still room for multiple operating systems, and that vendors can benefit from maintaining control of device development to hit the right markets and price points.&quot; \u2022 Windows Phone 7 shipped around 2m devices in the quarter. Cunningham said the figures would have left him &quot;quite downbeat&quot; about its prospects if Microsoft had not announced its tieup with Nokia in February. &quot;Nokia is under considerable strain in the smartphone market as it transitions strategy, platforms and people,&quot; said Cunningham. &quot;Its worldwide reach, however, should never be underestimated. Canalys&apos; country-level data shows that the vendor remains number one in 28 countries, including mainland China, where it grew 79% to 8.9m units, thanks in part to Chinese New Year shipments.&quot; \u2022 Nokia, Apple, RIM, Samsung and HTC were the top five global smart phone vendors, as in Q4 2010. Apple continued to make market share gains, reaching 19%. RIM&apos;s share, however, dropped in Q1, as its portfolio awaited a refresh and the vendor focused on the PlayBook launch. Overtaking Motorola, LG moved into sixth place, with its Optimus series of Android smart phones doing well in all regions. The popularity of 4G-branded models, such as the Samsung Galaxy S 4G, HTC EVO Shift 4G and the T-Mobile myTouch 4G, heavily influenced US market shipments this past quarter. Q1 also marked the first full quarter of LTE smart phone shipments, following Verizon&apos;s 4G network launch in December 2010. Canalys estimates that shipments of these devices reached over 600,000 units.  HTC was singled out for praise. &quot;Shipments of its EVO series, Inspire 4G and Thunderbolt enhanced HTC&apos;s strong performance in this quarter,&quot; said Canalys vice president and principal analyst Chris Jones. &quot;The vendor has a wide and regularly refreshed portfolio, covering multiple network technologies, which puts it in a strong position both in the US and worldwide.&quot;  He suggested that in the US the &quot;4G&quot; label - for higher-speed networks using so-called Long-Term Evolution (LTE) connections - could become important for sales. &quot;We are starting to see some significant benefits from marketing high-speed networks to consumers in the US, as end users become more familiar with the performance and technical aspects of their smartphones. It&apos;s a trend that will inevitably spread around the world over the coming years as carriers upgrade their network infrastructures.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/04/glencore-cornerstone-investors-anchor-huge-flotation", "sentences": ["China&apos;s Zijin Mining will acquire a $100m holding, while GIC, Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, has agreed to spend $400m."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-04T19:00:00Z", "title": "Glencore's 'cornerstone' investors anchor huge flotation", "tags": ["Glencore", "Commodities", "IPOs", "Sovereign wealth funds", "Stock markets", "Business"], "article": "Asian and Middle Eastern investors, as well as big US investment and hedge funds, will emerge owning more than 30% of new Glencore shares when the company lists on 24 May.

But in the runup to Saturday&apos;s parliamentary elections more people have started to speak out against the clan that has ruled Singapore for almost 50 years. Parallels with the Arab spring are striking, even if revolution is not just around the corner. Most murmurs of discontent can be found online: fears of reprisal are diminished for anonymous bloggers. On internet forums, blogs, Facebook and Twitter, grumblings about high housing prices, the widening gap between rich and poor, immigration laws and the salaries of government ministers (among the highest in the world) are hot topics. The People&apos;s Action party (PAP) has been in power since independence in 1965, and is widely recognised as having turned this colonial outpost into a financial behemoth in a few decades. But it knows it has a battle on its hands. On Saturday, it will contest 82 of the 87 seats, up from 47 of 84 seats in 2006. More than one in four voters in Singapore&apos;s 5\u00a0million-strong population, are under the age of 35, and the internet is a main source of news. For the first time, candidates have been allowed to campaign using social media, and the effect has been far-reaching: many Singaporeans say this is the most debated and politicised election they have seen. Not all young people will be using their mandatory vote to go against the grain. Some, such as economics student and first-time voter Sofina Toh, 22, are swayed by the PAP&apos;s recent apology for past mistakes and promise to do better. &quot;The PAP has done so much for Singapore \u2013 just look at the country now from what it used to be,&quot; she says. &quot;Shouldn&apos;t we give credit where credit is due? They&apos;ve promised to make changes. Maybe we can give them another chance.&quot; Others are not convinced. &quot;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me,&quot; tweets a management student, Ong Rei En. At political rallies, for which turnout has arguably been the highest in Singapore&apos;s history, the energy is electric. An estimated 50,000 people crowded into an outdoor stadium on Thursday to wave blue flags and wield inflatable hammers, symbol of the opposition Workers&apos; party. As the crowd chanted for change, fists raised in hope, armed police watched awkwardly, the sweat on their brows betraying the night&apos;s humidity. Rally attendance does not always translate to the polling booth. In 2006, despite large crowds at opposition speeches, the PAP won 67% of the vote. Many Singaporeans fear their ballots will be traced and their mortgages or jobs taken away if they vote for the opposition.

His comments followed announcements by the Olympic Delivery Authority that 12,635 people were working on the Olympic park, a figure that met targets set by the London Development Agency. However, when the bid was won, officials promised the project would result in a 70,000 reduction in the number of workless people in the capital. After the Games, local councils will shoulder much of the burden for delivering this legacy. &quot;We know there needs to be reductions but not at this pace and not at this level of unfairness,&quot; said Wales, noting that all five Olympic boroughs in east London faced heavy budget restrictions. &quot;When Richmond is getting a \u00a36 a head cut and we are getting a \u00a3160 per head of the population cut, you can see where the cuts are falling. And we are the ones trying to do something to make a difference for our residents. This government just doesn&apos;t care. The dogma and the lack of any concern is staggering.&quot; Speaking on a Guardian Focus podcast, Wales said the Games must not overshadow the drive to create employment opportunities. &quot;We stand here alone trying to keep that going. They are trying to make the Olympics work, but on the transformation of east London, they are walking away. It will happen, despite them, not because of them.&quot; Dee Doocey, chair of the economic development committee of the London assembly, said the boroughs will need more direct help to keep promises made in the bid: &quot;This is not a five-year legacy. This is a 30-year project and unless someone is prepared to push for government funding to achieve the legacy, it will not be achieved because you can&apos;t do these things without money.&quot; Organisers face the millstone of employment targets set at the time of the bid, when the economy was booming and there was the reasonable expectation that funds would be available to transform the east London economy. At that time, it was also thought likely that more opportunities would arise for the private sector. Neale Coleman, director of London 2012 at the Greater London Authority, said an employment and skills legacy is being achieved, exceeding that achieved by any other Olympics. &quot;An enormous amount has been done in this area, he said. &quot;We have seen a significant amount of new apprenticeships and if you compare this with other public sector projects it compares very favourably.&quot; A spokesman for the department for Business, Innovation and Skills said 426 apprentices had been employed at the Olympic park, which exceeded the initial target to train 350 apprentices. He said 98% of contracts awarded by the ODA had been won by British companies, half of which were based outside London. &quot;These contracts, worth \u00a36bn, have generated thousands of additional contracts through the supply chain and have come at an incredibly important time for the British economy,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/09/berlin-philharmonic-musical-journey-3d-review", "sentences": ["Even so, this recording of Simon Rattle conducting Mahler&apos;s First Symphony and Rachmaninov&apos;s Symphonic Dances, taken from a concert in Singapore&apos;s Esplanade last autumn, dazzled on numerous levels."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-09T16:03:39Z", "title": "Berlin Philharmonic: A Musical Journey in 3D \u2013 review", "tags": ["Berlin Philharmonic", "Simon Rattle", "Film", "Gustav Mahler", "Sergei Rachmaninov", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "Most of my musical journeys are in 3D, but then I&apos;m lucky enough to hear most of my music live.

In the cinema, everything is right there, the extraordinary presence and definition of the sound revealing not just the finesse of the playing but also the gutsy energy of performances that, elsewhere, have risked seeming somewhat mannered. The speakers seem to bundle all the instruments into a ball a few feet in front of your head, from which individual instruments and sections jump out at you like bursts from a flyweight boxer. But that&apos;s nothing compared to the video, where the audience perspective is less that of a good stalls seat (which cost \u00a3300 or so at the concert) than a helicopter darting silently around a stage that, thanks to the 3D distortion, expands and contracts like a maniac concertina.

Yet the softly spoken Indian man who greets me at the door of his friend&apos;s suburban Acton home on a sunny Sunday morning is credited with creating what some have labelled the first ever acid house record. Charanjit Singh&apos;s back catalogue could have disappeared into musical obscurity were it not for the cult album Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat that he created in a few days in Mumbai in 1982. The album is one of the earliest records to use the legendary Roland TB 303 synth \u2013 a machine synonymous with the acid house sound \u2013 and Singh paired this with the equally renowned Roland TR 808 to create an album astonishingly unusual and ahead of its time. So far ahead, in fact, that it appears to pre-date the first acid house records to come out of Chicago by about five years.            While the record seems extraordinary, to its creator its origins were rather straightforward. &quot;There was lots of disco music in films back in 1982,&quot; says Singh matter of factly. &quot;So I thought why not do something different using disco music only. I got an idea to play all the Indian ragas and give the beat a disco beat \u2013 and turn off the tabla. And I did it. And it turned out good.&quot; As we drink tea and eat biscuits with his wife in the strikingly ordinary west London home in which he is staying briefly, I am struck by Singh&apos;s naturally shy demeanour and his absolute bemusement about the growing interest in Ten Ragas. One reason for Singh&apos;s air of surprise is the fact that the record was a commercial failure when it was first released. &quot;It didn&apos;t click,&quot; says Singh with the resignation of the session musician whom fame has passed by. &quot;It didn&apos;t have any publicity. Only sometimes you could hear it on the All Indian radio station, filling the gaps.&quot; But if it failed to make an impact on its release, it&apos;s certainly clicking with a lot of people now. While Ten Ragas is not the only pre-acid house record to use the 303, it&apos;s perhaps the only one that sounds like it should have influenced acid house (impossible, given that the musicians credited with giving shape to the genre could never have heard the album at the time). This has been one of the key factors in driving the album&apos;s march to fame since its &quot;re-discovery&quot; and re-issue two years ago. With this fame though has come a level of notoriety \u2013 and uncertainty. Much has been made of the album&apos;s astonishingly advanced sound palette, the high recording quality, and the unexpected use of a 303 on a record made in Mumbai so soon after the machine&apos;s official release in Japan at the end of 1981. These factors, coupled with the original record&apos;s astonishing rarity and extremely unlikely and enigmatic creator, have led many to believe the album was a hoax.     Newfound fame ... Charanjit Singh and his wife. Photograph: Stuart Aitken    Until now, Singh has not helped the conspiracy theorists by remaining silent on the issue. Living in relative obscurity in Mumbai makes him a difficult man to track down. This rare trip to the UK affords me a unique opportunity to shed more light on this hugely important record. But, as my interview with him progresses, it becomes increasingly obvious that Singh&apos;s shy demeanour makes him a difficult man to interview. No amount of questioning yields much more detail than what is already known about the album. I now understand why Edo Bouman, the man responsible for the official re-issue of Ten Ragas, warned me that Singh was &quot;quite mellow and shy&quot; and advised me to ask him &quot;very simple step by step questions&quot;. Despite this warning I am still frustrated that Singh seems unable to give more specific detail on when and where he recorded the album. He is also hazy on the details of exactly where he bought the 808 and 303 and cannot give any real reasons as to why he chose to buy them in the first place. &quot;The 303 \u2013 that was something new,&quot; he explains. &quot;It just came out. I went to Singapore and bought it from there.&quot; With some more gentle probing he explains that he was intrigued by the way he could use the 808 and 303 in synch with the Roland Jupiter-8 keyboard. He explains that he didn&apos;t know much about the machines when he bought them and that he had to spend time learning how to use them properly. &quot;At home I practised with the combination and I thought &apos;It sounds good \u2013 why not record it&apos;&quot;. Throughout our conversation it also becomes obvious that Singh is relatively unaware of the music that Ten Ragas is often compared to. So, I decide to play him a selection of famous acid tracks to see if he can find any similarities between the music that became known as acid and what he did with Ten Ragas. Having explained that much of the music that Ten Ragas is compared to comes from Chicago, we settle down to listen to the record that arguably started it all \u2013 Acid Trax by Phuture. Singh listens intently but seems unmoved by the pulsing, stripped down music \u2013 and the signature squelch of the 303. &quot;It&apos;s quite simple&quot; he concludes after around three minutes, gently chuckling at the idea that there are similarities between Acid Trax and Ten Ragas. &quot;It&apos;s very simple this music,&quot; he says. &quot;What I played are ragas \u2013 there&apos;s a lot of variation.&quot; Singh&apos;s wife Suparna seems more interested and asks for more detail about the nightclub context that Acid Trax would be most suited to. &quot;Is this very popular?&quot; she asks somewhat dubiously as the record continues to play. As we talk over the music I become increasingly aware of the oddness of the situation \u2013 listening to loud acid house at 12.30 on a Sunday afternoon in a suburban house in Acton with a couple of genial 60-year-olds visiting from Mumbai is indeed a strange scenario. Undeterred I try out another track, this time opting for Flow Coma from 808 State&apos;s seminal acid house album Newbuild from 1988. As I explain that the track was recorded in Manchester, Singh appears more engaged and after a while concludes &quot;this is more interesting&quot;. Again though, as the track progresses, Singh seems relatively unimpressed and slightly bewildered by the peculiar noises emanating from the hi-fi system. In order to illustrate the differences in his approach, Singh treats me to a performance of one of his recent compositions. While his failure to provide more context to Ten Ragas is frustrating, Singh is utterly charming throughout our interview, and never more so than when he settles down at one end of the living room behind his new Yamaha keyboard. As he does so it becomes apparent that this is a man who is more at home simply playing music rather than answering questions about it. This is my enduring memory of our meeting. I am left with the feeling that Singh is not entirely sure himself why he did what he did back in 1982. Further, he is equally unsure why such a fuss is being made of Ten Ragas now. The album was in many ways just another in a long line of recordings for Singh. But in others it is truly unique. Talking to Singh nearly 30 years on, there is a sense that he is only just starting to realise this.This article previously referred to &quot;Midi technology&quot; on the 808 and 303 \u2013 an error which has now been corrected"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/10/singapore-election-democracy-new-media", "sentences": ["Something extraordinary happened in Singapore in May 2011.", "Neither was it that, for the first time since independence, a majority of Singaporeans got to vote.", "The Singapore Democratic party (SDP), of which I am leader, was one of the six opposition parties that contested the ruling Peoples&apos; Action party (PAP).", "But this is Singapore \u2013 a country which has seen one-party rule for more than half a century, where citizens are locked away without trial for dissent, and where protests can only occur with a licence from the authorities.", "I have been banned for standing in elections because I was sued for defamation by former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, and ordered to pay more than a million Singapore dollars in damages.", "The overall effect has been that few in Singapore are willing to offer themselves as opposition candidates.", "In any case, we saw Singaporeans come alive politically and express themselves in quite unprecedented ways.", "And it is this resentment, buttressed by the new media which has enabled citizens to come together, if only online, that has caused many Singaporeans to shed their fear.", "But Singapore has taken that first crucial step to making parliamentary democracy a reality."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-10T10:41:11Z", "title": "Singapore is taking the first steps to true democracy | Chee Soon Juan", "tags": ["Singapore", "Internet", "Technology", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Something extraordinary happened in Singapore in May 2011. It was not that the prime minister dissolved parliament and called for general elections. Neither was it that, for the first time since independence, a majority of Singaporeans got to vote. Instead, a populace finally tired of living under an authoritarian system and of constantly being told how good their rulers were and that their rule was a right and not a privilege. The Singapore Democratic party (SDP), of which I am leader, was one of the six opposition parties that contested the ruling Peoples&apos; Action party (PAP). We saw an unprecedented surge in the number of people coming forward to volunteer their help. Medical professionals, lawyers, educators, managers and students, poured forth and came into our office by the hundreds. I could see one message written all over their faces: &quot;We have had enough, we want change!&quot; In any other democracy, no one would bat a eyelid over such a development. But this is Singapore \u2013 a country which has seen one-party rule for more than half a century, where citizens are locked away without trial for dissent, and where protests can only occur with a licence from the authorities. I have been banned for standing in elections because I was sued for defamation by former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, and ordered to pay more than a million Singapore dollars in damages. I could not meet their demands and was made bankrupt. Under the law bankrupts cannot run for office. Previous opposition leaders have also been dealt with in a similar manner. I have also been repeatedly imprisoned for exercising my right to free speech and assembly. These convictions also bar me from standing in elections. The overall effect has been that few in Singapore are willing to offer themselves as opposition candidates. This has allowed the PAP an easy passage at every election since 1959. In fact, for an entire decade in the 1970s parliament comprised of only PAP members of parliament. Anger and disenchantment with the government, which has been accumulating over the years, is palpable. People are fed up with rulers who insist that they are the only ones capable of running the country. Ministers award themselves salaries several times that of the US president, while the poor find themselves homeless and stricken by poverty. Government leaders have lost all sense of what public service is. This arrogance has caused professionals from the establishment to join us and other opposition parties. Our party fielded two former top civil servants. This would have been unimaginable even a year ago. The SDP did not win the seats that we contested. It would have been a miracle if we had. For every mainstream media outlet is still firmly in the control of the PAP government. News of my party&apos;s campaign activities, our manifesto and our plans for our constituencies were either played down or completely blacked out. In the past this would have been fatal. But we, and more importantly our small army of supporters, fought back \u2013 on the internet. We were able to counter the untruths that were hurled at us and, crucially, put forth our own views and policy positions. The consequence is that we were able to make significant progress in the percentage of votes cast for us. Conversely, the internet community very successfully put the PAP on the defensive over several missteps. These would not have been evident without the probing in cyberspace. But years of autocratic rule have taken their toll and undoing this will take more than just one election campaign, a campaign limited to nine days. In any case, we saw Singaporeans come alive politically and express themselves in quite unprecedented ways. To be sure, there is still much fear among the people, especially the older generation who have witnessed the heavy hand of the PAP&apos;s patriarch and &quot;Minister Mentor&quot; Lee Kuan Yew. But it is also Lee who is generating much of the resentment against the government of which his son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister. And it is this resentment, buttressed by the new media which has enabled citizens to come together, if only online, that has caused many Singaporeans to shed their fear. There is no turning back now. The road to freedom is without doubt still long and arduous. But Singapore has taken that first crucial step to making parliamentary democracy a reality."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/may/11/sizing-hilary-westlakes-alice", "sentences": ["I&apos;m not interested in museum pieces, and I&apos;d never just want to pick up a show where I left off.&quot; Hers has been a remarkable and varied career, which began in the 1970s with the co-founding of the performance company Lumiere and Son with experimental theatre-maker and writer David Gale, and has embraced working with animal keepers in the primate and reptile houses at Singapore Zoo as well as a stint as creative director of entertainment at EuroDisney (&quot;I tried to introduce them to the work of Pina Bausch&quot;)."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-11T10:27:00Z", "title": "Dining With Alice: Time for second helpings", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Lewis Carroll"], "article": "The White Rabbit scuttles by looking anxious, Tweedledum has mislaid Tweedledee, the Queen of Hearts is on a murderous rampage, and somewhere in the distance you can catch glimpses of Alice \u2013 only she seems, mysteriously, to be a different size each time you see her. If ever there were a show that felt like falling down a rabbit hole, it&apos;s Dining with Alice, Hilary Westlake&apos;s whimsical and batty Mad Hatter-style open-air dinner party-cum-performance piece. Not only do you get a full dinner \u2013 you come face-to-face with characters from Lewis Carroll&apos;s novel, who run amok while the waiters vainly attempt to keep everything \u00e0 la carte. This isn&apos;t the show&apos;s first appearance: it was originally conceived for the Victorian splendour of the Larmer Tree Gardens near Salisbury in 1999, where it played for just three nights. I was one of those few audience members \u2013 just 750 in all \u2013 who were entranced by the riddles and tongue-twisters of this strange topsy-turvy world. Staged long before the term &quot;immersive theatre&quot; became commonplace, the piece has since passed into theatrical legend. &quot;Many more people claim to have seen it than could ever have been there,&quot; laughs Helen Marriage, who commissioned Westlake to make the original version. She&apos;s co-founder, with Nicky Webb, of the inventive production company Artichoke, who famously brought \u2013 among much else \u2013 The Sultan&apos;s Elephant to London in 2006 and a giant mechanical spider to Liverpool two years later. &quot;It was a show with an in-built sense of magic,&quot; she remembers. &quot;Everyone dreams of being able to go to a Mad Hatter&apos;s tea party.&quot; Now, after a decade-long search for a suitable venue, once again they can. Westlake&apos;s re-imagined version of Dining with Alice begins an eight-performance run as part of this week&apos;s Norfolk and Norwich festival, in the fairytale grounds of Elsing Hall \u2013 a medieval manor house that comes complete with moat, walled gardens, picture-book windows and waterfalls.     Wonderland outdoors ... original production of Dining with Alice, 1999. Photograph: Sheila Burnett    Westlake is unconcerned that the piece&apos;s reputation precedes it. &quot;I never repeat myself.

I&apos;m not interested in museum pieces, and I&apos;d never just want to pick up a show where I left off.&quot; Hers has been a remarkable and varied career, which began in the 1970s with the co-founding of the performance company Lumiere and Son with experimental theatre-maker and writer David Gale, and has embraced working with animal keepers in the primate and reptile houses at Singapore Zoo as well as a stint as creative director of entertainment at EuroDisney (&quot;I tried to introduce them to the work of Pina Bausch&quot;). In 2002, she organised the official parade for the Queen&apos;s Golden Jubilee. One of Lumiere and Son&apos;s signature works was Deadwood, which played out in the Royal Botanical gardens in Kew in 1986 \u2013 the precursor of many of today&apos;s large-scale outdoor shows, and way ahead of the game in its focus on the destruction of tropical rainforests. There have, perhaps inevitably, been disasters along the way. One such was Out of the Blue, a massive outdoor piece of opera-theatre that took place in September 1997 on the shoreline of Gorleston-on-Sea in Norfolk; it turned into such a monstrously damp squib that locals rechristened it &quot;Don&apos;t Have a Clue&quot;. Westlake took the blame, but says the story behind what happened was complicated. &quot;What artist wouldn&apos;t be excited by the prospect and promise of helicopters, dozens of yachts, massed choirs and full orchestras? But when those can&apos;t be delivered, it&apos;s the artist who gets the blame. You are at the centre of a lot of people&apos;s disappointment. I learned from that experience to say no.&quot; She now admits to being wary of projects requiring large-scale community participation when it hasn&apos;t been confirmed in advance, though fortunately there appear to be few such problems with Dining with Alice \u2013 no fewer than 150 girls of all ages turned up wanting to play one of the several Alices who appear in the show. Marriage argues that Westlake&apos;s experimentalism lives on: &quot;The fact that Dining with Alice is charming doesn&apos;t detract from the fact that it is radical. There&apos;s nothing fake about it.&quot; The audience will be treated like honoured guests, even from the time they book: they will receive a letter from the Red Queen and an invitation to learn the Victorian parlour song Come into the Garden, Maud, a rendition of which will form part of the show. Nicky Webb says that audience experience is the crucial thing for Artichoke. &quot;We want what we do to take root in people&apos;s imagination and find a place there. It&apos;s good to do Dining with Alice again, and do it better and discover.

For a minimum investment of \u00a3250 you can become a &quot;co-owner&quot; of the Butcher&apos;s Arms in the Cumbrian village of Crosby Ravensworth. You would have a say in how the business is run and you should enjoy a &quot;modest&quot; return on your money, too. And those behind the project say you will &quot;always receive a friendly welcome&quot; in a pub that you part-own. Community owned and run local businesses are increasingly common. In villages, towns and cities throughout the UK, people are being invited to become members of &quot;community co-operatives&quot; that are bringing pubs, shops, cafes and other vital amenities back to life. No longer prepared to sit back and accept the closure of their local facilities, residents and others sympathetic to the cause are joining forces to take them back into local ownership \u2013 and are putting in their own money. Last month the Fox and Hounds in Ennerdale Bridge, Cumbria, reopened, and became the fifth pub in the UK to be owned and run by the whole community. After being threatened with losing the pub, local people raised \u00a377,000 in just 10 days. Meanwhile, there are now more than 250 community-owned shops across the UK, according to the rural communities charity the Plunkett Foundation. Community ownership now saves 10% of rural shops that would have otherwise closed, it said in a recent report. The latest to open its doors, in the village of Woodgreen, near Fordingbridge, Hampshire, is the Woodgreen Community Shop. In Crosby Ravensworth, determined villagers set up a co-operative \u2013 called Lyvennet Community Pub Ltd \u2013 to save their &quot;local&quot; after almost 90% of residents endorsed the idea. Their plans to buy, refurbish and reopen the Butcher&apos;s Arms took a step towards reality this week when it emerged the amount raised has reached almost \u00a3200,000. Their offer to buy the pub for \u00a3255,000 was accepted earlier this year\u00a0and, with support from the Co-operative Enterprise Hub, a community share issue was launched, inviting people to become members of the co-op. The Butcher&apos;s Arms is the only pub in the village, and closed in September 2010. The group (strictly speaking, it is an\u00a0&quot;Industrial and Provident Society&quot;) has plans to reopen it as a traditional Cumbrian pub, &quot;selling local ales from local brewers, good quality food, and providing a venue for traditional pub sports and pastimes, local events and celebrations, music and culture&quot;. They\u00a0later intend to set up a not-for-profit shop from the premises selling basic supplies and local produce. While the villagers need \u00a3255,000 to buy the pub, they are hoping to raise \u00a3290,000 to enable them to refurbish it\u00a0and, hopefully, have it open by the end of July, so that it will get some of the summer trade. So far, more than 120 people have signed up as shareholders, including individuals from as far afield as Australia and Singapore, and while the minimum investment is \u00a3250, some have put in thousands of pounds. However, there are only a few days left\u00a0to act as the share issue closes on Friday 20 May. As well as being co-owners of a pub, the plan is for members to receive interest on their investment, though not until the end of year two. &quot;Once the business is established and has been trading for more than a year, the society anticipates it will pay a competitive rate of interest (3% and rising) to all members. This will come from the lease paid by the landlord,&quot; says the group, which hopes people might see a stake in a pub as an ideal early Father&apos;s Day gift. David Graham, one of the co-op&apos;s six directors, says: &quot;Reopening the pub will put the heart back into our village. We have been delighted with the support that we have received so far; however, we still have a lot of work to do.&quot; The Co-operative Group says what is happening in places such as Crosby Ravensworth may inspire other communities to look at the co-operative business model: &quot;From pubs to grocers, cafes to childcare, it is now seen as an attractive model for today&apos;s ethically motivated entrepreneur.&quot; The Co-operative Group invested \u00a37.5m in the Co-operative Enterprise Hub to support the creation and growth of member-owned enterprises.

A horse and cart rattles along the narrow road and then a\u00a0scuffed moped, its driver resting on a cushion of unplucked chickens. Is this small, self-sufficient volcanic island really becoming, as its\u00a0embryonic tourist board suggests, the new Bali? Twenty minutes away by air, Bali itself is bursting. This year the country is targeting 7 million foreign tourists \u2013 traffic jams block the streets, hotel complexes have been built over paddy fields, visitors tweet about the pollution. But Lombok, one of 27 provinces in the Indonesian archipelago remains, if not untouched, then certainly unbruised. In 1966 50,000 people died of famine on the island; one hopes the slow infusion of foreign wealth will prevent that happening again. Over the years the island has been primed for tourism annually, but it&apos;s only now, as plans for an international airport and a\u00a0$600m project to put 10,000 luxury villas on Lombok&apos;s southern coast take shape, that the industry is showing real growth \u2013 boutique hotels spread tastefully around the coast. After a 13-hour flight, my boyfriend and I take the three-hour connection from Singapore to Lombok, where we queue for $25 tourist visas and emerge exhausted into the dusty wetness of a busy dusk. It&apos;s a two-hour journey to Sekatong Bay, where Cocotinos recently became the first hotel to open on the island&apos;s east coast. We drive through Mataram, the island&apos;s capital, then out through the villages, where covered platforms line the roads and act as parasols for Lombok&apos;s weary workers. From shelves on every roadside house children sell mismatched glass bottles of moped fuel and packets of nuts. The hotel&apos;s rickety pier strikes through the dark sea like a fallen Christmas tree, and by candlelight we eat our first nasi goreng, a fried rice dish that&apos;s served for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A day later, we travel west to Senggigi, the closest thing Lombok has to a holiday resort. Every drive here is in the shadow of Mount Rinjani, an active volcano that tourists can camp out on to photograph the sunrise and honeymoon energetically. We pass paddy fields where women stand in conical hats, casually thrashing the rice while their babies run naked through puddles. From a distance I\u00a0see a glint of silver in the road \u2013 as we approach I realise it&apos;s a blanket scattered with tiny drying fish. It looks like a sequined jacket discarded after a party. Senggigi is a concrete collection of karaoke bars and red-chested men. This is what Lombok might look like if the island wasn&apos;t 80% Muslim \u2013 the Hindu culture in Bali is more welcoming to those seeking all-day happy hours and bikini competitions, but it is Lombok&apos;s modesty that locals hope will ensure that it doesn&apos;t crumble under the weight of tourists. We stay at one of Senggigi&apos;s mid-priced hotels, Qinci Villas, where the tide comes in so far it splashes diners in the restaurant. Hawkers shout up from the beach, selling their local pearls and sarongs at &quot;special sunset prices&quot;. Restaurants down the hill offer a taxi service from the hotels, which we use to visit Warung Manega, a seafood restaurant sat snugly on the shore. They barbecue fish over coconut husks and serve it accompanied by colanders of rice and salads of water spinach \u2013 a huge platter of squid, king prawns and fish costs around 100,000 rupiah, less than \u00a38. Tip: if, in your excitement at selecting the biggest prawn you&apos;ve ever seen, you drop it in the sand, rinse with Bintang beer. It&apos;ll still taste better than most dinners you&apos;ve enjoyed. The posher hotels, we learned that night, cost more because they&apos;re built further away from the mosques \u2013 mosques that broadcast their call to prayer very loudly from 4.30am until breakfast. A blogger on the island recalls a recent story in which a hotel owner &quot;dared to suggest to a local village meeting that perhaps they could turn the volume down a touch on the prayer chant. The police subsequently arrested him.&quot; The blogger continued: &quot;He received death threats and his villas were looted. To date no one has been arrested for the destruction to property. Lombok is a whole different kettle of fish from Bali.&quot;     A sense of calm at Jeeva Klui.    At Qinci, mosquitos slap juicily against the mirror, there are no televisions to watch when the storm finally breaks and the air conditioning spits an oddly urinary smell through the vents. We&apos;re happy to move on round the coast, past stands selling grilled jagung bakar (corn on the cob) and a bar where a covers band improves U2 songs by slurring the lyrics into a stream of pure emotion, to Jeeva Klui, a\u00a0boutique hotel that shimmers with calm. In the morning we get a lift into the local market \u2013 on the way, we&apos;re reminded that to point with your left hand will cause offence, and I feel as foreign as snow, a feeling that returns whenever I\u00a0meet locals, my hulking white body towering above their 5ft heights. At the market, women sit on the floor rebalancing their bananas and komak beans in the shade of an umbrella. Chillis (the Indonesian translation of Lombok) cascade from baskets, topless boys hack coconuts into neat skull-shaped hunks, rice and salt are weighed by hand and, inside a vast dark warehouse, meat is presented red and semi-alive on heaving trestle tables. The island grows everything it needs, and each village has its speciality: one produces tofu from its bean curd, another makes dried shrimp paste, another is famous for its salted shark. All are available here, alongside cages of live cocks, being sold not-so-secretly for fights. We walk past the cidomos (the tiny horses and carts) and through a\u00a0fisherman&apos;s village, where thatched shacks squat metres away from the sea and narrow boats (jukung) are tethered after they&apos;ve delivered their red snapper.     Gili Eco Villas on the island of Gili Trawangan. Photograph: Christopher Leggett    The tiny Gili islands are visible from the shore, with Gili Trawangan (the most developed) a popular backpackers&apos; destination. We skid across the sea in a rickety speedboat and hail a cidomo on the jetty. There are no cars or fresh water on the Gili islands, but to make up for it there are plenty of Australian teenagers singing Katy Perry songs. Our dwarfish horse totters us drunkenly to Gili Eco Villas, a collection of houses at the far end of the island where the tiny rooms contain little more than a\u00a0mosquito-netted bed. On the beach, snorkellers and divers coo over coral, and we watch clouds gather from a\u00a0bar on stilts in the water. When the storm comes, it is so strong it cuts the electricity, so we sit in the dark under a wall-less roof and watch lightning rip across the ocean. The outside bathroom is alive with frogs and the mirrors steam up with thick tropical heat. When we get hungry, we pick through the forest, pausing in a wet huddle between flashes, and eat nasi goreng under a bamboo canopy. In the morning, everything is sodden, and everyone is asleep. Back on the west coast of Lombok, another stormy night in the eccentric Puri Mas hotel means we are tied to the balldancing-themed bar, where a\u00a0local band persuades my boyfriend to join them in hours of Elvis covers. Tugu Lombok, our sixth hotel, looks like it was carved by talented giants. Spectacular and beautifully grand, with colourful traces of Dutch colonialism, it features ancient statues of Hindu gods scattered among the sun loungers, and the sea is clear enough to see blue fish nodding past your knees. We&apos;re woken by birdsong and pad into the outside bathroom with its huge copper bath. We spend a final night around the bay at the famous Oberoi. The island&apos;s first luxury hotel is a temple of elegant excess, where a waiter watches sunbathers discreetly, sweeping over with sorbet on banana leaves when they start to sweat. The air is cleaner here, the money evident. Cycling out of the gates past the corrugated iron shacks that make up nearby villages, I feel as though my comparative wealth is visible like a guilty blush. I&apos;d heard stories about Indonesians further inland throwing rocks at tourists, but we encounter only curiosity from the women resting by the road and excitement from the uniformed schoolchildren who run alongside our car, thumbs raised. Our final meal, a rijsttafel \u2013 an Indonesian feast \u2013 is served over the water in a candlelit hut. By the pool an orchestra of local children pluck traditional (if atonal) songs while women dance slowly. On the way to the airport we stop in Pusuk Forest, where grey monkeys swarm by my feet for peanuts. The larger ones swipe the nuts away from the smaller ones, who lurk, hoodie-like, by the car.

Singapore&apos;s Tharman Shanmugaratnam \u2013 who was promoted to deputy prime minister earlier on Wednesday \u2013 and former UK prime minister Gordon Brown are both available at 8/1. Dervi\u015f had already been identified as a strong candidate to replace Strauss-Kahn, 62, who is currently in Rikers Island prison, New York, facing charges of sexual assault on a 32-year-old chambermaid. A former head of the United Nations Development Programme, Dervi\u015f leads the global economy programme at the Brookings Institution in Washington and is known to have strong connections with the IMF. For Dervi\u015f, Ahluwalia or Shanmugaratnam to be appointed, though, Europe&apos;s political elite would have to yield its traditional grip on the IMF. Each of its 10 managing directors has been European \u2013 and four hailed from France \u2013 thanks to a cosy transatlantic arrangement that means an American has usually run the World Bank. But the events in New York in recent days may end this status quo. Weber, the former head of the Bundesbank, is understood to be the favoured choice of German chancellor Angela Merkel. Under the weighted voting system used by the IMF, a candidate backed by European members and the US would be almost certain of success. The pressure on Strauss-Kahn has intensified since US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner said the Frenchman he was unable to run the IMF from Rikers Island. He is due to appear in court on Friday, and denies committing a sexual assault at his Manhattan hotel last weekend. His five-year term at the IMF ends next year, but he had been expected to step down early to run for the French presidency.

But after a groundbreaking election in which the ruling party had its first major shake up after 50 years in power, Singapore&apos;s &quot;founding father&quot;, Lee Kuan Yew, has announced his full retirement from cabinet. The 87-year-old former prime minister cited this year&apos;s &quot;watershed&quot; election as his inspiration, in which the People&apos;s Action party (PAP), which he helped create at independence from Great Britain in 1959, won its lowest ratings yet with just 60% of the popular vote.

Calling for &quot;a fresh clean slate&quot;, Lee noted that his age distanced him from younger voters and that a &quot;younger team of ministers [should] connect to and engage with this younger generation in shaping the future of Singapore&quot;. Lee is largely credited with turning the small colonial outpost into the financial dynamo it is today.

For them, Lee&apos;s stepping down heralds a breath of fresh air and &quot;is a pretty big deal&quot;, says Nansi Panjar, 27, who voted for the opposition Reform party in the 7\u00a0May election. &quot;This shows that the PAP is listening to its voters and that change could finally be in the air.&quot; Once the raison d&apos;etre for the PAP, Lee has more recently alienated voters by urging Singaporean Muslims to &quot;be less strict&quot; and hinting at the &quot;consequences&quot; of voting for the opposition. A much younger cabinet, with an average age of 52, was unveiled on Wednesday . Lee was Singapore&apos;s first prime minister, leading the country from 1959 to 1990. He is the longest-serving prime minister in the Commonwealth and the longest-serving head of government in Asia. He has remained in the cabinet since stepping down as prime minister, first serving as senior minister from 1990 to 2004 and later, from 2004 to 2011, as minister mentor, a post made for him by his son, Lee Hsien Loong, the current prime minister. He has also stepped down as the chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), which he has ceded to his son. He will stay on as senior adviser to the state investment firm, among the world&apos;s largest sovereign wealth funds at $300bn (\u00a3149bn). He will also remain MP of Tanjong Pagar ward, a constituency that he won uncontested in this year&apos;s election. Just how far removed from politics he will really become, however, is anyone&apos;s guess. In 1988 he was quoted as saying: &quot;Even from my sickbed, even if you are going to lower me into the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I will get up. Those who believe that after I have left the government as prime minister, I will go into a permanent retirement, really should have their heads examined.&quot; Perhaps that is why many voters are saying that, while his stepping down is somewhat of a coup, the real change is still to come. &quot;To be honest, we&apos;ll only see true freedom when Lee dies,&quot; said Panjar. &quot;That&apos;s when Singapore will finally be able to take a long look at itself and question where it really wants to go.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 25 May 2011.

If their prototype course works as well as they are hoping, then two days from now I will, as the spiel on Noble&apos;s website boasts, &quot;have learned to speak Chinese the way it is really spoken&quot;. It&apos;s a bold claim. Mandarin has a reputation as one of the hardest languages to learn. For one thing, it is tonal \u2013 each word has a variety of possible meanings, all dependent on the subtlest differences of pronunciation. A downwards, chastising inflection converts the word for &quot;buy&quot; into &quot;sell&quot;, while the incredulous falling and rising third tone transforms the word for &quot;mother&quot; into &quot;horse&quot;, and the same word, &quot;ma&quot;, used for horses and mothers, is appended to statements to transform them into questions, like a spoken piece of punctuation. The idea that any language, let alone one so notoriously difficult, can be taught in just two days struck me first as laughable and later, when I realised that I would be the guinea pig, terrifying. I approached the first class expecting to find myself face-to-face with the language-learning world&apos;s answer to Sue Sylvester from Glee, a megaphone-wielding, militaristic maniac forcing Chinese words into my head by rote until I curled up in a foetal position, wept blood and begged to go home. What I did not expect was a warm, soft-spoken man with a bright blond beard who reminded me less of a barking linguistic drill sergeant than a youthful Gandalf the wizard. Noble&apos;s teaching, it turns out, is entirely the opposite of the brain-straining I had envisaged. &quot;The important thing is to forget everything and make mistakes,&quot; he explains. &quot;I don&apos;t want you to try to remember what I teach you. In fact, I want you to forget it.&quot; This is going to be easy, I tell myself. Easy and, since I am going to forget it all, useless. My plan is to test Noble&apos;s teaching, when we&apos;re done, in conversation with native speakers. I have booked a table at a Mandarin-speaking restaurant in London&apos;s Chinatown, where I&apos;m hoping that my authentic Chinese accent will dazzle waiters and fellow diners alike. Ideally, an astonished waiter will ask: &quot;How long have you been learning Chinese?&quot; and I&apos;ll reply, nonchalantly: &quot;Oh, you know, just a couple of days, for a laugh.&quot; In Mandarin, of course. The lessons Noble&apos;s method, it turns out, is Socratic and simple, a variation of what&apos;s called the Lexical approach, which teaches language not as long lists of words but as a relatively small selection of set phrases \u2013 chunks of language that convey implicitly the rules of grammar and sentence structure. He teaches a handful of words and phrases to use as building blocks \u2013 I want, she wants, you want a sandwich \u2013 and we add prepositions, rules and verbs one by one. Pronunciation I learn from Kai-Ti, who repeats each sentence I say back to me, slowly and subtly correcting my often inventive pronunciation. Just as the chunked approach taught structure and grammar without making them explicit, by copying Kai-Ti I learn to use the four tones organically. Day one begins in the present tense, progresses to questions and then on to the past and future. By day two I am playing fast and loose with pronouns, possessives and conditionals, albeit with a very limited vocabulary. I can&apos;t help but see the process as a montage scene from a film, a time-lapsed conversation between master and pupil growing rapidly weirder and more complicated: &quot;I want to go to Beijing.&quot; &quot;Do you want to go Beijing?&quot; &quot;I want to go to Beijing but you want to go to Shanghai.&quot; &quot;Do you want to go to Shanghai because your mum went to Shanghai?&quot; &quot;I will go to Beijing because I don&apos;t like your mum.&quot; &quot;If you want to go to Shanghai I will go to Beijing and buy your mum.&quot; The narrow set of nouns and verbs is an integral part of Noble&apos;s technique. &quot;One of the worst things you can do with language teaching is teach someone a massive number of words. It&apos;s back-to-front \u2013 teach them to speak and then add to their knowledge. You have to become very fluent in a very small amount of the language.&quot; Many students, he says, are led astray by learning numbers, colours or days of the week before they&apos;ve learned any kind of framework with which to use them. &quot;The nouns are almost irrelevant. That&apos;s stuff you can learn yourself.&quot; Though his approach emphasises relaxation and experimentation, there are rules. Writing anything down is banned, as is all technical jargon \u2013 talk of participles, perfect tenses and the subjunctive makes Noble wince. &quot;The mistake with language learning is that it&apos;s seen as an academic subject, but it isn&apos;t; it&apos;s a practical subject. What you need is to be trained in them.&quot; He laments the state of language teaching in schools. &quot;I was naturally particularly good at languages but when I went to school they did German and I was utterly confused by it. I spent about eight years trying to learn and failed.&quot; It was only after leaving school and experimenting with commercially available language courses that he hit upon methods that worked for him and, he hoped, would work equally well for others. Though Collins has now published his courses for the public in French, Spanish and Italian, Noble&apos;s goal remains to change the way languages are taught in British secondary schools. &quot;If I had four years with kids in schools they would walk out fluent. Instead, I have 10 hours in a classroom on a weekend.&quot; After a hushed discussion in Mandarin, Paul and Kai-Ti give me one last crash course in preparation for my trip to the restaurant. They have chosen what I should order in advance, outlining a selection of standard dishes: Singapore chow mein (Shin-ja-poor chow me-en), Yang Zhou fried rice (Yan-Jo chow fan), Peking duck (Bei-jing kao ya) and, at my request, a glass of orange juice (Ju-tze shui). They teach me how to ask for the bill, how to ask the waiters whether or not they speak Mandarin (as opposed to Cantonese), and how to respond, when asked about the food, that it is tasty or, if the occasion warrants, delicious. I will not, Noble warns me, understand precisely what the waiting staff are saying to me. &quot;You cannot translate the words as they&apos;re being said. It&apos;s impossible. You just have to get a general sense.&quot; He returns to his notion of language learning as not academic but practical \u2013 less a quiz to be answered carefully than an assault course, to be fumbled through at speed. &quot;It&apos;s like using the force,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Don&apos;t try and understand; try and feel.&quot; The restaurant Six days later I am loitering nervously in the New World restaurant in London&apos;s Chinatown, its black-and-red exterior a willing embrace of stereotype, adorned with twin gold dragons and a pagoda-style roof of corrugated tiles. With the notable exception of China itself, it doesn&apos;t get more Chinese than this. I have spoken to the staff in advance \u2013 in English \u2013 and been assigned a Mandarin-speaking waitress, who agrees to indulge me while I road test my two days&apos; knowledge of the language. As I wait to be served I mutter to myself in Chinese, and, to my surprise, it&apos;s all coming back to me. &quot;Ni hao,&quot; she says, as she approaches. It&apos;s the standard Chinese greeting, which Noble tells me translates approximately as &quot;Y&apos;allright?&quot;. He suggests I use &quot;hao&quot; \u2013 the equivalent of &quot;fine&quot; \u2013 as a sort of catch-all response to any questions I don&apos;t understand, as it can mean yes, no, OK, good, bad, whatever. &quot;Hao,&quot; I respond. She asks for my order. This is the part I&apos;ve been practising longest, and I reel off my intended menu from memory, even managing to improvise successfully around the photographer&apos;s last-minute request for a can of Coke. Coca-Cola (in Mandarin, Ke-kou Ke-le) is a word taught early on in Noble&apos;s course, as a demonstration that the student already understands at least a little Chinese. She repeats the order in English so I can check that I&apos;ve said what I meant. It&apos;s correct. &quot;Hao,&quot; I say. &quot;You speak very well,&quot; she tells me. &quot;Sheh sheh,&quot; I respond: thanks. So far, so good, but then again, so on script. Ten minutes later, when she returns with the food, I resolve to move the conversation into bolder territory. &quot;Do you like him?&quot; I ask, indicating the photographer. She laughs, then looks confused and a little panicked. I replay what I&apos;ve just said in my head. What I&apos;ve actually asked, I realise, isn&apos;t, &quot;Do you like him?&quot; but &quot;Would you like him?&quot; A mistake which is definitely entirely my fault. &quot;Not would you like,&quot; I correct myself, &quot;Do you like?&quot; Which, while it is fairly simple, is not a phrase I&apos;d thought about in advance, or constructed in the lesson at all. It&apos;s a sentence I&apos;ve made up on the fly, suggesting that I have, against the odds, achieved some tiny degree of fluency. There are obvious deficiencies in what I have learned. Chief among them the fact that I know so few nouns; not even, for example, numbers, or months, or farmyard animals, which school language classes had conditioned me to think of as essential. I can, however, convert a verb into the past and future tenses, and say that I, you, we, they, he or she did it, and add an if, a but or a because, and offer, when the situation demands, to buy a stranger&apos;s mother or sell them a photographer. Which is more than I ever managed in five years of French at school. Have I really learned Mandarin in just two days? Well, yes and no. Mostly no, but sort of. Hao.

The call from the organisation&apos;s governing body was described as &quot;ironic&quot; by one British industry expert, who noted it that it came after the UK had cut tax breaks for the North Sea, making this country less attractive for producing oil. The IEA has pledged to use &quot;all tools that are at the disposal of its members&quot; to help if Saudi Arabia and others raised their output to prevent damage being done to the global economy. The unusual call came at a quarterly meeting of the IEA&apos;s governing body and is clearly designed to put pressure on the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which holds its own summit in three weeks&apos; time. &quot;The governing board urges action from producers that will help avoid the negative global economic consequences which a further sharp market tightening could cause, and welcomes commitments to increase supply,&quot; the members said in a statement. &quot;Additional increases in prices at this stage of the economic cycle risk derailing the global economic recovery and are neither in the interest of producing nor of consuming countries,&quot; they added. The call came as crude prices slipped after a brief rally this week, with Brent falling 54 cents to $111.76 per barrel after increasing more than $2 on Wednesday; The value of oil has fallen by 10% since the first week of May. The IEA acknowledged the fall but said crude remained &quot;at elevated levels&quot; due to market fundamentals, geopolitical uncertainty and future expectations. Peter Odell, a British-based petroleum economist and Professor Emeritus of International Energy Studies at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, said much of the price increase was caused by oil traders and speculators based in places such as London and Singapore. He doubted whether the IEA could help Opec. &quot;This call is also ironic given that the [UK] government has just reduced subsidies in the North Sea and seems hell-bent instead on spending billions on wind farms. This might satisfy some greens but is a potential disaster that will leave us begging for oil from abroad,&quot; Odell said. Oil analysts said the latest jump in prices had not come from an unexpected drop in the amount of oil stored in US refineries but a rise in equity prices and a firm dollar. Prices are expected to remain volatile as weak economic data from the US fuels concerns about demand, and investors worry that debt-laden Greece and Portugal may drag down other economies. Opec has already hinted that it might increase production but price hawks in the cartel have previously argued that much of the high price rise is caused by speculators and is outside their control."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/19/outsider-peter-mandelson-imf-european", "sentences": ["They range from Turkey&apos;s Kemal Dervis, who has important admirers in the UK government, to South Africa&apos;s Trevor Manuel, Mexico&apos;s Agustin Carstens and Singapore&apos;s Tharman Shanmugaratnam (endorsed by the former IMF chief economist Simon Johnson and Labour&apos;s former City minister Paul Myners on the World At One)."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-19T19:30:00Z", "title": "An outsider like Peter Mandelson could be perfect for the IMF | Martin Kettle", "tags": ["International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Dominique Strauss-Kahn", "Economics", "Peter Mandelson", "Global economy", "Gordon Brown", "Business", "Politics", "US news", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "The fall of Dominique Strauss-Kahn has triggered a defining test of European influence. Yet Britain is no mere spectator in this process. We have major interests at stake in the choice of Strauss-Kahn&apos;s successor. This country, and the Cameron government, face big decisions about whether and how to fight for those interests, or perhaps risk seeing them vanquished in their present form for all time. For more than 65 years the International Monetary Fund has been headed by a European, with an American deputy, while the US provides the head of the World Bank. In practice, the IMF job has most frequently gone to a French candidate such as Strauss-Kahn, or the frontrunner to succeed him, Christine Lagarde \u2013 for 35 of the last 48 years, in fact. But that postwar apportionment has come under assault from the rising economic powers of Asia and Latin America. Europe remains a huge economic player \u2013 too many here underestimate this. But there&apos;s a growing sense that, politically, we are now punching too far above our weight. The issue has been extensively wrestled at successive economic summits, notably at the G20 in Pittsburgh two years ago and again in Seoul last November, which both made important changes to IMF governance. The role of the Obama administration, less Eurocentric than its predecessors, has been pivotal. The choice of next IMF managing director would inevitably have arisen soon anyway, possibly in only a few months if Strauss-Kahn had returned to run for the French presidency next spring. But the chair is suddenly vacant. Now it&apos;s decision time. What to do? The argument for fairness and progress is powerful and in many ways compelling. The US-Europe duopoly reflects a world that is passing. China, India, Brazil and the rest are creating an ever larger share of the world&apos;s wealth. That growing share should be, and is gradually being, recognised in the makeup of the instruments of global financial governance. The idea that Europe, ailing and failing in so many ways, can automatically command the seat at the wheel of the IMF after Strauss-Kahn&apos;s departure is increasingly hard to sustain, not least in Obama&apos;s and the Tea Party&apos;s Washington. What is more, there are talented alternatives aplenty. They range from Turkey&apos;s Kemal Dervis, who has important admirers in the UK government, to South Africa&apos;s Trevor Manuel, Mexico&apos;s Agustin Carstens and Singapore&apos;s Tharman Shanmugaratnam (endorsed by the former IMF chief economist Simon Johnson and Labour&apos;s former City minister Paul Myners on the World At One). Come in Europe, your time is up, is now a widespread view. Yet in some ways it is also the argument made from the comfortable armchair of the beau monde onlooker, not from the sweaty and practical engine room of the engaged political participant. Europe pays more into the fund than anyone else, so why should it not use its role as principal shareholder? High-minded self-denial and historically aware European internationalism would be a lot easier to envisage if it was reciprocated, notably in the US, which in significant ways is also on the down escalator of global economic influence. If Washington wants to back an emerging-world IMF head, then it would make sense for the US to give up its traditional grip on the deputy&apos;s job. But there is not much sign of that. In the real world of sovereign debt crises, bailouts and deficit-cutting inhabited by Angela Merkel and the rest of Europe&apos;s leaders, a European IMF head is not just convenient but essential, as Strauss-Kahn has undoubtedly been during the continuing European crisis. And serious politicians don&apos;t give away power without a bankable quid pro quo. That&apos;s why Merkel was so quick to demand an early European successor. The IMF has been good for the eurozone in the last two years. The member states have a raw collective self-interest in that continuing to be the case. David Cameron, George Osborne and the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, do not have to be quite so desperate as Merkel. Yet even from their position a European successor makes a lot of sense. Partly this is because Britain can have some influence over which candidate goes forward. More importantly, it is because the scale and effectiveness of the IMF&apos;s engagement with Europe under Strauss-Kahn has helped to shield the larger European nations, Britain included, from having to spend money they can ill-afford, or try to restructure the EU in ways that would antagonise their voters. Strauss-Kahn was much admired in Whitehall. He fought to protect a progressive agenda amid inescapably hard times. He had economic credibility, and was what one minister admiringly calls an absolutely A-grade political operator. He got things done. He is the proverbial hard act to follow. If Gordon Brown were not Gordon Brown he might be, as he would like to be, the man for this hour. But Brown is unappointable. He has done nothing to cultivate the leaders whose goodwill and trust he would need. He is instinctively uncollegiate in a job that requires immense persuasive skills. And he can&apos;t be trusted not to use the IMF as a bully pulpit against Cameron and Osborne. A more intriguing UK outsider, in every sense \u2013 and absolutely guaranteed to have Brown chewing the carpet \u2013 is Peter Mandelson. China has asked if the former business secretary and EU trade commissioner would take the job. Mandelson is definitely interested. The coalition might be open to it too. Germany and France are another matter. Mandelson nevertheless ticks a lot of boxes. Ultimately what matters is that the IMF stands behind the economic life of its member states. The nationality of the boss is less important than the fund&apos;s strategy and credibility. We ought to know more, therefore, about what candidates for these big international jobs actually stand for, and what our governments are looking for when they vote. Given Europe&apos;s contributions and the priority of its problems, there remains a good case for a managing director who understands Europe. But Europe ought to have learned by now that doing the right job is more important than making the appointment. In the end, international institutions need leaders who can speak to and deliver for the nations. Strauss-Kahn did that. His successor must do so too. And that means a more transparent appointment system than the usual secret carve-up."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/20/hmv-sells-waterstones-book-chain", "sentences": ["Within this HMV UK &amp; Ireland saw sales fall 18.8% with international operations, in Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, down 6.7%."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-20T07:07:00Z", "title": "HMV sells Waterstone's for \u00a353m", "tags": ["Waterstones", "Media business", "Media", "HMV", "Retail industry", "Business", "Booksellers", "Books", "Music industry"], "article": "HMV has sold its Waterstone&apos;s book chain to a fund controlled by Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut for \u00a353m.

HMV said that it needs to reduce its borrowing requirements in the short term to &quot;achieve a satisfactory refinancing&quot; and &quot;has concluded that the most timely and effective way to achieve this is through the disposal of Waterstone&apos;s&quot;. &quot;We expect this deal to enable the group to achieve a reduction in the group&apos;s borrowing requirements, and, in turn, focus on plans for transforming the HMV Group into a broad-based entertainment business,&quot; said Simon Fox, the chief executive of HMV Group. The proceeds of the sale \u2013 which will see \u00a340m paid on completion in June and \u00a313m in October \u2013 will be largely used to reduce HMV&apos;s borrowing requirements. &quot;We are extremely pleased to have reached an agreement to acquire Waterstone&apos;s and its great heritage,&quot; said Mamut. &quot;I believe that our investment and strategy will secure a dynamic future for the UK&apos;s largest bookshop chain and I look forward to working with its booksellers in building on the principle of excellent bookselling, which is at the very heart of the business.&quot; HMV said that the sale is conditional on shareholder approval and also from the pension trustee, the pensions regulator as well as HMV&apos;s banks &quot;including a renegotiation of the group&apos;s lending facilities&quot;. &quot;Any such transaction would likely be subject to, amongst other things, shareholder, lending bank and pension trustee approval,&quot; the company said. &quot;There can be no certainty that any transaction will be concluded and a further announcement will be made as and when appropriate.&quot; HMV Group reported that total group sales continued to slide down 15.2% year on year in the 17 weeks to the of April. Within this HMV UK &amp; Ireland saw sales fall 18.8% with international operations, in Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, down 6.7%. Waterstone&apos;s reported a sales fall of 11.3%. The company said in the 53 weeks to the end of April group profits before tax and exceptional items would be about \u00a328.5m. Year-end net debt is expected to be \u00a3170m. \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

We were not being relocated to Japan, or anywhere else for that matter \u2013 we were on holiday and fancied a nose around some kit houses to see how Japanese families live. Very comfortably, if these earthquake-proof prefab homes were anything to go by. Designed to offer maximum space on their modest plots, they were all sliding doors and hidden gadgets, and yet even among all the hi-tech toys each home still had a traditional tatami room. Fascinating. When you&apos;re on a short trip, it&apos;s easy to get a feel for a place&apos;s history and culture by sampling the museums, galleries, religious buildings and ruins; buy the guidebook and off you go. And, yes, Tokyo&apos;s Shinto temples are fascinating, but what about glimpsing a genuine slice of life, seeing how ordinary people live? We spent some of our allotted temple time exploring a quiet suburb instead, wandering down streets of little houses with bay windows and net curtains, and Wedgwood trinkets proudly displayed. We perused pet shops crammed with designer doggy coats and jewelled kitty collars, and made a point of ducking into the most unlikely-looking places. The least promising of all delivered most: a striped tent redolent of the sort used by road workers was, we were delighted to discover, a bar. Things that at home might seem mundane reach uncharted levels of intrigue when you&apos;re away. I often hold off getting my hair cut until I&apos;m in another country and have had an interesting experience each time (and interesting results, it must be said). One time I had a trim in a tiny room at a community building in a Portuguese village, serenaded by singing and dance classes on all sides. At a hair salone in Singapore, they started washing my hair while I was just sitting at the mirror leafing through a magazine, and nowhere near a sink. There are many ways a stranger can get a peek behind the curtains of a place. But befriending an estate agent is a surprisingly fun way to start.Susie Grimshaw Ask to see behind closed doors  I&apos;m a shy guy. My brother asked me to be his best man but for me making a speech would have been impossible. Even the thought of proposing a family toast at Christmas brings me out in a cold sweat. I&apos;ve never asked a girl out on a date. But I am shamelessly forward when I&apos;m on holiday. I&apos;m much happier to grab a local and ask a stupid question (Do monkeys talk with their tails? Do you eat albino children in these parts? Both legitimate questions in context, honestly) rather than tick off a sight. And if there&apos;s a chance to invite myself into someone&apos;s home \u2026 So that&apos;s why the little doorway we found in the darkest, smelliest alley in old Delhi was irresistible. Through the open door I could see a courtyard and glimpses of half-naked bodies. Telling my friend that it would be fine, I stooped through the entrance and into a movie set. At least it should have been a movie set. The courtyard was about the size of a squash court and was surrounded by dirty black walls three storeys high. On each floor there was a narrow balcony circling the courtyard. Shafts of bright light pierced the crude roof and shone down, illuminating the glistening, sweating bodies of men stripped to the waist and busy preparing lunch. Huge fish were being chopped up and thrown into cauldrons of bright yellow curry. It felt like I&apos;d stepped back several centuries. The men saw us and looked startled but friendly. They found someone who spoke English and he explained that four or five hundred men worked, lived and ate in this building, a jewellery workshop. Many were young teenagers from impoverished villages in West Bengal who had been sent by their families to the city to earn money. We climbed through the floors, peeking into rooms and watching amazingly intricate gold pieces being made. Smiles and handshakes greeted us at every step. Half an hour later we left, buzzing with this extraordinarily vivid experience, made all the more special for being such a surprise. Our boldness/cheekiness had been amply rewarded. But had we been rude? You probably wouldn&apos;t barge uninvited into someone&apos;s home or workplace if you were on a day trip to Stratford-upon-Avon. But I don&apos;t think we were rude. It&apos;s context again. We were as interesting to them as they were to us. Tourist and local both got an insight into each other&apos;s lives.Richard Eilers, Guardian Travel sub-editor Befriend locals online in advance  My greatest holiday fear is the tourist trap. I&apos;m so petrified of falling in to one, that I have been known to tramp for miles through bleak foreign suburbs in the driving rain, searching desperately for a beer in a proper local bar. If you don&apos;t know where to go, a foreign city is like a labyrinth; it&apos;s far too easy to get lost, hit a dead end or come across a monster of a restaurant bulging with ripped-off tourists. When I travelled to Brussels for a long weekend, I read all the guide books, articles and online reviews, but it seemed like all anyone was looking for was waffles and chocolate shops. I wanted to find out where the locals hang out. So I got in touch with them. I thought about the sort of people that might be into similar things as me, and read blogs by artists, cartoonists, musicians and writers from the city. Most people have an email address linked to their blog, so it&apos;s easy to reach them directly. Bloggers also post flyers of events they&apos;re going to, which is a great way to discover what&apos;s coming up in smaller venues. You must always judge a blog by its style, fonts, writing quality and overuse of exclamation marks. &quot;Goin 2 dis awesome dance party tonite at Majestyk can&apos;t wait!!!!!!!&quot; is not the sort of cool, insider tip you are looking for. If it&apos;s not written in your language, get a fluent friend to translate, or send the author an email \u2013 if they speak English, they&apos;ll usually get back to you. I&apos;ve found that most people are delighted to be asked for advice. We&apos;ve been led to some magical places. In Brussels, a blogger pointed us to a club under the railway arches. In Lisbon, a group of illustrators invited me to a private view in an abandoned palace. In Seattle, we tucked in to revelatory eggs royale at Glo&apos;s cafe, which is huddled, unassumingly, on a side street off Capitol Hill. I doubt I&apos;d have stumbled across it. And in Baltimore we found ourselves in a vast warehouse flat-cum-gig venue, eating homemade burritos fresh from the kitchen while a metal band thrashed around in the background. You won&apos;t like everything you find, but adventures are guaranteed.Becky Barnicoat Have a project     A market in Urubamba, Sacred Valley, Peru. Photograph: Moe Kafer    Cultural cuisine is my passion, so when I travelled to Peru I wanted to experience the culture from a foodie&apos;s perspective. Not being particularly package-tour inclined, I did a bit of old-school networking in order to get to the heart of the country&apos;s kitchens. You only really need one good lead and the secret culinary gems start to appear. On a trek along the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, my guide not only offered insight into the country&apos;s history, he provided a few key foodie contacts that started me on my way. He passed on the name of an Aussie guide who had married a Cusco girl, so this couple were my first port of call on my return to the city. Together Libertad and I explored the local markets and visited a traditional cevicher\u00eda, a restaurant where Peruvians eat the delicious traditional dish of fish cooked by being marinated in lime juice. Not many foreign faces are seen at these tables, and locals were excited to share their hidden gems with a curious traveller. Although I am a food photographer, this trip was for my own enjoyment rather than any particular assignment, and this approach could have worked for anyone with an interest in food \u2013 or anything else. What I found was that if you are interested, people are always happy to share. Over the course of my visit I was introduced to the Sunday ritual of dining on deep-fried pork and dancing to local bands at the chicharroneria \u2013 where I was the belle of the ball \u2013 and welcomed into kitchens where I learned how to cook traditional recipes and about life in Peru, and even had a private audience with Gast\u00f3n Acurio, Peru&apos;s answer to Jamie Oliver. In fact, I learned so much about the diverse and delicious Peruvian cuisine I wrote a cookery book, A Taste of Peru, which I self-published on my return to the UK.Moe Kafer, food photographer and writer (moekafer.com, buy A Taste of Peru at tinyurl.com/6aswenl) Visit a sporting event My trick is to seek out sporting events wherever I go \u2013 baseball in Japan, football in Rio, takraw (kick volleyball) in Laos. The ball communicates in every language, you get to see the locals in a rare state of openness and passion, and you meet the culture in its most convivial and gregarious mode, when it is most ready to include an outsider in its rites (so long as he&apos;s wearing the right colours). Plus, of course, the beauty of travel is that even when things go completely wrong, you end up in the right place. My first time in Japan, I took myself to a baseball game and deliberately showed up at 5pm for a game that I thought began at 7pm. I arrived to find great crowds streaming past me in the opposite direction, since the game had in fact begun at 2pm that day. But a stadium official was so heart-stricken to see me alone and walking in the wrong direction that he took me out to dinner, gave me a free ticket for the next day&apos;s game and, somehow, opened a door on the culture that would have stayed firmly closed if things had gone according to plan.Pico Iyer, travel writer Focus on one scene I have a few techniques I use that are quite specific to my interests. If I&apos;m travelling in the developed world, I tend to go immediately to the local vegetarian restaurant, or natural food store. It&apos;s not what you&apos;d call a cutting-edge journalistic technique, but as a hardcore veggie/green type, I can get keyed in straight away to a world view that I&apos;m in tune with, and these places always have flyers or contacts for like-minded people who begin to open up the city. I did this in San Francisco when I first went there in the 1990s and the place opened up a like a book for me. I ended up eating a meal with Zen monks at a Buddhist monastery and retreat in Marin, going to the best farmers&apos; market I&apos;ve ever seen, and made some friends I still see today \u2026Piers Moore Ede, travel writer  Take a taxi tour     Gemma Bowes swears by a taxi tour. Photograph: Getty Images/Image Source    Some of the best tour guides I&apos;ve ever had have been random taxi drivers whose services cost no more than a fare and a tip. They are generally full of stories and information, and always know where to get brilliant cheap food. On my last morning in Mumbai I was determined to find the best masala dosa (a crisp, thin, pancakey bread stuffed with spiced potato) for breakfast. The taxi driver took me to a tiny cheap cafe in a faceless bit of the city that served the most delicious examples, albeit in a grotty setting. In Jordan, a driver called Ahmed procured perfect falafel wraps from roadside cafes, while in Sri Lanka, Ranjit, a lovely, grandfatherly man, turned the eight-hour journey from Puttalam to Kandy into one of the best experiences of my trip. Frequently pulling over in rural villages to buy little paper bags of &quot;short eats&quot; \u2013 the favourite Sri Lankan snacks, such as spicy samosas, fish cutlets (crisp patties) and dhal vadai (balls of dhal with chilli) \u2013 he regaled me with explanations of Sri Lankan politics, history and culture, translated the Sinhalese radio and told his own fantastic stories, including his 11 near-death experiences (he&apos;d only got to number four by the time we arrived).Gemma Bowes, Guardian Travel editor  Read a book set in the destination  To get a feel of a place before or while I am visiting, I always try to read a piece of fiction that is set in the particular city that I&apos;m visiting. This will often give me ideas of places to see so I can compare them with how they are described in the book. The books can be set in modern times or in earlier periods. I&apos;m currently reading Cathedral of the Sea by Ildefonso Falcones, a book set around the building of the Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar church in Barcelona in the 14th century, ahead of a visit to the city later this summer. My holiday last year, travelling around Sweden by train, was very much influenced by the many Wallander and other Scandinavian detective books I had read during the previous year. There have also been occasions when a book provides a map, with a route of the places mentioned in the story. The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n was also set in Barcelona, and when I was there last time, the route took me down many streets that I normally wouldn&apos;t have explored. Of course there are a few drawbacks to this approach to holiday planning. One obvious one is that sometimes the places mentioned don&apos;t actually exist, and it&apos;s always disappointing when you can&apos;t find them. Then there&apos;s the danger that you don&apos;t get through the book quickly enough \u2013 I took Charles Dickens&apos;s A Tale of Two Cities with me for a long weekend in Paris, only to discover that I was already boarding the Eurostar for my return journey when the scenes set in Paris started to appear in the book. But generally I can recommend this as a good way of discovering interesting places \u2013 and certainly much more fun than reading a guide book.Martyn Dore Offer to teach people English Finding the local university and offering my services as a volunteer teacher of conversational English worked well in Colombia. I did have to do some work for it, but it led to getting to know people I wouldn&apos;t otherwise have met, which took me far off the beaten track, to meals with families and so on. Students are generally up for a laugh and the lecturers were happy to have some native English speakers to include in class exercises (or to take classes for them). I didn&apos;t have to do anything formal, or have any qualifications \u2013 I just turned up and talked to people to see if I could help out.Mark Crouch"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/22/osborne-supports-christine-lagarde-imf", "sentences": ["Trevor Manuel, South Africa&apos;s finance minister, has been mentioned, as has Tharman Shanmugaratnam of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-21T23:06:00Z", "title": "Osborne backs French finance minister Christine Lagarde to take over at IMF", "tags": ["International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "George Osborne", "Gordon Brown", "Dominique Strauss-Kahn", "European Union", "France", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "The government has officially backed Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, to be the new head of the International Monetary Fund, effectively ending Gordon Brown&apos;s dwindling hopes of snatching the job. European leaders are anxious to settle on a candidate to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as the IMF&apos;s managing director after being arrested in New York on suspicion of sexually assaulting a hotel chambermaid. George Osborne followed Italy, Germany and several other European governments in explicitly supporting Lagarde, 55, who won plaudits for her shrewd political judgment when the global financial crisis sent European economies into turmoil. &quot;I believe Christine is the outstanding candidate for the IMF \u2013 and that&apos;s why Britain will back her,&quot; said Osborne, who praised her &quot;real international leadership&quot; as chair of the G20 finance ministers. The chancellor said that he viewed Lagarde as a sympathiser in Britain&apos;s hawkish approach to budget deficits: &quot;She has been a strong advocate for countries tackling high budget deficits and living within their means.&quot; He said that a woman head for the IMF would be welcome: &quot;I also personally think it would be a very good thing to see the first female managing director of the IMF in its 60-year history.&quot; Lagarde, who represented France at synchronised swimming as a teenager, speaks fluent English, having worked as a lawyer in the US. She has been France&apos;s finance minister since 2007, and has been popular both among financiers and the public. She was voted Europe&apos;s best finance minister in a Financial Times poll in 2009. Germany&apos;s Angela Merkel and Italy&apos;s Silvio Berlusconi have both praised Lagarde in recent days and smaller European nations, including Sweden and Austria, have backed her. Under a long-running informal agreement, leadership of the World Bank has generally gone to an American, with the IMF job going to a European. Some policymakers, particularly in the US, have suggested that it is time for a candidate from an emerging nation to have the role. Trevor Manuel, South Africa&apos;s finance minister, has been mentioned, as has Tharman Shanmugaratnam of Singapore. With the eurozone beset by debt crises in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, leaders in the European Union are, however, keen for a sympathetic voice at the IMF. The US, which is yet to make its position clear, will have a key role in determining the outcome of the selection process, with a new head due to be appointed by the end of June. The government&apos;s decision to back Lagarde will come as a bitter disappointment to Brown, who has lobbied for the job, citing his long-standing role in reforming international financial institutions. However, even before Strauss-Kahn&apos;s arrest, David Cameron had let it be know that he did not consider the former prime minister an &quot;appropriate person&quot; for the post. \u2022 The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the Record column, Sunday 29 May 2011. This report, referred to Trevor Manuel as South Africa&apos;s finance minister. He was certainly one of South Africa&apos;s longest-serving finance ministers, having been appointed in 1996 and moving to his current job as planning minister in 2009."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/may/22/live-racing-22-may", "sentences": ["2.00pm Gitano Hernando wins International Cup in Singapore Gitano Hernando, formerly trained by Marco Botti in Newmarket, won the International Cup in Singapore.", "1.30pm Frankie Dettori to ride Campanologist Frankie Dettori, who was due to ride in Singapore until his mount was declared a non-runner, has just arrived at the Curragh for one ride.", "I know that I&apos;m always prepared to put a line through the form if a horse based in Newmarket gets stuffed at, say, Kranji, where Presvis will line up for the Singapore Airlines International Cup at 1.40pm."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-22T11:20:22Z", "title": "Talking Horses: The return of Goldikova, Irish 1,000 Guineas and best bets in our daily horse racing blog", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "4.20pm Misty For Me heads Ballydoyle one-two in the Irish 1,000 Guineas Aidan O&apos;Brien completed an Irish Guineas double when Misty For Me swept past stablemate Together to win the fillies version at the Curragh. 3.20pm So You Think cruises to Gold Cup victory  So You Think enhanced his already massive reputation with an effortless victory in the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh.

But she still had just enough in reserve to hold off the determined challenge Cirrus Des Aigles. 2.00pm Gitano Hernando wins International Cup in Singapore Gitano Hernando, formerly trained by Marco Botti in Newmarket, won the International Cup in Singapore. British hopes Presvis and Wigmore Hall finished down the field. Full report here. 1.30pm Frankie Dettori to ride Campanologist Frankie Dettori, who was due to ride in Singapore until his mount was declared a non-runner, has just arrived at the Curragh for one ride. Godolphin&apos;s No1 jockey will replace Johnny Murtagh on the Saeed Bin Suroor-trained Campanologist in the Gold Cup (3.10). Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook It turned into a depressing experience at Haydock on Saturday, when I was mostly reporting on the Hungarian contingent who were there to support Overdose on his British debut. They were very excited, accepted in advance that there would be no excuses and then had the deflating experience of watching him getting swamped in the final two furlongs, eventually finishing seventh. It reminded me a lot of the time Deep Impact ran third in the Arc, when Longchamp was full of Japanese supporters who expected nothing less than victory and seemed struck dumb by misery when it didn&apos;t happen. But it is asking a lot of a racehorse to take on a top-class field after travelling so far from home. I know that I&apos;m always prepared to put a line through the form if a horse based in Newmarket gets stuffed at, say, Kranji, where Presvis will line up for the Singapore Airlines International Cup at 1.40pm. I hope Overdose&apos;s connections are not so downhearted that they do not send him to Royal Ascot for the King&apos;s Stand next month. Clearly, he would be an unlikely winner and it may be that he simply can&apos;t cut it at that level now, at the age of six and after injury problems. But he also had the perfectly legitimate excuse of finding the ground too firm at Haydock. Andreas Suborics, his rider, described how he felt the horse trying to protect himself against pain in the second half of the race by raising his feet higher and higher off the ground. On ground that has some kind of cushion to it, Overdose can run a better race. It would be most disrespectful to write off a horse with 15 wins to his name after one disappointing effort. Today&apos;s Irish 1,000 Guineas is almost entirely bereft of foreign challengers, with only Mick Channon&apos;s Majestic Dubawi arriving from outside the host country. But it is very hard to beat Aidan O&apos;Brien in Irish Classics, as we were reminded on Saturday when Roderic O&apos;Connor won the 2,000, and the Ballydoyle man may get his fifth success in this Classic with Misty For Me (4.15). I fancied this filly for the English 1,000 but she faded after being competitive until halfway. It was a similar sort of effort to the one made by Roderic O&apos;Connor in the English 2,000, though he had the excuse of having to chase the monstrous Frankel. Any horse can be forgiven one poor effort and a few of O&apos;Brien&apos;s runners have disappointed on their reappearance runs this season. Misty For Me completed her juvenile season with two Group One wins and she looks the best in the field to my eyes, yet we can get 8-1 (she was an even bigger price this morning for the early risers). Earlier, the Tattersalls Gold Cup at 3.10pm is interesting because we get to see the ex-Australian So You Think once more. If he is the superstar he is supposed to be, he should win well, though there is no good reason to back him at 1-4. Still earlier than that, Goldikova makes her seasonal reappearance at Longchamp in the Prix d&apos;Ispahan. We are being offered 4-5, which seems crazy, even about such a wonderful beast, because this is her first run in what is expected to be a long season, with the Breeders&apos; Cup in November as its end point. Whatever she does today, she will be sharper next time and it may be that, at six, she is more in need of her first run than ever. She was well beaten in this race in 2009, when soft ground was blamed, and only had half a length in hand over Byword last year, though that underestimates the ease of her victory that day. Today&apos;s good to soft is probably OK for her but it still feels like a good chance to take her on and I&apos;m surprised to see Dick Turpin (2.45) trading as high as 7-1 on Betfair as I type. He won a French Group One last summer on similar ground and was only a length behind Goldikova in the Prix de la Foret, when the seven furlongs was on the sharp side for him. His effort last Saturday, when stuffed in the Lockinge is forgivable because he was uncomfortable on such a fast surface. If he wins today, Overdose&apos;s connections should take note from the difference that a suitable surface can make.

To general amazement many fans&apos; idea of the most likely winner, the Hong Kong Gold Cup winner California Memory, a confirmed hold up horse, was sent on from the start by Matthew Chadwick, and his famed finishing kick was lost long before the business end of the race. Gitano Hernando&apos;s jockey, the British born but South African resident Glyn Schofield, took the perfect opportunity to sit on the leader&apos;s shoulder, kick early in the straight and make the most of his horse&apos;s resolution. South African champion mare River Jetez led the final pursuers but could get no closer than the half length by which she was beaten, with former German 2,000 Guineas winner Irian, now trained in Hong Kong by John Moore, deadheating with last year&apos;s fourth, the locally trained Waikato, a length away in third. Richard Hughes on Presvis could never get near the leaders as he chased a steady pace that saw the 10f completed in the relatively slow time for the course of 2.03.93 and finished 10th of the twelve runners, while Wigmore Hall, trained by Michael Bell, kept on for seventh, beaten a total of around five lengths. If there was any bitterness on a great night for South African racing connections it was the thought that the brave winner is owned by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, a person whose personal form is unappealing to say the least, but otherwise it was a satisfying performance by a horse who has clearly come to himself in maturity and is already being talked of as a potential Melbourne Cup winner. There was no real money to be made out of Rocket Man&apos;s imperious victory in the KrisFlyer International Sprint, but there is quite ridiculous pleasure in seeing a good horse do exactly what you expect him to and when that horse is the standard bearer of an entire nation&apos;s racing the rush is amplified to an absurd extent. On the local tote Singapore&apos;s national hero started at his now regular odds of 1-5, and only if you had the foresight to visualise a situation in which neither of the much vaunted Hong Kong duo of Sacred Kingdom and Green Birdie could get in a blow at him and the supposedly best of the Singaporean rest could do no more than examine his retreating tail could you have turned any sort of profit on the race. But this was not really about the financial end of racing but about the emotional side. Rocket Man jumped fastest of all and that in itself drew a huge cheer from the crowd. Then Better Be The One and Perfect Pins, no respecters of persons clearly, pushed up on the inside to deprive him of the easy lead that would have ended all semblance of competition. The cheering resumed with renewed force when Felix Coetzee asked Rocket Man to take over at the top of the straight, and continued all down the straight as Rocket Man righted the wrong of the past two seasons when he was defeated by about the width of a man&apos;s arms in the island nation&apos;s only international sprint. After his victory in the Dubai Golden Shaheen it might be reasonable in any normal year to assume that Rocket Man, whose record now reads 16 victories and four very close seconds from 20 starts, has established himself as the fastest horse on earth. But normality doesn&apos;t reign at the moment and fans of Frankel and Black Caviar will no doubt dispute the claim of the Asian champion&apos;s besotted trainer, South African Patrick Shaw, that: &quot;I know I&apos;m biased but I don&apos;t care. He is the best in the world.&quot; Fellow South African Felix Coetzee, the man who rode Silent Witness, the other Asian champion worth mentioning in the same breath as Rocket Man, was almost equally convinced. &quot;He was just so good when he changed legs to pick them up as they turned in,&quot; he said. &quot;Oh I don&apos;t know I shouldn&apos;t have hit him, but, but you just want to make sure, don&apos;t you? These champions just tell you what to do. They do it all for you.&quot; Ascot and the Golden Jubilee now await, and Nick Smith, Ascot&apos;s international recruiter who was present and willing to put bags over people&apos;s heads if that was what it took to get Rocket Man to Berkshire may not even have to twist any arms to get him on the plane. A confrontation with the wonder mare Black Caviar in Hong Kong in December is the logical final step for the year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/may/25/banks-help-ftse-higher", "sentences": ["After this week&apos;s talk that Nasdaq could be interested in the London Stock Exchange, up 22p to 930p, came the suggestion of possible bids from Singapore or Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-25T16:11:30Z", "title": "Banks lead FTSE 100 higher but Shire slips on competition concerns", "tags": ["Business", "Shire", "Barclays", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Antofagasta", "Glencore", "Rexam", "Prudential", "National Grid", "Soco International", "London Stock Exchange", "Invensys", "JJB Sports"], "article": "Shire is facing a growing number of challenges to one of its best selling drugs, sending its shares lower in a rising market. The pharmaceutical group slipped 16p to \u00a318.75 following news that rivals Amneal Pharmaceuticals and Watson Laboratories had filed applications for generic versions of its hyperactivity drug Vyvanse. A similar application was made by Swiss group Sandoz last week, the first for Vyvanse, and Shire has 45 days to decide whether to mount a challenge. But analysts played down the problem. Shore Capital said any generic challenger would face an uphill struggle, while Evolution Securities believed the Vyvanse patent was sound and therefore would last until its expiration date of 2023. Once more the market was struggling for direction, but just about managed to finish in positive territory. The FTSE 100 closed 11.73 points higher at 5870.14, despite growing fears about a Greek default and the possible knock on effects on the rest of the Eurozone. There was a mixed economic picture, with UK GDP figures coming in much as expected, but weaker than forecast US manufacturing numbers. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:  There were few bright spots for the market today yet it still managed to crawl into the black, but the move higher has hardly been a convincing one. Whilst 5800 remains intact there&apos;s a degree of hope we could head back towards the highs, but a failure to do so could spell trouble for London equities.   A recovery in banking shares helped support the leading index, with Barclays 6.2p better at 271.8p and Royal Bank of Scotland rising 0.85p to 41.29p. Among the miners Antofagasta added 20p to \u00a312.16 after Morgan Stanley raised its recommendation from underweight to equal weight, but commodities trader Glencore marked its first day in the FTSE 100 with a 2.8p decline to 522.2p, compared to its 530p a share flotation price. Rexam rose 5.8p to 385.5p as Credit Suisse raised its target price from 445p to 465p. The bank said:  We believe the market is underestimating the ongoing turnaround at Rexam. With a large share of the revenue growth coming from improved utilization on existing assets, revenue and earnings growth could be achieved with capital expenditure kept at a level close to depreciation. Cash flow should be strong and we see Rexam raising its dividends and possibly also considering share buy backs. We believe increasing return of strong cash flow to shareholders will be greeted positively by the market.   Elsewhere Prudential added 4.5p to 719p despite a negative note from Nomura. The bank said:  We think the market is underestimating how geared Pru is to the US, which now accounts for the majority of its net book value (44%), and how much a likely slowdown in US sales this year could reduce group growth.  Pru has guided that it intends to withdraw some of the more attractive features of its variable-annuity products in order to moderate sales growth this year. We think that this reflects management&apos;s concerns that the US has become too large a part of the group, and is starting to eclipse Asia, which is the focus for Pru&apos;s growth strategy.  The challenge for Pru, in our view, is to navigate a smooth landing as it moderates growth, since its distribution is entirely via third parties, whose support can easily be lost if products are not sufficiently competitive.  We recommend switching out of Pru into Axa which we believe faces the opposite situation from Pru this year, with a likely return to growth, driven by its Asian and US franchises.   But National Grid fell 7.5p to 617p as Deutsche Bank cut its rating from buy to hold. There was another spate of takeover speculation. Soco International jumped 15.6p to 382.7p on talk a national oil company could be interested in the exploration group. After this week&apos;s talk that Nasdaq could be interested in the London Stock Exchange, up 22p to 930p, came the suggestion of possible bids from Singapore or Hong Kong. A price of around \u00a315 a share has been mentioned. A day after being ejected from the FTSE 100 in favour of Glencore, engineering group Invensys added 5.1p to 298.2p as analysts at Collins Stewart tipped it as a possible candidate for a break-up bid. Struggling retailer JJB Sports slipped 1.75p to 24.5p after its full year losses soared from \u00a368.6m to \u00a3181m. The company, which agreed a rescue package with landlords in March and raised \u00a396.5m from shareholders, said a full recovery could take up to five years. Nick Bubb at Arden said the results were &quot;predictably disastrous ...not surprisingly, there is no meeting for analysts today.&quot; Finally Playtech, which supplies online gaming software, put on 25.75p to 333.5p after an upbeat annual meeting statement. The company confirmed it had signed a memorandum of understanding to supply technology to Gala Coral, and said it had decided to buy back up to 10% of its equity, believing the current price did not reflect the underlying value of the company. James Hollins at Evolution Securities said:  We believe that the Gala Coral deal could be worth more than \u20ac5m earnings to Playtech, implying a 5% upside to our current estimates. And there are more deals in the pipeline helped by the acquisition of [software group] PTTS. First quarter trading was good and has accelerated in the first six weeks of the second quarter. This company is on a roll.  The stock has started to recover and should advance today but it is coming off a four-year low and offers plenty of upside. Buy before the company does.

At the end of Frankel&apos;s victory in last month&apos;s 2,000 Guineas, it was not the six-length winning margin that was the focus of discussion but the manner in which he blew away the opposition, an outstanding miler showing the pace of a champion sprinter. Such statements, of course, are largely supposition. For, despite a clause in the race conditions that said runners would have a microchip inserted into their saddlecloths in order for sectional times to be recorded, it didn&apos;t happen. Instead, we have to rely on hand times taken from recordings of the race to stimulate discussion as to how Frankel performed, a situation that racing people in other countries find frankly laughable. In the likes of Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong, where British racing is a popular out-of-hours betting medium, punters are baffled by the lack of proper timing data. That is not to say that British racing is easily comparable to what happens in those countries, where similar tracks lend themselves far more easily to the use of sectional times for horses who turn out time and again at the same venues. But, of all the initiatives embraced by racing in an effort to make itself more accessible, few concepts can be grasped as easily by both the new and old fan of the sport. &quot;Not only does sectional timing allow for immediate comparison between horses, but it also gives historical context,&quot; says Timeform&apos;s Simon Rowlands. &quot;With accurate sectional times, we can find out, not just that Frankel won the 2,000 Guineas, but how and where he won it.&quot; But after the disappointments, there is good news ahead for clockwatchers. A deal has been agreed for Turftrax to supply live timing data for Ascot&apos;s British Champions Day fixture on 15 October. &quot;We weren&apos;t able to finalise things financially in time for Newmarket but, with the support of the series sponsor, Qipco, timing data will be available at Ascot and hopefully we can look to expand that in 2012,&quot; said Rod Street, chief executive of Racing Enterprises, which looks after the sport&apos;s commercial interests. Furthermore, At The Races remains keen to introduce sectional timing to its output in 2012 for all-weather racing at Lingfield, Southwell and Wolverhampton, if the necessary funding can be arranged. &quot;It&apos;s still very much on the agenda,&quot; said the channel&apos;s executive producer, Rob Dakin. &quot;It&apos;s quite a lump of money needed to get it off the ground with installation of the equipment, but SIS are prepared to back it financially and it was disappointing that, when we went to Racing For Change at the start of the year, we didn&apos;t get the support. It sometimes seems like very little has been done for racing&apos;s existing audience, compared to the new followers the sport is trying to attract. &quot;I&apos;m going to go back to them, as we&apos;re still committed to it, but I&apos;d love to hear from anyone else who can help us get over the line.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/may/26/exam-boards-fined-substandard-qualifications", "sentences": ["&quot;What we hope to get is a better understanding as to what the perception is and what the reality is.&quot; Stacey said the regulator would be looking closely at qualifications offered in Singapore, South Korea and Finland, among others."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-26T14:16:25Z", "title": "Exam boards may be fined over substandard qualifications", "tags": ["Education", "Schools", "GCSEs", "Regulators", "Business", "Vocational education", "Further education", "Students", "Higher education", "Exams"], "article": "Exam boards could be fined for offering second-rate qualifications, the government&apos;s exam standards regulator for England has warned. Glenys Stacey, the Ofqual chief executive, said it was &quot;unusual&quot; that the regulator did not have the right to impose financial penalties and spoke of the need for penalties as well as incentives for boards. The education bill going through parliament gives Ofqual greater powers to hold exam boards to account, but new legislation would be needed before it could fine them. The regulator is currently able to de-register an exam board and prevent it from offering qualifications, but the bill would gives it an extra responsibility to ensure that England&apos;s examinations and qualifications keep pace with its international competitors. Stacey told the Guardian that Ofqual may &quot;find that our range of powers needs augmenting in some way&quot;. &quot;All regulators want the greatest range of tools and you&apos;d expect us to be seeking those. We are intent on working the tools we have in earnest, it&apos;s whether a fining option has a particular place,&quot; she said. &quot;There may be a place for fining ... we will be exploring this with government.&quot; However, Stacey added that Ofqual was working with exam boards, rather than &quot;plotting against&quot; them. In March, a government-commissioned report into vocational courses-said thousands of students were gaining qualifications did not lead to jobs or further training. Professor Alison Wolf, an expert in public policy, found that while there were some worthwhile apprenticeships in building and manufacturing, and hairdressers&apos; training was of a good standard, there was a raft of courses &quot;that do not do people any good&quot;. Stacey said Ofqual, which was established as an independent non-ministerial government department a year ago, was developing a &quot;harder-wired&quot; stance so that exam boards were at &quot;the level we prescribe and we have real certainty about what they prescribe&quot;. She spoke of the need for &quot;carrot and stick incentives&quot; so that qualifications were &quot;at the line or above it&quot;. &quot;Regulators have to earn their stripes. They don&apos;t seek to be liked, but they seek to be respected,&quot; Stacey said. &quot;The regulator is planning to hold discussions over whether standards have fallen, risen or been maintained with exam boards and others &quot;close to the issue&quot;. The regulator&apos;s chief executive said it faced a challenge in changing the view that exams were getting easier. &quot;There is a public perception that things aren&apos;t what they used to be. As a regulator we need to get under the skin of that,&quot; she said. &quot;What we hope to get is a better understanding as to what the perception is and what the reality is.&quot; Stacey said the regulator would be looking closely at qualifications offered in Singapore, South Korea and Finland, among others. Last July, Ofqual said a science GCSE that almost 500,000 pupils took was too easy. In some cases, pupils had to gain fewer than half the available marks to be awarded an A grade, and only six out of 30 marks for a C. Students were not given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge of scientific concepts. Earlier this week, a report by Ofqual showed that the number of A-level and GCSE qualifications taken in England, Wales and Northern Ireland fell by almost 6% last year, while Diplomas, BTECs and City &amp; Guilds courses shot up by 11%."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/26/ubs-may-move-investment-bank-to-uk-to-avoid-swiss-capital-regime", "sentences": ["According to sources quoted in the Wall Street Journal, Swiss financial regulators want UBS either to hold sharply higher amounts of capital, or to ringfence its investment banking operations against default by moving them to a rival jurisdiction such as London, Singapore or New York."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-26T18:07:16Z", "title": "UBS may move investment bank to UK to avoid Swiss capital regime", "tags": ["UBS", "Banking", "European banks", "Basel III", "Regulators", "Switzerland", "Europe", "World news", "Business"], "article": "UBS could move the headquarters of its investment bank to London to avoid tough capital requirements being planned by the Swiss authorities, according to reports in the US. A move to London from its Zurich headquarters would allow the bank to minimise the capital it keeps to protect against a repeat of the near collapse it suffered in 2008. UBS was a major buyer of mortgage-backed securities based on sub-prime mortgages, which suffered huge losses in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse in the US. According to sources quoted in the Wall Street Journal, Swiss financial regulators want UBS either to hold sharply higher amounts of capital, or to ringfence its investment banking operations against default by moving them to a rival jurisdiction such as London, Singapore or New York. Regulators have already indicated they need to charge an extra levy on UBS and the other main Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, to protect local taxpayers from a default. The banks, considered &quot;too big to fail&quot; by the Swiss government, must either sharply increase the amount of assets they keep as an insurance policy to 19% of lending, or move some or all of their operations to a financial centre with less stringent regulations. Plans to demolish part of the Broadgate complex in the City to make way for a new home for UBS&apos;s main investment bank operations has fuelled speculation that the bank is considering a fundamental move from Zurich. All major banks are lobbying hard to make sure that their local regulator minimise capital requirements. An agreement by banking regulators under the Basel III accord insists that banks conform to minimum capital requirements by 2019. But earlier this week, the European Union&apos;s internal market commissioner, Michel Barnier, stepped into the debate by warning of the potential downside from adopting rigid rules based on Basel III. Barnier fears European banks could become uncompetitive if they are forced to adopt higher capital rules than rival banks in the US or Asia. The Swiss authorities are also known to be concerned at the effect of draconian regulation on the country&apos;s banking industry, but believe they have little choice when faced with the cataclysmic possibility of another collapse. UBS said it was considering different ways to cope with new regulations, but ruled out spinning off its investment bank, saying that part of the business was integral to its future. A spokesman also pointed out that Swiss law prevented a break-up of the bank. He said: &quot;There are no easy solutions to circumvent tough Swiss regulation, in our view.&quot; Around Sfr 100bn (\u00a370.5bn) of the investment bank&apos;s balance sheet is funded through retail deposits and savings in its wealth management business. The spokesman said: &quot;To ensure a full ring-fencing of the investment bank under a Swiss holding structure, insolvency law would also have to be changed as current laws apply an enforced solidarity.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/26/ubs-speculation-leave-switzerland", "sentences": ["Singapore is so small that a move there would be pointless \u2013 state support could not be relied upon in a crisis."], "publicationDate": "2011-05-26T20:02:23Z", "title": "Who wants to give UBS a home for its investment banking arm?", "tags": ["Business", "UBS", "Banking", "European banks"], "article": "It is &quot;pure speculation&quot;, says UBS, that its Swiss regulators are pushing the bank to move its investment banking unit out of the country. Nevertheless, the speculation is intriguing. Switzerland has imposed upon its banks a capital and liquidity regime that is more severe than anything implemented (or to be implemented) in the US, the UK or the rest of the Europe. It has good reason to do so. The balance sheets of UBS and Credit Suisse are alpine in size. Switzerland couldn&apos;t cope with a major collapse \u2013 the last banking crisis was painful enough for Swiss taxpayers, thanks in large part to UBS&apos;s investment\u00a0bank. It is also logical for the Swiss to wish to go further than mere capital and liquidity improvements. Big banks attract and manage big risks. In a full-blown crisis, nobody really knows how much capital is enough to keep banks away from taxpayers. But the Swiss authorities, if the report is accurate, are guilty of wishful thinking. It is inconceivable that the UK would want to take responsibility for UBS&apos;s most risky operation on a no-strings basis. We&apos;ve got enough UK banks with huge balance sheets, thanks. Singapore is so small that a move there would be pointless \u2013 state support could not be relied upon in a crisis. That leaves the US on the supposed shortlist.

Organisers hope that the 15-tonne granite obelisk celebrating the work of Copp, the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties, will be erected near the shore close to their wartime base at the Hayling Island sailing club near Portsmouth later this year. Fewer than 200 men, mainly from the Royal Navy and Royal Engineers, served in the unit during the last three years of the war, and between them they won 90 medals, although their work has been little noticed over the past 70 years. Successor units are believed to have been active in the Falklands and Iraq. Robin Walton, a former director of a design school in Portsmouth who is leading the fund-raising operation, said: &quot;It is simply because they were so good at what they did that nobody knows anything about them, but their courageous work undoubtedly saved the lives of thousands of allied servicemen. &quot;I had never heard of Copp until I was asked to produce a booklet about local history attractions and when I did, I thought, bloody hell, why haven&apos;t we done something to commemorate what they did?&quot; The unit was set up in 1942 after the fiasco of the Dieppe landing, to survey future invasion sites more accurately. In that operation, reconnaissance had involved holiday snaps of the beach, and tanks and men had struggled to cross shingle; more than half the Canadian and British troops became casualties and 96 aircraft, 33 landing craft and a destroyer were lost. Copp trained teams to be sent ashore in enemy territory secretly at night to assess landing places and lay beacons. Naval officers assessed the gradients of beaches and Royal Engineers took sand samples to check sites were firm enough for tanks.

Then a young navy lieutenant, he remembers being launched, dressed in an early diving suit, in a canoe from a submarine lying a mile offshore at Gold beach in Normandy in the days before the D-day landing to lay beacons. &quot;It was critically important: it was a long way across the channel, a 10-hour crossing, so you could not afford mistakes. We arrived five days before the landing, went up at night to fix positions, and then returned to the submarines, which remained on the sea floor during the day. &quot;We watched the incredible initial bombardment but we were frankly a bit whacked by that stage and were sent back into the escort convoy. After that the team I was in got sent off to Burma to prepare for the invasion of Singapore, which fortunately we never had to make because of the Japanese surrender.&quot; Booth, a retired farmer, still active in a local choir and on his allotment, said: &quot;It was incredibly hush-hush at the time \u2013 quite critical of course that we did not tell anyone about what we were doing and people did not want to publicise it after the war, so basically no one has heard of us,&quot; he added. &quot;Perhaps we deserve a little publicity now.

He&apos;s quite useful for trying things out on because he&apos;s been in a coma for some years. Well, not strictly a coma, medically speaking; but he&apos;s been living in Singapore, which is like being in a coma. He&apos;s missed things, so he can bring a fresh perspective to them: he comes without prejudice or preconception. So I&apos;m watching Lead Balloon (BBC2) with him. This, the first episode in series four, is his first ever. In the opening scene, Jack Dee&apos;s character, Rick, appears to be reading a suicide note. It is a suicide note, but it&apos;s a suicide note in the novel he&apos;s writing, and the camera pans back to reveal Rick&apos;s wife, Mel (Raquel Cassidy), who he&apos;s reading it to for approval. It&apos;s one of those you-think-it&apos;s-one-thing-but-actually-it&apos;s-something-else gags. To be honest, I kind of knew it was one thing and not something else from the start. There were clues, and I know Rick is too pathetic to seriously contemplate killing himself. I think my GF&apos;s B knew too \u2013 he&apos;s not stupid. No laughs from him yet. But he seems to be engaged and quickly picks up the premise \u2013 comedian-novelist faffs about not doing anything or admitting to himself that his career is not just on but nearing the bottom of the slide while the people around largely ignore him. We soon get to meet some of the other characters \u2013 daughter Sam (Antonia Campbell-Hughes, always the show-stealer for me, and there&apos;s not nearly enough of her in this one), Sam&apos;s BF, Ben (Rasmus Hardiker, also strong), and Magda, the east European cleaner. Magda&apos;s a good character, too \u2013 deadpan, funny. She doesn&apos;t totally convince me as a foreigner, though. At one point she says: &quot;Anyway, I must get on with Hoover.&quot; &quot;Get on with&quot; \u2013 that&apos;s quite a complex phrasal verb she&apos;s using; so how come she can do that but has no grasp of either the definite or the indefinite article? Obviously an English person (Anna Crilly) pretending not to be English. Perhaps it doesn&apos;t matter; Andrew Sachs \u2013 German-born, then British \u2013 never convinced as a Spaniard, but Manuel was still quite funny. The big news is that the Sunday Times want to do an at-home-with interview with Mel, and Rick has got it into his head that it&apos;s really him they&apos;re interested in. So he practises his lines, and thinks about what he&apos;s going to wear, buys some new clothes, including a really horrid cardigan thing. And he thinks maybe a pet will make him look more interesting, so he buys a pig . . . And there it is, 12 minutes in, the first laugh from my GF&apos;s B, Singapore boy over there. Now you could say that that&apos;s because he takes after his sister in his lack of sophistication. Or you could say \u2013 and I think this would be fairer \u2013 that it&apos;s because it&apos;s actually the first funny thing that&apos;s happened. For all Jack Dee&apos;s hard work at midlife angst, disappointment and disillusionment, the first (pot?) belly laugh goes to the pig, simply because it&apos;s a funny-looking animal in an unusual situation (the front seat of an Audi). From then on, he \u2013 GF&apos;s B \u2013 and me too, to be honest, are reasonably happy, chortling away whenever the pig appears. Clive, the annoying nosy neighbour, turns up and says his mother is convinced Rick&apos;s got a pig in the house. &quot;What? A pig?&quot; says Rick incredulous. &quot;What would I be doing with a pig?&quot; And it goes on and on, you know exactly where it&apos;s going, and it gets there eventually \u2013 the pig appears, on the doorstep next to Clive, munching on something. And we laugh, both of us, not because of Rick&apos;s line (&quot;Oh, hang on, maybe she saw this pig&quot;) or because of the look on Clive&apos;s face, but because of the look on the pig&apos;s face. My worry is that when you take the pig out of the equation, and out of the house \u2013 which is what&apos;s going to happen now \u2013 the laughs will go with it. It&apos;s become a bit too predictable, too old-fashioned sitcom, too gentle, too unanarchic. My GF&apos;s B is kinder about Dee, but broadly speaking agrees, and he&apos;s coming into it from a coma, so to speak. He&apos;s never seen \u2013 or even heard of \u2013 The Inbetweeners, The Thick of It, (the underrated) PhoneShop; he doesn&apos;t even know what we can do comedy-wise in this country, or what funny is now.

He was primarily a painter, but since his death thousands of these sculptures have been retailed under his name, making fortunes for the sellers. Art insiders estimate that continued control of the Dal\u00ed sculpture trade is worth at least \u00a360m to the rights owners. But a Guardian investigation has revealed growing concern among experts and the art market. One dealer says: &quot;Those in the know call these sculptures &apos;Almost Dal\u00ed&apos;.&quot; The official Dal\u00ed foundation in Spain says it will not offer authentications of any sculptures, and wants to mount an investigation of the whole business. A variety of offshore entities promote the sculptures through impressive-sounding exhibitions, colourful websites and glossy literature. They include IAR Art Resources, a Cyprus-registered corporation; a foundation based in Liechtenstein; and a Swiss foundry. Other companies involved are called Camblest, Jemelton and InterArt Resources. But behind much of this facade is a single figure, a millionaire international entrepreneur, the Italian art dealer Beniamino Levi. He says he purchased a number of rights from Dal\u00ed&apos;s former manager, Enrique Sabater, as well as signing some contracts with Dali while he was alive. The sculptures that Levi manufactures and sells were not, however, actually made by Dal\u00ed. Many are now being produced, in &quot;editions&quot; of sometimes more than a thousand at a time, years after the painter&apos;s death. They are based on images in Dal\u00ed pictures, but it is often unclear what role, if any, the painter played. Alice in Wonderland, for example, is on sale both in the 4.5-metre version and a smaller one-metre size, priced at \u00a319,500. In the Moor House catalogue they are described as &quot;conceived in 1977&quot;. In the price list, it is disclosed that the large Alice is in fact one of a series of eight, all identical. The smaller figure comes, it says, in a far bigger &quot;limited edition&quot; of 350. This itself turns out to be far from the whole story. The small print in the catalogue makes a number of further carefully worded statements. The edition of 350 turns out to be a potential mass production of more than 1,000, in shades of blue, green or brown, because &quot;the sculpture . . . is cast in three separate editions, each with a different patina&quot;. The Alices were not originally made in 1977 as the unwary might imagine. Instead they were &quot;cast at a later date&quot; with an initial piece &quot;first cast in 1984&quot;. The sculptures, the catalogue concedes, might, in fact, have been manufactured as recently as 2005, when the artist was dead for 16 years. Manufacturing can presumably continue into the future, as long as the market will bear it. The Guardian observed sales staff assuring potential buyers that Dal\u00ed made the original wax models, or maquettes, for such sculptures with his own hand. But scrutiny of the small print reveals that this is not necessarily so. When challenged, Levi admits such claims are sometimes a &quot;mistake&quot;. Some particularly artful phrasing in the catalogue claims only that the sculptures come from moulds &quot;originating in the artist&apos;s lifetime&quot; that are &quot;realised from&quot; an original artwork by Dal\u00ed. Buried in a technical description, it is said that the model to be cast can be first created by the foundry artisan and that a two-dimensional drawing &quot;can form the basis for the sculpture&quot;. In fact, the Alice in Wonderland statues appear to be simply clumsier 3D versions of a Dal\u00ed design that first surfaced in 1977 on a tapestry. This depicts Alice on a geometric background. There, she throws a strong shadow, and has a slightly different headpiece. But the run of Alice sculptures clearly come from a sketch of this design, rather than a wax or plaster maquette made by Dal\u00ed&apos;s own hands. According to two proffered &quot;certificates of authenticity&quot;, these Alice sculptures were &quot;authorised by written contracts signed by the artist or the artist&apos;s [un-named] legal representative&quot;. One certificate is signed by IAR Art Resources Ltd of Cyprus and the other by Perseo SA, a foundry in Mendrisio, Switzerland. According to Swiss company records, both are controlled by Beniamino Levi himself. Levi will not reveal the contents of the actual contracts, nor the records of the total number of statues his foundry has turned out. The Modern Masters Gallery in London, which currently sells the sculptures, and is planning to market more at Henley Festival this July, is in turn run by a subsidiary of Levi&apos;s private company, IAR Art Resources. The &quot;Almost Dal\u00ed&quot; trade, which has several rival publishers but is dominated by Levi, is immensely profitable. One dealer, who asked to remain anonymous, estimated that it would cost Levi no more than \u00a31,000 a time to have a foundry manufacture one of the bronzes subsequently priced at more than \u00a325,000. Levi&apos;s displeased reaction suggests this estimate is not too wide of the mark. He says: &quot;You know how much it cost Jeff Koons to do the sculpture he sold for \u00a320m? \u00a33,000! So why you asking me this question?&quot; According to insiders, a wealthy South African property developer once purchased an entire run of 29 statues to which Levi has rights, when they were on display on London&apos;s South Bank. Carlos Slim, one of the world&apos;s richest men, also splashed out on 38 of Levi&apos;s Dal\u00ed sculptures in 2008, via a Florida dealer, Robert Priess of R&amp;R Bond Gallery, to stock a large museum the Mexican telecoms tycoon has personally constructed in Mexico City. Perhaps as a result of such transactions, the octogenarian Levi, along with his New York-based art dealer wife, has a sumptuous residence on Ibiza, as well as his house in Switzerland. Levi presents himself primarily as a philanthropist in his publicity material. He is president of the Stratton Foundation, registered in the secretive tax haven of Liechtenstein. This is, he says, &quot;a non-profit organisation dedicated to promotion of culture and the arts&quot;. However, the official Salvador Dal\u00ed Foundation, based in Spain, takes a dim view. Its head, Joan Manuel Sevillano, whose organisation sells its own lines of Dal\u00ed merchandise, describes the swelling sculpture trade as &quot;a vast illusory world&quot; of over-priced pieces of dubious artistic merit. &quot;Promoters of sales of thousands of multiple editions of Dal\u00ed sculptures are living in another world,&quot; he says. &quot;There is a grey area around Dal\u00ed sculptures. A lot of material Dal\u00ed authorised through licensing, or contracts, were based on drawings by him \u2013 but often were not created by him.&quot; These multiples, he says, &quot;are being marketed as a commercial exercise, very similar to luxury merchandising. You look at a sculpture and you don&apos;t know what you are seeing \u2013 is it one out of 10, or 300 in three different patinas, so it&apos;s 900? And did Dal\u00ed make it or not, or is it made by a third person with Dal\u00ed&apos;s permission or not?&quot; Sevillano says some of the pieces that Levi puts on show cannot be classified as works of art. &quot;These are commercial sculptures, made for decorative purposes.&quot; There seems to be little market for them at major auction houses. Sotheby&apos;s in New York says only three Dal\u00ed sculptures have been accepted since 2008 and they were unsold. In Sotheby&apos;s London only three sculptures sold in the same period, and Christie&apos;s appears not to deal in such pieces. &quot;Serious collectors won&apos;t touch this stuff,&quot; claims one London-based dealer. Dawn Ades, a leading UK Dal\u00ed scholar and a professor at the University of Essex, says of the sculpture trade: &quot;Dal\u00ed&apos;s name has been exploited, taking advantage of an all-too-gullible public.&quot; She says: &quot;It&apos;s a murky area.&quot; Art historian Dr Elliot King of Colorado College agrees: &quot;When people see an enormous Dal\u00ed sculpture like Profile of Time that was once on display at Kew Gardens, they automatically think the artist was like a Michelangelo, but you have to be clear what these giant sculptures are: figures based on works Dal\u00ed has done. That&apos;s why it&apos;s all very sticky \u2013 the number of editions that are made and the different patinas. Which ones Dal\u00ed actually signed, which ones are legitimate, which ones are not.&quot; The Guardian put these allegations to Levi in Paris, where he was presiding at his Dal\u00ed exhibition between trips to Ibiza and Switzerland. He said of the Dal\u00ed foundation: &quot;They are very jealous. I bought everything before them.&quot; The foundation accepted, he pointed out, that he had legitimate rights to the Dal\u00ed images that he purchased from the painter&apos;s secretary: &quot;I gave a lot of money to Sabater.&quot; He confirmed that the Alice sculpture was based on a drawing, according to rights he bought in 1984 and 1989. &quot;I have a document in French. In 1983 Sabater signed it with Dal\u00ed to have the rights to create the sculptures in different sizes and patinas based on a plaster someone else did, based on Dal\u00ed&apos;s drawings. . . This paper says that this plaster was made in Spain and Italy, and Dal\u00ed approved it. I don&apos;t know: I was not there.&quot; Asked if he could claim to collectors that these sculptures would increase in value, like Dal\u00ed paintings, Levi replied: &quot;If I am honest, I can&apos;t say that, as I can&apos;t say it about the stock market . . . If you like it, buy it. I can&apos;t guarantee anything.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/04/apache-helicopters-strike-libya-targets", "sentences": ["&quot;This gives us a chance to target new targets in a way we weren&apos;t able to do,&quot; he said from Singapore, where he was attending a security conference."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-04T10:50:00Z", "title": "British Apache helicopters strike Gaddafi's forces for first time", "tags": ["Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Nato", "Africa", "World news", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Military", "UK news", "Muammar Gaddafi"], "article": "British army Apache helicopters have attacked Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s troops for the first time, destroying a radar station and a military checkpoint and marking a sharp escalation in Nato Libya campaign. One of the two Apaches came under fire early on Saturday from forces loyal to the Libyan leader near Brega, a strategic oil city close to the eastern frontline, but both returned successfully to HMS Ocean, stationed off the Libyan coast. French Tiger helicopters struck separately, hitting 15 military vehicles and five command buildings at an undisclosed location. The new air operation is expected to strongly boost the morale of the rebels, who have been holding ground in various parts of the country but unable to make strong advances towards Tripoli because better-equipped government forces still hold towns along routes to the capital. The head of the rebel council, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, said: &quot;We welcome any measures that would expedite the departure of Gaddafi and his regime.&quot; Jalil later held talks with the British foreign secretary, William Hague, who flew into Benghazi to further pledge Britain&apos;s backing for the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council. &quot;Britain remains a strong and true friend of Libya,&quot; Hague said. &quot;We could not and did not turn a blind eye when Gaddafi turned his forces against innocent civilians. For as long as Gaddafi continues to abuse his people, we will continue and intensify our efforts to stop him. &quot;We are here as part of a coordinated and strategic approach to Libya \u2013 ensuring that our military, diplomatic and development actions are aligned.&quot; Before the deployment of the Apaches, Nato had relied on jets flying nearly three miles above the ground to target Gaddafi&apos;s military arsenal. But the introduction of combat helicopters, which can fly slower at low altitudes, will give the alliance a key advantage in close quarter fighting, allowing it to pinpoint targets in built-up areas where Gaddafi&apos;s troops are dug in and reduce the chance of what the military terms collateral damage. In a statement, Nato said that the craft would allow it to &quot;track and engage pro-Gaddafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas&quot;. The defence secretary, Liam Fox, said that the use of the attack helicopters was &quot;a logical extension&quot; of Nato&apos;s campaign. &quot;This gives us a chance to target new targets in a way we weren&apos;t able to do,&quot; he said from Singapore, where he was attending a security conference. &quot;What it does show is our willing to use the range of assets we have to keep the pressure up. We will continue with the methods we have to degrade his [Gaddafi&apos;s] command and control, to degrade his supplies.&quot; Nato said that the targets of Saturday&apos;s mission included military vehicles, equipment and forces. Major General Nick Pope, the chief of the defence staff&apos;s strategic communications officer, said the Apaches, equipped with thermal imaging capabilities, used Hellfire missiles and 30mm cannon during the attack. At the same time, Tornados and Typhoon jets struck another military installation in Brega, and two ammunition bunkers in Waddan, in central Libya. &quot;Our understanding of the detailed disposition of Colonel Gaddafi&apos;s forces has been improving in a very satisfactory manner, despite their efforts to conceal themselves,&quot; Pope said. There was no word on casualties. In Tripoli, where jets have been conducting nightly raids on Gaddafi&apos;s military infrastructure, the government offered no comment. The use of the low-flying helicopters does raise the possibility of western forces suffering casualties for the first time in the war. But Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard, commander of Nato&apos;s Libyan operation, said the mission was a success and indicated that the helicopters would be used again. &quot;We will continue to use these assets whenever and wherever needed, using the same precision as we do in all of our missions,&quot; he said. Rebels forces are concentrated in three main areas spread across Libya. In the east, where the revolution started in February, the rebels are trying to push towards west from Ajdabiya. Brega is the next town along the highway. Separately, rebels also control Libya&apos;s third city, Misrata, 130 miles (210km) from Tripoli, as well as several small towns in the western Nafusa mountains range. Gaddafi has become increasingly reclusive in Tripoli as the Nato bombing campaign has intensified. While members of his regime continue to defect, and his diplomatic isolation is near complete, he remains defiant, and has refused to entertain suggestions that he leave power or go into exile. The strikes came after Libyan rebels on Friday won control of four towns in the western Nafusa mountain range, where government forces have besieged and randomly shelled rebel-held areas for months. After weeks of siege, government forces drove about seven tanks and a number of armoured vehicles into Yifran in early May and surrounded nearby Galaa, said Col Jumaa Ibrahim of the region&apos;s rebel military council."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/04/bernie-ecclestone-bahrain-grand-prix", "sentences": ["The 2012 FIA Formula One World Championship calendar: 11 March Bahrain 18 March Australia 1 April Malaysia 8 April China 22 AprilKorea 6 May Turkey * 20 May Spain 27 May Monaco 10 June Canada 17 June United States 1 July Valencia 15 July Great Britain 29 July Germany 5 August Hungary 2 September Belgium 9 September Italy 30 September Singapore 14 October Japan 28 October India 11 November Abu Dhabi 25 November Brazil * Subject to confirmation"], "publicationDate": "2011-06-04T17:15:16Z", "title": "Bernie Ecclestone acknowledges concerns about Bahrain Grand Prix", "tags": ["Bernie Ecclestone", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2011"], "article": "Bernie Ecclestone has acknowledged the reticence of Formula One teams to take part in a rescheduled Bahrain Grand Prix by stating: &quot;Of course they&apos;d rather not be racing in December, but these are unusual circumstances.&quot; Although his comments reference the timing rather than any moral or logistical objections many teams are understood to have.

Following his unannounced visit he said he had seen the &quot;inspiring&quot; hope of many Libyans for freedom. Hague&apos;s visit came in the wake of the first attacks by British Apache helicopters which targeted Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s troops, destroying a radar station and a military checkpoint during a night-time raid. They marked a sharp escalation in the Nato campaign in Libya. Hague and the international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, discussed a political roadmap for Libya&apos;s future with the head of the National Transitional Council (NTC), Mustafa Abdul Jalil. The council is recognised by the UK as the legitimate post-Gaddafi government and has been given significant non-military assistance by the British government. Hague stressed the importance of &quot;developing plans for a competent, inclusive and transparent administration that includes clear civilian control of military and regional representation&quot;. The ministers spoke about British humanitarian assistance, visited a medical centre and laid a wreath at Commonwealth war graves before meeting citizens in Benghazi&apos;s Freedom Square. &quot;We are here today for one principal reason: to show our support for the Libyan people and for the National Transitional Council, the legitimate representative of the Libyan people,&quot; Hague said. &quot;We are here together as part of a coordinated and strategic approach to Libya \u2013 ensuring that our military, diplomatic and development actions are aligned.&quot; Renewing calls on Gaddafi to go, he said the dictator was &quot;isolated internationally and domestically&quot; and &quot;continues to abuse human rights without mercy or compunction&quot;. Hague added: &quot;Of course we all want a political, not a military, solution to any conflict, including this one. But that is only possible if Colonel Gaddafi will go. &quot;You only have to talk to the people here, see the graffiti that is written on all the walls, listen to anybody in the street, to realise that there isn&apos;t a political solution that involves Gaddafi still being at the head of Libya.&quot; Mitchell announced new British support for the clearance of mines in Misrata, Benghazi and other affected areas to help ensure the safety of 200,000 people. Of the 4,000 wounded people that have been treated in Misrata alone so far, more than 400 have reportedly required limb amputations, according to the Foreign Office. The British office in Benghazi is now the largest in north Africa after Cairo. After the talks, Hague wrote on Twitter: &quot;In Malta, returning from Benghazi. The work and hope of many Libyans for freedom is inspiring, as I&apos;ve now seen for myself.&quot; Earlier, one of the two Apaches came under light-arms fire from forces loyal to Gaddafi near Brega, a strategic oil city close to the eastern frontline. Both helicopters returned undamaged to HMS Ocean, stationed off the Libyan coast. French Tigre and Gazelle helicopters struck separately, hitting 15 military vehicles and five command buildings at an undisclosed site. The new air operation is expected to boost the morale of the rebels and may help break the military stalemate. Four months into the conflict, rebel forces are holding their ground in various parts of the country but have been unable to make strong advances towards Tripoli because better-equipped government forces still hold towns along key routes to the capital. As part of its mission to protect civilians, Nato has relied on jets flying nearly three miles above the ground to target Gaddafi&apos;s command centres and military arsenal, especially weapons and vehicles deployed in open areas. But the introduction of combat helicopters, which can fly more slowly at low altitudes, will give the alliance a key advantage in close-quarters fighting, allowing it to pinpoint targets in built-up locations where Gaddafi&apos;s troops are dug in and to reduce the chance of what the military terms &quot;collateral damage&quot;. &quot;This is an escalation in support of the civilians Gaddafi is persecuting,&quot; said Lieutenant Colonel Jason Etherington, commanding officer of 4 Regiment, Army Air Corps. He added: &quot;This is all part of a campaign to step things up. We are stepping things up, bringing another capability for protection of civilians.&quot; In a statement, Nato said that the craft would allow it to &quot;track and engage pro-Gaddafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas&quot;. But the move also signals the strong intent, especially from Britain and France, to prevent the conflict from dragging on for many more months. The defence secretary, Liam Fox, said that the use of the attack helicopters was &quot;a logical extension&quot; of Nato&apos;s campaign. &quot;This gives us a chance to target new targets in a way we weren&apos;t able to do,&quot; he said from Singapore, where he was attending a security conference. &quot;What it does show is our willingness to use the range of assets we have to keep the pressure up.

One of the Apache pilots, an Army Air Corps officer based at Wattisham, in Suffolk, who has also served in Afghanistan, said that as they hit the military checkpoint, they came under &quot;a direct threat&quot;. &quot;We had made sure that we were looking at a definite military target, rather than a civilian one, and we took out the threat,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of our pilots have experience of Afghanistan and of course we are facing something completely new in Libya. There is always a degree of trepidation, but the Apache provides us with great protection and brings us safely back home.&quot; The deployment of the low-flying Apache helicopters, which have been used extensively in Iraq and Afghanistan, raises the possibility of western forces suffering casualties for the first time in the war. Nonetheless Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard, commander of Nato&apos;s Libyan operation, indicated that the helicopters would be used again. &quot;We will continue to use these assets whenever and wherever needed, using the same precision as we do in all of our missions,&quot; he said. The decision to send four British Apache helicopters to Libya was made by David Cameron on 27 May. Their deployment via HMS Ocean means there should be less chance of civilian casualties in operations that previously relied on the use of Tornado and Typhoon aircraft. Rebel forces are concentrated in three main areas spread across Libya. In the east, where the revolution started in February, they are trying to push towards the west from Ajdabiya. Brega is the next town along the highway, and Nato hopes that the helicopter attacks may weaken loyalist defences to the extent that the rebels can push through. Separately, the opposition forces also control Libya&apos;s third city, Misrata, 130 miles (210km) from Tripoli, as well as several small towns in the western Nafusa mountain range. Gaddafi has become increasingly reclusive in Tripoli as the Nato bombing campaign has intensified. While members of his regime continue to defect, his diplomatic isolation is near complete, with China holding initial talks with rebel representatives this week. Yet Gaddafi, who has ruled since 1969, remains defiant, and has refused to entertain suggestions that he leave power or go into exile. Nato&apos;s involvement in Libya stems from the UN security council resolution authorising all necessary measures to protect civilians in the country under threat of attack."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/05/talksport-here-come-the-boys", "sentences": ["We were in Singapore for the Olympic bid, and our show was cancelled because of the London bombings, so we had the afternoon off.", "And I went out to the pool and he was there having a massage, saying to the waiter, &apos;I want you to bring me two Singapore Slings, pal."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-04T23:02:01Z", "title": "TalkSPORT: Here come the boys", "tags": ["TalkSport", "Sport radio", "Media", "Radio", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Sport"], "article": "After a couple of days of listening to talkSPORT&apos;s output, there&apos;s an awful lot of things I know. Things I never thought I&apos;d ever need to know. That I didn&apos;t previously realise I didn&apos;t know. And that I now wonder if there&apos;s any way I can de-know. Because to tune into 1089/1053 AM is, basically, to take a crash course in blokeology. For me, a talkSPORT ingenue, it is Bloke-ish for Beginners, with the presenters leading me into alien territory (football, basically, but so minutely dissected that they could be talking about hare coursing or trout tickling); while the advertisements open up a world of products I didn&apos;t even know existed, much less ever imagined wanting. At the start of the day, for example, I have no opinions, really none, on West Ham. Twenty-four hours later, I know so much about Avram Grant I feel like I may once have been married to him. I have learned that if you want 18-mil, cell four MDF, Selco, &quot;Where The Trade Goes&quot;, has opened a new warehouse in Catford. And that Paddy Power is an actual person. Who knew? If I&apos;d given the betting firm any thought at all I&apos;d have assumed it was the kind of name dreamed up by a branding consultancy to convey a sort of quaint, faux-Irish charm. But no. There is an actual Mr Power who&apos;s barely ever out of the talkSPORT schedules. Because betting, like purchasing WD40 and making the household decisions on where to buy tyres, are, it seems, Things Men Do. And because this is the station &quot;For Men Who Love Sport&quot;. &quot;Although, of course, we do have lots of women listeners,&quot; Paul Hawksbee, who co-presents the afternoon show with Andy Jacobs, tells me. &quot;It&apos;s not like the old days where if a female listener rang in, everybody would be like\u2026&quot; he puts on a cave-man voice, and beats his chest: &quot;\u2026WOMAN!&quot; Tuning into talkSPORT is, therefore, to enter a strange, parallel audio universe, but it&apos;s also one that has become the broadcasting phenomenon of recent times. And which has finally been recognised by the industry. Because, last month, the station, which has been around for only just over a decade, operating with a tiny staff on a shoestring budget, won three gold awards at the Sony Radio Academy Awards \u2013 the medium&apos;s equivalent of the Oscars. Not just that, it carried off the top accolade: Station of the Year. It&apos;s the little station that could, the underdog that has gone from being the joke of the radio waves to a commercially successful operation that has put on a million new listeners in a single year. It&apos;s true that it is still referred to, in certain quarters, as &quot;White Van Man Radio&quot;. And, it has a not-entirely-unwarranted reputation for being the station of last resort for the nation&apos;s sexists and reprobates. Its latest star signings are Andy Gray and Richard Keys, freshly disgraced from Sky (where they made off-air comments about the competence of a female linesman); it also boasts George Galloway and Stan Collymore, and it was where Russell Brand made his first radio excursion after Sachsgate. But, even if you know nothing about sport, it&apos;s properly interesting broadcasting. Listening to my first drive-time phone-in, there&apos;s a full-on barney when a West Ham fan goes into meltdown. And then Rod Stewart phones in. &quot;I saw his name flash up on the screen,&quot; presenter Adrian Durham tells me the next day. &quot;And I thought\u2026 It can&apos;t be. And it was!&quot; &quot;I were gutted I missed it,&quot; his co-presenter, ex-England cricketer Darren Gough (aka &quot;Goughie&quot;) says. &quot;But we do get a lot of people phoning in. All the footballers, cricketers, sportsmen, they all listen. I know they do, because that&apos;s how I got into it. I used to listen when I played. And they phone us up. And Brucie, last year, remember that? Bruce Forsyth rang in.&quot; It&apos;s the interaction between the presenters, many of whom are retired professional sportsmen, and the listeners that has somehow made talkSPORT the success it was never quite meant to be. And a large part of that is down to Moz Dee, the former Radio 5 Live editor, who this year won Sony gold award for Station Programmer of the Year. &quot;Moz offered me a job when he came over three years ago,&quot; Danny Kelly, who presents an evening slot, told me. &quot;And I had my doubts because it really wasn&apos;t a great station at the time. But within weeks I loved it. I think of it like a pirate ship. Not a pirate-radio ship. But an actual fireworks-in-the-beard, proper pirate ship. It&apos;s so small and it&apos;s filled with these renegades and ne&apos;er-do-wells who wouldn&apos;t really find a home anywhere else, and the talk just flies. You get these brilliant calls. And they know all the presenters. Properly know them. Any big sporting event, the BBC spends days beforehand setting it all up, whereas talkSPORT turns up a couple of hours before the match in a van that looks like it&apos;s out of The Sweeney, and just starts broadcasting, with the presenters just saying what they think, and somehow it manages to give the listeners a far better flavour of what&apos;s actually going on.&quot; In fact, talkSPORT is a success that&apos;s been built on the back of failure: it was born from the corpse of Talk Radio UK, the deliberately &quot;controversial&quot; station founded by an American company back in 1995. &quot;Which really didn&apos;t work,&quot; says Moz Dee. He should know. Before 5 Live, he was in at the launch of Talk Radio UK, as one of their breakfast-show DJs. &quot;They were trying to recreate what is a very successful format in the United States. Which is talk. And I make a very clear distinction between talk and formatted speech \u2013 which is Radio 5 Live and Radio 4. It was free-flow talk. But no one quite knew what that meant so there were these Americans saying you&apos;ve got to be on the edge, you&apos;ve got to be in people&apos;s faces. I&apos;d come from BBC local radio and we didn&apos;t really know what that meant. Basically, you ended up saying bollocks a lot.&quot; It was, he says, pretty much &quot;mayhem&quot;. &quot;And then Kelvin MacKenzie bought it,&quot; says Moz. Which, of course, is just what an ailing, shock-jock radio station needs: the man who put &quot;Gotcha!&quot; on the front page of the Sun, and who at Live TV gave the world topless darts and the weather dwarves. &quot;He was a fantastically colourful, charismatic personality,&quot; says Moz, diplomatically. &quot;And he has to be credited for the vision. The name, the brand, the concept, they were all his ideas. He was the one who realised it could work for sport. It was a bit of a culture shock, yes. Like firing people on air, when they&apos;ve been on air for an hour, which is what happened to me with Kelvin.&quot; And then, slightly less diplomatically, he launches into a pitch-perfect Kelvin impression. &quot;I was programme director for a wee bit before I went to 5 Live and we&apos;d just started a new presenter and he rang me up and he says, &apos;Who&apos;s that on air?&apos; And I said, &apos;It&apos;s this new round-up of news and sport we&apos;re just starting.&apos; And he said, &apos;I don&apos;t like &apos;em. Get &apos;em off. Get &apos;em OFF!&apos; And I said, OK, listen, I&apos;ll talk to them at the end of the month. &apos;End of the month? End of the fucking month? Fucking &apos;ell. You&apos;ll be going with them end of the month! You&apos;re not getting me, are you son? I want them off! NOW! I don&apos;t want them on ANOTHER MINUTE.&apos; So I had to go in, pull these poor guys off air, God forgive me, put someone else on, and the audience came back after the break and had absolutely no idea what had happened to them. They just vanished.&quot; The station has, he says, quite a lot of &quot;baggage&quot; from the Kelvin years. They now bid and own rights to commentate on Premier League matches, but back then, when it was all sewn up by the BBC, the Kelvin MacKenzie solution to the inconvenient fact of not being allowed into the 2000 European Championships was to report live from a hotel room, somewhere near Euro 2000, where the commentators would be watching the match on the TV. The station has changed, Dee says, &quot;partly by building credibility and \u2013 dare I use this word? \u2013 journalism. Some commentators still look at us and seem to believe we get up every morning, drag ourselves out of a cave, dust ourselves down and get out our microphones.&quot; Why do you call it &quot;dare-I-say journalism&quot;? &quot;Because when you talk about us, people sort of smirk at you when you use those big words.&quot; Later, though, I meet Sean Dilley, talkSPORT&apos;s lobby correspondent. It&apos;s definitely journalism that he&apos;s doing. &quot;There&apos;s so many stories for us,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s so much sport in politics and vice versa. And now of course all the politicians want to come on. Three years ago you couldn&apos;t get them. We were considered &apos;red-neck radio&apos;. Now, we got the last audio interview with Gordon Brown. The first one with Ed Miliband. David Cameron&apos;s coming on later this month. Sport is so popular it&apos;s a religion. If you ignore talkSPORT, basically, you ignore the public.&quot; There&apos;s a pleasingly left-field quality to much of talkSPORT. Chip, Dilley&apos;s guide-dog \u2013 he&apos;s blind \u2013 is let off his lead and bounds around the office, the editorial floor of which is roughly the size and layout of a domestic flat. There&apos;s a kitchen, a lounge area, a handful of desks, and occasionally people wander off in the direction of the bathroom, although it turns out this is actually the studio. It&apos;s here that, in a no-nonsense way, they broadcast to their 3.25 million listeners, a figure that&apos;s up 36% on a year ago. Moz looks less like the bossman-in-charge than the work experience boy. Alice, the press officer, is the most charming press officer in the history of press officers; she&apos;s writing a novel in her spare time. When I&apos;m interviewing the news reporter, Ian Abrahams, universally known on the station as &quot;The Moose&quot;, he says something and then adds, &quot;Am I all right to say that?&quot; to Alice. She shrugs. &quot;Say whatever you want!&quot; And then there&apos;s Alan Brazil, the Glaswegian ex-top-flight footballer, who now co-hosts the breakfast show. He&apos;s done the job for 11 years. &quot;I&apos;m not one of those people who can watch EastEnders and then go to bed,&quot; he says. He hasn&apos;t really slept in a decade, but his lifestyle has now become part of the show. Kelvin MacKenzie sacked him twice, the second time when he got roaring drunk at the Cheltenham Gold Cup, slept through his alarm call and failed to turn up for his programme. But the listeners lobbied for his return and ever since he&apos;s simply regaled them with tales of his nights on the town. &quot;He has an astonishing constitution,&quot; says Ian Abrahams. &quot;Sometimes he hasn&apos;t even slept. And yet he gets in, that light goes on, and bang, he&apos;s there, and he&apos;s brilliant.&quot; Do you ever go out drinking with him? I ask. &quot;God, no. I would literally die. We were in Singapore for the Olympic bid, and our show was cancelled because of the London bombings, so we had the afternoon off. And I went out to the pool and he was there having a massage, saying to the waiter, &apos;I want you to bring me two Singapore Slings, pal. Every 20 minutes. D&apos;you hear that? Two. Every 20 minutes.&apos;&quot; Brazil is on air for a solid four hours from 6-10am, and then passes over to Andy Gray and Richard Keys. It&apos;s four months since the pair left Sky and the trauma is still fresh on their faces. I&apos;m trying to be tactful, so I go for what I think is an inoffensive opening question. &quot;Why talkSPORT?&quot; I ask. There&apos;s a pause. &quot;Well, it wasn&apos;t exactly planned,&quot; says Gray. It was, inevitably, a controversial signing. The station has no female presenters. And it bills itself for men who love sport, when of course lots of women do, too. &quot;We don&apos;t have a big sign saying &apos;No Women Allowed&apos;,&quot; Moz Dee tells me. But some of your signings slightly send out that message, I argue. It was for the talent, and their broadcasting experience, that he hired them, Dee says. That and their contacts. And it&apos;s true that footballers take their calls. And, in return, there&apos;s almost a puppy-like gratitude for being given a second chance. Being sacked by Sky &quot;is not something I really want to talk about,&quot; says Gray. &quot;It was a horrendous time in my life. It was a horrendous time in my family&apos;s life. What we were put through. And as far as I&apos;m concerned it&apos;s gone now. This has been fantastic rehabilitation for us both, the station, and the people who work here. And we owe them a huge debt for coming along at a time in our life when we couldn&apos;t have been lower than we were.&quot; It&apos;s quite a heartfelt speech, this. And it&apos;s not the first time I hear it. Mark Saggers, the veteran sports journalist, tells me at length how he was &quot;unceremoniously dumped&quot; by the BBC and he&apos;s just as fervent in his love of talkSPORT. &quot;It&apos;s proper broadcasting! I had eight producers at the BBC. I couldn&apos;t say a\u00a0word without it being approved first. The best thing I was told when I arrived here was &apos;Just be yourself.&apos;&quot; There&apos;s something of the Church of the Second Chance about talkSPORT and the loyalty it inspires. I meet up with Stan Collymore, who&apos;s another 5 Live refugee. Another ex-sportsman with a chequered past. He now does a show with Saggers \u2013 &quot;and we&apos;ve talked about it all,&quot; Saggers says. &quot;Stan&apos;s depression, his dogging, Ulrika. It&apos;s absolutely gripping broadcasting.&quot; Collymore&apos;s somewhat defensive with me. Wary of journalists. Professional but guarded. Radio 5 Live have been trying to lure him back but he&apos;s refused to go. &quot;I just got really fed up of listening to people like David Mellor talking about football. He used to be on BBC 5 Live&apos;s opposite kind of show to the one I do, which is a post-match phone-in. 5 Live is very straight down the line, middle-class sports output, whereas most of the footballing public are working class. So I was always listening to guys with these middle-class accents pontificating, and I just felt that there&apos;s not enough Geordies and Brummies and Scousers and Londoners being represented.&quot; It&apos;s a point that isn&apos;t lost on Moz Dee. He comes from an Irish family, grew up in the Midlands, became an actor as a teenager, appearing in several David Puttnam films, and then set up his own theatre company and wrote plays before stumbling into radio. But he also worked with his dad on the building sites. &quot;And some of the wisest men I&apos;ve ever met have been in the back of a van. Who have properly lived life and who have a real insight into what life is like. So it does make me angry when people say, &apos;White Van Man. Flag of St George out the back. And a load of blokes, going Phwoar!&apos; I never once saw that happen!&quot; Football has broken out of its ghetto. It&apos;s now the sport of brickies and prime ministers (Cameron claims to be a Villa fan, although Sean Dilley tells me he&apos;s checked Hansard and in 2001 he definitely wasn&apos;t). And talkSPORT has finally, perhaps, emerged from its ghetto, too. In the &quot;creative&quot; department where they make the programme trails and talkSPORT ads, I ask Peter Gee, the head of creative, who the audience is. He replies: &quot;He&apos;s called Stan. And he lives in Walthamstow.&quot; Or at least, he was. That was the joke for years. &quot;But now we&apos;ve also got Crispin from Winchester and Tristan from Islington.&quot; More than half the audience are ABC1s, Ford sponsors the breakfast show, &quot;and we&apos;ve got all sorts of solid blue-chip advertisers&quot;. &quot;Still,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;d never realised quite how many builders&apos; warehouses there are in Catford.&quot; &quot;Oh yes,&quot; says Peter. &quot;My mate Stan goes there. But actually, so does Tristan from Islington. It&apos;s Everyman radio. It really is. And I think it always has been. It&apos;s just taken the world a little while to catch up.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/05/lou-rhodes-lamb-interview", "sentences": ["The six comeback gigs they agreed to do in 2009 mushroomed into 33 shows, taking them to Singapore and Australia, and their show at Manchester Cathedral last month sold out in less than a day."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-04T23:05:00Z", "title": "Lamb: 'We made a huge leap of faith'", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Folk music", "Drum'n'bass", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "My first encounter with Lamb takes place by the boot of their manager&apos;s car. I have just arrived at Lou Rhodes&apos;s home in rural Wiltshire and, once I&apos;ve said hello to Rhodes and Andy Barlow \u2013 she does the lyrics and vocals, he programs the music \u2013 it&apos;s time to knuckle down and do some work. The car boot is full of boxes to be carried into Rhodes&apos;s kitchen. Each box contains deluxe vinyl copies of Lamb&apos;s first new album in seven years, which the duo will presently sign. As I totter down the steps under a cargo of earthy folk and intricate electronica \u2013 the band&apos;s signature musical blend \u2013 Barlow shoots me an apologetic glance. &quot;This is what it&apos;s like without a major label doing everything for you.&quot; In 1995, on the basis of just three songs, Rhodes and Barlow signed a six-album deal with a subsidiary of Mercury Records. Nine years later, after the release of their fourth album Between Darkness and Wonder, the band fell apart. There were deeper personal reasons for the split, but part of the problem, they say, was label interference. Their bosses wanted them to ease up on the tricky beats and melancholy lyrics and sound a little more like Dido. Now, after a five-year separation, Lamb are back together, and this time they&apos;ve decided to go it alone. That means doing everything themselves, from funding the recording process, to doing the album artwork, to setting up their own live shows \u2013 and ferrying vinyl from their manager&apos;s car. We stow the boxes in Rhodes&apos;s apartment. Since the break-up of her marriage to percussionist Crispin Robinson in 2004, Rhodes has favoured communal living, and she and her two sons share this building, an enormous old country pile near Bath, with several other families. Barlow, by contrast, lives alone on a remote hilltop outside Brighton. They are an odd pairing. Rhodes, who is in her mid- 40s but looks much younger, is breezily stylish in a silky black top and a flowing wool cardigan. Barlow, 35, wears a green camouflage jacket and bulky jeans. He seems to fulfil a younger brother role in the partnership, and his remarks, over lunch at the local pub, provoke a few older-sisterly raised eyebrows. They met through a mutual friend on the Manchester music scene. Rhodes was a photographer with a background in folk music. Barlow was a sound engineer obsessed with drum&apos;n&apos;bass. &quot;We were polar opposites,&quot; says Rhodes, but in spite of their differences they decided to collaborate. &quot;My motives weren&apos;t entirely honourable,&quot; Barlow confesses. &quot;I thought she was really hot, and maybe if we were in a band together we could get it on. But we never did, thank God.&quot; On record, their divergent interests fitted together unexpectedly well, and their self-titled debut album won the band a loyal following. On a personal level, however, they suffered from &quot;yin-yang abrasions&quot;, as Barlow puts it. &quot;How Lamb works is we take each other out of our comfort zones,&quot; he explains \u2013 but after nine years they were getting on each other&apos;s nerves. Family matters added to the strain. &quot;When we were touring before we split,&quot; Rhodes says, turning to Barlow, &quot;you were the party animal and I had young babies with me. I&apos;d try to take them somewhere on the tour bus that wasn&apos;t full of fag-ends and empty bottles and the general debris of rock&apos;n&apos;roll. It was pretty intense at times.&quot; After the split, Barlow became a father for the first time \u2013 he travels to Dublin regularly to see his three-year-old son \u2013 and Rhodes believes this has strengthened their friendship. &quot;Having a kid makes you grow up real quick and knocks a lot of stuff out of the way,&quot; she says. &quot;I think we relate to each other differently as a result.&quot; &quot;Kids aside,&quot; says Barlow, &quot;I think something&apos;s happened with us where we don&apos;t allow ourselves to wind each other up. We understand that we&apos;re different now and we enjoy that. I remember thinking, if it wasn&apos;t for Lamb I wouldn&apos;t actually hang out with Lou. Now I want to hang out with her.&quot; The product of their reconciled differences is a strong fifth album, simply called 5, which should please their existing fans and win over some new ones. Their ambition was to return to the raw, stripped-back feel of their debut, and they follow this through on tracks such as &quot;Strong the Root&quot; and &quot;Build a Fire&quot;, a guitar-heavy number inspired by Barlow&apos;s recent trip to the Burning Man festival in Nevada. &quot;Rounds&quot;, meanwhile, is a nod to the dreamy analogue sound Rhodes has been cultivating in her solo career. On the new album she decided not to sing about romantic love, her default subject matter in the past. Instead, she takes on grief, the limits of language and, on &quot;Wise Enough&quot;, the future of humanity. If the pair were worried about being forgotten by their fanbase, their anxieties were soon laid to rest. The six comeback gigs they agreed to do in 2009 mushroomed into 33 shows, taking them to Singapore and Australia, and their show at Manchester Cathedral last month sold out in less than a day. To ensure that the new album got made, 2,500 Lamb enthusiasts pre-ordered it, raising around \u00a330,000. &quot;It was a huge leap of faith for us and the fans,&quot; Barlow says, &quot;but I think it&apos;s good to live a little more on the edge like that.&quot; Now, rather than fielding the whims of label bosses, Lamb answer directly to fans. If it means leaps of faith and some heavy lifting now and then, it&apos;s a price they seem happy to pay. 5 is out on Phantom Domestic.

The warning comes as US airlines prepare to launch a legal challenge against the ETS in Luxembourg next month, adding to unease from the Russian and Chinese governments. From January carriers flying in and out of the European Union must join power companies in the EU in the cap-and-trade system, where they will have to acquire carbon credits to account for the emissions generated by their flights. Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s rating agency said return fares could rise by between \u20ac4.60 and \u20ac39.60 by 2020 to offset carbon costs of about \u20ac30 a tonne. However, the Association of European Airlines (AEA) warned that the proposals have yet to secure the backing of non-EU carriers and could spark tit-for-tat trade measures. &quot;If this is not sorted out in the next six months we run the risk of a trade conflict between the EU and third countries,&quot; said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary general of the AEA, whose members include British Airways, bmi and Virgin Atlantic. Speaking at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Singapore, Schulte-Strathaus said some airlines could be forced to cede routes to non-EU carriers because they would not be able to pass extra costs on to passengers. Non-EU carriers, by contrast, will be able to offset the higher costs as the rest of their network will not fly via the EU. Iata, the trade body whose members include British Airways, Air France and American Airlines, said the ETS would would increase annual industry costs by more than \u20ac1bn to Europe&apos;s airline industry expected to make a profit of $500m (\u00a3304m) this year. The worldwide profit, generated by Asian and US carriers, is expected to be $8.6bn. &quot;It makes Europe completely uncompetitive,&quot; said an Iata spokesman, who said airlines already faced an expected rise in fuel bills of $27bn this year. &quot;Whether the airlines can recover it from passengers depends on market conditions.&quot; US airlines will take their legal fight against ETS to the European court of justice next month where they will argue that the system breaches international law. The Air Transport Association of America (ATA) believes that imposing a European scheme on non-EU airlines contravenes various agreements including the Chicago Convention, which regulates the global airline industry. ATA argues that it breaches article 1 of the convention, which states that countries have sovereignty over airlines in their airspace. By that rationale, the EU has no right to tax a carrier flying out of, say, Dubai or New York. The US government has backed ATA, claiming that the scheme takes money away from airlines that could otherwise be invested in greener aircraft and engines. Nicholas Calio, ATA chief and an experienced Washington lobbyist who worked as an aide for President Bush, said a global trading scheme was the best solution. &quot;The legal case is important as a means of addressing what is wrong with the European scheme, but also as an opportunity for us to continue to pursue an approach that is appropriate for this global industry,&quot; he said.

Passengers on European airlines are already facing price increases of up to \u20ac40 (\u00a335) per return fare under the scheme, which carriers must join from January next year. Once they have joined the ETS, carriers will have to pay for carbon dioxide emissions that exceed a certain threshold by acquiring credits. &quot;The uncertainty will add more cost,&quot; said Walsh. &quot;It will add more concern in the mind of travellers that they will face disruption to services and I think there is a real risk this could happen.&quot; Walsh has called for a global emissions trading scheme for airlines and urged the EU to implement a compromise in the meantime.

In a joint letter with the chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, Steve Ridgway, who is also chairman of the Association of European Airlines, Enders warned: &quot;If the EU goes ahead with its plans, China has already ... announced its intention to deploy counter measures against European aviation.&quot; The letter added: &quot;Past experience with the US has\u2009 demonstrated that it will not shy away from retaliatory measures.

But Europe&apos;s climate chief, Connie Hedegaard, told the Guardian she was &quot;standing firm&quot; on the plans, passed by member states two years ago. &quot;This is our legislation, adopted unanimously,&quot; she said. &quot;This is the first time China has mentioned a trade war and retaliation \u2013 if Europe immediately back-tracks, what would that look like? If someone says boo, we do not change our laws \u2013 that would not be serious.&quot; She played down the prospect of a trade war, saying China had already come forward with informal suggestions on bringing in &quot;equivalent measures&quot; to reduce emissions from its airlines, as an alternative to participating in the scheme. Such measures have always been allowed under the EU directive, as a get-out clause for companies reluctant to trade emissions that nevertheless ensures carbon is cut overall. &quot;The whole purpose of this is not to punish anyone but to get ways of handling the growing challenge of emissions from aviation,&quot; said Hedegaard. &quot;There is still time for that dialogue [on whether China&apos;s alternative measures would be enough].&quot; China&apos;s main aviation body backed airlines taking legal action against the ETS, following in the footsteps of US carriers taking a case to the European court of justice next month. &quot;I believe we have to take legal action,&quot; said Wei Zhenzhong, general secretary of the China Air Transport Association. Speaking at the annual general meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Singapore, Wei told Reuters that China remained open to negotiations \u2013 but the situation could escalate into a trade war. Walsh echoed those fears as he urged Brussels to delay plans to charge non-European airlines under the ETS, which will require airlines flying into, out of and within the EU to pay for any emissions that exceed a set cap. According to the Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s rating agency, passengers on European airlines face price increases of up to \u20ac40 (\u00a335) for a return trip by the end of the decade under the scheme, with extra costs of \u20ac1bn for the industry next year alone. Speaking at the Iata conference, Walsh said that if major powers such as China, the US and Russia are forced to pay for carbon dioxide emitted by services to and from the continent, they could block flights by EU carriers in retribution or impose aviation taxes that will have to be passed on to passengers. &quot;It is clear that the countries are going to retaliate, whether in the form of imposing additional taxes on European airlines or restricting access to markets,&quot; said Walsh, whose group owns BA and Spain&apos;s Iberia. &quot;The uncertainty will add more cost,&quot; said Walsh. &quot;It will add more concern in the mind of travellers that they will face disruption to services and I think there is a real risk this could happen.&quot; Walsh has called for a global emissions trading scheme for airlines and urged the EU to implement a compromise in the meantime. Walsh said Brussels should resort to a &quot;plan B&quot; that will charge carriers for regional and domestic flights within Europe only. &quot;There needs to be a plan B. It is unacceptable that airlines face the prospect of retaliation because of the actions of the EU. Plan B for me would be to restrict the scheme to intra-Europe.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/us-fast-track-frequent-flyers", "sentences": ["Speaking at the annual general meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Singapore, Pistole said treating every passenger with the same level of scrutiny was inefficient."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-07T10:44:32Z", "title": "US plans fast-track security checks for low-risk frequent flyers", "tags": ["Air transport", "Airline industry", "World news", "Business", "US news", "Transport", "UK news", "Transport policy", "Politics", "UK security and counter-terrorism"], "article": "Airline passengers in the US could be handed a shortcut through security checks under a government plan to give favourable treatment to low-risk travellers. The plan would allow passengers who agree to supply personal data to US officials to receive a less stringent examination at airport departure lounges. The head of the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), John Pistole, said travellers who supplied information such as frequent flyer details and travel records in advance would pass through security areas more quickly. &quot;We have been working for the last six months in trying to develop a programme that allows us to differentiate between those who are regular travellers and those who are not,&quot; he said. It is understood that a pilot programme could get under way before the end of the year, involving at least one airport but limited to US passport holders or domestic travellers. The trial is likely to be watched closely in the UK, where the transport secretary, Philip Hammond, has pledged to review airport security. Speaking at the annual general meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in Singapore, Pistole said treating every passenger with the same level of scrutiny was inefficient. &quot;We recognise that one size does not fit all.&quot; This week, the IATA unveiled a vision of what the TSA checks could look like, with a &quot;checkpoint of the future&quot; that funnels passengers into three security lanes: enhanced security, normal security and &quot;known traveller&quot;. Passengers are allocated the appropriate lane by an iris-recognition system linked to a government database, with known travellers going via a single, elongated arch through an x-ray check, a metal detector and a check for liquids. Checks that are known to frustrate millions of passengers, such as shoe scans, would be avoided. Stringent security measures in the US are a source of frustration within the aviation industry, with British Airways among the most outspoken critics of a regime that, owing to the sheer size and profitability of the market, has the power to dictate global trends. For instance, the European commission admitted last month that it had been forced to abandon a partial relaxation of the ban on carrying liquids on to planes after pressure from the US government. Sir Martin Broughton, chairman of BA, has warned that the industry is &quot;kowtowing&quot; to American security concerns. In a speech earlier this year he said: &quot;The current procedures have grown, Topsy-like, with each new procedure being superimposed on the existing structure every time there is a new security incident. &quot;Every time, it&apos;s a procedure to stop a repeat of what has already been attempted rather than a programme to prevent the next new attempt by terrorists.&quot; Backing the use of government data to create passenger watchlists, he added: &quot;We need to be using data better \u2013 data that we and governments have.&quot; Also speaking at the IATA, the secretary general of Interpol warned that air passengers were at risk after the theft of 28m passports and national identity cards. Ron Noble said Interpol was concerned that terrorists could slip into countries undetected because governments were failing to share information on stolen identities. &quot;The number one risk confronting airlines and countries around the world is the risk terrorists or other dangerous persons will carry a fraudulent identity document and move from one country to another,&quot; he said. Noble added that last year 40,000 passengers were caught with illegally obtained IDs, with the true number of fraudulent travellers likely to be even higher because of a lack of stringent checks."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/07/donald-hewlett-obituary", "sentences": ["He was later responsible for looking after Japanese prisoners-of-war in Singapore, where he organised entertainment for British troops."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-07T17:29:00Z", "title": "Donald Hewlett obituary", "tags": ["Television", "Comedy", "BBC", "Stage", "Comedy"], "article": "Donald Hewlett, who has died of pneumonia aged 90, was already in his mid-50s and had a long career as a screen character actor behind him when he was cast as Colonel Reynolds, commanding officer of a second world war Royal Artillery concert party, in It Ain&apos;t Half Hot Mum (1974-81). In public, he found people recognising not just his face, but also his voice. While Battery Sergeant Major Williams (Windsor Davies) tried to instil discipline into Bombardier &quot;Gloria&quot; Beaumont (Melvyn Hayes), the singer Gunner &quot;Lofty&quot; Sugden (Don Estelle), the pianist &quot;Lah-de-Dah&quot; Gunner Graham and others, Colonel Reynolds enjoyed the easy life, lounging around, sipping gin and conducting an affair with Daphne Waddilove-Evans (Frances Bennett), whose husband was away in the Punjab. The sitcom was written by the Dad&apos;s Army creators David Croft and Jimmy Perry. Perry himself had taken charge of a concert party while serving with the Royal Artillery during the war. Croft and Perry later gave Hewlett the role of Lord Meldrum in the &quot;upstairs, downstairs&quot; sitcom You Rang, M&apos;Lord? (pilot 1988, series 1990-93). As head of an aristocratic, 1920s family, George Meldrum ran the Union Jack Rubber Company and was a respected member of the gentry \u2013 a position threatened by his extra-curricular activities with Lady Agatha Shawcross (Angela Scoular). It was often left to the butler, Alf Stokes (Paul Shane), to create diversions and cover up the relationship. Despite his wealth, the peer paid his staff badly. Hewlett, who came from a wealthy family himself, was born in Northenden, Cheshire. His father, Thomas, owned the Anchor Chemical Company, based in the Manchester suburb of Clayton. Hewlett was 10 when his mother died. While attending Clifton college in Bristol, he started producing revues. Then, at Cambridge University, where he studied meteorology and geography, he was a member of the Footlights revue. However, his course was curtailed by the outbreak of war, during which he served in the Navy as a meteorologist in Orkney \u2013 providing reports for Lord Mountbatten \u2013 and set up Kirkwall Arts Club in a temperance hall. He was later responsible for looking after Japanese prisoners-of-war in Singapore, where he organised entertainment for British troops. After the war, Hewlett trained at Rada, winning the Athene Seyler award for comedy. He left it to his younger brother, Clyde \u2013 who was later made a life peer for his services to the Conservative party \u2013 to take over the family business. Hewlett started his professional career with the repertory company at Oxford Playhouse, where he soon became a leading man, acting alongside Christine Pollon, whom he married in 1947. He also helped to boost the career of Ronnie Barker, who was working for the theatre&apos;s publicity department. He got chatting to Barker after seeing him sticking up posters, and recommended him for a speaking role in the next production. In 1951, Hewlett and Barker \u2013 in costume \u2013 provided a local spectacle as they shared a pony-and-trap trip around Oxfordshire to promote a production of Charley&apos;s Aunt. Hewlett also toured with the husband-and-wife team of Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert, and appeared in the West End musical Grab Me a Gondola (Lyric theatre, 1956-57) and the revue \u2026 And Another Thing (Fortune theatre, 1960). He made his film debut, alongside Sid James, Tony Hancock and Peter Sellers, in the comedy Orders Are Orders (1954). Although Hewlett subsequently appeared in the school comedy Bottoms Up (starring Jimmy Edwards, 1960), most of his screen career was spent on television. He played Captain &quot;Snooty&quot; Pilkington, son of the retired army officer of the title, in the sitcom The Adventures of Brigadier Wellington-Bull (1959). He then appeared mostly in dramas, including episodes of The Saint (1965), The Avengers (1966) and Callan (1967), as well as the Dennis Potter plays Vote, Vote, Vote, for Nigel Barton (1965) and Message for Posterity (1967). In a 1965 episode of Coronation Street, he was Bob Maxwell, a married solicitor who offered Elsie Tanner a lift, had a heart attack at the wheel and died. He also played Sir George Hardiman in the 1971 Doctor Who story The Claws of Axos. More comedies then came Hewlett&apos;s way, including the regular role of Colonel Sutcliffe in Now Look Here (starring Ronnie Corbett, 1971-73) and Carstairs in the shortlived Come Back Mrs Noah (pilot 1977, series 1978), written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd. Hewlett&apos;s last screen appearance was in a 1995 episode of the sitcom The Upper Hand. The following year, he took to the stage for the last time, alongside Ronnie Corbett, in the pantomime Mother Goose (Churchill theatre, Bromley). Epilepsy, caused by a damaged heart valve, led him to retire and he later developed Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Hewlett&apos;s first marriage ended in divorce, as did his subsequent, 1956 marriage, to Diana Greenwood, a dressage rider. He is survived by his third wife, the actor Therese McMurray, whom he married in 1979, and their children, Patrick and Siobhan; and by two sons, Jonathan and Mark, and a daughter, Sophie, from his second marriage. \u2022 Donald Marland Hewlett, actor, born 30 August 1920; died 4 June 2011"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/07/floyd-mayweather-jr-victor-ortiz-wbc", "sentences": ["The Filipino&apos;s promoter, Bob Arum, claimed on Monday that Mayweather had turned down an offer of $65m (\u00a340m) from &quot;legitimate people in Singapore&quot; to fight Pacquiao."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-07T20:10:00Z", "title": "Floyd Mayweather Jr to fight Victor Ortiz for WBC welterweight title", "tags": ["Floyd Mayweather", "Boxing", "Sport"], "article": "Floyd Mayweather Jr has claimed he will return to the ring on 17 September against the WBC welterweight champion Victor Ortiz. &quot;My fans have been waiting long enough,&quot; the 34-year-old said\u00a0when announcing the fight on Twitter.

How does internationalisation come in? We need graduates from universities that are globally aware and have skills applicable to an inter-connected world and our graduates get those skills from the people they learn from (teachers) and those they learn with (fellow students). This is one important role played by international students and faculty on campus. Having an overseas campus also benefits domestic students: Studying abroad programmes help form internationally aware graduates. For students to be able to attend their university&apos;s own campus is the best way to ensure students get the same quality, a seamless curriculum and sufficient support. This is one of the main reasons why having an overseas campus is so important for universities. Understand why international students pick UK universities: Though the US remains the first choice for the best and brightest international students (with the exception of Oxbridge and Imperial) the UK attracts the &apos;second string&apos; of international students because universities here actively promote themselves through advertising, fairs, agents, local offices, the British Council and so on. It is easier to get a UK visa than US and it is also easier to get admission to a top UK university compared to a top US university which requires students to take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). And international students can work while studying in the UK. But many are put off by the perceived risk of being unable to get a \u00a320K graduate job. Why international students choose a particular university: Reasons include personal contact with the university through international office or an academic. The agent/counsellor they have asked to help them has recommended a particular university. Price; a financial discount can sway a student from a better university to less-renowned one. And finally, a recommendation from alumni. Faculty experience matters: That means more than a conference trips. They have to engage internationally by making their research globally relevant. Taking part in field trips, running short courses or spending time working at an overseas campus also helps. Internationalisation also has implications for career services: When graduates are unable to stay in the UK to find work wither because of visa restrictions or a lull in the job market, the career service of their UK university should assist them in finding work back home as it would British students. In so doing, the university gets a good reputation overseas which helps attract new students and makes industry contacts abroad which opens up possibilities for work placements, internships and research for home students and faculty. India is the greatest opportunity and UK HEIs must learn how to capitalise on that: Over the next decade India needs 1000 new universities, creating 20 million more student places and over a million new faculty positions. UK universities must learn more about India and work out what India needs that their university can provide. That is a pan-institutional activity that should involve establishing an India interest group and an external India advisory board. To ensure that an India-centric internationalisation strategy benefits students, universities must have alumni, students and faculty who have experience of India share that with other students and faculty as well as encourage students to take part in research that relates to India. The main impediments, however, are immigration policy, narrow-mindedness, over dependence on China and the economic disaster that is unfolding across the western world. Richard Yelland, head of division in the Education Directorate of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Paris  To attract international students, British universities must focus on quality and not on price: The UK has good universities but so do other countries and as they increase their efforts to attract international students the focus will increasingly be on what makes a particular institution stand out. The English language is clearly a plus, but quality matters. Or I should say &apos;perceived quality&apos; as we don&apos;t know much about actual quality. The main threat is poor quality: Internationalisation, like higher education itself, is above all an opportunity for students. And like higher education more generally it is an opportunity which too often been restricted to a few who are able to benefit from it. As more are enabled to take that opportunity - whether it is through the Erasmus programme (which enables university students to study for part of their degree in another country), branch campuses, or online tuition, the chief threat - as in any industry - is that a painstakingly built-up reputation can be grievously damaged by one high-profile incident. You cannot guarantee immunity from accident, but you can and must take steps to minimise the risks. That means taking no chances on quality assurance and doing your very best to ensure that every aspect of provision is as good as it can be. Carolyn Campbell, head of networks and partnerships, QAA, the national quality assurance agency for UK higher education. Cross-border education brings new opportunities and access for students but it also presents challenges for our universities: When opening campuses overseas, UK universities have to manage risk and negotiate the local regulatory frameworks, while ensuring comparability in the standards of their degrees no matter how and where delivered. Relevance of the course content is just as important overseas and has to be adjusted - but not by level and standard - to reflect either local or regional contexts. For more than 10 years, QAA has carried out the review of UK HE provision delivered in locations as far away as China, Singapore and India. We publish these reports, such as this overview of UK HE provision in India. Capitalise opportunities and minimise risks: UK universities must be bold and seize opportunities but balance threats with robust quality assurance and management - including due diligence, robust risk management, succession and sustainability planning and effective communication. Most importantly, UK HEIs must keep the interests of students at the forefront, know whether they are satisfied and respond to their concerns. Dr William Lawton, director, the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education, a think tank on cross-border higher education programme delivery China and Malaysia continue attracting foreign HEIs: The British Council had predictedthat the number of international students doing UK degrees outside the UK would outnumber those coming to the UK to study by 2010. They were right and most of that activity is in Asia, particularly in China and Malaysia. UK universities must count the cost of internationalisation: Institutions may want to consider language of provision (as non-English-speaking countries continue to arguably erode one of the main competitive advantages of English-speaking countries), as well as the costs and investments in time to choose wisely \u2013 with reference to partners, area of study, level and so on. Overstretching resources in a climate of constrained government funding is a risky strategy any way you look at it. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The device, which has a 9.7-inch screen, the same size as Apple&apos;s iPad, runs HP&apos;s own webOS operating system inherited from Palm, which HP acquired in mid-2010.  HP&apos;s greatest strength is that it is the biggest seller of PCs to corporations, and so wields enormous power in seeking to sell tablets to the same customers. In that it is likely to vie with RIM, maker of the BlackBerry, with its PlayBook device which runs RIM&apos;s own QNX operating system.  Meanwhile RIM&apos;s 7-inch PlayBook will go on sales from Thursday 16 June, priced at \u00a3399 for a 16GB model. It will be sold through Dixons retail stores, Carphone Warehouse, Best Buy, Insight UK and Phones4U. Apple&apos;s iPad 2 costs \u00a3399 for a 16GB Wi-Fi version, and \u00a3479 for a 32GB version, making the TouchPad exactly price-competitive. A key differentiator though may be how quickly HP can persuade corporate and third-party developers to write applications for its app store. Another challenge is likely to be persuading phone operators to sell the forthcoming HP Veer, a followup to the unsuccessful Palm Pre, which can act as a companion to the TouchPad. The Guardian understands that European operators have been wary of committing to the Veer after the Pre&apos;s disappointing sales performance in 2009. The TouchPad has a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and includes NFC (Near-Field Communications) for interaction with HP smartphones such as the Veer. Preorders will begin on Sunday 19 June, though the company did not say whether that will be through retailers or its own website. No retail partners were announced. The tablet - HP&apos;s first using webOS - will be available in the US, France and Germany from 1 July. Availability is scheduled for &quot;later this year&quot; in Ireland, Spain, Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore.  HP has previously tried to sell Windows-based tablets, even being featured in speeches by Microsoft chief executive at the keynote speech at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. But it has seen little takeup. Now, the company plans to put increasing emphasis on the possibility of webOS to differentiate its products from those of other PC manufacturers: Leo Apotheker, the new chief executive, said earlier this year that a growing number of HP PCs will ship with webOS as a layer running alongside Windows. &quot;What makes HP TouchPad a compelling alternative to competing products is webOS,&quot; said Jon Rubinstein, senior vice president and general manager, Palm Global Business Unit, HP. &quot;The platform&apos;s unmatched features and flexibility will continue to differentiate HP products from the rest of the market for both personal and professional use. This is only the beginning of what HP&apos;s scale can do with webOS.&quot; Rubenstein knows the size of the challenge he is up against: he is the former head of hardware at Apple, and was there when the iPad was being developed, though he left before it was released. \u2022 Motorola shipped 250,000 of its Android Honeycomb-based Xoom tablets in the first quarter of 2011, the company has told the Guardian. The figures indicate the number sent for sale to shops. There are no figures yet on how many have been sold through retail and other channels. Richard Windsor, technology analyst at the brokers Nomura, has estimated that around 100,000 have been sold in the first quarter. Scott Forstall, Apple&apos;s head of iPhone software, said earlier this week that Apple has so far sold 25m iPads - which implies that it has sold around 5.5m already in the first two months of this quarter. That would put this on track to be its best-selling quarter so far, ahead even of the Christmas quarter."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jun/11/sebastian-vettel-canadian-grand-prix-f1", "sentences": ["Alonso said: &quot;It&apos;s been a long time \u2013 since Singapore 2010, in fact \u2013 that I was last on the front row and I am pleased that Felipe is right up close to me."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-11T18:51:15Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel leaves Lewis Hamilton trailing at Canadian Grand Prix", "tags": ["Sebastian Vettel", "Lewis Hamilton", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2011"], "article": "The Formula One world, outside the small and privileged nuclear family that is Red Bull, gave a collective sigh of disappointment as Sebastian Vettel secured his sixth pole position in seven races this season, and the 21st of his exceptional career. The Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve is not considered to be among Red Bull&apos;s favourites and this is where, last year, they failed to win pole for the first time. The German world champion already has a 58-point advantage over the second-placed Lewis Hamilton. If he wins again here, on a track where Hamilton has raced three times and won twice, the current championship will, realistically, be over. This year F1 has introduced melting tyres and DRS \u2013 the adjustable rear wing to help facilitate more overtaking \u2013 and re-introduced KERS. But Red Bull&apos;s hegemony is even more pronounced than before. Even a crash in practice on Friday morning failed to damage Vettel&apos;s car or his confidence sufficiently for the rest to catch up. &quot;Thank you, thank you, thanks for fixing the car on Friday after I stuffed it into the wall,&quot; he screamed when it was all over. &quot;We made up some ground from last year. Now I feel comfortable here.&quot; There is even something a little too familiar about his pole-winning celebrations. Later, he added: &quot;We know this is not our strongest track, we love high-speed corners. But we had the fastest package today so we can be confident. &quot;The runs we had were very confident. Surely it is never easy and it will not be easy tomorrow, like in the last two races. We are ready to fight so we will see what happens tomorrow.&quot; There is rain as well as wind forecast on Sunday, to further promote the possibility of safety cars being used on a circuit which usually provides more than its share of incidents because of its unforgiving nature; mistakes here are cruelly punished. Speaking about the possibility of wet conditions, Red Bull&apos;s team principal, Christian Horner, said: &quot;We&apos;ve gone for a set-up which covers both eventualities. We didn&apos;t expect to get pole here, so it&apos;s a surprise to get it here at one of our weakest circuits. It was a fantastic performance from Seb.&quot; His only disappointment was that Mark Webber could not join Vettel on the front row. He finished fourth, unable to use KERS, a problem which kept him out of the morning practice run. Ferrari&apos;s Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa will be second and third on the grid, encouraged by the knowledge that Red Bull are traditionally stronger in qualifying than in race set-up. Alonso said: &quot;It&apos;s been a long time \u2013 since Singapore 2010, in fact \u2013 that I was last on the front row and I am pleased that Felipe is right up close to me. It means the whole team has worked hard to improve our performance.&quot; It was Ferrari&apos;s best Saturday of the season. But it was a disappointing session for the McLaren pair of Hamilton and Jenson Button, traditionally so strong here, even though their performances were probably compromised by their decision to set up for a wet race; they are fifth and seventh, separated by the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg. It is still a chastening fact that Hamilton won 17 poles between 2007-09, but just once since, at this track last year. &quot;I just want to finish tomorrow and hopefully get some points,&quot; he said. &quot;Vettel&apos;s gone, he&apos;s on his way, they&apos;re very hard for us to catch at this rate, but I&apos;m still positive and hopeful. &quot;I don&apos;t know when we have anything coming but I really hope sometime soon we&apos;ll have something positive come to the car.&quot; Button, two places behind Hamilton, said: &quot;This is a circuit where you can overtake so we&apos;ve got to hope our race pace is a lot better than in qualifying, because we&apos;re a long way off where we expect to be around here.&quot; This old-fashioned track, with long straights, challenging chicanes and slow corners, with lots of tyre wear because of the heavy breaking required, has been to the liking of McLaren, who finished one-two last year, with Hamilton edging home ahead of Button. &quot;This is a circuit where McLaren have always gone bloody well,&quot; Button said. &quot;Monaco really showed that we have a strength on mechanical circuits. We should be good here. Lewis is always very, very fast here. His team-mates have never out-qualified him here. &quot;It was great last year. I really enjoyed the race, fighting with Fernando Alonso and ending up second just behind Lewis.

Sleeves have to be of the right length and sponsors&apos; logos of the correct dimensions. Is it any surprise, then, that Fifa has taken issue with the Iranian FA&apos;s interpretation of a suitable kit for women&apos;s teams? The Iranian national women&apos;s team was banned from a qualifying match for the 2012 London Olympics against Jordan because of the Islamic clothing worn by the players. In Iran, the decision has been criticised by everyone from the head of women&apos;s affairs at the Iranian Football Federation to President Ahmadinejad himself.\u00a0 Discussion around Islamic clothing in international competitions is a recurring issue. In 2010, the Iranian women&apos;s youth team was refused participation in the Youth Olympics in Singapore because of the headscarf. Negotiations between the Iranian Football Federation and Fifa followed, and a compromise was reached where the team was allowed to wear headgear that did not cover the neck, allowing Iran to return to the field. The Iranian team that came out to play in Jordan this year wore the same headgear previously given the green light by Fifa. Ali Kafashian, the head of the Iranian Football Federation, wrote in a letter to Sepp Blatter that Iran had received only one document from Fifa relating to the kit since the 2010 Youth Olympics. That document, received on March 7 2011 (before the game against Jordan) confirmed the agreement between the two parties from the year before. The only addition to the team&apos;s outfit was in fact their shirts, which now covered their necks. It is understandable that some media reports quote &quot;health and safety&quot; as the basis of Fifa&apos;s discontent, while others state that the controversy is because of the prohibition of &quot;religious messages&quot; in the outfits of the players. When it comes to the Islamic headscarf, Fifa is rarely clear on the specifics. Often it cites law four of the laws of the game, which specifies the basic compulsory equipment of players. This law bans dangerous items (such as jewellery) and any equipment that has &quot;political, religious or personal slogans or statements&quot;. Let us ignore for a moment that the law specifies &quot;slogans or statements&quot;, and include in that category (for the sake of argument) any item that has some religious significance. It should be mentioned that covering the body, in this case with the shirt, is as important a tradition (and a more commonly shared one) in the Islamic world than the headscarf; the scarf does not have &quot;more&quot; religious significance than the shirt. Nevertheless, the acceptance by Fifa of the adapted head covering of the women&apos;s youth team in Singapore shows one of two things: either Fifa, perhaps with religious experts, accepted that new head cover was not &quot;Islamic&quot; and therefore did not come under the ban on religious clothing, or the &quot;renegotiated&quot; kit satisfied Fifa&apos;s concerns about health and safety. If the adapted headcover was thought to be safe, all we have left is the shirt. Kafashian writes: &quot;It says nowhere in law four that our shirts are unsafe or dangerous&quot; and adds &quot;Many of the [other] teams use similar shirts&quot;. Indeed, it would be difficult for Fifa to argue that the reason behind the referees&apos; decision in Jordan was safety concerns over the high-neck collar \u2013 remember the recent ban on snoods hadn&apos;t come into effect. In the eyes of the Iranians, the high collars satisfied all the conditions for law four. For many in the Iranian press, the Bahraini nationality of the referees was crucial to the matter, considering the Iranian government&apos;s hostility to that country&apos;s violent repression of recent pro-democracy protests against the Gulf-backed monarchy. Whatever the reasons for the referees&apos; decision and Fifa&apos;s discontent, by leaving the issue until the last minute, and undermining earlier agreements between the Iranian Football Federation and Fifa, the organisation is responsible for denying a team the opportunity to qualify for the Olympic games and must take responsibility for an error that once again undermines its very existence. Fifa states that its role is to promote friendly relations between members, to stand against discrimination of any kind and to promote the game of football globally \u2013 surely this was the perfect opportunity to live up to those principles? But instead we have to ask ourselves, if it indeed matters what footballers wear, who has the right to decide? Is it Blatter, who thinks &quot;female players are pretty&quot; and should therefore wear tighter shorts when playing football, or his &quot;council of wisdom&quot;, still awaiting its first female member? The Women&apos;s World Cup 2015 is to be held in Canada, a country whose football federation banned 11-year-old Asmahan Mansour from playing in her headscarf in 2007. Considering Fifa&apos;s latest move, they might as well state it clearly now: hijabis need not apply."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/14/china-vietnam-dispute-military-exercise", "sentences": ["&quot;In a sense [the dispute] has become more complicated because it has become conflated with Sino-US competition in south-east Asia,&quot; said Dr Ian Storey, of the Institute of South East Asian Studies in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-14T15:16:49Z", "title": "Vietnam holds live-fire exercises as territorial dispute with China escalates", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Vietnam", "Malaysia", "Philippines", "Taiwan", "Brunei", "Asia Pacific", "South China Sea"], "article": "China has warned other countries not to become involved in an escalating sea border dispute with Vietnam that reflects concern over Beijing&apos;s increasing international power and confidence. Experts say the stand-off between China and Vietnam - two of the six powers laying claim to a number of islands and their surrounding waters in the South China Sea - is the worst for more than two decades. Vietnam held live-fire exercises off its coast on Monday, in what analysts said was a response without precedent. The complex dispute over sovereignty in the 1.2m square miles of sea has been simmering for decades, but has grown increasingly fractious in the past few years. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also lay claim to parts of the sea. As much as a third of the world&apos;s trade passes through the Malacca Strait. Countries are also competing to tap the sea&apos;s energy resources and exploit its fish stocks. Last year, foreign ministers lined up to attack China&apos;s stance at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) regional forum, in what the Chinese regarded as a Washington-led ambush. The US said it had a national security interest in a peaceful resolution and that it supported a collective solution. Beijing insists the issue should be handled through bilateral deals. &quot;In a sense [the dispute] has become more complicated because it has become conflated with Sino-US competition in south-east Asia,&quot; said Dr Ian Storey, of the Institute of South East Asian Studies in Singapore. Benigno Aquino, president of the Philippines \u2013 which has also accused China of intruding into its waters \u2013 told a press conference on Tuesday: &quot;Perhaps the presence of our treaty partner, which is the United States of America, ensures that all of us will have freedom of navigation, will conform to international law.&quot; Washington has played down the issue this year, with both sides seeking to improve relations after 2010&apos;s bilateral tensions. China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, told a news conference: &quot;We hope countries not related to the disputes over the South China Sea will respect the efforts of directly related countries to resolve the issue through direct negotiations.&quot; In an apparent reference to Vietnam, he added: &quot;Some country took unilateral actions to impair China&apos;s sovereignty and maritime rights and interests [and] released groundless and irresponsible remarks with the attempt to expand and complicate the dispute over the South China Sea.&quot; Hong added that China would not use force to resolve disputes. Vietnam alleges that Chinese boats cut a cable from a seismic survey boat off its coast in late May and impeded another last week, while China accuses Vietnam of illegally entering its waters. Storey warned in a paper two years ago that rivalries were escalating again after easing in the first half of the last decade. &quot;Failure to address rising tensions could lead to greater regional instability, disruptions to global trade and economic development, environmental degradation and, worst-case scenario, military confrontation,&quot; he and his co-author concluded. Storey said that China saw itself as the aggrieved party, but added: &quot;Despite the rhetoric about its peaceful rise and not seeking hegemony, it is seen that China is becoming more assertive and, in the last few months, aggressive.&quot; Vietnam had reacted with unprecedented stridency by holding the live-fire drill and issuing a decree on the terms of military service, he added. &quot;The increasing frequency of incidents at sea raises the risk of an armed confrontation,&quot; said Storey, adding that tensions were at their highest point since a clash in 1988 in which around 70 Vietnamese personnel were killed. The growing strength of China&apos;s navy has also contributed to the concerns of regional powers. It is due to hold naval drills in the western Pacific and official media outlets have suggested it may launch its first aircraft carrier within months, a year earlier than expected. The renewed tensions come after a Chinese diplomatic charm offensive apparently aimed at undoing the damage from last year&apos;s row. Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt of the International Crisis Group said: &quot;[China has] seven central government agencies, the People&apos;s Liberation Army Navy, provincial governments and state-owned enterprises who all have their own interests and claims in the disputed waters. Without very solid inter-agency co-ordination, the multitude of players often make case-by-case policy decisions on the ground in accordance with their individual priorities. &quot;Some of the harder-line actors can justify their actions with the voices of strident nationalism, contributing to a heated domestic environment and marginalising more moderate voices.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/14/schools-told-raise-bar-gcse-results", "sentences": ["In an attempt to confront parents, and the teaching profession, with the scale of the challenge, he will point out that in Singapore about 80% of pupils achieve at least a C in English and maths O-levels.", "If Britain is to justify claiming to have a world-class curriculum, exam system and world-class teachers, the levels of achievement in Singapore need to be matched, he will argue."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-14T21:01:00Z", "title": "Schools told to raise the bar on GCSE exam results", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "GCSEs", "Michael Gove", "Politics", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Exams"], "article": "The education secretary, Michael Gove, will try to demonstrate the coalition has not lost its zeal for public service reform on Thursday when he announces tougher exam targets for England&apos;s worst-performing schools. In an attempt to end what he sees as the low-expectations culture in some schools, he will say that by 2015 he expects every secondary school in England to be achieving the current national average of at least 50% of pupils achieving five A*-C grades at GCSE, including English and maths. If not the school will be regarded as underperforming. The current threshold to avoid that label is 35% of pupils getting five &quot;good&quot; GCSEs, including English and maths. The new goal would require 870 of the 3,000 secondary schools in England to improve by 2015 to avoid being taken over by a neighbouring headteacher or academy. Gove&apos;s proposals indicate that neither the mishandling of the NHS reforms, nor the threat of a national teachers&apos; strike over pensions, have prompted a loss of confidence in the coalition about public service reform. In the speech Gove will challenge the country to recognise the scale of the education improvement still required in many schools by turning the current average performance into a minimum requirement. The plan represents a huge increase in the speed of demanded improvement in comparison with what Labour attempted after 2004. The targets will also inevitably become the yardstick against which Gove himself will be measured as education secretary by the next election. He will also propose as an interim measure that after the 2012 exams the floor of minimum performance is raised to 40% of pupils achieving five A*-Cs including in English and maths. At present 407 secondaries are below that level, but that number is dynamic and the list is bound to change by 2012. Gove will argue the rise of Asian economies and the sweep of technology are changing the demand for knowledge and skills so fast that Britain, and indeed Europe, has to accelerate the pace of improvement if it wants to avoid long-term economic decline. The education debate in the UK has been too inward-looking and failed to grasp the skills transformation in the far east, he will say. He will also argue that radical improvements will occur only if led by outstanding academies and headteachers on the ground, not micromanaged by Whitehall. In an attempt to confront parents, and the teaching profession, with the scale of the challenge, he will point out that in Singapore about 80% of pupils achieve at least a C in English and maths O-levels. In England, by contrast, about one-third of pupils do not achieve basic levels in English and maths at 11, and only half achieve at least grade Cs in English and Maths GCSE aged 16. If Britain is to justify claiming to have a world-class curriculum, exam system and world-class teachers, the levels of achievement in Singapore need to be matched, he will argue. Pointing once again to successful academies, such as Mossbourne in Hackney, east London, as well as his experiences in the US, Gove will argue that the envisaged improvements are achievable. Gove has the power to allow outstanding academies to take over failing schools and build new chains. In his speech, marking a new phase in schools reform and ending a period of relative silence from one of Cameron&apos;s closest allies, Gove will also seek to rebut claims that he has perverted the academies programme by refocusing it solely on successful schools. The academies programme under Tony Blair was aimed at failing schools. In response Gove will also announce the government will turn at least 88 struggling schools into sponsored academies over the next two years. This is more than the Labour government achieved between 2000, when the academies programme was first announced, and 2008. Seventy-three of the new sponsored academies will be secondary schools and 13 primaries. Since coming to office Gove has already raised the minimum level of performance once, demanding all schools ensure 35% of pupils, as opposed to 30%, achieve five A*-C. The new demanding thresholds will be overseen by Dr Elizabeth Sidwell, the schools commissioner and a former headteacher and chief executive of three academies. She has already warned: &quot;While there are many excellent schools in the country, the tail of underperformance is a long and depressing blight on our education system.&quot; In his speech Gove will also promise that he will not tolerate underperformance in academies, vowing he will not allow the introduction of a two-tier system in which excuses are made for academies. He will argue that in academies by their nature it is simpler and easier for governors to act, but he will say he will not tolerate failure amongst academies. But he believes research overwhelmingly shows that academy status improves schools through innovations such as extended school days, changed payscales, and cuts in administrative costs such as payroll systems. Gove believes with the right leadership some schools can be turned around within three months. Gove will argue the key to building an effective education system is not Whitehall diktat, but by creating a system that leads to self-improvement. He will argue there are seven key pillars to reform, some of which he has yet to introduce: \u2022 Self-governing schools with a simple way to start new schools, and improvement driven by chains of schools which focus on the worst. \u2022 A higher entry bar for teaching, better pay for good teachers, and a faster system to remove unsuitable teachers \u2022 Planning and building regulation reform to make it easier for new and good schools to expand. \u2022 Improved curriculums and use of technology. \u2022 A more focused Ofsted inspection team. \u2022 A more transparent funding system. \u2022 Data transparency exemplified by the national pupil database going live on the web in 2012. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 June 2011.

It is the most direct intervention in primary schools by a government that has so far been mainly focused on intervening in secondary schools. The primaries that will be turned into academies are those that have fallen below the government&apos;s minimum standards for five years. The standards require at least 60% of pupils to achieve a basic level \u2013 level four \u2013 in English and maths by the age of 11, and also require them to have made at least average progress between the ages of seven and 11. Around 500 primaries have fallen below the minimum standards for three or four years, and local authorities have been asked to draw up plans to show how they intend to improve them. Authorities with particularly large numbers of struggling primaries will be identified for urgent collaboration with the Department for Education, Gove said. Speaking to the National College for School Leadership&apos;s annual conference in Birmingham, he warned that the government could intervene where authorities were &quot;recalcitrant&quot; or tried to &quot;stand in the way of improvement&quot;. He said: &quot;Wherever possible, we want to find solutions that everyone can agree on, as we have done with the vast majority of the secondary schools that will become academies next year.&quot; But Christine Blower, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said &quot;compelling&quot; schools to turn into academies would not improve standards. &quot;This is a totally unacceptable experiment to undertake with our primary school children,&quot; she said. &quot;Since last September, few primaries have voluntarily converted to academy status.&quot; Academies operate outside local authority control and can set their own pay scales for teachers. &quot;Schools value and need the additional support they receive from their local authority and neighbouring schools,&quot; Blower added. &quot;Simply closing schools and replacing them with academies will not have the impact sought, but will cause a great deal of confusion and distress for parents, pupils and staff.&quot; As reported in the Guardian earlier this week, Gove said he would be setting tougher exam targets for Britain&apos;s worst-performing schools. By 2015, the education secretary said he expected every secondary school in England to be achieving the current national average of at least 50% of pupils achieving five A*-C grades at GCSE, including English and maths. If not, the school will be regarded as underperforming. The current threshold to avoid that label is 35% of pupils getting five &quot;good&quot; GCSEs, including in English and maths. As an interim measure, after the 2012 exams the floor of minimum performance will be raised to 40% of pupils achieving five A*-Cs including in English and maths. At present, 407 secondaries are below that level. &quot;To compete with the best in the world, we have to raise our expectations not just once, but continuously,&quot; Gove said. &quot;In Singapore, more than 80% of young people taking O-levels now achieve five passes \u2013 the equivalent of C grades at GCSE. In South Korea, an incredible 97% of students graduate from high school. &quot;There is no reason, if we work together, that by the end of this parliament every young person can&apos;t be educated in a school where at least half of students reach this basic academic standard.&quot; Gove told the conference that England &quot;still had one of the most segregated school systems in the world, with the gap between the best and the worst wider than in almost any other developed nation&quot;. To &quot;liberate thousands from the narrow horizons which have limited mankind&apos;s vision for centuries&quot;, teachers and everyone involved in education would have to &quot;work harder&quot;, he said. &quot;My moral purpose in government is to break the lock which prevents children from our poorest families making it into our best universities and walking into the best jobs,&quot; he added. Meanwhile, an error has left some academies with hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they should have, it has emerged. According to the Financial Times, it is not yet clear how serious the error is and whether schools will be able to keep the funds. In Hampshire, academies were reported to have been given an extra \u00a3300 per pupil. Asked about the report on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Gove initially said he found it &quot;a bit perplexing&quot; before conceding there was a problem. &quot;There have been individual mistakes made by local authorities,&quot; he added. Asked whether officials in the Department for Education had been responsible for any of them, he replied: &quot;Not that I am aware of.&quot; He said they had been working with a &quot;flawed&quot; system inherited from the former Labour government."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/17/singapore-culture-dinner-clubs-music", "sentences": ["It is often derided as a cultural desert, but a younger generation of Singapore&apos;s residents and expats is determined to bring an edgier side to the city.", "Borrowing from ideas hatched in New York and Hong Kong, secret dinner clubs are now the menu du jour, some with themes betraying Singapore&apos;s inherently geeky nature.", "The two self-declared nerds, who met at Singapore&apos;s underground Hackerspace club, wanted to add an &quot;element of excitement to a city full of potential, but a bit sleepy and dull&quot;, Kera said.", "Similarly interested in rebelling against what she felt was a lack of &quot;personality, history or unique ambiance&quot; in Singapore&apos;s restaurants, Zina Alam, 27, decided to start her own Bangladeshi-style supper club, Khana Commune.", "&quot;Singapore is changing every day, politically and culturally,&quot; said the former journalist, whose own change of direction was inspired by a visit to Edinburgh&apos;s supper clubs.", "&quot;You wouldn&apos;t see this anywhere else in Singapore,&quot; she said.", "Now the cultural development is following.&quot; While some grumble that Singapore&apos;s music and arts scene is still far from robust, at the Crazy Elephant, a popular live music bar on the busy Clarke Quay waterfront, novice musicians are invited to perform on stage in a weekly DIY music night.", "&quot;Most people think Sundays are quiet, but budding artists too afraid to play in a bigger arena, or even well-known bands like Deep Purple, have all come to jam.&quot; The beauty of living in a &quot;cultural desert&quot;, some say, is that it provides an empty space upon which a promising new future, like Singapore&apos;s, can be built."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-17T11:54:51Z", "title": "Singapore finds its cultural feet with culinary renaissance", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "Singapore holidays", "Asia", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "It is often derided as a cultural desert, but a younger generation of Singapore&apos;s residents and expats is determined to bring an edgier side to the city.

The loss of one of the great spin bowlers has left the country badly in need of a facelift. There was a listlessness about Sri Lanka in the field as they neared the end of a Test series for which they seem to have had little appetite. They are here but have rarely given the impression that they want to be. Without Murali, their bowlers have provided few moments of distinction. They have been a dreadful disappointment. Sri Lanka have been hampered in Southampton by a knee ailment for Dilhara Fernando, which caused him to bowl off a short run and occasionally at barely 70mph. Suranga Lakmal ambled in with the new ball as if he expected it to be just as unsuccessful as the old one. Where Sri Lanka&apos;s fast bowlers once hid behind the exploits of Murali, their limitations are now exposed. At least Sri Lanka could draw hope from the Test debut of Lahiru Thirimanne, a 21-year-old left-hander from Moratuwa whose hundred against Essex before this Test was his first outside Sri Lanka, but whose application against the moving ball suggested that it will not be the last. His 38 before Chris Tremlett had him caught at slip was the highlight of Sri Lanka&apos;s day. England must look at Sri Lanka&apos;s one-day record with envy but in Test cricket the tourists have lost all purpose. Their fielding throughout the series has been studded with misfields and their over rate has been desultory. It can take several minutes to set Rangana Herath&apos;s field and all he does when Kumar Sangakkara outlines a few options is roll his head in acquiescence. England&apos;s over rate is only marginally better, meaning the series has been played out at 13.4 overs an hour and overtime has become a daily occurrence. Remarkably, both sides have escaped fines. Ian Bell did not waste the opportunity. He used to be cursed by the statistic that he had never been the first England batsman to score a century in a Test, implying that he never fashioned a game but batted in the shadow of others. Then he struck the first England hundred in a Test against Bangladesh and it was remarked that he had never made the first century \u2013 except against Bangladesh. Now he has added Sri Lanka \u2013 so he will be told he has only done it against Bangladesh and a side who think they are Bangladesh. News from home is hardly cheering for Sri Lanka. Hot on the heels of news that Sri Lanka Cricket has suffered the theft of two computer hard discs that relate to its much-criticised World Cup arrangements, and that the sports minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, has called in the police to investigate, comes a decision from the Indian board to withdraw its players from Sri Lanka&apos;s inaugural Twenty20 tournament. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is unhappy that Indian players involved have been asked to sign contracts with Somerset Ventures, the Singapore-based company that owns the commercial rights, rather than with Sri Lanka Cricket. The Indian board argues that this makes the tournament a private venture and that they have no choice but to block participation. Sri Lanka Cricket own the seven franchises, so its failure to take responsibility for the of the international players contracts is at best careless. Sri Lanka Cricket&apos;s secretary, Nishantha Ranatunga, says he is &quot;surprised and hurt&quot; by India&apos;s decision. Sri Lanka&apos;s players, who must fear the collapse of the tournament and a loss of wages, must be equally disturbed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/20/internet-domain-wave-new-suffixes", "sentences": ["The Icann board approved the move by 13 votes to one with two abstentions in a meeting in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-20T18:29:20Z", "title": "Internet domain addresses opened up to wave of new suffixes", "tags": ["Internet", "Business", "World news", "Language"], "article": "Twenty-six years after .com was first unveiled to the world, officials have swept away tight regulations governing website naming, opening up a whole world of personalised web address suffixes. Icann, the internet naming board, approved one of the biggest changes in the web&apos;s history on Monday, allowing the number of web suffixes to expand virtually without limit. Currently there are 22 international &quot;top level domain&quot; suffixes such as &quot;.com&quot;, but sites with suffixes such as &quot;.sport&quot; and &quot;.eco&quot; will pop up next year. Peter Dengate Thrush, chairman of Icann&apos;s board of directors, said: &quot;Today&apos;s decision will usher in a new internet age. We have provided a platform for the next generation of creativity and inspiration. Unless there is a good reason to restrain it, innovation should be allowed to run free.&quot; Analysts say they expect 500 to 1,000 domain suffixes, mostly for companies and products looking to stamp their mark on web addresses, but also for cities and generic names such as .bank or .hotel. Websites can now be categorised by subjects such as industry, geography and ethnicity \u2013 as well as using Arabic, Chinese and other scripts. There are also 290 country suffixes such as &quot;.uk&quot; and &quot;.fr&quot;, which will remain unchanged for now. Groups have formed to back &quot;.sport&quot; for sporting sites, and two conservationist groups separately are seeking the right to operate an &quot;.eco&quot; suffix. It will also now be possible to have website names entirely in Mandarin or Cyrillic or any other script, which will ease the problem of reading and writing addresses for the majority of people who do not use the Roman alphabet. The growth will also come as the internet shifts to the next-generation IPv6 addressing system for its basic systems, which enables far more devices to be attached to the internet. Icann approved the move after six years of negotiations, in which concerns were repeatedly expressed that the enormous expansion of suffixes could lead to extra costs for businesses of registering a site with their trademark as the number of suffixes explodes. During the 1990s there were hundreds of cases of &quot;domain squatting&quot; in which people would register sites that used companies&apos; trademarked names, effectively holding them to ransom. Expanding the number of domains could make that far worse. But it would also ease the pressure on the &quot;.com&quot; domain, created 26 years ago. In May 2009 a study found that 74% of websites were in the .com domain space. &quot;It will allow corporations to better take control of their brands,&quot; said Theo Hnarakis, chief executive of Melbourne IT, which manages online brands for clients such as Volvo, LEGO and GlaxoSmithKline. &quot;For example, .apple or .ipad would take customers right to those products.&quot; But others said that the promise of space could be a double-edged sword. &quot;If you&apos;re a company with a lot of money, such as Barclays, then you could buy the &apos;.barclays&apos; suffix and build a little island on the internet, on the basis that you can persuade customers that only legitimate Barclays sites will end with that,&quot; said Charlie Abrahams, of the brand protection company MarkMonitor. &quot;If your brand has just three letters, it might be worth it. If you&apos;re Tommy Hilfiger, it&apos;s probably not, because I can&apos;t imagine anyone bothering to type all that at the end of a URL.&quot; However, the principal beneficiaries are likely to be the internet registrars who sell the rights to site names. Icann has set a $185,000 fee per suffix, and applicants have to work their way through a 360-page guidebook to prepare their bids ahead of the first suffix auctions, which start on 12 January 2012 and run for 90 days. Icann says it will auction suffixes if multiple parties have legitimate claims. However, it expects companies will reach deals to avoid a public auction. &quot;I think we&apos;ll see much more of that going on than see auctions generating circuses,&quot; said Dengate Thrush. &quot;But there is that prospect that there will be a couple of identical applicants and applications.&quot; Adrian Kinderis, chief executive of AusRegistry International, which helps companies to register domains and manages names such as &quot;.au&quot; for Australia, said: &quot;It&apos;s a significant undertaking. We&apos;re calling it the Olympic bid. But it&apos;s worth it for corporations that have suffered from things like trademark infringement and can now carve out a niche on the internet.&quot; Abrahams estimates that it would cost a typical company \u00a31m to run their own suffix for the minimum 10 years required. &quot;It is a lot of work \u2013 but if someone beats you to it, you have lost it forever,&quot; he noted. The Icann board approved the move by 13 votes to one with two abstentions in a meeting in Singapore. &quot;This is the start of a whole new phase for the Internet,&quot; said But tThe move could also create enormous confusion for consumers and companies. It greatly expands the risks from &quot;phishing&quot; sites because they could use confusing domain names in language scripts that look similar to existing ones to capture peoples&apos; details. And for companies, the challenge will be to decide whether to register their names in all possible domains, or to create their own suffix, or to limit themselves to a small number of domains."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/21/nokia-n9-launch-smartphone", "sentences": ["&quot;Our primary smartphone strategy is to focus on the Windows phone,&quot; Elop, who moved to Nokia from Microsoft last year, said at a telecom conference in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-21T06:17:00Z", "title": "Nokia unveils N9 smartphone", "tags": ["Nokia", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology"], "article": "Nokia has launched a new smartphone, the N9, which uses its own Meego software, while chief executive Stephen Elop said he has &quot;increased confidence&quot; that the struggling Finnish mobile phone maker will launch its first Windows Phone device this year and ship in volume in 2012. &quot;Our primary smartphone strategy is to focus on the Windows phone,&quot; Elop, who moved to Nokia from Microsoft last year, said at a telecom conference in Singapore. However he provided few details on how he planned to arrest a slide in Nokia&apos;s market share. The N9 is the first \u2013 and last \u2013 smartphone from Nokia to run Meego. The commercial launch will be held later this year, the company said. The N9 model comes with a large touch screen and is available in black, cyan and magenta. The MeeGo platform - a newcomer in the market dominated by Google and Apple \u2013 was born in February 2010 when Nokia and Intel unveiled a merger of Nokia&apos;s Linux Maemo software platform with Intel&apos;s Moblin, which is also based on Linux open-source software. After Nokia pulled back from the project four months ago other vendors have become more interested in the technology as Nokia&apos;s dominant role in the project had held back others from adopting it. Last month, Nokia said it decided to abandon hopes of meeting key targets just weeks after setting them, raising questions over whether Elop can deliver on a turnaround he promised in February.  Nokia has been losing ground in the smartphone market to Apple&apos;s iPhone and Google&apos;s Android devices, and in the low-end mobile phones to more nimble Asian rivals such as China&apos;s ZTE and India&apos;s Micromax. In a research note this month, Nomura said Samsung Electronics will become the world&apos;s largest smartphone maker by volume this quarter and that the number of iPhones sold will mean Apple will take the number two spot next quarter, pushing Nokia to the third place. Nokia has led the smartphone market since 1996 when it launched the Communicator, a smartphone that is popular in the business community for its ability to browse the internet as well as to receive and send emails, data and fax. Nokia dumped plans to use MeeGo in its future smartphones when in February it picked Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone as its future software choice, but it decided to unveil one of the models it was working on before closing the business line.  The partnership with Windows may not be a panacea for Nokia&apos;s troubles since rivals including HTC and ZTE will continue to bring out devices based on Microsoft&apos;s software. Nokia&apos;s market value has plunged by more than half since February, after the leak of a memo from Elop that compared the company&apos;s market position to a man standing on a burning oil platform."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/jun/21/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["Nokia N9: First Press Shots [Update] &gt;&gt; Pocketnow&quot;This is the Nokia N9, set to be announced tomorrow at CommunicAsia 2011 in Singapore, and as is quite obvious, it is not the QWERTY slider that we were expecting."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-21T07:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Nokia N9, Chromebooks reviewed, Facebook's new photo app and more", "tags": ["Technology"], "article": "A burst of 11 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team New TV features not strong drivers of new TV purchases &gt;&gt; DisplaySearch3D capability is an above-average driver in Indonesia, and nowhere else.

Established this month, the club already has 800 members. The founders of Malaysia&apos;s latest Islamic grassroots movement would surely chastise the SlutWalk on a rationale that goes something like this: had western societies acknowledged that man is hardwired for sex and endorsed polygamy, there could have been happy endings galore. Jennifer Aniston would still be with Brad Pitt if she were willing to share him with Angelina Jolie. And Bill Clinton&apos;s term as US president would not have been scandalous had Hillary allowed her husband to take Monica Lewinsky as his second wife. After all, Bill is just &quot;being a man&quot;, says the club&apos;s founding member Rohaya Mohamad in an interview with the Malaysian Star newspaper. The medicine graduate from the University of Wales, who is the third wife of a 45-year-old man, adds: &quot;As a world leader, you are stressed up and one way to release your stress is by having sex.&quot; As Muslim societies wrestle with women&apos;s rights, one would have thought such outrageous remarks would fall on deaf ears. Yet the club is expanding: it plans to open a new chapter for Malay Muslims in neighbouring Singapore soon. Three factors underpin the club&apos;s popularity. Foremost, these women believe they are curing sex-related social ills such as rape, incest, prostitution and sex trafficking. On this lofty assumption rests a second factor. Its founders believe their aphrodisiac ways are a counter to &quot;most women&apos;s groups&quot;, a veiled reference to western feminism, which ignore the repercussions when a wife does not sexually satisfy her husband. Perhaps the most compelling factor is hinged on the belief that the club does God&apos;s work. The Qur&apos;an, they argue, is peppered with references to sex. To their detractors, another founding member Siti Maznah Mohamed Taufik has this to say: &quot;God even promised sexual pleasure from beautiful bidadari [angels] in heaven for those who are good. So are you saying that God is sex-crazed or obscene?&quot; Men&apos;s natural proclivity for sex can be traced to Islam&apos;s first prophet, Adam, according to Royaha. &quot;Eve was created because Adam had needs. Men have [sexual] needs which they can&apos;t control. And if the needs are not fulfilled, men will find another woman. God created them like that.&quot; Combine all three factors and you get their panacea: make sex goddesses of married Muslim women to the point that they are better in bed than first-class prostitutes. Yet these conjectures stand on shaky ground. To begin with, one can find no shortage of criminologists \u2013 even from the Muslim world \u2013 who would point out that pinning down the cause of rape, incest, prostitution and sex trafficking to the failure of a wife to slake her husband&apos;s sexual thirst is not just highly reductive but also sociologically unsound. Surely not all rapists are sexually dissatisfied with their wives. Six seasons of Criminal Minds have suggested to me that most do it to exact revenge or to exert control. But the founders are ignoring the rigorous debate on feminism in modern Islamic thought by theologians such as Fatima Mernissi and Asghar Ali Engineer. The latter has been instrumental in questioning the interpretation of the word q\u0101nit\u0101t in the widely cited verse 4:34 of the Qur&apos;an as &quot;obedience to man&quot; rather than &quot;obedience to God&quot;. The verse is widely cited as testament that God wants wives to be docile. Finally, the idea that the club offers an alternative to western feminism is more nuanced. There is a strong case to be made for multiple feminisms, as Nesrine Malik and Geraldine Brooks have argued. If Islamic feminism is to take shape, Malaysia&apos;s Obedient Wives Club doesn&apos;t offer an alternative, but a negation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/21/greek-debt-crisis-ratings-agency-default", "sentences": ["&quot;Fitch would regard such a debt exchange or voluntary debt rollover as a default event and would lead to the assignment of a default rating to Greece,&quot; Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings with Fitch, told a conference in Singapore early on Tuesday."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-21T09:45:00Z", "title": "Greek debt crisis: ratings agency raises default fears over bonds", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Business", "World news", "Rating agencies", "Greece", "Europe", "Bonds"], "article": "Europe&apos;s hopes of preventing Greece defaulting on its debts were knocked on Tuesday as ratings agency Fitch declared that it will declare the country to be in default if commercial banks agree to roll their loans over, as EU finance ministers are planning. European leaders, led by France and the European Central Bank, argue that Greek lenders could choose to buy new, longer maturing bonds when their existing debts mature, as part of a second Greek rescue package. They say that lenders would be under no compulsion to make the swap, rather than cashing the bond in, so Greece would not be defaulting on its debts. Fitch, though, refuses to accept this. &quot;Fitch would regard such a debt exchange or voluntary debt rollover as a default event and would lead to the assignment of a default rating to Greece,&quot; Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings with Fitch, told a conference in Singapore early on Tuesday. Fitch had previously signalled its opposition to lenders exchanging their debts for longer-dated securities - which had been Germany&apos;s favoured plan, until Angela Merkel accepted defeat last Friday. Like the other agencies, it believes that any deal where lenders receive securities on worse terms than the original contractual terms of the existing debt should be classed as a &quot;distressed&quot; debt exchange. Colquhoun&apos;s comments &quot;further cast doubt on the ability of Greece to avoid a default, or credit event,&quot; according to Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. The warning came just hours ahead of a crucial confidence vote that could bring down the Greek government, as it struggles to pass a new raft of austerity measures to qualify for \u20ac12bn in aid. Without this money, Greece will probably be unable to repay debts that mature in July and August. Negotiations over the second rescue package, worth an estimated \u20ac120bn (\u00a3106bn), are continuing after EU ministers failed to reach agreement at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. The lack of progress has tested the patience of both the financial markets and the International Monetary Fund, which warned that the lack of decisive action risked another global financial meltdown. EU ministers hope to reach agreement in July. They stated on Monday that second bailout is to be &quot;financed through both official and private sources ... in the form of informal and voluntary roll-overs of existing Greek debt at maturity for a substantial reduction of the required year-by-year funding within the programme, while avoiding a selective default for Greece.&quot; If the ratings agencies declare that Greece has defaulted, then banks would be forced to write down the value of their Greek debt. This would also prevent them from using it as collateral. Analysts fear that a Greek default could trigger panic across the sector, with some comparing it to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. IMF flies into Athens European stock markets opened higher on Tuesday morning, driven by optimism that a rescue deal can be agreed. The FTSE 100 index had gained 40 points by midday, to 5733. The vote of confidence in George Papandreou&apos;s reshuffled government is expected to take place at 10pm BST. John Hydeskov, chief analyst at Danske Markets in London, warned there could be disastrous consequences if the Greek parliament does not approve the new package of spending cuts, in the face of widespread public opposition. &quot;The alternative of not getting the money is so frightening that we don&apos;t have another choice,&quot; he told CNBC. Officials from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union are flying into Athens on Tuesday, a sign of the importance of the vote. &quot;Without more austerity Greece may not see further EU funding, which would bring default closer,&quot; said Jane Foley of Rabobank. Opponents of a second bailout argue that it would only ratchet up the economic and political cost of the crisis, without providing a solution. &quot;A second Greek bailout is almost certain to result in outright losses for taxpayers further down the road because, even with the help of additional money, Greece remains likely to default within the next few years,&quot; said Raoul Ruparel, analyst at the Open Europe think tank. &quot;Another bailout will also increase the cost of a Greek default, transferring a far bigger chunk of the burden from private investors to taxpayers,&quot; Ruparel added. Open Europe estimates that each household in the eurozone underwrites \u20ac535 in Greek debt, through the existing loan guarantees. By 2014, if a second bailout is agreed, this will increase to \u20ac1,450 per household, it claimed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/jun/23/nokia-n9-windows-phone-tease", "sentences": ["We believe this is Elop presenting at the Communasia communications symposium in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-23T14:09:00Z", "title": "Stephen Elop teases with Nokia Windows Phone - but N9 will be DOA, analyst says", "tags": ["Nokia", "Windows Phone", "Technology"], "article": "     Aww, isn&apos;t it pretty?

But let&apos;s wait to see battery life, radio performance, software stability &amp; all the rest first, yes?&quot; (Chorus everyone saying &quot;No, let&apos;s just buy it unseen.&quot;&quot;) So who&apos;s going to buy the Nokia N9? According to Francisco Jeronimo, research manager for European mobile devices at the analysts IDC, pretty much nobody. Or nobody that matters. In a research note, he comments:   This new N9 is probably the best user interface that Nokia has delivered on a smartphone to date. The UI [user interface] is intuitive, easy to use, fast and running in a beautiful designed hardware featuring high-end specs. Although, despite probably being the best smartphone that Nokia has ever launched it may easily be a &quot;death-on-arrival&quot;.   Hang on, dead on arrival? Why?   Mobile Operators will hardly launch the device. Being the first and last MeeGo device, there&apos;s no roadmap available. Without a line-up of new products coming out, the platform and this device will not be supported by most operators (if any) in Europe. They already support several and successful operating systems, so there is no major reason to add a new one, which was killed this year with the new WP7 strategy.    Consumers may be attracted by the user experience but will easily be put off by the lack of applications and a rich ecosystem as opposed to Apple&apos;s iPhone or Android devices. On the other hand without operators subsidising the device, consumers will have to pay a premium price for a high-end product that does not give them any additional value compared to its competitors.  And now here comes the damning conclusion:   So, is this the right time for Nokia to launch this device? In my opinion No. Nokia does not need a niche device with poor sales. As a solo device without roadmap, ecosystem or operators subsidies, the N9 will be another struggling device adding up on top of Nokia&apos;s difficult situation. Secondly Nokia&apos;s message has been clear. The company has a strategy and is executing it as fast as they can. Launching a MeeGo device ahead of WP7 would only make sense to help the transition from Symbian to WP7, which will not happen with a short-living product. It can even be counterproductive if the WP7 device does not provide a similar experience to the N9, raising the question whether or not the WP7 was the right platform to compete in the smartphones battlefield. The WP7 OS stills performing poorly on the market, representing only 3% of the worldwide smartphone shipments in the first quarter 2011.  His parting shot: &quot;How does this device help Nokia then? The N9 shows that Nokia can get it right!..&quot;The N9 shows that Nokia can produce a beautiful device running a delighting experience, which raises the expectations to the WP7 devices later this year.&quot; Oh, and speaking of Windows Phone (not WP7, Francisco - Nokia is going to launch &quot;Mango&quot; phones in October or later), what&apos;s this that Stephen Elop, chief executive of Nokia has to show off here?            Wow. Notice how carefully he told everyone to turn off their cameras and recording equipment? If there had been a big flashing sign saying &quot;FILM THIS NOW&quot; it would hardly have been better. We believe this is Elop presenting at the Communasia communications symposium in Singapore. (The time on the phone is 10:46 on Wednesday June 22. At least according to the phone.) Notice how remarkably still the camera is. How it is broadcast-quality despite shooting over a roomful of people. Notice how it is on a tripod (no camera shake). This is not some samizdat piece of citizen journalism; it&apos;s a carefully spun piece of PR. It&apos;s something &quot;we do not want to see out in the blogosphere.&quot; No, of course not. We&apos;re not showing it here at all. It&apos;s not a careful tease by Nokia. No, no, not at all. Meanwhile the N9 is still DOA (especially after this careful kimono-opening which has oops! accidentally gotten out into the blogosphere) except to rich people who want to buy it SIM-unlocked to experience what looks like a very interesting UI. Enjoy. Update: there&apos;s a much longer version (22-minute) of the kimono-tweaking with the phone - apparently codenamed Sea Ray - at Technet.hu but it&apos;s overwhelmed with demand at present.

If you&apos;ve resisted the temptation to make straight for the comments section let me set out a few figures for you. Average (mean) national wage: \u00a326,510 (ONS \u2013 the median is \u00a321,221), MPs&apos; current salary: \u00a365,738. Underpaid? Not on the face of it. But look at other measures and average wages are higher \u2013 \u00a3576.8 per week or \u00a329,993.60 for 52 weeks according to the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (Ashe) for 2008. However, we&apos;re talking about a role for which &quot;average&quot; isn&apos;t, or certainly oughtn&apos;t to be, part of the job description, so let&apos;s make a few more comparisons. As some 80% of MPs have attended university, let&apos;s look at graduate pay. Their median salary is \u00a329,000 (in banking and finance that&apos;s \u00a337,300), and median graduate salaries peak at age 51 at \u00a334,500. The average age of members in the 2010 House of Commons was 50. Winnowed down by sector, the figures narrow further. The average (mean) pay for managers is \u00a348,286 but just look at the London region and that rises to \u00a373,260. But perhaps most telling is how MPs&apos; pay has changed over the last 50 years relative to the average and to that of other public servants of comparable standing: GPs and circuit court judges. Exact comparisons aren&apos;t possible as measures change and professional pay often remains static for a few years and then jumps, however broad trends do emerge. In the 1960s MPs earned roughly 2.66 times what a male white-collar worker earned, now they make about 2.25 times an average graduate salary. Through the 60s and 70s MPs&apos; and GPs&apos; pay broadly tracked one another, now family doctors routinely make half as much again as MPs. And while in the 60s and 70s MPs occasionally made two thirds of what those &quot;sitting there like fucking Batman with this really rather far out hat&quot; earned, these days their salaries are pretty firmly half that of judges. By those measures MPs are down a good 20% since the 60s. Bring bankers and company directors into the equation and most of our elected representatives probably feel rather hard done by. Leaving aside the fact that MPs tried to boost their incomes through allowances rather than salaries, there are a number of ways of looking at this. First, it raises questions about whether we take our democracy seriously enough. We live in an age where power is apparently leeching inexorably away from &quot;the people&quot; and the accountable institutions in which people vest their power to unaccountable institutions and individuals; corporations, quangos and the super-rich. It&apos;s not a recent phenomenon. In 1816 Thomas Jefferson railed: &quot;I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial by strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.&quot; Yet those uppity corporations have only grown bigger and badder. It&apos;s certain that multinational business and finance are employing the very best people to look after their interests, and so should we. There are 40,000 odd GPs in the UK being paid about \u00a3100,000 per year, yet we moan about the cost of 650 MPs earning \u00a365,000. Yes GPs tend to our health, something we all care about, but MPs oversee the legislation that governs our lives and this year will scrutinise \u00a3710bn of public spending \u2013 something we should care about no less. Yet if we continue to move towards a society where people&apos;s value is measured in purely material terms and, at the same time, fail to pay our elected representatives properly, then arguably some will find all the more enticing the temptations dangled by the corporate world: not necessarily outright bribes but hospitality, offers of directorships, consultancies and so on. We owe it to ourselves to make sure that our elected representatives work for us, for all of us, and don&apos;t pay undue heed to the demands of the denizens of boardrooms and super-yachts. Singapore, not a &quot;democracy&quot; that we should be proud to be comparing ours to, pays its MPs around \u00a3113,000. Transparency International ranks it as the least corrupt country in the world, alongside Denmark and New Zealand. However, mention of New Zealand and Denmark leads me to another way of looking at the question of MPs&apos; pay. In his excellent book Affluenza, Oliver James observes that Danes and Kiwis enjoy a greater immunity to our obsessive, depressive, materialistic world than do we in the UK. Their pay structure is flatter and their sense of responsibility to the community stronger. So perhaps rather than aspiring to pay MPs more we should think about paying top earners less. One might well argue that MPs&apos; pay is a good example of the market at work. Competition for jobs is fierce. There are 45,844,691 of us on the interview panels. Scrutiny is intense. They have to reapply for their jobs at least every five years. When banks and law firms argue they pay high salaries because that&apos;s what the market dictates, they&apos;re being dishonest. The market, in those instances, is not working efficiently. Compared with the political process there is precious little scrutiny or accountability. They are simply small groups of peers, with a vested interest in high remuneration, rewarding one another. If bankers, lawyers and senior executives had been subject to the same rigours as MPs over the last 50 years, perhaps their earnings wouldn&apos;t have run away from everyone else&apos;s to the same degree. Just imagine Sir Fred Goodwin going door-to-door in Edinburgh to persuade people he was worth his vast salary. Fred the Shred? Fred the Shredded more like."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/27/philip-morris-australia-cigarettes-packaging", "sentences": ["Moreover, the government has failed to demonstrate that plain packaging will reduce smoking prevalence.&quot; The company has nominated Singapore as a venue for the initial talks."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-27T20:18:03Z", "title": "Philip Morris to sue if Australia puts all cigarettes in plain green wrappers", "tags": ["Tobacco industry", "British American Tobacco", "Business", "Australia news", "World news", "Advertising", "Media", "Smoking", "Health", "Society", "Asia Pacific", "Philip Morris International"], "article": "     Marlboro manufacturer Philip Morris International is threatening to sue the Australian government for billions of dollars over its plan to be the first country to introduce plain, brand-free packaging for cigarettes. The row is being closely followed by politicians in Britain, Canada and New Zealand, where similar plans to curtail cigarette branding are being considered. The Australian government has drawn up some of the world&apos;s strictest restrictions for cigarette packaging. From January 2012 it plans to stop manufacturers showing logos, branding, colours and promotional text on tobacco packaging. Cigarette packets will be a drab, olive-green colour that research has shown is unattractive to smokers. The box will also show graphic images depicting the health consequences of smoking on the front and back. Branding will be restricted to the name of the manufacturer and the name of the product displayed in a standard size and type of lettering. British American Tobacco (BAT), one of the largest cigarette firms in Australia, has already said it plans a legal challenge to the proposals, which have yet to be formally released. A spokeswoman said BAT would wait for the legislation to be issued before making any move. Philip Morris Asia is the parent company of the Marlboro firm&apos;s Australian outpost. It claims Canberra&apos;s proposals will violate its intellectual property rights and is taking legal action using Australia&apos;s bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The rules are designed to protect investments made by Asian companies against discriminatory treatment. &quot;If no mutually agreeable solution is found, then it proceeds to us seeking compensation. We estimate the damage will potentially amount to billions of Australian dollars,&quot; a spokeswoman for Philip Morris Asia told Dow Jones Newswires. &quot;Brands are valuable intellectual property and form the basis of consumer goods businesses like ours. If we are banned from using them, our business in Australia will become commoditised and its value will be significantly impacted. &quot;The Australian government does not have an unfettered right to confiscate [our] valuable intellectual property. Moreover, the government has failed to demonstrate that plain packaging will reduce smoking prevalence.&quot; The company has nominated Singapore as a venue for the initial talks. The Australian government pledged to fight any legal action. The prime minister, Julia Gillard, said: &quot;We&apos;re not going to be intimidated by Big Tobacco&apos;s tactics, whether they&apos;re political tactics, whether they&apos;re public affairs kind of tactics out in the community, or whether they&apos;re legal tactics. We&apos;re not taking a backward step. We&apos;ve made the right decision and we&apos;ll see it through.&quot; The Australian health minister, Nicola Roxon, said the government&apos;s legal advice was strong. &quot;We won&apos;t be frightened off by threats of legal action,&quot; she said. &quot;We will fight that action.&quot; The Australian moves come as the UK prepares to tighten its rules on cigarette packets, with plain packaging under consideration. Last week, the US government unveiled its new packaging rules, which force tobacco firms to print harrowing images of the health consequences of smoking on cigarette boxes. Martin Dockrell, director of research and policy at anti-smoking group Ash, said he expected the Australian suit to be the first of many as governments around the world tighten up the rules on cigarette packaging. &quot;Plain packaging would make a tremendous difference and that&apos;s why the tobacco industry is fighting so hard to stop it,&quot; Dockrell said. &quot;Legal action is a standard delaying device for them. They are going to throw huge amounts of money into this.&quot; Philip Morris is already pursuing a claim against Uruguay for the latter&apos;s tough rules on cigarette packaging. The company is citing impairment of its commercial interests in a case lodged with the World Bank&apos;s arbitration body, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. It argues that these violate trade agreements with Switzerland, where Philip Morris International is based. Uruguay is defending its laws, arguing that its government has a right to legislate on such matters in the interest of public health. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 June 2011. The original said that Philip Morris&apos;s ICSID action had forced Uruguay to water down its rules on cigarette packaging.

Standard is benefiting from strong growth in Hong Kong, Singapore and China, and also from a bout of cost cutting.

A rise in costs has been a worry at the back of investors&apos; minds, but the bank said cost growth was expected to be in line with income growth. And first half income and pretax profits are expected to show double digit growth in the first half. Standard of course is less exposed to some of the riskier problems facing the sector, such as the Eurozone debt crisis, given its focus on Asia, which is a positive for the share price, up 25.5p to 1565.5p. Analysts at Collins Stewart issued a buy note, saying:  Set against the context of expected first half results from the global banking sector, double-digit pretax earnings growth - even if diluted at the earnings per share level because of last autumn&apos;s equity raising - would represent in our view a very competitive performance.  With UK GDP figures coming in much as expected, the FTSE 100 is still in positive territory, albeit off its best levels, up 18.30 points at 5740.64. Water companies continue to be in focus following yesterday&apos;s news of a possible offer for Northumbrian Water from Hong Kong&apos;s CKI group. Northumbrian has edged 3.4p lower to 410.1p, following a statement from the company confirming it had not yet received any proposal. But Angelos Anastasiou at Investec said:  A deal for Northumbrian now seems likely and a 25-30% RCV [replacement cost value] premium would give price range of 450-486p.   Lakis Athanasiou at Evolution Securities suggested a price of around 436p, saying:  A bid for Northumbrian by CKI will automatically be referred to the Competition Commission, because of CKI&apos;s ownership of Cambridge Water. The Competition Commission will probably allow the bid, but with customer price reductions, that will very likely remove any synergy benefits. Any potential bid is unlikely to complete before the end of 2012.   Most analysts tipped the other companies in the sector as possible bid targets in the wake of the Northumbrian news. So Severn Trent has added 39p to \u00a314.54, United Utilities is up 12.5p at 600p and Pennon has put on 9p to 675p. Investec&apos;s Anastasiou said:  Our view is that United Utilities is still the cheapest, but all are potentially attractive to infrastructure players.

On another, a huge screen tracks the entire length of the Yellow river \u2013 China&apos;s second-longest waterway \u2013 with real-time data from dozens of monitoring stations showing flow speed, pollution levels and reservoir volumes. The operation closely monitors the outflow volumes from each of the nine provinces that border China&apos;s &quot;mother river&quot;, and decides whether they are on course to meet monthly targets. A sophisticated set of river controls allows engineers to intervene by opening or closing a high-tech network of automated sluice gates and monitoring devices. This gives them remote control over almost all downstream diversions of the water for agriculture and industry along its 5,464 km length. The system also allows engineers to flush bad pollution spills through the system more quickly, which has contributed \u2013 along with economic, legal and policy changes \u2013 to the improvement in water quality and quantity on the main river. Now Chinese hydroengineers are embarking on a plan to upgrade the &quot;digital Yellow river&quot; \u2013 what they claim is the world&apos;s most advanced water-rationing system \u2013 to try to save one of the most overworked waterways on the planet from drought, pollution and the unsustainable demands of a surging economy. The plan, which begins later this year, is a major enhancement of an already advanced management system that has helped to reverse the decline of China&apos;s second-biggest river over the past 10 years. For most of the past 30 years, the Chinese government has focused on engineered solutions to the country&apos;s water problems that increase supply. When water ran out or became polluted, they drilled deeper wells or built longer diversion channels to tap fresh resources. But the Yellow river, which has been the main artery of Chinese civilisation for thousands of years, has shown the limitations of that approach and forced a different way of thinking that blends science, conservation, old-style communist centralised control and modern market cap-and-trade mechanisms. The change is evident at the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) in Zhengzhou, which is the command centre for the waterway&apos;s managers.     Tourists observe the Xiaolangdi reservoir at a special water-discharging festival. Photograph: Wang Song/Corbis    In 1997, the Yellow river symbolised everything that was wrong with China&apos;s environment: 40% of its waters were off the scale for pollution, and the lower reaches were so choked with sediment that the river bed stood several metres above the surrounding farmland, raising the risks of floods. But the biggest problem was seemingly terminal dormancy. The river was so overexploited that it failed to reach the sea for 226 days a year. Since then, however, the flow has been unbroken, and last year the basket-case river become an award-winning model when the YRCC won the Lee Kwan Yu Water prize in Singapore. Its head, Li Guoying, was promoted to national vice-minister for water resources. Its digital control system is now being emulated on other stressed rivers, including the Talimu in Xinjiang, the Hei in Qinghai, and the Dong in Guangdong. The European Union, which has a team working with the commission, said the award was well deserved. &quot;It&apos;s an achievement. The water runs to the sea again,&quot; said Paul van Meel, team leader on the EU-China River Basin Management Programme, which is working with the commission. &quot;This is thanks to the central control. This is a unique way to manage a river on such a large scale.&quot; Leading conservationists, including formerly fierce critics of the Yellow river&apos;s management, have also lauded the improvement, though they emphasise that more needs to be done. &quot;I appreciate the change of mindset of the Yellow river commission from conquering nature to promoting the healthy life of the river. The digital centralised control is a wonder,&quot; said Ma Jun, founder of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs NGO. &quot;But the river is far from being revived. By keeping a minimum flow we keep it from dying. But its once vibrant and rich ecosystem is damaged by the construction of cascade dams and the ensuing overexploitation of resources and increasingly by water pollution.&quot; The main outstanding challenge is enforcing the fair distribution of scarce water resources among the nine provinces that share the river. Allocations can make the difference between wealth and poverty. This is evident at Liang village in Henan province. Although the cornfields here are just 10km from the Yellow river and Xiaolangdi reservoir \u2013 one of China&apos;s biggest \u2013 they are drying up because the farmers have almost no water-use rights. Utterly dependent on rainfall for irrigation, the villagers are impoverished and insecure. This year, they are suffering from the worst drought in decades, which will ruin the summer crop if it continues for just one more week. But Henan has used its quota elsewhere. &quot;We have asked the government for help but they say there is a scarcity even of drinking water for the cities, so they cannot spare anything for our crops,&quot; said the deputy head of the village, Lu Kasheng. &quot;We have drawn up plans to drill a 400-metre well but it will cost 700,000 yuan (\u00a368,000), so we need financial help as well as approval from the government.&quot; The villagers get drinking water for only a few hours every two days. Proportions for the provinces have been fixed since 1987, based on the average annual run-off between 1919 and 1975 of 58bn cubic metres. That has proved woefully optimistic. Due to the damming of tributaries, the spread of cities and climate change, the volume slumped last year to 46bn cubic metres. Provinces are supposed to equally share the shortfall. Yet the upstream regions of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia take more than 1bn cubic metres of water above allocation every year.     A dry riverbed in the Huayuankou section of the Yellow near Zhengzhou. Photograph: Zhu Xiang/Corbis    The losers are groundwater supplies and ecosystems, particularly wetlands. Twenty-one billion cubic metres are supposed to be set aside for sediment flushing and maintenance of non-human life on the river. But this is the area of the water budget that is raided when provinces go over their limit. This will be partly addressed later this year when engineers begin installing the second stage of the project, which will force recalcitrant upstream provinces to cede control over water-diversion sluice gates. The new system is currently being designed by the commission and Tsinghua University. Once it is completed three years from now, the engineers in Zhengzhou say they will have remote control over 90% of the river&apos;s taps for agriculture and industry. &quot;We are trying to resolve the contradictions between the provinces by coordinating water use,&quot; says Pei Yong, director of the water regulation division. &quot;This aims to ensure there is no break in the middle reaches, so water can flow to the sea and the ecology can be improved.&quot; While this centralised control system might seem a typically communist response to the water crisis, local governments in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia are also experimenting with market-based solutions, notably the trading of water-use rights. In provinces that have already used up their quota, industries can only expand their water use by paying farmers to improve irrigation efficiency. The offsetting is similar to the cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide emissions. There are other signs that China&apos;s mandarins are looking more closely at improving efficiency and limiting demand in some areas. In its agenda-setting &quot;No 1 document&quot; this year the government made water conservation a priority, capping annual water consumption at 670bn cubic metres and promising to spend 4tn yuan (\u00a3390bn) on projects to reduce waste and enhance irrigation. But there is still a long way to go before the Yellow river is off life-support. Hydroelectric dams remain outside the central control system. Demand for water in northern China continues to grow faster than efficiency gains. As a result, environmental pressure has shifted from the Yellow river to its tributaries \u2013 which are increasingly polluted \u2013 and underground aquifers, which are diminishing at an alarming rate. The state also remains committed to environmentally disruptive megaprojects to boost supply. Its &quot;ultimate solution&quot; to the drought problems in the Yellow basin is the South-North Water Diversion \u2013 the world&apos;s biggest hydroengineering project. Once completed, the planned western leg of the scheme will tap water from high on the Tibetan Plateau to replenish the Yellow close to its source. This will be technically difficult, politically controversial and hugely expensive, but if China is to continue to expand its economy, hydroengineers say there is no choice. &quot;The water shortages along the Yellow river are still a problem. The imbalance between supply and demand will become more and more serious unless we can divert water from outside,&quot; says Pei. &quot;For now, we will strengthen conservation and adjust the water-use structure. But the ultimate solution is diversion. If that does not go ahead, we will face a big problem in our water supply.&quot; The good news of the Yellow river goes only so far. \u2022 Additional reporting by Cecily Huang.

At a time of rapid consolidation of world exchanges \u2013 for example, Deutsche B\u00f6rse has swooped on NYSE Euronext \u2013 analysts believe London is now vulnerable to a bid from a player such as Nasdaq, the US technology bourse that tried to acquire the LSE in 2007. Other possible suitors include the Hong Kong and Singapore exchanges. The LSE&apos;s bid for TMX was trumped late on Wednesday by rival Canadian consortium Maple, playing the nationalist card, and was supported by large Canadian banks such as Toronto-Dominion. At the end of last year, British mining group BHP was forced to scrap a takeover of another Canadian company, Potash Corporation, after the government in Ottawa ruled the deal provided no &quot;net benefit&quot; to Canada. Although Maple&apos;s offer for TMX was worth more than the LSE&apos;s and offered a &quot;Canadian solution&quot;, its merger plan could be blocked on competition grounds. TMX said a majority of shareholder proxy votes supported the LSE merger resolution. &quot;However, it is clear that the two-thirds threshold required to approve the merger would not have been achieved.&quot; Rolet said: &quot;We are clearly disappointed that, despite a majority of both LSE and TMX Group shareholders voting for our recommended merger, the two-thirds approval threshold for TMX Group shareholders was not met and hence the merger will now not proceed.&quot; He added: &quot;Our group is in good shape and financially robust. Whilst the merger with TMX Group was an exciting opportunity for LSE, we continue to see other significant growth opportunities.&quot; In terminating the merger agreement, TMX has agreed to pay a $10m (\u00a36.3m) break fee to the LSE, and a further $29m if, within 12 months, it merges with Maple. Simon Maughan, an analyst at broker MF Global, said: &quot;The failure of the TMX deal will leave the LSE a target as investors have bought into the stock recently in the belief the TMX bid will fail and the LSE will end up on the block.&quot; Arnaud Giblat at UBS said there was an obvious candidate waiting for the London exchange should the LSE&apos;s offer for TMX fail: &quot;Nasdaq seems to want to bulk up and the LSE fits the bill.&quot; Canada&apos;s main opposition party argued the LSE/TMX deal was not in the public interest and demanded the government hold a public inquiry. The left-leaning New Democratic Party said the arrangement, as structured, &quot;was flawed and would lead to a foreign takeover of Canada&apos;s capital markets&quot;. It urged the federal government, which has a majority of seats in the legislature, to refrain from giving the deal its &quot;rubber-stamp&quot; approval. Under Canadian law, any foreign acquisition or investment over C$312m (\u00a3200m) requires federal government approval and must pass a test ensuring it provides a net benefit to the country.

Up to 14,000 UKBA staff from the Public and Commercial Services trade union are striking over pensions, job cuts and pay. A spokesman for BAA, Heathrow&apos;s owner and the UK&apos;s largest airport group, said the longest queues for non-EU passengers were 45 minutes at Terminal 3, exactly in line with the government benchmark, and 25 minutes at Terminal 5, the UK&apos;s biggest airport terminal. By late morning there were minimal queues in the airport, he said. &quot;There are currently no queues and the longest queue that passengers have had is 45 minutes, so we are pleased that UKBA&apos;s contingency plans seem to be working well so far.&quot; Heathrow expects about 70,000 passengers through border control. Earlier this week UKBA told airlines that passengers should reconsider their travel plans in case of significant delays. The agency has made contingency plans including getting managers to staff the passport check desks. At the PCS picket line at Hatton Cross, next to the southern runway, there was a determined mood. Nur Alam, a PCS branch officer, predicted more walkouts in the autumn unless there were &quot;meaningful&quot; talks with the Home Office over issues such as pensions and staff reductions. &quot;Unless the department holds a meaningful consultation we will have no other option.&quot; Staff cuts are an underlying concern amid the publicity given to pensions reform in recent weeks. Sue Smith, deputy president of the PCS Home Office group, said &quot;a lot&quot; of UKBA staff had come out on strike. &quot;They are absolutely furious about the cuts that have already taken place in the border force, including voluntary redundancies at Heathrow where people have left and have not been replaced.&quot; Heathrow passengers reported no abnormal disruption as they underwent passport checks, which for non-EU travellers includes questioning from an immigration officer and takes longer than for EU passengers, most of whom have their documents swiped before being waved through. At Heathrow&apos;s Terminal 3 where Qantas, Singapore Airlines and American Airlines operate, passport queues were hovering around the government target of 45 minutes for non-EU passengers. Debbie Seely, 59, a US citizen who flew in from Chicago with American Airlines, said she waited for about 45 minutes but was handed bottles of water by staff. &quot;The queue was always moving and we really didn&apos;t have to stand still for long.&quot; At Terminal 5 the Brazilian national rugby team travelling to a tournament in Cornwall said it took about 15 minutes to get through passport control. &quot;It seems normal,&quot; said Erick Cogliandro, 27, who travelled on an Italian passport and had even shorter queues to contend with. His team-mates had few problems: &quot;They just took 15 minutes. I don&apos;t know what normal is here but it was pretty empty.&quot; Moutie Abrahams, 42, who flew in on a packed BA flight from Cape Town, said: &quot;We came here two months ago and we stood in queues for a really long time. Today it was much quicker. &quot;In South Africa our strikes are more efficient. You would still be standing there.&quot; The airfield was operating normally, with nine out of 10 flights arriving and departing on time. Manchester airport, which has strong PCS membership among UKBA employees, said 1,500 passengers from three US flights had to wait for about an hour at passport control. &quot;Where we have had to check non-standard passports it is taking longer than usual, about an extra 20 or 15 minutes,&quot; said a spokesman, adding that EU passengers were not hit by delays. Gatwick said the average passport queue was around six minutes. A spokeswoman said: &quot;Everything is fine.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2011/jun/30/london-stock-exchange-bid-hopes", "sentences": ["And it may prompt the likes of Nasdaq OMX, the Hong Kong, Singapore or Australian exchanges, to make an approach."], "publicationDate": "2011-06-30T16:05:39Z", "title": "London Stock Exchange jumps 11% on bid hopes, while FTSE climbs for fifth day", "tags": ["Business", "London Stock Exchange", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "SIG", "Vedanta Resources", "Cairn Energy", "Glencore", "Greene King", "Halfords", "Game Digital"], "article": "A day after its proposed merger with Canada&apos;s TMX fell apart, the London Stock Exchange has jumped nearly 11% on suggestions it was now vulnerable to a predator. The failure of the TMX deal - the latest collapsed merger between global exchanges - is another embarrassment for LSE bosses, including chief executive Xavier Rolet. And it may prompt the likes of Nasdaq OMX, the Hong Kong, Singapore or Australian exchanges, to make an approach. Analysts at UBS said:  We believe that there is a good chance of a Nasdaq approach. Hostile deals have a high failure rate in exchanges. We believe there is sufficient scope for cost synergies for Nasdaq to offer up to 1150p, a 22% premium on current share price while maintaining sufficient earnings accretion for their shareholders to support the deal.  Two of the LSE&apos;s shareholders would be key to any deal. Borse Dubai holds nearly 21% of the LSE, while the Qatar Investment Authority has 15.1%, although both are sitting on hefty losses on their stakes which could make them reluctant to back any bid they perceive as too low. LSE shares ended 105p higher at \u00a310.61. Overall leading shares moved sharply higher for the fifth day running, the market&apos;s best run since the end of May, as the Greek parliament successfully passed a second vote on the government&apos;s crucial austerity measures. With a better than expected Chicago purchasing managers&apos; survey lifting Wall Street, the FTSE 100 finished 89.76 points higher at 5945.71. The leading index has added almost 250 points since Monday. Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist, City Index commented:  This week has seen a return of risk appetite amongst investors, with confidence gained by the positive steps made by Greece&apos;s lawmakers to cut debt, and the unity seen in the eurozone, particularly that of French and German banks to help the troubled country. [But tomorrow] there is a chance that investors could use the final session of the week as an excuse to cash in some gains ahead of the weekend.   Banks were boosted by the Greek news, and by the strategy update from Lloyds Banking Group, up 4.345p to 49p, which included confirmation of 15,000 job cuts. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 1.7p to 38.46p amid talk of an Australian disposal. Insulation specialist SIG added 3.5p to 136.5p on talk of a possible bid from French cement and aggregates business Lafarge. Vedanta Resources rose 62p to \u00a320.94 after it appeared the Indian government had finally approved its acquisition of a majority stake in Cairn Energy&apos;s business in the country. Cairn climbed 8.5p to 414.8p. Elsewhere Glencore closed 4.45p higher at 491p after Credit Suisse said the company planned to move from quarterly to half yearly reporting. Traders said this would avoid problems with reporting the figures of its associate Xstrata before the mining group issued the figures itself, as effectively happened recently. Credit Suisse also said, after a meeting with Glencore, that acquisitions were likely using the commodity trader&apos;s shares following its recent float. It said;  The company is always assessing a number of options and will continue to avoid competitive sales processes. On Xstrata management believe there are value benefits (mainly through marketing synergies) to putting the two companies together but it would not comment on potential likelihood or timing of a combination.  In our view potential targets include privately held agriculture player Louis Dreyfus and ENRC. Both companies would fit Glencore&apos;s strategy to expand in the agriculture sector and increase its industrial asset base.  An IPO of the Kazzinc precious metals assets remains a potential plan for 2012.   Among a number of companies reporting results, textiles services group Berendsen added 39.5p to 545p after it said first half profits would be higher than the same time last year. But Greene King fell 30.6p to 487.4p as investors took profits. The pub and restaurant group&apos;s results were in line with expectations but it warned of a tough outlook, given the current UK consumer climate. Halfords lost 6.3p to 371.2p as Barclays Capital began coverage of the retailer with an underweight rating and 340p target price. Game Group added 3p to 36.25p after Credit Suisse increased its stake from 5.6% to 8.2%. Traders suggested this stake-building could be the forerunner of a possible bid.

The culture secretary&apos;s thought was an interesting one, betraying a recognition of the terrible temptations he faced. But like an alcoholic discussing his problem over a pint, he succumbed all the same. In the midst of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, Ofcom&apos;s turn-of-the-year advice to refer the decision to the Competition Commission provided the perfect opportunity for Mr Hunt to keep his hands clean. But far from clearing the murk that always surrounds News Corporation&apos;s dealings with elected power, he has greatly thickened the fog. The Australian-born American citizen Rupert Murdoch commands just under 40% of the UK newspaper market, and just under 40% of the vast BSkyB. Now, with Mr Hunt&apos;s help, he is set to increase that second figure to 100%, and to merge the two operations, creating unique opportunities for bundling up paper and TV advertising and sales. Even in Berlusconi&apos;s Italy there are restrictions on broadcasters moving into print. No well-functioning democracy should allow one man to frame its window on the world. But then the institutions of British democracy have hardly been functioning well of late in relation to Mr Murdoch. The fourth estate of the free press, in which we are of course one interested party, is one of those institutions. It should check and balance political power from the outside, while itself being held in check by the ordinary processes of the criminal law. The fact that BSkyB&apos;s summer party last night was staged in the Foreign Office, however, seemed apt: Murdoch&apos;s tentacles reach deep into the establishment&apos;s heart. A fortnight before yesterday&apos;s decision, the prime minister \u2013 who had of course basked in the warmth of the Sun in last year&apos;s close election \u2013 attended a closed summit of CEOs at News International&apos;s Wapping base. But two decades after the Sun claimed to have won it for John Major, and one and a half since Tony Blair flew to Singapore to woo Mr Murdoch, reports of politicians kowtowing to News Corp have lost all power to shock. What is new \u2013 and what, surely, ought to have given Mr Hunt pause for thought \u2013 is the emerging evidence that the company has been run as a law unto itself. After years of denials, supine Press Complaints Commission oversight and an odd reticence on the part of the police, the truth has very slowly asserted its power in the phone-hacking scandal. Dozens of detectives have been looking into the dealings of just one Murdoch paper, there are multiple lawsuits involving politicians as well as celebrities, and the News Corp board has made an unprecedented admission of guilt. With a handful of arrests already made, and with live questions remaining about whether the men and women at the top could be charged under Section 79 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, any cabinet minister worth their salt would be desperate to keep their distance from this company if it were in any other line of business. It is true that no charges have yet been pressed, and so it is proper for ministers to be cautious. Being cautious, however, would have meant passing the file to the Competition Commission. Instead, Mr Hunt clung on to it and justified this by devising special arrangements to secure the editorial independence of Sky News, wilfully disregarding the Murdoch record in thwarting safeguards for past acquisitions, from the Times to the Wall Street Journal. Confronted with News Corp&apos;s awesome power, Mr Hunt has made it more powerful still. The web movement Avaaz is marshalling dissent from the margins. But within the mainstream, ever more voices must answer to a single empire, and democracy will pay the price."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/01/thai-leader-cambodia-temple", "sentences": ["&quot;In this very critical week for Thai politics, [the temple dispute] has appeared again as a political weapon,&quot; said Dr Pavin Chachavalpongpun of the Institute of South-East Asian Studies in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-01T16:17:00Z", "title": "Thai leader accused of using Cambodia temple row for election gain", "tags": ["Thailand", "Cambodia", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The corrugated roof gleams, the paintwork is bright and pink-flowered curtains float at the windows. Somrith Sanbradap&apos;s house was completed just two days ago, but she shows no sign of pleasure in the achievement. The Thai farmer&apos;s last home went up in flames in February, destroyed by Cambodian shelling as a long dispute over Preah Vihear \u2013 the 11th-century temple a few kilometres away \u2013 flared up again. At least seven people died and thousands fled homes on both sides of the border. Now residents fear another clash is imminent. &quot;I lost everything \u2026 I don&apos;t want this to happen again and the way things are going now, watching the news brings back very bad memories,&quot; Somrith said tearfully. This week, the Thai military said Cambodia was moving in reinforcements \u2013 a claim denied by Phnom Penh \u2013 after Bangkok announced it was leaving the World Heritage Convention over the dispute. But analysts believe the row is driven by Sunday&apos;s general election in Thailand. &quot;In this very critical week for Thai politics, [the temple dispute] has appeared again as a political weapon,&quot; said Dr Pavin Chachavalpongpun of the Institute of South-East Asian Studies in Singapore. He said that while the government&apos;s stance would not win over opponents, it had rallied nationalist sympathisers who had drifted away. The incumbent Democrats are trailing Puea Thai in the polls. The prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said the decision to leave the convention was solely about defending Thai land, the Nation newspaper reported. He added: &quot;I want the voters to choose the Democrats as we protect the territory, although it is against the wishes of a leader in a neighbouring country.&quot; Abhisit said the Cambodian leader, Hun Sen, wanted a new Thai government because of his ties to exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The opposition Puea Thai party is headed by Thaksin&apos;s sister and regarded as his proxy. The temple, known as Phra Viharn to Thais, stands high on an escarpment in the Dangrek mountains. Originally a Hindu place of worship it was later used by Buddhists. Bangkok does not dispute a 1962 international court of justice ruling that it belongs to Cambodia, but still claims a 4.6sq km area of land around the site. In 2008 rightwing Thai nationalists reacted angrily when Unesco granted the site world heritage status, although Bangkok had not opposed Cambodia&apos;s application. The Democrats \u2013 then in opposition \u2013 took an increasingly hawkish line. While no one expects large scale military action, clashes in the last three years have affected bilateral relations, caused deaths and evacuations and damaged Preah Vihear itself. Prof Charnvit Kasetsiri, a historian and former rector of Bangkok&apos;s Thammasat University, warned that the row and the decision to quit the World Heritage Convention were affecting Thailand&apos;s standing. &quot;It has damaged our reputation internationally \u2013 we look like the bad guys to the world,&quot; he said. The Thai military says it will not instigate hostilities \u2013 each side blamed the other for February&apos;s skirmish \u2013 and now seems to be playing down its comments about Cambodian reinforcements on the other side of the border. &quot;I&apos;m not scared, because we&apos;re well prepared,&quot; said a soldier guarding a sandbagged checkpoint at what used to be the ticket booth for the Thai national park leading to the temple. That is as far as one can go \u2013 a source of regret to Warunrat Chitruchiphong, a regular visitor since her teenage years. &quot;It&apos;s magnificent. I want to go back,&quot; she said. The 34-year-old teacher&apos;s bigger concern is the safety of her pupils. The Phumsaron Wittaya high school was in the middle of a sports day when fighting broke out in February; shells hit the buildings as the frightened staff and pupils crouched in concrete bunkers built the previous year. &quot;I&apos;m constantly worried that if something happens we won&apos;t get them into their bunkers in time,&quot; said Warunrat. &quot;I&apos;m very nervous, but what can we do?&quot;Pavin said he did not expect to see violence this week or next. But in the longer term, he warned, it depended on the election&apos;s outcome.&quot;If Puea Thai come back, the issue could be used once again to discredit the red shirts. There&apos;s a possibility of the military and Democratic opposition pressing the situation,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/advertisingsummit/speaker-biography-david-gates", "sentences": ["He has been located in Brazil, The Netherlands, Japan and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-01T16:54:46Z", "title": "Changing Advertising Summit 2011: David Gates", "tags": ["CAS speaker biographies"], "article": "    David Gates is Global Category Director for Whiskies at Diageo.

Nottingham recently advertised for staff in the psychology department here. The recruiting team were pleasantly surprised by the quality of applicants that they managed to attract.

They will certainly know of the Holocaust, Anne Frank and what happened to children who were evacuated from London. But what do they know of the British men who went to fight in the Far East and were captured and subjected to years of neglect, near-starvation, disease and slave labour? Probably very little. These men&apos;s stories have remained largely unheard \u2013 until now. In a unique project Meg Parkes, a researcher from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), has been recording the memories of 62 Far East prisoners of war (FEPoWs) to put on a website for secondary school pupils. Of the 50,000 men who became Far East prisoners of war, only 37,500 were finally liberated from the labour camps. Many of those who returned in late 1945 became patients at LSTM. The numbers of these men are now dwindling and many are in their 90s. The stories of their imprisonment, forced labour and transportation remained repressed for many years after liberation, because many simply could not revisit such painful memories. But now they want their stories to be heard by future generations. A selection of the interviews is available on the Guardian Teacher Network, our new resource website, for teachers to download and share with pupils. They range from the tale of Fergus Anckhorn, who discovered how his magic tricks with a tin of fish or a banana became an essential tool in his battle to survive, to the compelling words of Cyril Jones who, injured and stranded in the jungle, was befriended by a monkey who showed him how to eat bamboo shoots \u2013 and stay alive. Maurice Naylor, 90, was captured in Singapore. He says: &quot;The war in the Far East tends to be overlooked, especially the thousands upon thousands of young men who, as PoWs, suffered and died from overwork, starvation and disease. &quot;When I was released, I didn&apos;t want to know; I pushed it to the back of my mind. I couldn&apos;t talk about it. I had nightmares. But I had to get on with my life.&quot; When he retired, Maurice visited Thailand and saw his fellow soldiers&apos; graves. He decided it was time to speak. &quot;At first it was difficult to talk. It set me back, dredging up old memories. But it is important \u2013 I want to do my bit. We all lost our youth there.&quot; With the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund, LSTM set up the website www.captivememories.org.uk to catalogue and provide some background to the men&apos;s interviews. At Pensby high school for girls in The Wirral, year 7 girls were prompted to imagine they were animals witnessing the imprisonment of these men, and they came up with pieces of creative writing showing deep understanding of the prisoners&apos; plight. Some of that creative writing has, in turn, become part of a booklet for Ness Botanic Gardens, which has a bamboo-themed garden designed in collaboration with the girls. Ness also has a free educational audio trail, also available on the Guardian Teacher Network. For more details see www.liv.ac.uk/nessgardens.

An impact assessment report by the Home Office says the new policy will deter bogus students and improve compliance, but the expected 230,000 reduction in the numbers of applicants for the Tier 4 student visa from outside the EU over the next four years will have wider costs. The report estimates that income from fees will be cut by $270m over four years, while up to $3.2bn will be lost because students enrolled at private colleges have lost their right to work part-time and contribute to the economy. Private English language training providers, which had 21,000 Tier 4 visa applicants in 2010, are likely to see applicants drop by 13,000 in 2014, with a net loss $4.8m. The report estimates that the decision to raise the minimum level of English proficiency for students from non-English-speaking countries who want to study on degree courses will cut applicants by 11,000 per year. Meanwhile, lobbying by the British Council and the English UK trade association to have the Accreditation UK inspection scheme for private English language programmes accepted by the Home Office for Tier 4 visa applications has failed. Accreditation UK was not included on a final list of recognised accrediting bodies published by the UK Border Agency last month. Institutions currently approved by Accreditation UK that want to continue to enrol Tier 4 students will need to gain approved accreditation by the end of 2012. US fails to close Hispanic and white reading gap The achievement gap between Hispanic and white students in US schools has not closed significantly since the 1990s, according to data released by the US department of education. Figures published in the National Assessment of Educational Progress last month show the gap narrowed by three points in fourth- and eighth-grade reading between 1992 and 2009, but the overall difference remains more than 20 points, equivalent to two grade levels. Hispanic students from second- or third-generation families, identified as not English language learners, performed better, with the gap at fourth-grade reduced from 24 points in 1998 to 15 points in 2009. However Hispanic children who were classified as English language learners were 44 points behind their white counterparts in 2009. Singapore test puts strain on foreign domestic staff  Singapore is conducting a full review of its test of English proficiency required by foreign domestic workers following reports that a 26-year-old Indonesian woman attempted suicide after failing the test three times. Migrants seeking work as maids are required to pass the test within three days of arrival in Singapore. Those who fail are repatriated but are allowed to return to retake the test a further two times. Fear of failure and the additional expense of retaking the test are putting workers under stress. Dubai teachers offer Indian colleagues help by phone Up to 60 teachers based in Dubai have volunteered to help English language teachers in rural India improve their command of the language without leaving their Gulf state. Under the initiative, organised by the Mumbai-based education charity Pratham, the teachers will be issued with pre-paid SIM cards that they can use to offer speaking practice by phone to teachers in remote villages and slum areas. max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fujisawa-sustainable-smart-town-future-model", "sentences": ["Panasonic is involved with a number of other projects, including the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City project in China and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor in India."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-05T16:01:00Z", "title": "Japan's Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town - a model for 'smart life'?", "tags": ["Built Environment", "Guardian sustainable business", "Smart cities"], "article": "Picture life without traffic jams or petrol stations. Have your Smartphone automatically book your next doctor&apos;s checkup. Tootle off to work on an electric bike through manicured parkland. Reserve one of the 1,000 homes in Japan&apos;s Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town and such a low carbon, eco lifestyle is yours for the taking. Sound like a futuristic, eco-version of Yuppie-ville? Perhaps. But this conversion of a disused factory site into a purpose-built, green city could well be a sign of things to come. And not before time: by 2050, about eight in ten people will be living in cities, population experts predict. The implications of such rapid urbanisation are worrying environmentalists. The planet&apos;s future, many of them warn, could be won or lost on urban planners&apos; drawing boards. Authorities in the central Japanese city of Fujisawa are hoping their &quot;smart town&quot;, due to open its gates in 2013, might provide a model for the way forward. With a total budget of 60bn yen (\u00a3463m), the pilot experiment is expected to cut average carbon dioxide emissions by 70%. With the first brick laid only last month, the ink on the blueprints has yet to be completely finalised. But the city&apos;s backers \u2013 a consortium of nine companies, led by electronics giant Panasonic \u2013 aren&apos;t short on ambition. &quot;Our aim is to build a smart town that will be the model for &apos;smart life&apos; [that is being] called for worldwide,&quot; says Teruhisa Noro, a spokesperson for the project at Panasonic, which sees its involvement as part of Japan&apos;s rebuilding efforts after March&apos;s tsunami. As a minimum, every house will have solar power generator units and home fuel cells. Energy storage devices and heat-pump hot-water systems will come as standard. The same with energy-saving air conditioners and sensor-controlled lighting. Green energy systems lie at the heart of the leaf-shaped city, a structure intentionally designed to show the natural interconnectedness of its constituent parts. One of the critical innovations underpinning the project is a smart grid, which will see every villa, apartment and condominium hooked up to same real-time information network, enabling the supply of electricity to be lined up with demand. &quot;Fujisawa will be a town with power and information networks that are connected from the start,,&quot; says Noro. The statement holds an important clue as to the drivers behind the Smart Town idea. Saving the planet is part of it and Panasonic has set itself the target of becoming the world&apos;s greenest electronics company by its centenary in 2018. But sustainable cities promise to become big business too. By Panasonic&apos;s reckoning, global demand for new cities will hit 3,100 trillion by 2030. The consortium bankrolling the Fujisawa project includes utilities, a consultancy firm, several banks, a real estate developer, an architect firm and a construction company. All see it as an opportunity to test out products and solutions that can then be spun out elsewhere. Most of that demand will centre on Asia, where migration from the country into cities is set to explode. China alone is expecting its urban population to increase by 350 million over the next 10 years. The country has earmarked funds for at least a dozen new eco-cities as part of its five-year plan. Panasonic is involved with a number of other projects, including the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City project in China and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor in India. &quot;There&apos;s a convergent trend between companies and cities,&quot; says Bruno Berthon, managing director of sustainability services at global consultancy firm Accenture, one of the companies participating in the Fujisawa pilot. Part of that convergence centres on shared environmental targets. Carbon emissions in Europe are going up in every city bar one (Stockholm). Innovative business solutions are seen as critical to turning that around. Fujisawa&apos;s emphasis on healthcare also fits public policy objectives. The early plans promise technology link-ups with medical facilities and other ways to help older people live a comfortable life - important, given Japan&apos;s ageing population. Competition represents another overlap of interests. If the20th century was all about the competitiveness of nations, Berthon says, then the 21st century will be about the competitiveness of cities. Companies are looking to set up operations in urban environments with efficient transport links, low pollution and good housing options, he adds. &quot;Industries are choosing not between countries, but between Frankfurt, Barcelona and Marseilles or Beijing and Shanghai.&quot; This raises another important issue. The innovations being tested out at Fujisawa are designed not just with future greenfield cities in mind; existing urban conglomerations stand to gain much too. &quot;In theory, it&apos;s easier to get these &apos;smart cities&apos; right from the start. In Europe and elsewhere, the battle is to retrofit&quot;, says Paul Rainger, an expert on urban sustainability at Forum for the Future. The ultimate aim of these huge &quot;working labs&quot; is to engineer ideas that will become standard for future urban infrastructure across the board, argues Rainger. &quot;Companies are looking for the sustainability equivalents of the Sky dish or Edison light bulb.&quot; He cites the example of San Francisco, where the municipal transportation department has introduced an open source database and invited companies to devise businessideas on the back of it. A Smartphone app to determine when your bus or tram will arrive is just one of the ideas to have emerged so far. Another app uses sensors in the city&apos;s car parks to direct drivers to empty parking spaces. The big prize for companies focuses at the &quot;macro level&quot; ofrunning urban services, such as the power grid or water grid, argues Rainger. That requires an entirely different business model and skill set from current practices and will be less related to large scale power generation, for instance, and more about micro-managing energy networks.

The Anfield club made their opening offer for the 26-year-old on Tuesday in an attempt to address a frustrating summer in the transfer market so far but were immediately rebuffed by Villa, who value the winger at closer to \u00a320m but are reluctant to sanction his departure. Downing has encouraged Liverpool&apos;s interest by announcing he has no intention of extending a Villa contract that has two years remaining. Villa, as Liverpool know following their long and failed pursuit of Gareth Barry, are tough negotiators under the chairman Randy Lerner and after losing Ashley Young to Manchester United it may take a much bigger offer before they countenance Downing&apos;s sale. Villa received \u00a316m from United for Young, who had 12 months remaining on his contract and whose form was eclipsed last season by Downing, their player of the year. It is therefore no surprise that Liverpool&apos;s opening gambit failed, although Fenway Sports Group, the club&apos;s owner, is expected to return with an improved offer for a player that the manager, Kenny Dalglish, has made a transfer priority. The striker David Ngog, who rejected the makeweight role in Liverpool&apos;s acquisition of Jordan Henderson from Sunderland, could be offered to Villa on top of a cash bid. Despite signing Henderson prior to the European Under-21s Championship Liverpool have struggled to land several leading targets \u2013 including Young, Phil Jones and Connor Wickham \u2013 and are yet to agree a price with Blackpool for Charlie Adam. Their difficulties have been compounded by a lack of interest in several high-earning yet unwanted players at Anfield, with Alberto Aquilani, Joe Cole, Christian Poulsen, Paul Konchesky, Milan Jovanovic, Brad Jones, Philipp Degen, Nabil El Zhar and Emiliano Ins\u00faa all still on the club&apos;s payroll. Jovanovic, at least, appears to be edging towards an Anfield exit one year after he arrived on a free transfer from Standard Li\u00e8ge and proceeded to collect \u00a3120,000 a week. The Serbia international made two appearances under Dalglish and FSG is understandably keen to remove him from the wage bill to release funds for other targets. He has been linked with a move to Olympiakos and was quoted in the Greek media as saying: &quot;I got the paper from Liverpool that I am free to search for a new club. Up to now, I still haven&apos;t received an official offer from Olympiakos, but I am looking forward to hearing their plans.&quot; Steven Gerrard, meanwhile, is expected to be fully fit for the start of the new Premier League season on 13 August despite being withdrawn from Liverpool&apos;s pre-season tour of the Far East. The Liverpool captain underwent two groin operations in the second half of last term, ending his involvement in March, and remains on a rehabilitation programme. It has been decided to avoid interrupting that by withdrawing the 31-year-old from the trip to China, where Liverpool play Guangdong next Wednesday, and Kuala Lumpur, where they face a Malaysia XI on 16\u00a0July. The squad will also take part in a training session in Singapore the following day. Dalglish said: &quot;Steven and the medical team have done fantastically well so far and they are in the final stages of getting him back to full training. I&apos;m sure there will be supporters disappointed that Steven is unable to be with us in Asia but I&apos;m sure the same people will appreciate the importance of Steven giving himself the best possible opportunity of being fit to play against Sunderland on the opening day of the new campaign.

But BP dropped 4.35p to 455p as traders suggested that figure could be too high. In a note on Wednesday, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecast net income of $5.77bn, well below current expectations. Merrill said:  BP second quarter results are set to reflect the transition period that the company is in and we see limited room for surprises.

We forecast [an 11% fall] in second quarter production, reflecting some of the disposals already concluded. Downstream [earnings are forecast to fall by 30%] due to relatively weak refining margins, heavy maintenance at the Texas City refinery and a lower expected contribution from trading.  Even so, Merrill maintained a buy rating on BP with a 580p price target.

News that China had raised interest rates to cool growing demand and tackle inflation also hit sentiment. There was also nervousness ahead of Thursday&apos;s rate meetings at the Bank of England and European Central Bank - the latter is expected to hike rates by 25 basis points to 1.5% - and Friday&apos;s US non-farm payroll figures.

Analysts at Charles Stanley said:  [It is] difficult to read much into June&apos;s passenger data, comparison of which is badly distorted by last year&apos;s strike at BA. But the bounce-back is slightly better than we hoped for, though Iberia&apos;s numbers still look indifferent. Yield growth is probably making up for that, but is well priced in by now, leaving the risk in the equity still on the downside.  But Serco bucked the downward trend, up 21p to 565p after a buy note on the outsourcing company from Merrill Lynch, while credit rating group Experian added 12p to 823p on the back of a positive recommendation from Citigroup. Among the mid-caps retailers were again in demand, with Sports Direct International climbing 8.4p to 250.9p after its purchase of an 80% stake in entrepreneur Tom Hunter&apos;s luxury retail business. WH Smith rose 22p to 522p ahead of a trading update today Thursday. But Britvic, the company behind Fruit Shoots and J2O, slipped 8.9p to 384.6p following a French proposal to more than triple VAT on sweetened soft drinks in the country. Around 19% of Britvic&apos;s revenues come from France. Finally diagnostics group Axis-Shield jumped 165p to 500p after it rejected a \u00a3230m bid from US rival Alere, opening up the prospect of an auction for the company. The US group has offered 460p a share in cash and said it hoped it could work to a recommended deal. But Axis - created in 1999 through the merger of Shield Diagnostics and Norway&apos;s Axis - said the offer undervalued the company and its future prospects. Analyst Sebastien Jantet at Investec said:  [The] announcement from Alere effectively puts Axis in play and, whilst a 460p approach may look attractive given the current price and Axis&apos; track record, we think it undervalues the company. We would urge investors to hold on and believe we may well see another bidder emerge.

Since employers are not legally bound to grant days off, the weeks never end. In the country that officially works the longest hours in the world, where one in six families has domestic help, the legal right to a day off has long seemed unthinkable for maids. But a government minister&apos;s suggestion that a mandatory rest day could minimise stress has reignited a long-standing debate in Singapore over workers&apos; rights. Halimah Yacob, Singapore&apos;s minister for community development, health and sports, says domestic workers need one day a week to &quot;rest and recuperate&quot;. The government has said it is &quot;studying the suggestion&quot;. But no legal right to a day off isn&apos;t the only problem for Singapore&apos;s 201,000 domestic workers, for whom there is, perhaps not surprisingly, no minimum wage either. It&apos;s the attitudes of their employers \u2013 and indeed the country at large \u2013 that stands in the way of progress. &quot;Are maids really that overworked?&quot; asked schoolteacher Low Ai Choo, in a letter to the local Straits Times. &quot;My maid has a day off once a month. Every time she comes back from her outings she appears even more tired and listless, and needs to recuperate from her outing. &quot;My maid is the one who goes to bed by nine every night and my husband and I are the ones still up way beyond nine to tuck in our children and catch up with school work.&quot; Low is one of many employers reacting angrily to Yacob&apos;s suggestion, which came after the International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreed last week to give domestic workers a day off every week, as well as other basic labour rights. Singapore, along with the UK, was among 63 member states that abstained from the vote. For some domestic employers such as Choo, the real issue lies in Singapore&apos;s &quot;workhorse&quot; mentality, whereby everyone \u2013 not just maids \u2013 could do with more time to relax. Singaporeans work the longest hours in the world according to the ILO, clocking up an average of 46.6 hours a week. New parents often struggle with the work-life balance, as statutory maternity leave in Singapore is limited to 16 weeks and there is no right to paternity leave. In the UK new mothers can take up to 52 weeks&apos; maternity leave and fathers up to two weeks. Many domestic workers in Singapore are hired as live-in cooks, cleaners and nannies, and some agencies, such as Best Maid, capitalise on Singapore&apos;s strong work ethic. &quot;In Singapore, [a] maid is not a luxury, but a necessity,&quot; reads the company&apos;s website. But not everyone can afford domestic help. On top of the salary, employers are required to pay a \u00a32,500 security bond on their maid, as well as a monthly fee of around \u00a3135 throughout the standard two-year contract. Such rules can encourage employers to be less concerned about the welfare of their workers than &quot;getting value for money&quot;, says Vincent Wijeysingha of the charity Transient Workers Count Too. &quot;Unlike more liberal countries where your rights are protected by law, here it all comes down to the personal goodwill of the employer, he said. &quot;Many think, &apos;I already pay so much for her, I don&apos;t want to let her out of the house where she might find a boyfriend, get pregnant and make me lose my security bond.&apos;&quot; While physical abuse of domestic workers has decreased in recent years, psychological abuse is very common, says Bridget Tan of the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, which counsels some 1,000 runaway domestic workers every year. &quot;Newcomers usually have their mobiles taken away, aren&apos;t allowed to communicate with family or neighbours and get no day off. The working conditions here are making people go crazy.&quot; Domestic helpers \u2013 nearly one-third of which come from the Philippines \u2013 work an average of 14 hours a day, with only 12% given one day off per week, according to a new report. Employers negotiate contracts directly with their workers, with many offering a monthly payment of around \u00a325 if no rest day is taken. Salaries range from around \u00a3125 to \u00a3350 a month, although many workers receive no pay for the first six to 11 months of their contract due to agency fees. Mandatory rest days are already enshrined in employment law in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and it seems Singapore&apos;s domestic employers may soon have to follow suit in allowing their employees some relaxation time, says Edmund Pooh of Universal Employment Agency. &quot;It will be difficult for them to attract good workers if they don&apos;t.&quot; For Filipina worker AJ, 40, who uses her weekly day off to attend computer classes and socialise with friends, more time to rest can only be a good thing. &quot;I came here for a better life \u2013 we all did,&quot; said the former agricultural worker. &quot;But you cannot work from 6am to 9pm every day with no rest and so little pay. Sometimes I really do think they just consider us a commodity, like we are for sale.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jul/10/david-willets-students-brazil-deal", "sentences": ["There was a 27.8% increase in students from China and a 20.4% rise in students from Singapore, although the improvement of higher education in both of these countries could see a future fall in numbers."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-09T23:06:00Z", "title": "British bid to attract 10,000 Brazilian students", "tags": ["University funding", "David Willetts", "Higher education", "Education", "Politics", "UK news", "Brazil"], "article": "Ministers have been accused of seeking to plug a black hole in university funding by arranging for 10,000 fee-paying Brazilians to study in the UK. David Willetts, the universities minister, flew to South America last month to arrange a deal that he hopes will be highly lucrative at a time of cuts to state funding for higher education. The Brazilian government is planning to provide up to \u00a318,700 a student. Universities UK, the representative body for universities in this country, said it welcomed the plan, which promised &quot;rich rewards&quot;. The development follows a \u00a3200m cut by the coalition government to state funding for higher education, which will mean 24,000 fewer places for UK and EU students, including teacher training allotments, over the next two academic years. Figures published last week also suggested that 220,000 UK and EU students would be unable to attain places this autumn following a 1.4% year-on-year increase in demand for university places as of the end of June. While the Brazilians will not take places otherwise available to British and EU students, concerns were raised last night that the government&apos;s funding model for higher education is becoming increasingly reliant on attracting overseas nationals who, if they had been born in the UK, might have struggled to attain a place at a university in this country. Brazil does not have a single institution in the Times Higher Education list of the world&apos;s 200 top universities. Willetts&apos;s mission also appears to fly in the face of a vow by the home secretary, Theresa May, earlier this year to bring in regulations that would result in 85,000 fewer non-EU nationals coming to the UK to study each year as part of plans to curb immigration. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: &quot;UK higher education benefits massively from having staff and students from across the world. However, the government must not use overseas students as cash cows, and as a way of bailing out its flawed university funding plans. &quot;With hundreds of thousands of domestic students set to miss out on a university place this summer, ministers shouldn&apos;t be looking to ration access on the basis of who can pay the most. &quot;If the UK wants to remain competitive in the global knowledge economy, we should be following the example of competitor nations and expanding student capacity for both home and overseas students.&quot; The shadow universities minister, Gareth Thomas, said Willetts&apos;s trip to Brazil was a &quot;desperate&quot; move. He added: &quot;I am all for increasing exports, but with the government having cut teaching funding by 80% and funding for world-class facilities by 40%, this looks like a desperate attempt to help universities balance their books. &quot;With David Cameron and David Willetts having axed almost 24,000 domestic student places, many English families who see loved ones turned away from university this summer will wonder if the government has got its priorities right.&quot; Usman Ali, vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students, said: &quot;Instead of spending his time touting for a Brazilian bailout to the student funding chaos he created, David Willetts should reverse the cut he imposed to domestic student numbers that risks leaving many without a place this summer.&quot; The deal was discussed at a roundtable meeting in Brazil attended by Willetts, Brazilian ministers, and 13 British university vice-chancellors, including those from Birmingham, Warwick and Nottingham. The details have yet to be finalised, but it is expected that the Brazilian undergraduates would stay in the UK for nine months, although the British government is also exploring the possibility of offering postgraduate courses. Non-EU students pay fees of up to \u00a326,000 a year and are not counted within the allotment that each university is allowed to take on each year. It is estimated that the numbers of overseas students being educated in the UK could double in four years as universities seek sources of revenue amid a squeeze on central government funding. Durham University is expecting a 97% rise in the number of international students between now and 2014-15, and Exeter anticipates a 73% rise across four of its colleges. Figures show that the number of British students gaining places on degree courses starting last autumn fell by 0.1%, from 425,063 to 424,634. But the number of non-EU students rose by 7.8%, from 32,984 to 37,088. There was a 27.8% increase in students from China and a 20.4% rise in students from Singapore, although the improvement of higher education in both of these countries could see a future fall in numbers. A government spokesman said that talks over the Brazilian deal were at an early stage. A statement from Universities UK \u2013 whose chief executive, Steve Smith, joined Willetts in Brazil \u2013 said: &quot;The scholarships are for a period of under one year and will not mean fewer places for UK students. &quot;A successful scholarship programme will bring clear benefits to the UK and Brazilian HE sectors and their wider economies, contributing to the knowledge base in both countries, encouraging collaboration in world-class research and facilitating staff and student exchange.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 14 July 2011.

Instead, he was stuck in a hotel in Senegal, whiling away the hours watching television and chatting to the staff with whom he is fast becoming friendly. Soumaoro, one of the most respected musicians in west Africa, flew from his home in Mali to Dakar three weeks ago to obtain a visa for Britain. He expected to stay four days at most while he was fingerprinted, questioned and cleared for entry. Instead, his passport was sent to Ghana for processing and he was left stranded in the Senegalese capital, his manager having to scramble out emergency funds for food and lodging. Now it is touch and go whether he will make the opening night. And it is not just any old show, but a project so close to the band&apos;s hearts that they have spent more than five years working on it. It is called Eclipse and will be performed entirely in the dark so the audience experience music in the same way as Amadou &amp; Mariam, who are both blind. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe it,&quot; said Soumaoro, a multi-instrumentalist who spent three years studying in Britain, learning braille so he could teach music at Amadou and Mariam&apos;s school for blind children in Bamako. &quot;I consider England my second home, but this is amazing.&quot; He is right: it is amazing Britain treats world-class artists in this demeaning manner. Sadly, his story is not unusual. For it does not matter how famous or talented they are. Non-Europeans wanting to entertain British audiences must endure a bureaucratic nightmare which, combined with rising costs, increasing delays and occasional consular rudeness, is deterring more and more of them from coming here. Britain is taking itself off the cultural map. For all our talk of global engagement and our openness to foreign businesses and footballers, this nation is earning a shameful reputation for hostility to artists from outside Europe. Composers and cinema directors who are household names have said they will no longer come here. One cellist with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra who flew in to play an unpaid show was grilled for eight hours then deported for having the wrong visa. Even Grigory Sokolov, perhaps the world&apos;s finest concert pianist, has taken the UK off his touring schedule in anger at our intrusive visa process. And it is getting worse amid financial constraints and a darkening climate of hostility to immigrants. When hip-hop&apos;s Wu-Tang Clan told their Glastonbury audience they were treated &quot;like the Taliban&quot; by the UK Border Agency, they aired publicly what many artists say in private. One world-famous African musician, one of the politest people I have met, told me he was stunned at the arrogance of British officials. Cuts and rising costs have contributed significantly to the problem. In recent months, the price of visas for entertainers has risen from \u00a3125 to \u00a3190 while the service has slowed down, consulates subcontracting processing to fewer and fewer centres. Musicians who tour the world to earn a living must hand over passports for up to 15 working days to perform in Britain. This is the last straw for many people operating in a field where money is tight, with some of the most passionate promoters of global arts and cross-cultural collaboration giving up in frustration. Some even argue Britain is guilty of institutional racism. &quot;The relationship of the world&apos;s artistic community with Britain is very bad and, as a result, Britain is missing out on some of the world&apos;s greatest artists,&quot; said Jay Visva Deva, an arts consultant who has spent 35 years working with performers from Asia. &quot;More and more artists just don&apos;t want to come back to Britain now.&quot; Deva works with the Indian folk musician Raghu Dixit, who has made eight trips to Britain in the last 20 months building his reputation. Each time he and his four band members must apply anew for visas, costing nearly \u00a31,000 whether they get them or not, and are unable to tour abroad while their application is processed. They say it only takes two days to get a visa for Singapore, three days for European countries covered by the Schengen Agreement or four days for Australia. Despite careful planning, Dixit had to rely on the help of a supportive MP to cut through red tape so he could perform on Later With Jools Holland last year. Even this tactic \u2013 combined with an emergency flight across India to plead in person with stonewalling officials \u2013 failed to ensure he got his visa in time to make a major festival in Glasgow in January, missing the chance to play in front of 1,800 people. Spend more than two weeks between shows \u2013 time for recording perhaps \u2013 and you must apply again. Meanwhile, the forms are lengthy, complex and baffling for people whose native tongue is not English. Make one mistake and you are in trouble. The Senegalese hip-hop band Daara J, who have headlined Womad, were refused entry for their album launch last year because their promoter did not have the required amount in his bank account. Even if the mistake is made by British officials, the artists carry the cost. Malian members of the AfroCubism project sorted their visas in one batch for last month&apos;s high-profile show at the Albert Hall. But a wrong date was written in veteran singer Kasse Mady Diabate&apos;s passport. So he had to fly at his own expense from Portugal to Paris, spend a night in a hotel while he obtained a new visa, then dash over on the Eurostar to perform to 4,000 fans. There have to be border controls, but all these problems were meant to have been ironed out with new rules bought in to replace work permits four years ago. The points-based system, which lumps some of the world&apos;s greatest artists in with temporary workers, is not working. More than two-thirds of London&apos;s arts organisations have been adversely affected by the scheme and it is becoming near-impossible for new artists to break through \u2013 ironically at a time when African music in particular has rarely been hipper. At the very least, restrictions should be loosened on higher-profile performers and regular visitors; it is not as though these uniquely talented artists are taking away jobs from British workers, after all. The alternative is that at a time when the world is shrinking and western influence is diminishing, we miss out on the most dynamic, inspirational and influential voices from the developing world. Ultimately it is us, not them, who are the losers.

Anwar Ibrahim&apos;s comments came a day after an estimated 20,000 people took to the streets to protest against alleged vote-rigging and other electoral abuses, defying a government ban and widespread use of teargas and water cannon filled with chemically laced water to deter the crowds. More than 1,400 people were arrested and 12 injured \u2014 including Anwar \u2014 as clashes between police and protesters broke out in Malaysia&apos;s biggest protest since 2007. Speaking to a small group of young graduates on Sunday, the People&apos;s Justice party leader warned prime minister Najib Razak&apos;s government: &quot;We will have to pursue \u2013 in parliament and outside of parliament \u2013 free and fair elections, even by rallying unless they change the electoral vote.&quot; When asked whether Malaysia was in the middle of its own revolution, Anwar said: &quot;We have no confidence left [in the government], so it is important for Najib to consider seriously that we are close [to that].&quot; Najib, whose ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (National Front) has been in power since 1957, has dismissed Anwar as an opportunist who &quot;will do everything, good or bad&quot; to become prime minister himself. He has also claimed that Anwar might have been using Saturday&apos;s rally \u2013 organised by the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections, a loose group of 62 non-governmental organisations \u2013 for his own political gain. Najib&apos;s government took extreme measures to prevent people from attending Saturday&apos;s protest, including a city-wide lockdown that saw police suspend public transportation, seal off main roads, and threaten to arrest anyone wearing yellow, the colour of the coalition. Amnesty International denounced the government&apos;s actions as &quot;the worst campaign of repression we&apos;ve seen in decades&quot;. But Najib has since warned activists not to take to the streets again and claimed that his party, Umno, far outnumbered opposition groups. &quot;Don&apos;t doubt our strength,&quot; he said. &quot;If we want to create chaos, we can. Umno has 3 million members. If we gather 1 million members, it is more than enough.

Many are hoping that Saturday&apos;s rally could potentially topple the BN entirely in the next election, slated for as early as this year. But some analysts say the government may hold off in order to smooth things over. &quot;From Najib&apos;s perspective, holding elections any time soon would be a mistake because of the damage that has been done,&quot; Bridget Welsh, Malaysia specialist at Singapore Management University, told Reuters. &quot;The fact that such a large crowd turned up despite a crackdown shows that voter anger is deep and this is going to push a lot of people who are in the middle towards the opposition.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 15 July 2011.

The attendance at York was better than the biggest crowd at Goodison Park during the Premier League season, while Chester&apos;s crowd of 36,500 was narrowly ahead of the best gate at Spurs. And on Monday morning, once the money had been banked, came the recriminations. Chester is annoyed that Newmarket has shifted its entire July Festival meeting back by a day, to run from Thursday to Saturday, with a knock-on effect that the Roodee&apos;s City Wall Stakes moved to York to ensure coverage by Channel 4 racing. Richard Thomas, the Chester chief executive, pointed out that barely 10,000 racegoers made their way to Newmarket, and questions whether Saturday&apos;s fixture congestion is really a price worth paying. Newmarket, though, counters that its attendance was up by 8% over the three-day meeting, and that Saturday is the ideal position for a Group One event like the July Cup, particularly with a view to growing overseas audiences \u2013 and betting turnover \u2013 in years to come. In a sense, they are both right, since the executives at both courses are arguing, understandably, from their own point of view. But if a bumper weekend of attendances at four of the sport&apos;s most important venues can lead to bickering, it also suggests that before it can stride boldly into a commercial future, racing will first need to decide what, exactly, &quot;racing&quot; is. Chester and Newmarket are both in the business of staging athletic contests between horses for the benefit of a paying public, but their actual markets are so different that &quot;racing&quot; effectively means something different depending on whether you are in Cheshire or Suffolk. One point that Thomas was possibly too polite to make is that Chester&apos;s attendance on Saturday outstripped not just the total for the card at Newmarket the same afternoon, but the gate for the entire three-day July meeting. And if the best races from the Thursday and Friday at Headquarters had been squeezed on to a single Saturday afternoon, the attendance would not have been appreciably higher. Its catchment area is sparsely populated, and its crowd is rarely rises past 20,000 even for its Classics. Newmarket&apos;s appeal is that it has the very best horses on show for those who are willing to take the trouble to get there. Chester&apos;s overall programme falls far behind Newmarket&apos;s in terms of quality, but thanks to outstanding management and marketing, it packs in the punters from its densely-populated surrounding area, to watch competitive cards with only a sprinkling of Listed or Pattern-class events. Last year, their numbers were up by 22%, and on some of its summer Sundays, cars are queuing almost from dawn to get a good pitch on the infield. In terms of the needs of off-course punters, there was something for everyone at both Chester and Newmarket on Saturday, with the Bunbury Cup at the Suffolk track probably second only to the John Smith&apos;s Cup at York as the biggest betting event of the day. But if Britain is to export its racing product to potentially valuable markets overseas, then a Group One event like the July Cup is going to be vitally important, particularly if, as part of a series, it can attract runners from markets like Singapore and Japan too. The important point in terms of the future is that British racing is not a single product. Races make money from several different markets and the range will widen if foreign punters can be persuaded to bet on it too. The relative importance of those markets varies from one track to the next and even from meeting to meeting at an individual course. As a result, the conflict between the\u00a0courses that staged racing on Saturday is less significant than it seems. They are doing what they do best, and that must be good for the sport and the industry."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/11/arsenal-tour-malaysia-china-digger", "sentences": ["&quot;China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are match-fixing capitals,&quot; said Hill."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-11T22:00:00Z", "title": "Arsenal's put reputation at risk with pre-season tour of Malaysia | Matt Scott | Digger", "tags": ["Arsenal", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Arsenal play against a Malaysia XI in Kuala Lumpur , at a time when two coaches of high-profile teams there have been arrested or charged under anti-corruption legislation for match fixing.

The players will not know what is going on, but the gamblers and fixers will approach them and try anything they can do to befriend the players.&quot; The fixture takes place in the weeks following a number of arrests and court appearances of Malaysian clubs&apos; coaching staff and bookmakers who are alleged to have paid bribes to influence the outcome of matches in a nation where the unregulated sports-betting industry is estimated to be worth \u00a34.2bn a year.

Heavy hand forces Reds So Liverpool are inching away from their favoured stadium policy of refurbishing Anfield, and it looks like a heavy political hand has forced them. For although the local council has displayed baffling insouciance about Liverpool&apos;s delayed development plans, it turns out that three days before a story in this column about it last Thursday the housing minister, Grant Shapps, had some harsh words on the matter. According to Building Magazine, Shapps told the communities select committee that Liverpool needed &quot;urgently&quot; to come to a decision because delay &quot;holds back regeneration&quot;. Speaking under parliamentary privilege, Shapps also criticised the council leader, Joe Anderson, for having &quot;simply said, &apos;When&apos;s the next cheque coming?&apos;&quot; As the club finally rouse themselves towards a decision, one element of deliberation was perhaps made easier for Liverpool: Shapps could not have been clearer that the government will give no financial assistance to the stadium development. Fifa&apos;s scheme goes flat The World Cup bidding race at Fifa is apparently not the only area of its operations that is contaminated: the World Cup legacy is also said to be a toxifying influence. According to Alive &amp; Kicking, a sports-and-education charitable enterprise that focuses on Africa, the programme set up by Fifa and its sponsor Hyundai to donate 1m footballs to Africa is wrong from every point of view. &quot;On a practical level the balls being distributed are made of plastic, which will soon deteriorate in the dry African conditions,&quot; said Alive &amp; Kicking. &quot;Apart from leaving millions of children with a useless burst ball within days, Alive &amp; Kicking [estimate] the environmental impact of 1m plastic footballs being dumped on the continent ... will amount to 450 tons of plastic littering the landscape.&quot; And there is more. &quot;From a development perspective, the ball dump does nothing to encourage local enterprise and actually undermines efforts to boost hard-hit sub-Saharan economies,&quot; it said. Fifa did not respond to a request for comment. Plymouth&apos;s player power Plymouth Argyle players and staff could hold the key to the success or failure of Peter Ridsdale and Kevin Heaney&apos;s bid to take over the club and its property assets respectively. The Football League joins the Premier League in court, probably in November, in an attempt to defend against a challenge from HM Revenue &amp; Customs their controversial football creditors rule (FCR), which protects 100% of failed clubs&apos; debts to players, staff and other clubs. At Argyle, Ridsdale is asking staff and players to accept reduced dividends from the insolvency process. If agreements are reached on a consensual basis, the League will consider its FCR inviolate. However, in the event of dispute, the League could step in and block the Ridsdale-Heaney bid. The difficulty hard-pressed staff have is that rival bidders are unlikely to offer any more than Ridsdale or Heaney."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2011/jul/13/flickr-twitter-maps", "sentences": ["Using the title See something or say something, he&apos;s produced images for London, below, as well as 34 more including New York, Barcelona, Baltimore, Tokyo, Singapore, Jakarta, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Washington DC, San Francisco, Rotterdam... and not Worthing."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-13T10:14:00Z", "title": "Mapping the world Flickr and Twitter", "tags": ["Flickr", "Mapping technologies", "Data visualisations", "Media", "Digital media", "Technology"], "article": "Self-described map geek Eric Fischer has released a fresh batch of data visualisations that merge Flickr and Twitter geographic data.

But Malaysia&apos;s fancifully named &quot;hibiscus revolution&quot; has potential, at least, to inflict a winter of discontent on the gormless government of prime minister Najib Razak. That&apos;s something David Cameron should bear in mind when Najib comes touting for business in Downing Street on Thursday. Bilateral trade and investment is important. Respect for basic human rights more so. Najib reacted with characteristic heavy-handedness when tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Kuala Lumpur at the weekend demanding &quot;reformasi&quot; \u2013 democratic reform \u2013 and an end to a defective electoral system that guarantees Najib&apos;s party representing the Malay majority, Umno, stays in power indefinitely. About 1,700 people were arrested and many injured as police used baton charges, watercannon and teargas to break up peaceful protests. In an echo of Britain&apos;s Ian Tomlinson affair, one protester, identified as Baharuddin Ahmad, 59, collapsed and later died near the Petronas Towers in central Kuala Lumpur while fleeing teargas. Amnesty International said police had beaten many demonstrators. It demanded an investigation into claims they failed to provide prompt assistance to Baharuddin and that there was a 90-minute delay before an ambulance arrived. &quot;Prime minister Najib&apos;s government rode roughshod over thousands of Malaysians exercising their right to peaceful protest,&quot; Amnesty said. &quot;This violent repression \u2026 flies in the face of international human rights standards and cannot be allowed to continue. David Cameron should tell prime minister Najib that these human rights violations are unacceptable.&quot; The protests, the product of rising tensions linked to mooted early elections, spending cuts and political upheavals in neighbouring Thailand and Singapore, echo events across the Muslim world. Many of the participants were reportedly younger-generation Malaysians kicking back against establishment cronyism, curbs on public assembly and debate, and state-imposed censorship considered draconian even by regional standards. Within hours of the violence, a Facebook petition demanding Najib resign was attracting 300 &quot;likes&quot; per minute, the (Singapore-based) Straits Times reported. As of this morning, more than 172,000 people had expressed support. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why the harshness, the beatings,&quot; posted Sofie Muhammad. &quot;The crowd didn&apos;t even throw stones at the shops. Why is the government afraid? All we want is free elections.&quot; Videos were also recorded by protesters. Marimuthu Manogaran of the Democratic Action party, representing the ethnic Chinese minority, said many of the protesters were &quot;first timers&quot;. &quot;Young people [are] coming out there to demand their rights \u2026 and I think that is a good sign for Malaysia,&quot; he told Luke Hunt of the Diplomat. Another report, denied by police, said a hospital where protesters had taken refuge was attacked by security forces \u2013 an incident akin to events in Bahrain earlier this year. Appalled by the behaviour of police and federal reserve unit special forces, Bersih 2.0, the opposition &quot;coalition for clean and fair elections&quot;, called for a royal commission of inquiry and vowed to continue its reformasi campaign, come what may. Anwar Ibrahim, the veteran opposition leader endlessly persecuted by successive governments on trumped-up sodomy charges (he is due in court again next month), was among those injured. He said later the government had lost the people&apos;s confidence and more street protests were inevitable. &quot;We will have to pursue free elections inside and outside of parliament,&quot; he warned. Far from admitting fault, Najib has threatened more strong-arm tactics if the demos continue. &quot;Don&apos;t doubt our strength. If we want to create chaos, we can. Umno has 3 million members. If we gather 1 million members, it is more than enough. We can conquer Kuala Lumpur,&quot; he said. Such threats seem ill-advised. When elected in 2009, Najib promised to bridge Malaysia&apos;s political, ethnic and religious divisions. Now he&apos;s in danger of exacerbating them, as his old boss, Malaysia&apos;s founding father Mahathir Mohammed, suggested in a recent interview. Malaysia is not on the verge of revolution, hibiscus-coloured or otherwise. Relatively speaking, it is more stable, homogenous and prosperous than other Muslim or Arab countries currently experiencing popular turmoil. But it is not politically immune to the international zeitgeist, any more than its economy is immune to global trends. This latter consideration explains why Najib is in London. And it gives Cameron and other European leaders leverage should they choose to use it. Malaysians need only look north to see how Thai voters defied the political-military establishment and voted in a leader of their choice. When Burma&apos;s Aung San Suu Kyi speaks of the twin imperatives of freedom and democracy, she speaks for an entire region. And if Malaysians look south to Singapore or east to Hong Kong, they see entrenched ruling elites under determined challenge by activists emboldened by the spirit of change. Malaysia&apos;s leaders should wake up and smell the coffee. Led intelligently and openly, Malaysia could be a paradigm for south-east Asia. Led repressively, it could fall apart. Najib must get on the right side of history.

Here, four readers share their own thoughts on getting tattooed and whether they regret it. Hannah Frost: &apos;Sure, I might regret it later, but it means something to me&apos;     Hannah Frost tattoo Photograph: Hannah Frost    Tattoos are a subject people just can&apos;t help but have an opinion about. Of course, there&apos;s a matter of taste. Fern Britton&apos;s tattoos could be seen as a desperate cry for attention \u2013 as many people who oppose tattoos often think \u2013 but it&apos;s more likely that she&apos;s just doing what makes her happy. Being tattooed, you get used to certain questions: why did you do it? Aren&apos;t you going to regret it when you&apos;re old? You also get used to the subtext: that was a stupid idea, tattoos are pointless. Anti-tattoo people often preach that they&apos;re a bad choice because they&apos;re permanent. But what decision isn&apos;t permanent? People make choices with consequences you can&apos;t take back every day of their lives. I only have one tattoo, one I designed myself and considered for two years before getting it done, shortly after my 18th birthday. To most people, that screams &quot;immature mistake&quot;. Sure, I might regret it later, but it means something to me, and when I&apos;m old and wrinkled, I&apos;ll see not a bad decision, but a willingness to dare. Kate Godfrey aka Clio: &apos;I want to live up to the beauty of my designs&apos;     Kate Godfrey tattoo Photograph: Kate Godfrey    My tattoos are secret. I work as a management consultant, mainly in the Middle East, and dress in black-and-navy suits for work, with conservative pearls. I can&apos;t colour my hair. Sometimes, in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, or rural Pakistan, I wear a burqa for meetings. Underneath my suits, I have flowers across my belly, bright pinks fading to the edges of the foliage; swallows on my ribcage. I travel to Singapore for my tattoos, spending money for good work. It&apos;s an incentive to stay pretty \u2013 I want to live up to the beauty of my designs. I started getting tattoos because they were expensive and pretty, but it&apos;s more than that. It&apos;s the sense of control of my body that I&apos;m addicted to. I can alter it without hurting it; I can decorate it, and I can put my identity on it. God gave me a big nose, but I own my body and I have stamped myself on it. Externally, I may look conservative, but I&apos;m not. And there&apos;s one clue to that \u2013 the Latin tag in delicate old-tea brown on my left wrist. Katie Khan: &apos;Sometimes the process of adding layers of ink also adds to your story&apos;     Katie Khan tattoo Photograph: Katie Khan    My first tattoo, on the inside of my wrist, was a mistake. Young, and in love, I dived straight in with the classic blunder: the initials of my young love. When he cheated on me three weeks later, I stared sadly at my healing wrist for 12 more months, willing it to disappear, or act out some quasi-voodoo on its namesake. Six months later, I added a Japanese kanji, hoping to hide my tattoo. The subsequent inking of a tiger lily over the whole thing taught me that it doesn&apos;t matter what the tattoo means, just visit the most creative, most expensive artist you can find. (I imagine Fern&apos;s butterflies are bold and colourful, and when she belly-laughs they flutter.) They say tattoos should reflect your personality. But my cover-up tattoo is as messy and meaningful as my relationships. Hidden in the depths of my dermis remains the imprint of my first love \u2013 but me and my tattoo have both moved on; we&apos;ve evolved, cathartically. Sometimes the process of adding layers of ink also adds to your story. Nic Groombridge aka DrNic: &apos;The association between tattoos and crime is entirely socio-cultural&apos;     Nic Groombridge tattoo Photograph: Nic Groombridge    I got my only tattoo in my mid-40s and now, at nearly 60, I&apos;ve been thinking about them again. Not because of Fern Britton, but because I&apos;m trying to write an academic article about them. Lombroso, the Italian doctor seen by some as the &quot;father&quot; of criminology, saw them as a mark of atavism and criminality. But I disagree and had the tattoo done, in part, to spite him. My research shows that not only was Lombroso fascinated by tattoos and prisoner art and artefacts, but many other early criminologists were. More depressingly I find that there are modern-day &quot;tatisticians&quot;, suggesting that tattoos are associated with crime, deviance and mental health problems. I believe that association is entirely socio-cultural. There are criminals with tattoos \u2013 arty books laud those of Russian inmates, Japanese yakuza or American drug gangs. Some Japanese swimming pools ban them and the Met ask even civil staff to declare their tattoos. But as I and Fern Britton show, many tattooed people are not criminal! \u2022 This article was amended on 15 July 2011. An editing error mangled one of the first part of Katie Khan&apos;s submission.

Elena Gagarina, daughter of the Russian cosmonaut, did the honours. The casting of the sculpture, a recreation of an original made in 1984, was supervised by the architect Pavel Medvedev, whose statue of Laika the space dog, the first animal to orbit Earth, was erected in Moscow three years ago. Laika died up there. The Gagarin sculpture is not just a memorial to a brave pioneer. It is also a reminder of a fabulous idea \u2013 the notion that space-race technology, both Soviet and American, would transform buildings, everyday goods and machinery, and ways of life. However, although Gagarin&apos;s 1961 leap into the unknown did advance design, hopes for a space-age future were nothing new. Science-fiction books, comics and films predate rocket flight, after all. The space-age look found its way into Soviet buildings of the 1960s and 70s. Meanwhile, much of Britain&apos;s futuristic architecture of recent years \u2013 the &quot;high-tech &quot; movement championed by Norman Foster  and Richard Rogers \u2013 has been underpinned by a delight in the sort of space-age design that surfaced when Gagarin made world headlines 50 years ago. Foster&apos;s 2004 &quot;Gherkin&quot; is a very modern building that also just happens to look like an old-fashioned space rocket. Arguments over the authorship of the Gherkin appear to have come an end this week with Ken Shuttleworth of Make architects insisting it was a team effort. In countless articles since 2003, when Shuttleworth left Foster and Partners to set up his own practice, he&apos;s been credited as the designer of the London tower. &quot;It&apos;s the desire for a figurehead or a single name attached to an individual building that still causes problems,&quot; says a spokesperson for Foster and Partners. &quot;Norman has always insisted that his greatest creation is the team around him, and the Gherkin was \u2013 once and for all \u2013 very definitely designed by a team.&quot; Got that everyone? The idea of a &quot;future memory&quot; in architecture, so dear to Foster, is to be debated in a specially commissioned pavilion for the 2011 Singapore ArchiFest in October. Asif Khan, a young London architect whose work also includes craft, furniture and product design, has been commissioned to create the Future Memory Pavilion on behalf of the British Council, in partnership with the Royal Academy of Arts and the Preservation of Monuments Board, Singapore. Khan&apos;s sketch reveals an elemental design made of ice and sand that will morph during the course of the festival. It captures the spirit of a fascinating line of architectural enquiry, and a contradiction inherent to futuristic design: no matter how apparently innovative they are, buildings retain powerful memories of past. Even as architects try to construct the future, it slips away and becomes the past \u2013 just as Khan&apos;s pavilion will slowly dissolve back into the Earth and a state of timelessness.     Rain check ... Zaha Hadid's Guangzhou Opera House. Photograph: Dan Chung    Zaha Hadid&apos;s futuristic buildings, such as the flamboyant new Guangzhou Opera House, are as informed by her love of 1920s Russian constructivism as they are with the future. Sadly, the opera house has been in the news this week because of reports that it&apos;s already heading the way of Khan&apos;s pavilion and falling to bits. Simon Yu, project architect of the opera house, called me from China. &quot;I&apos;ve just been to inspect the building. It&apos;s typhoon season and its been pouring with rain, but rain isn&apos;t &apos;seeping relentlessly into the building&apos; as has been reported. Glass panels haven&apos;t fallen from windows and no large cracks have appeared. I&apos;m not sure what all this is about. Yes, there&apos;s still a lot of snagging to be done; we&apos;ve demanded a high standard of work from what is often seasonal labour, but the flaws are superficial.&quot; Gas holders, meanwhile, were among the most futuristic structures of the 19th century. If the Victorians had invented space rockets, they would have lifted off from structures like these. Some of the most elegant, including Hornsey No 1 in London (described by English Heritage as &quot;probably the world&apos;s first geodesic design&quot;), remain under threat. &quot;This is not just any gas holder,&quot; says Heloise Brown, conservation adviser for the Victorian Society. &quot;Hornsey No 1 will soon be the last surviving example of a highly innovative design and it must not be lost.&quot; Sadly this particular gas holder, designed by Samuel Cutler, is not listed and may be demolished soon.

Ngog and Aquilani had both been linked with moves to Sunderland, although reports suggested the former&apos;s salary had been the biggest obstacle to the move.

Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Hong Kong began taking broadcasts of English football when Liverpool were in their pomp and that support has never faded. On Friday, 38,700 watched them train and the vast sweeping banks of the Bukit Jalil Stadium, which hold 84,000, were crammed in a way they were not for Arsenal on Wednesday night, and will not be for Chelsea next week. If selling the brand abroad is about staging entertaining exhibition matches, then Liverpool obliged. Their two matches in Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur have produced 16 goals. That six of them were conceded against Guangdong Sunray Cave, of the Chinese second division, and Malaysia, who stand 144th in the Fifa rankings might give Dalglish pause for thought, however unreliable pre-season fixtures are as a guide to the real business of football. Charlie Adam, who spent last summer preparing for Blackpool&apos;s first season in the Premier League with games at Accrington Stanley and Tiverton Town, where he was not asked to provide palm prints in wet concrete or was screamed at whenever he opened his mouth, scored his first goal in a Liverpool shirt. It came from a penalty, awarded \u2013 to the outrage of the home players \u2013 for a foul on Carroll. Generally, Asian footballers tend to be unquestioning about a referee&apos;s decision, but after Wednesday&apos;s 4-0 defeat by Arsenal \u2013 and with a World Cup qualifier against Singapore looming \u2013 this was a side under pressure. The hosts pulled the score back to 4-3 before Maxi Rodr\u00edguez and Dirk Kuyt walked through defending that presented a similar challenge to the cones at Melwood. Adam will remember the game for the screams for his twice-taken penalty, the noise and the clinging, draining humidity \u2013 something that is unlikely to be a problem when Liverpool next play a friendly, at Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

A\u00a0group of school kids has clambered on to the wall of their playground and is chanting and waving in the sunshine as we pass in a blur of whirring wheels and glinting pedals.\u00a0One little boy catches my eye and yells: &quot;Allez, monsieur, allez!&quot; while his classmates all scream in delight: &quot;Plus rapide, plus rapide!&quot; The moment flashes like quicksilver, but I know it&apos;ll be one I&apos;ll savour for months to come. The Londres-Paris bike race, or the L2P as it&apos;s now often called, is in its eighth year and has gained a\u00a0reputation for being &quot;the professional cycling event for amateur riders&quot;. It takes place over three 110-mile stages and has climb and sprint sections as well as a timed &quot;yellow jersey&quot; competition. It&apos;s the closest most club cyclists will ever get to experiencing life in the Tour de France\u2026 well, it would be if we kept going for another 2,000 miles and doubled our speed. But those are mere details.     A quick break for rest, repairs and yet another energy gel.    Certainly the L2P looks the part. There&apos;s a fleet of Skoda support cars in full race regalia (240 Octavias and Superbs are currently following the actual tour) and 45 mustachioed motorbike outriders who effortlessly organise a system of rolling road closures which ensure we sweep across junctions and through red lights as if we have diplomatic immunity. There is also a 130-strong crew of mechanics, physiotherapists, cooks, PRs, cameramen, bag handlers\u00a0and drivers looking after us. There are musettes and energy gels and a\u00a0dozen race captains \u2013 and there are of course drugs, too, but these are all consumed in 500ml beer glasses at the end of the day. And then there are the rouleurs \u2013 this year 365 are taking part. It&apos;s all shaved legs, mahogany-smooth calves and beautiful bikes sculpted from carbon and titanium. I had been\u00a0tempted to borrow my wife&apos;s Ladyshave, but as I was already entering a\u00a0world I wasn&apos;t au fait with I\u00a0decided to stick with my aerodynamically disastrous leg fur. Besides, I was still shaken by the events of that morning. My roommate, who I&apos;d only met the day before and who knew so much about cycle lore that I\u00a0was surprised to see his pyjamas were not made of Lycra, had peered at the inside of my cycling shorts and asked if I wanted to borrow his &quot;bottom butter&quot;. When I&apos;d looked blank he&apos;d produced a tube of what looked like Primula cheese and squirted the cream all over the crotch. He then patiently explained that the lubricant would spare me the worst effects of sitting on a\u00a0sadistically thin saddle for the best part of seven hours a day.     Nigel Mansell shares a joke with \u201cBig Maggie\u201d B\u00e4ckstedt, a winner of the hellish Paris-Roubaix one-day classic.    Each year the L2P attracts some of the biggest stars from the world of sport. Lining up at the start of the 2011 race was cycling legend Stephen Roche, who has won both the Tour de France and the Giro d&apos;Italia in his time. Magnus B\u00e4ckstedt, a winner of the Paris-Roubaix, was alongside him, flexing his colossal thighs, as was Will Carling. Nigel Mansell was there, too. He&apos;d arrived with a pair of young riders to push him up the hills. &quot;No, of course it&apos;s not cheating,&quot; he&apos;d laughed as they propelled him effortlessly past me on the day&apos;s first long climb. But the cycling celebrities were not here to grandstand \u2013 they were here to be part of the peloton, happy to be working alongside the rest of us to keep the group&apos;s speed up. Individual cycling is an intensely competitive sport, but a well-drilled peloton will always be more than the sum of its parts. So pedalling alongside the likes of Stephen, Magnus, Will and Nigel is new-dad Matt, who&apos;s flown over from Singapore just for the event. There&apos;s a group of 11 who have come from Colorado &quot;for some flat riding&quot;, and others still from Jersey, Australia and South Africa. There&apos;s also Stuart and Debbie from Dunblane, who are &quot;doing something memorable&quot; for their 25th wedding anniversary, and Paul, who is riding for a personal charity linked to his son&apos;s illness, and then there&apos;s Joanna and Henry and John and Kevin and Michelle\u2026 At times the event seems more like a\u00a0high-speed cocktail party than a\u00a0serious road race.     A helping hand on one of the climbs.    The L2P is my first real chance to sample peloton life. There is so much unspoken etiquette to riding in a bunch that in some ways it has been like joining the Masons. The more experienced riders have been passing on their road knowledge to us newbies and I&apos;ve quickly learned the hand signals cyclists make behind their backs to alert following riders of potholes and obstructions, of parked cars and speed bumps; calls of\u00a0&quot;slowing&quot; or &quot;gravel&quot; or &quot;stopping&quot; shouted over shoulders echo along the line. I toyed with introducing a\u00a0new sign for &quot;Road kill ahead&quot;, but no one seemed interested in my upturned hand\u2026 At last, after three hard but exhilarating days in the saddle, we ride into Paris. This is the spine-tingling moment we&apos;ve all been waiting for. The capital has played host to the final stage of the world&apos;s greatest bike race for more than a\u00a0century, and cycling legends from Jacques Anquetil to Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault to Lance Armstrong have raced along the very roads that we are now pedalling.     The peloton snakes through French fields.    The peloton, stretched at times to more than a mile long, flies along the historic streets. Cars blow their horns, church bells ring, a bride gets out of her stopped wedding car to cheer as we sweep past. We turn on to the Avenue Foch, one of the cobbled boulevards that leads up to the immense bulk of the Arc de Triomphe \u2013 the scene of Stephen Roche&apos;s epic triumph in 1987 \u2013 and then turn down along the river Seine to finish in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. There&apos;s laughter and hugs, the popping of champagne corks, and few without tears in their eyes. &quot;Honest, it&apos;s just the hay fever,&quot; says the sobbing Matt. After a slap-up dinner with too much wine, rousing speeches and bouts of backslapping, I load up my bike and head for the Eurostar and London. It took me 21 hours to get to Paris \u2013 and just over two to get back. I bid farewell to my new peloton buddies at St Pancras station on the Sunday morning and set off to slowly\u00a0cycle the seven miles back to\u00a0my home in south London. At one\u00a0point I swerve past a large pothole and instinctively gesture a\u00a0warning for the riders behind me\u2026 I\u00a0smile stupidly and then say to\u00a0myself: &quot;Allez, monsieur, allez!&quot; Essentials For details on how to enter next year&apos;s L2P, go to londres-paris.com.

It was a little more sophisticated than that. Their performance strongly suggested that the besuited consiglieri in the row behind them had earned their fees. There were signs of two kinds of advice \u2013 a PR strategy and a legal defence. Both were all about crafting an escape from a tight and unpleasant corner. The foundation stone of the PR strategy was humble apology. James Murdoch interrupted his first answer to say how sorry he was, how great his regret was. Rupert Murdoch interrupted his son&apos;s apology to make his own. &quot;This is the most humble day of my life,&quot; he said. Twice. PR consultants around the planet would spot the soundbite there, uttered by Mr Murdoch but written surely by an expert. They continued to apologise at all available intervals. Rupert, in particular, volunteered that he had been absolutely shocked, appalled and ashamed to hear of the hacking of the phone of Milly Dowler. This, in turn, proved to be part of a wider strategy \u2013 a non-aggression pact with everyone. The MPs on the committee; their tormentors on the Guardian; the lawyers who have hauled them through the courts: none were to be attacked. Murdoch Sr sat with head bowed and his hands clasped. Murdoch Jr \u2013 whose temper is globally famous \u2013 was a model of deference and courtesy. Only once did Murdoch Sr stray from the pacific script, when he snarled against &quot;all our competitors trying to build up this hysteria&quot;. But he soon compensated with two extra PR gambits. He recalled his father as a heroic journalist, who had exposed the truth about Gallipoli (though cynics say Sir Keith fixed the evidence), and then he made a brilliant grab for the friendship of the committee by recommending Singapore&apos;s approach to clean politics, which would involve paying MPs $1m a year. They laughed. He smiled. That&apos;s PR. But behind that gloss, there was an intensely serious and carefully organised defence. They allowed some moral blame to get through \u2013 hence the humility \u2013 but at all costs they had to repel anything that looked remotely like criminal responsibility. For Rupert Murdoch, this was simple. Essentially, he worked too high up the ladder to see the ground. He had 52,000 employees, and the News of the World accounted for less than 1% of News Corp, he explained. Twice. And so it was that he had never known that in March 2003 his editor, Rebekah Brooks, had told this same select committee that her journalists had paid police in the past; and he didn&apos;t know why no one had investigated this interesting confession; and he had never heard that the judge who presided over Max Mosley&apos;s action for privacy in 2008 had accused the News of the World&apos;s chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck, of blackmailing two prostitutes in the case; and he didn&apos;t know that his son had authorised more than \u00a31m to be paid to settle the case of Gordon Taylor; and he didn&apos;t know that his subsidiary company had authorised another \u00a31m to settle the case of Max Clifford; and he didn&apos;t know that last year, this same select committee had accused executives from News International of suffering from &quot;collective amnesia&quot;. He couldn&apos;t even remember what he had ever discussed with Tony Blair. &quot;We argued about the euro,&quot; I think. For James Murdoch, the defence was more complex. He was not so high up the ladder and was specifically responsible for minding the family business in the region which included the UK. He took a chronological approach, using a different blockade for each phase, to separate himself from culpability. How could he not have known that in 2007, after the trial of the News of the World&apos;s royal correspondent and private investigator, there was evidence that other NoW journalists were involved in hacking? That was easy. He had not been there. But Les Hinton had been there, as chairman of News International (and as Rupert&apos;s trusted friend and adviser). What did he know? James didn&apos;t know that either. Hadn&apos;t he asked Hinton what he knew? No, he hadn&apos;t. But what about 2008, when he personally approved the settlement of the legal action brought by the chief executive of the Professional Footballers&apos; Association, Gordon Taylor, and two associates? &quot;It&apos;s a good question,&quot; replied James. &quot;I&apos;m happy to discuss the case of the out-of-court settlement with Mr Taylor.&quot; This was potentially tricky. On the one hand, it is a matter of record that the NoW settled the case after a judge ordered police to disclose evidence they held, including an email from a NoW reporter for the attention of Thurlbeck, containing the transcripts of 35 intercepted voicemail messages. This was the smoking gun, which led to the NoW settling the case. On the other hand, James Murdoch&apos;s position was that he had not had any evidence of that kind at the time. If he didn&apos;t know about the &quot;email for Neville&quot;, why did he settle the case? If he did know about it, why didn&apos;t he tell the police? The answer lay with the lawyers, he said. He had been told that the NoW&apos;s outside counsel had advised them that they were bound to lose the case \u2013 but he had never been told why. He had paid out more than \u00a31m in damages and legal fees without knowing what evidence compelled him to do so. Beyond this, he insisted, he had known nothing of the illegal activity at the paper until the legal action brought by Sienna Miller in December last year forced the disclosure of paperwork. Until then, he had relied on the advice of three groups of people. First, Scotland Yard, which had said repeatedly there was no new evidence and no need to reopen the inquiry. He made no reference to the evidence last week of senior Yard officers who said they had been unable to obtain evidence of the crime at the paper, because News International had lied to them and obstructed them. Second, the Press Complaints Commission, which had produced a report saying there was no evidence that anyone other than Clive Goodman had been involved in crime at the NoW. He made no reference to the recent blunt statement by the chair of the PCC, Lady Buscombe, that the News of the World had lied to them. Finally, he cited the report of a highly reputable law firm, Harbottle and Lewis, which had inspected a collection of NoW emails and declared they revealed no evidence of crime. More recently, those emails have been handed to police, and the ex-DPP Lord Macdonald has said they contain evidence of indirect hacking and serious crime. He hadn&apos;t known that, he said, until this spring. Two other executives had handled them at the time, but both of them had left."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/20/james-rupert-murdoch-full-transcript", "sentences": ["I think there is an answer to it and we ought to look at the most open and clear society in the world, which is Singapore, where every Minister gets at least $1 million a year, and the Prime Minister a lot more, and there is no temptation and it is the cleanest society you would find anywhere."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-20T11:26:00Z", "title": "James and Rupert Murdoch at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee - full transcript", "tags": ["News of the World", "News UK", "Phone hacking", "James Murdoch", "Rupert Murdoch", "Press intrusion"], "article": "Oral Evidence Taken before the Culture, Media and Sport on Tuesday 19 July 2011 UNCORRECTED TRANSCRIPT OF ORAL EVIDENCE Members present: Mr John Whittingdale (Chair)Dr Th\u00e9r\u00e8se CoffeyAnn CoffeyDamian CollinsPhilip DaviesPaul FarrellyCathy JamiesonAlan KeenLouise MenschMr Adrian SandersJim SheridanMr Tom WatsonExamination of WitnessesWitnesses: Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, News Corporation, and James Murdoch, Chairman, News International, gave evidence. James Murdoch: Mr Chairman, I have a procedural question, if it pleases you. Our understanding was that we would be afforded the opportunity to make an opening statement, and we prepared on that basis. We would like the opportunity to make that statement. Would you allow us? Q151 Chair: The Committee discussed that earlier. We feel that we have a lot of questions, and we hope that all that you would wish to say will come out during the course of questioning. If you feel that is not the case, you can make a statement at the end. James Murdoch: In that case, we would also like to submit the statement in writing, if it pleases you. Q152 Chair: That would be perfectly acceptable. [Interruption.] Could we please remove the people who are holding up notices?After that brief interruption, we will begin. Good afternoon, everybody. This is a special meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. It is a follow-up to the inquiry that the Committee held in 2009 into press standards, privacy and libel, during which we took evidence on the extent of phone hacking that had taken place in the News of the World. In our report last year, we stated that we thought it was inconceivable that only one reporter had been involved. In the last few weeks, not only has evidence emerged that I think has vindicated the Committee&apos;s conclusion, but abuses have been revealed that have angered and shocked the entire country. It is also clear that Parliament has been misled. We are very conscious on the Committee that there is an ongoing police investigation, and possible criminal proceedings to follow, and this Committee would not wish to jeopardise that. However, we are encouraged by the statements that have been made by all the witnesses this afternoon that they wish to co-operate with the Committee and help us to establish the truth.As our first witnesses this afternoon, I welcome the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of News Corp, Rupert Murdoch, and the Deputy Chief Operating Officer and Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corp International, James Murdoch. I also thank you for making yourselves available to the Committee this afternoon. Rupert Murdoch: Thank you, Mr Chairman. We are more than prepared to. Q153 Chair: Perhaps I might start with Mr James Murdoch. You made a statement on 7 July in which you stated that the paper had made statements to Parliament without being in full possession of the facts, and that was wrong. You essentially admitted that Parliament had been misled in what we had been told. Can you tell us to what extent we were misled, and when you became aware of that? James Murdoch: First, I would like to say as well just how sorry I am, and how sorry we are, to particularly the victims of illegal voicemail interceptions and to their families. It is a matter of great regret to me, my father and everyone at News Corporation. These actions do not live up to the standards that our company aspires to everywhere around the world, and it is our determination to put things right, to make sure that these things do not happen again and to be the company that I know we have always aspired to be.As for my comments, Mr Chairman, and my statement, which I believe was around the closure of the News of the World newspaper\u2014Rupert Murdoch: Before you get to that, I would just like to say one sentence. This is the most humble day of my life. James Murdoch: The statement around the closure of the News of the World newspaper, where I stated that we\u2014the company\u2014had not been in full possession of the facts when certain statements were made to this Committee, was referring to the emergence of new facts, largely that came about at the end of 2010, as the due process of a number of civil trials reached the point where document disclosure and evidence disclosure made it apparent to the company and to myself at that time that indeed there was reason to believe that potentially more people had been involved in News of the World illegal voicemail interceptions from before. That was new evidence or new information at the time, which postdated the 2009 hearings and that is what I was referring to.Subsequent to our discovery of that information in one of the civil trials at the end of 2010, which I believe was the Sienna Miller case\u2014a civil trial around illegal voicemail interceptions\u2014the company immediately went to look at additional records around the individual involved. We alerted\u2014the company alerted the police, who restarted on that basis the investigation that is now under way, and since then the company has admitted liability to victims of illegal voicemail interceptions, has apologised unreservedly, which I repeat today, to those victims, and the company also set up a compensation scheme independently managed by a former High Court judge to be able to deal with legitimate claims from victims of those terrible incidents of voicemail interceptions.Those are the actions that were taken as soon as the new evidence emerged. When I made the statement about not being in full possession of the facts, it was of those facts that at that point were still in the future, and in the due process of the civil trial\u2014the civil litigation process\u2014evidence really emerged for us, and we acted. The company acted as swiftly and as transparently as possible. Q154 Chair: When this Committee took evidence in 2009, we heard from the managing editor of the News of the World, Stuart Kuttner; the legal manger of News International, Tom Crone; the News of the World editor, Colin Myler; the former editor, Andy Coulson; and Les Hinton, the former chairman of News International. All of them told us that there had been a thorough investigation and no evidence had ever been found that anybody else was involved. That clearly was not correct. Were any of them lying to this Committee? James Murdoch: Mr Chairman, the company relied on three things for a period of time up until the new evidence emerged. The company relied on a police investigation in 2007; I will recount this to try to take us back to that area. This is before I was involved. I became back involved in News Corporation and News International matters at the end of 2007. In the 2007 period, there was a police investigation; successful prosecutions were brought against two individuals, and the editor of the News of the World resigned.The company relied on both the police having closed the investigation and repeated assertions that there was no new evidence for them to reopen their investigation. The company relied on the PCC, which had had a report and had said that there was nothing more to this at the time. The company relied on the legal opinion of outside counsel that was brought in related to those matters, who, with respect to their review, had issued a clear opinion that there was no additional illegality other than the two individuals involved before. The company relied on those facts, and for the company in 2008 and 2009, it was not clear that there was a reason to believe that those matters were anything other than settled matters, and in the past. Q155 Chair: So is it your testimony to this Committee that none of the individuals who gave us evidence in 2009 knew at that time what had been going on? James Murdoch: I do not have direct knowledge of what they knew and at what time, but I can tell you that the critical new facts, as I saw them and as the company saw them, really emerged in the production of documentary information or evidence in the civil trials at the end of 2010. The duration from 2007 to the end of 2010 and the length of time it took for that to come clear and for that real evidence to be there is a matter of deep frustration\u2014mine. I have to tell you that I know and I sympathise with the frustration of this Committee. It is a matter of real regret that the facts could not emerge and could not be gotten to my understanding faster. Q156 Chair: You have made clear that it is the case that information we were given was incorrect. Have you established who, as well as Clive Goodman, was involved in phone hacking in the News of the World? James Murdoch: I am sorry, Mr Chairman, can you repeat that? Q157 Chair: Who, as well as Clive Goodman, was involved in phone hacking in the News of the World? James Murdoch: As I think you made clear earlier, Mr Chairman, there have been a number of arrests of former News of the World employees. These are matters for current criminal investigations and, understandably, it is difficult for me to comment in particular about some of those individuals. Q158 Chair: Have you carried out your own investigation since the discovery of this information to find out the extent of involvement in phone hacking in the News of the World? James Murdoch: We have established a group in the company, co-operating very closely with the police on their investigation. Their investigation is broad, with respect to journalistic practices, in particular journalistic practices at the News of the World, and the policy and direction that the company has given them is to co-operate fully and transparently with the police; to provide information and evidence that the company believes and they believe is relevant to those investigations, sometimes proactively, sometimes in response to those requests. Again, I think the very fact that the provision of the new information to the police in the first place when there was no police investigation ongoing that then led to, in part, the re-opening, or this new investigation being established can, I hope, be testament to some proactive action and transparency with respect to getting to the right place to find out the facts of what happened, understanding all the allegations that are coming in and moving forward to aid the police in successful completion of the important and serious work that they are doing. Q159 Chair: Was the departure from your company in the recent few days of Tom Crone, Rebekah Brooks and Les Hinton because any of them had knowledge of phone hacking? James Murdoch: I have no knowledge and there is no evidence that I am aware of that Mrs Brooks or Mr Hinton, or any of those executives, had knowledge of that. Certainly Mrs Brooks&apos; assertions to me of her knowledge of those things has been clear. None the less, those resignations have been accepted, but there is no evidence today that I have seen or that I have any knowledge of that there was any impropriety by them. Q160 Mr Watson: Mr Murdoch senior, good afternoon, sir. You have repeatedly stated that News Corp has zero tolerance to wrongdoing by employees. Is that right? Rupert Murdoch: Yes. Q161 Mr Watson: In October 2010, did you still believe it to be true when you made your Thatcher speech and you said, &quot;Let me be clear: we will vigorously pursue the truth\u2014and we will not tolerate wrongdoing.&quot;?Rupert Murdoch: Yes. Q162 Mr Watson: So if you were not lying then, somebody lied to you. Who was it? Rupert Murdoch: I don&apos;t know. That is what the police are investigating, and we are helping them with. Q163 Mr Watson: But you acknowledge that you were misled. Rupert Murdoch: Clearly. Q164 Mr Watson: Can I take you back to 2003? Are you aware that in March of that year, Rebekah Brooks gave evidence to this Committee admitting paying police? Rupert Murdoch: I am now aware of that. I was not aware at the time. I am also aware that she amended that considerably, very quickly afterwards. Q165 Mr Watson: I think that she amended it seven or eight years afterwards.Rupert Murdoch: Oh, I&apos;m sorry. Q166 Mr Watson: Did you or anyone else at your organisation investigate this at the time? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q167 Mr Watson: Can you explain why? Rupert Murdoch: I didn&apos;t know of it, I&apos;m sorry. Allow me to say something? This is not an excuse. Maybe it is an explanation of my laxity. The News of the World is less than 1% of our company. I employ 53,000 people around the world who are proud and great and ethical and distinguished people\u2014professionals in their line. Perhaps I am spread watching and appointing people whom I trust to run those divisions. Q168 Mr Watson: Mr Murdoch, I do accept that you have many distinguished people who work for your company. You are ultimately responsible for the corporate governance of News Corp, so what I am trying to establish is who knew about wrongdoing and what was involved at the time. If I can take you forward to 2006: when Clive Goodman was arrested and subsequently convicted of intercepting voicemails, were you made aware of that? Rupert Murdoch: I think so. I was certainly made aware of when they were convicted. Q169 Mr Watson: What did News International do subsequent to the arrest of Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire to get to the facts? Rupert Murdoch: We worked with the police on further investigation and eventually we appointed\u2014very quickly appointed\u2014a very leading firm of lawyers in the City to investigate it further. James Murdoch: Perhaps I can help here\u2014 Q170 Mr Watson: I will come to you in a minute, sir. Just let me finish my line of questioning and then I will come to you. What did you personally do to investigate that after Mr Goodman went to prison? You were obviously concerned about it. Rupert Murdoch: I spoke to Mr Hinton who told me about it. Q171 Mr Watson: Okay. In 2008, another two years, why did you not dismiss News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, following the Mosley case? Rupert Murdoch: I had never heard of him. Q172 Mr Watson: Okay. Despite a judge making clear that Thurlbeck set out to blame two of the women involved? Rupert Murdoch: I didn&apos;t hear that. Q173 Mr Watson: A judge made it clear Thurlbeck set out to blackmail two of the women involved in the case. Rupert Murdoch: That is the first I have heard of that. Q174 Mr Watson: So none of your UK staff drew your attention to this serious wrongdoing, even though the case received widespread media attention? Rupert Murdoch: I think my son can perhaps answer that in more detail. He was a lot closer to it. Q175 Mr Watson: I&apos;ll come to your son in a minute. Despite the fact that blackmail can result in a 14-year prison sentence, nobody in your UK company brought this fact to your attention? Rupert Murdoch: The blackmail charge, no. Q176 Mr Watson: Do you think that might be because they knew you would think nothing of it? Rupert Murdoch: No. I can&apos;t answer. I don&apos;t know. Q177 Mr Watson: Do you agree with Mr Justice Eady when he said that the lack of action discloses a remarkable state of affairs at News International? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q178 Mr Watson: Mr Murdoch, a judge found a chief reporter guilty of blackmail. It was widely reported. He says it was a remarkable state of affairs\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: Why didn&apos;t he put him in jail? Q179 Mr Watson: Because it was a civil case.Were you aware that News International commissioned an investigation into News International e-mails by Harbottle &amp; Lewis? Rupert Murdoch: Was I\u2014 Q180 Mr Watson: Aware that News International commissioned an investigation into News International e-mails by the solicitors firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis? Rupert Murdoch: Yes. I didn&apos;t appoint them, but I was told of it happening. Q181 Mr Watson: You claimed in The Wall Street Journal that Harbottle &amp; Lewis had made a major mistake. Can I ask what mistake you were referring to? Rupert Murdoch: I think maybe that&apos;s a question again for James, but there was certainly\u2014well, we examined it, re-examined that. We found things that we immediately went to counsel with to get advice on how to present it to the police. Q182 Mr Watson: In their written response to this Committee&apos;s questions, are you aware that News International stated that both Jon Chapman and Daniel Cloke reviewed these e-mails before forwarding them to Harbottle &amp; Lewis? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q183 Mr Watson: So nobody in the company told you that two of your executives had reviewed the e-mails back then? Rupert Murdoch: I was under the understanding that everything had been sent to them. Q184 Mr Watson: Okay. You are aware that Lord Macdonald QC has since reviewed the e-mails again on behalf of News International, are you not? Rupert Murdoch: Yes. Q185 Mr Watson: You are aware that he stated he found evidence\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: And he has reported to the whole board of News Corporation. Q186 Mr Watson: He did. And you are aware that he stated to the board that he found evidence of indirect hacking, breaches of national security and evidence of serious crime in the Harbottle &amp; Lewis file. Rupert Murdoch: He did indeed. James Murdoch: Mr Watson please, I can address these in some detail, if you will allow me. Q187 Mr Watson: I will come to you, Mr Murdoch, but it is your father who is responsible for corporate governance. I want to ask about what he knew, but I will come back to you. Who was aware of the Harbottle &amp; Lewis findings at News International? Rupert Murdoch: It went to the senior officials of News Corp. Certainly the top legal officer. Q188 Mr Watson: So Tom Crone or Les Hinton? Rupert Murdoch: No. They were not the top legal officers. Q189 Mr Watson: Who were the top legal officers? Rupert Murdoch: You can answer that. James Murdoch: Mr Jon Chapman was the top legal officer of News International. Mr Crone was the head of legal affairs at News Group Newspapers. Q190 Mr Watson: Were you informed about the findings by your son, Mr Murdoch, or by Rebekah Brooks? Rupert Murdoch: I forget, but I expect it was my son. I was in daily contact with them both. Q191 Mr Watson: When were you informed about the payments made to Gordon Taylor and Max Clifford? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q192 Mr Watson: You were not informed? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q193 Mr Watson: At no point did you know that Taylor and Clifford were made payments? Rupert Murdoch: I never heard of them\u2014the first one. Q194 Mr Watson: You never informed the chief executives of News Corp that you authorised payment of \u00a3500,000? James Murdoch: Would you like me to answer the questions now Mr Watson? Q195 Mr Watson: I would like you to tell me whether you informed your father that you had authorised payments to Gordon Taylor as a result of him being the victim of a crime. James Murdoch: On the settlement with Mr Taylor, and I am happy to address the matter of Mr Taylor in some detail if you would like, my father became aware of it after the settlement was made in 2009, I believe, after the confidential settlement had become public, as a newspaper reported on the out-of-court settlement afterwards. Please understand that an out-of-court settlement of a civil claim of that nature and of that quantum is something that normally, in a company our size, the responsible executives in the territory or country would be authorised to make. That is the way the company has functioned; it is below the approval thresholds, if you will, that would have to go to my father as chairman and chief executive of the global company. Q196 Mr Watson: There are other questions I could ask on this, but there are other colleagues who have specific questions for you, Mr Murdoch, about this issue, so I will move back to your father if I can. Mr Murdoch, at what point did you find out that criminality was endemic at News of the World? Rupert Murdoch: Endemic is a very hard, wide-ranging word. I also have to be extremely careful not to prejudice the course of justice, which is taking place now. It has been disclosed. I became aware as it became apparent. I was absolutely shocked and appalled and ashamed when I heard about the Milly Dowler case, only two weeks ago, eight days before I was graciously received by the Dowlers. Q197 Mr Watson: Did you read our last report into the matter, where we referred to the collective amnesia of your executives who gave evidence to our Committee? Rupert Murdoch: I haven&apos;t heard that. I don&apos;t know who made that particular charge. Q198 Mr Watson: A parliamentary inquiry found your senior executives in the UK guilty of collective amnesia and nobody brought it to your attention. I do not see why you do not think that that is very serious. Rupert Murdoch: But you&apos;re not really saying amnesia, you&apos;re really saying lying. Q200 Mr Watson: While it has been obvious to most observers from the summer of 2009 that phone-hacking was widespread, you knew for sure in January of this year that the &quot;one rogue reporter&quot; line was false. Is that right? Rupert Murdoch: I forget the date. Q201 Mr Watson: Why was Edmondson the only person to leave News of the World last January? Rupert Murdoch: We have given all our files and all our knowledge and everything to the police. They have not given us the Mulcaire diaries, so we do not know what was in that, but there was a page that appeared to be addressed to him. Again, that is my son&apos;s\u2014 James Murdoch: Perhaps it would be helpful to the Committee\u2014if you would like to go through any of the particular detail around why decisions were made by the management team at News International and the precise chronology\u2014if I could answer those questions. As the chief executive of the regional businesses across Europe, I have somewhat more proximity to it. Mr Watson: I understand the detailed points, Mr Murdoch\u2014 James Murdoch: I am simply offering to help to clarify these matters, Mr Watson. Q202 Mr Watson: But your father is responsible for corporate governance, and serious wrongdoing has been brought about in the company. It is revealing in itself what he does not know, and what executives chose not to tell him. With respect to you, I will pursue my line of questioning and come back to you later.Mr Murdoch, why was no one fired in April, when News International finally admitted that News of the World had been engaged in criminal interception of voicemails? Rupert Murdoch: It was not our job to get in the course of justice. It was up to the police to bring the charges and to carry out their investigation, which we were 100% co-operating with. Q203 Mr Watson: But in April the company admitted liability for phone hacking, and nobody took responsibility for it then. No one was fired. The company admitted that they had been involved in criminal wrongdoing and no one was fired. Why was that? Rupert Murdoch: There were people in the company who apparently were guilty. We have to find them and we have to deal with them appropriately. James Murdoch: Mr Watson, if I can clarify: most of the individuals involved or implicated in the allegations that were there had long since left the company. Some that were still there\u2014you mentioned one\u2014exited the business as soon as evidence of wrongdoing was found. A process was set up in co-operation with the police to aid them with any of those things that they wanted to do, but many of the individuals that were potentially implicated in those civil litigations and potentially in these criminal matters had already left the building and were not in the News of the World at this time. In the current News of the World, our News of the World executives and journalists at the time\u2014many of whom were not there in 2006 and 2007, so some of them had already left. Q204 Mr Watson: Thank you. Mr Murdoch, why did you decide to risk the jobs of 200 people before pointing the finger at those responsible for running the company at the time of the illegality\u2014your son and Rebekah Brooks? Q199 Mr Watson: We found your executives guilty of collective amnesia. I would have thought that someone would like to bring that to your attention\u2014that it would concern you. Did they forget? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q200 Mr Watson: While it has been obvious to most observers from the summer of 2009 that phone-hacking was widespread, you knew for sure in January of this year that the &quot;one rogue reporter&quot; line was false. Is that right? Rupert Murdoch: I forget the date. Q201 Mr Watson: Why was Edmondson the only person to leave News of the World last January? Rupert Murdoch: We have given all our files and all our knowledge and everything to the police.

Q204 Mr Watson: Thank you. Mr Murdoch, why did you decide to risk the jobs of 200 people before pointing the finger at those responsible for running the company at the time of the illegality\u2014your son and Rebekah Brooks? Rupert Murdoch: When a company closes down, it is natural for people to lose their jobs. We have in this case made\u2014and I am making this continually\u2014every effort to see that those people are employed in other divisions of the company, if they are not part of the small group\u2014I do not know how big a group it was, but whatever group was involved with criminality. Q205 Mr Watson: Did you close the paper down because of the criminality? Rupert Murdoch: Yes, we felt ashamed at what had happened and thought we ought to bring it to a close. Q206 Mr Watson: People lied to you and lied to their readers. Rupert Murdoch: We had broken our trust with our readers; the important point was that we had broken our trust with our readers. Q207 Mr Watson: Are you aware that there are other forms of illicit surveillance being used by private investigators, which were used by News International? Rupert Murdoch: Other forms of? Q208 Mr Watson: Illicit surveillance. Computer hacking, tracking on cars. Rupert Murdoch: No. I think all news organisations have used private detectives, and do so in their investigations from time to time, but not illegally. Q209 Mr Watson: If it can be shown to you that private investigators working for newspapers in News International used other forms of illicit surveillance like computer hacking, would you immediately introduce another investigation? Rupert Murdoch: That would be up to the police, but we would certainly work with the police. If they wanted us to do it, we would do it. If they wanted to do it, they would do it. Q210 Mr Watson: Finally, can I ask you, when did you first meet Mr Alex Marunchak? Rupert Murdoch: Mister\u2014? Mr Watson: Alex Marunchak. He worked for the company for 25 years. Rupert Murdoch: I don&apos;t remember meeting him. I might have shaken hands walking through the office, but I don&apos;t have any memory of him. Mr Watson: Thank you. Q211 Jim Sheridan: Mr Murdoch senior, I have a number of short questions for you. Why did you enter the back door at No. 10 when you visited the Prime Minister following the last general election? Rupert Murdoch: Because I was asked to. Q212 Jim Sheridan: You were asked to go in the back door of No. 10? Rupert Murdoch: Yes. Q213 Jim Sheridan: Why would that be? Rupert Murdoch: To avoid photographers at the front, I imagine. I don&apos;t know. I was asked; I just did what I was told. Q214 Jim Sheridan: It is strange, given that Heads of State manage to go in the front door. Rupert Murdoch: Yes. Q215 Jim Sheridan: Yet you have to go in the back door. Rupert Murdoch: That is the choice of the Prime Minister, or his staff or whoever does these things. Q216 Jim Sheridan: So was it under the Prime Minister&apos;s direct instructions that you came in the back door? Rupert Murdoch: I was asked would I please come in through the back door. James Murdoch: I do not think my father would have any direct knowledge of the arrangements that were being made for his entry to or exit from a particular building, with respect, Mr Sheridan. Q217 Jim Sheridan: Again, Mr Murdoch, have you ever imposed any preconditions\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: Which visit to Downing Street are you talking about? Q218 Jim Sheridan: It was just following the last general election. Rupert Murdoch: I was invited within days to have a cup of tea and to be thanked by Mr Cameron for the support. No other conversation took place. It lasted minutes. Q219 Jim Sheridan: That is the one when you went in through the back door?Rupert Murdoch: Yes. I had been asked also by Mr Brown many times. Q220 Jim Sheridan: Through the back door? Rupert Murdoch: Yes. And my family went there many times. Q221 Jim Sheridan: Have you ever imposed any preconditions on a party leader in the UK before giving them the support of your newspapers? Rupert Murdoch: I never guaranteed anyone the support of my newspapers. We had been supporting the Thatcher Government and the Conservative Government that followed. We thought it had got tired and we changed and supported the Labour party 13 years ago, or whenever it was, with the direct loss of 200,000 circulation. Q222 Jim Sheridan: Did you ever impose any preconditions on either the Labour or Conservative party? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q223 Jim Sheridan: No preconditions whatever? Rupert Murdoch: No. The only conversations that I had with them\u2014with Mr Blair that I can remember\u2014were arguing about the euro. Q224 Jim Sheridan: Mr Blair visited you halfway round the world, before the 1997 election. Anyway, that does not matter. Rupert Murdoch: That was something that Mr Cameron arranged\u2014Campbell. Q225 Jim Sheridan: It is understood that the FBI is investigating 9/11 victims. Have you commissioned an investigation into these allegations? Rupert Murdoch: We have seen no evidence of that at all, and as far as we know, the FBI haven&apos;t, either. If they do, we will treat it in exactly the same way as we treat it here. I cannot believe it happened from anyone in America. Whether someone at the News of the World or Mr Mulcaire took it on himself to do it, I don&apos;t know. Q226 Jim Sheridan: I will come back to you, James, in a minute. I just want to clarify, if these allegations are in any way true, will you commission an investigation into them? Rupert Murdoch: Absolutely. Q227 Jim Sheridan: You must be horrified by the scandal, and the fact that it has cost you the BSkyB transaction and led to the closure of the News of the World. Who do you blame for that? Rupert Murdoch: A lot of people had different agendas, I think, in trying to build this hysteria. All our competitors in this country formally announced a consortium to try and stop us. They caught us with dirty hands and they built the hysteria around it. Q228 Jim Sheridan: It was your competitors that blocked it, which stopped you\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: No, I think a mood developed that made it really impractical to go ahead. James Murdoch: Mr Sheridan, we have been very clear that serious allegations of wrongdoing have been levelled at the News of the World. We believed that the actions of some reporters and people some years ago have fundamentally tarnished the trust that the News of the World had with its readers. This is a matter of huge and sincere regret\u2014mine, my father&apos;s, and the company&apos;s. The company&apos;s priority\u2014very much so\u2014is to restore that trust, operate in the right way, and make sure that the company can be the company that it has always aspired to be. The removal of the proposal to make an offer to the BSkyB shareholders who are not News Corporation is simply a reflection of that priority of moving forward. Q229 Jim Sheridan: I have every sympathy with what you are saying, but do you understand that people who have been the victims of the News of the World, based on allegations, will find that a bit strange? James Murdoch: It is our absolute priority to, with those\u2014 What happened at the News of the World was wrong. We and I have apologised profusely and unreservedly for that, and my father has as well. These are very serious matters and we are trying to establish the facts of any new allegations as they come up. We are working closely with the police to find out where the wrongdoing was and to hold people accountable. I think importantly as well, to the victims of illegal voicemail interceptions, not just have we apologised, but we have admitted liability\u2014the company has admitted liability\u2014and we have set up the appropriate third-party compensation schemes to do that. These are all matters that we are fully engaged in. Q230 Jim Sheridan: May I just return to your father? I know that this is a very stressful time for yourselves, but Mr Murdoch, do you accept that ultimately you are responsible for this whole fiasco? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q231 Jim Sheridan: You are not responsible. Who is responsible? Rupert Murdoch: The people that I trusted to run it, and then maybe the people they trusted. I worked with Mr Hinton for 52 years and I would trust him with my life. Q232 Jim Sheridan: Are you satisfied that the cash payments that were made by the News Corporation companies to informants for stories were registered with the appropriate tax authorities? Rupert Murdoch: I do not know anything about that. Perhaps James can answer. Q233 Jim Sheridan: If people were given money in order to accomplish stories\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: People were given money to\u2014 Q234 Jim Sheridan: In order to get stories\u2014did you notify the appropriate tax authorities about this? James Murdoch: All of our financial affairs as a public company are transparent and audited. The tax jurisdictions that the company works in all around the world are worked with transparently and thoroughly. Tax compliance is an important priority for any business, and we comply\u2014the company complies\u2014with the laws. Q235 Jim Sheridan: Would that also include people who are on regular monthly retainers registering their affairs with HMRC? James Murdoch: I have no knowledge of separate people on retainers at the company and their own tax affairs, or their own tax arrangements. I can speak for the company&apos;s tax arrangements and, to the best of my knowledge, we are a company that takes tax compliance, regulatory compliance, and financial and regulatory transparency hugely seriously. It is something that we are very proud of. Chair: We are coming on to some of these questions in more detail. Q236 Jim Sheridan: Can I just turn to James? You will be aware of the situation of Tommy Sheridan, the former MSP, who is currently in prison. Bob Bird, whether deliberately or inadvertently, misled the jury in Tommy Sheridan&apos;s perjury trial. Your company has not disclosed internal e-mails that may aid the appeal of Mr Sheridan. Why is that? James Murdoch: I do not have direct knowledge of that, Mr Sheridan. I apologise, but certainly if you have additional questions on that in the future, I am happy to supply written answers, but I do not have direct knowledge and I am not in a position to answer those questions. Q237 Jim Sheridan: I have a couple more questions. James, can you please confirm or deny whether any News Corporation company is the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office? James Murdoch: I have no knowledge of that at this point. Q238 Jim Sheridan: Can you also confirm or deny whether any News Corporation company is the subject of an investigation by the Financial Services Authority? James Murdoch: I do not believe so. Not to my knowledge. Q239 Jim Sheridan: Finally, please confirm or deny whether any News Corporation company is the subject of an investigation by HMRC. James Murdoch: Not to my knowledge. We have ongoing dialogue with the HMRC and various subsidiaries here but, as far as investigations are concerned, I have no knowledge of one. Q240 Dr Coffey: Mr Murdoch, who made the recommendation to close down the News of the World to the board of News Corp? I assume that it was a board decision that was made by News Corp. Rupert Murdoch: It was the result of a discussion between my son and I, and senior executives. Miss Brooks one morning called the whole board of the News Corporation to seek their agreement. Q241 Dr Coffey: You have already suggested that it is because you felt ashamed. It is not a suggestion that it was a commercial decision to decide to close the News of the World. Rupert Murdoch: Far from it. Q242 Dr Coffey: Moving on to the financial governance arrangements for the News Corp. Mr James Murdoch, you suggested earlier that the payments to Mr Taylor were not notified at News Corp level because of the finance threshold. Can you tell us a bit more about that? I understand that you had to agree for the payment to Mr Taylor. Was that made at a financial level or a managerial decision? James Murdoch: I am very happy to discuss it. Thank you. It is a good question. I am very happy to discuss the matter of Mr Taylor. The out-of-court settlement with Mr Taylor was related to a voice mail interception that had occurred previously and was actually one of the counts, as I understand it, of the 2007 trial of Mr Mulcaire. It is important to think back to 2008 to understand what we knew then, what I knew then and what the information was and the context. The underlying interception was not a disputed fact.Further to that, it was the advice and the clear view of the company that, if litigated, the company would lose that case, that it was almost certain to lose that case because the underlying fact was not in dispute. Thirdly, the company sought distinguished outside counsel to understand that, if the case were litigated and if it were to be lost, which was the great likelihood, what the financial quantum would be or what that would cost the company. It was advised that, with legal expenses and damages, it could be between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31 million or thereabouts. I do not recall the exact number of the advice. I think that it was \u00a3250,000 plus expenses, plus litigation costs\u2014something like that. Lastly, this was in a context in the first half of 2008 and it was my first real involvement with any of the issues where there was no reason at the time to believe that the issue of the voice mail interceptions was anything but a settled matter, and that it was in the past after the successful prosecution of the two individuals we discussed as well as the resignation of the editor. The out-of-court settlement was made in that context. It was within the authorities, as I understood it, of News International to be able to make those out-of-court settlements in due course without going to the global level company. At the time, I was the regional head of News Corporation for Europe and Asia, and I directed that it was all right to settle that, but did not get involved in any of the negotiations directly about the settlement. But I do recall, in 2008, that those were the things that were known. Rupert Murdoch: Can I just add that my son had only been with the company for a matter of a very few weeks? James Murdoch: For clarification, it was a few months. I had come back to the company at the end of 2007 in the middle of December, and this was sometime\u2014I don&apos;t recall the exact date\u2014in the first half of 2008. Q243 Dr Coffey: Given you were new to the company\u2014weeks, months, I do not want to have a father-son argument about that\u2014what level of financial payments could other News International executives, people like Colin Myler or Tom Crone or Rebekah Brooks, have sanctioned without recourse to you as the chairman? James Murdoch: Generally speaking, the way that the company will operate, as any company will operate, is within certain financial parameters from a financial planning perspective. We will look at a budget for a year, much like a house will manage its budget, and say, &quot;How much money do we have to spend, and how much money does a particular company or part of the company or department have to spend?&quot; As long as they stay within those guidelines, the belief is that they should be empowered to make those judgments, to spend those moneys and achieve the ends that they can. I do not have at the tip of my fingers the precise financial authorities in that, but I can discuss with you after the Committee hearing what exactly you would like to know and whether or not it is right to come back to you with that. Q244 Dr Coffey: What level of financial pay-out would have it have taken to require an authorisation from the board of News Corp? James Murdoch: I think that, for the full board, it is in some millions, but I do not know the exact answer there. Q245 Dr Coffey: Do you know how much has been paid out to people, authorised by your executives? James Murdoch: Paid out in what way, Dr Coffey? Dr Coffey: Paid out as settlements. James Murdoch: Legal settlements? I do not know the total number, but around the world it is customary to reach out-of-court settlements in civil litigations and civil matters, and, rather than go through the lengthy and sometimes expensive litigation process, with the risk that that often entails, it is customary to try to reach out-of-court settlements in many cases. Rupert Murdoch: I should just add that we have a very strong audit committee at News Corporation, which would know about this. Neither of us are members of that. They are outside directors, and they review all these things. Q246 Dr Coffey: Thank you. Building on that then, how is it possible to make payments to people if they do not invoice you or if they are not an employee of New Corps&apos;s subsidiaries? James Murdoch: I am sorry, Dr Coffey? Dr Coffey: How is it possible to transfer cash or some other form of remuneration to people who do not invoice you or who are not employees of News Corps&apos;s subsidiaries? James Murdoch: I do not know the exact arrangements of that. I don&apos;t do that myself to tell you how that is done, but sometimes, in certain instances, it is appropriate for journalists or managers in a certain environment to have the ability to use cash in some instances. It is customary, however, for them to record those, and all of the cash expenses, as well as invoice expenses, should be looked at and recorded. Q247 Dr Coffey: So things like use of petty cash\u2014that could be quite big sums of money or small\u2014at the moment you just record that the journalist gave it to somebody. James Murdoch: Yes, and I don&apos;t have direct knowledge of all of those arrangements. Q248 Dr Coffey: I was going to ask if payments could have been made to family members of those alleged to have been hacked and similar, but is it possible that other forms of remuneration can be used in your company apart from cash and bank transfers? I am talking of things like travellers cheques, vouchers and things that can be redeemed for cash. James Murdoch: I don&apos;t have knowledge of that. Q249 Dr Coffey: Just looking at some of your corporate governance\u2014page 2 and page 4 of your own code\u2014it mentions directors, employees and officers of News Corporation acting to the principles set forth, including consultants, agents, suppliers and business partners adhering to the standards. It says, &quot;We may never ask a third party to perform any act that would violate these Standards.&quot; Can you tell me a little bit more, especially on the financial side, how you, as an organisation, try and make that happen? Rupert Murdoch: How that would work is that each newspaper has an editorial manager\u2014the titles vary. They have to approve the expenses claims of every reporter. A reporter has no authority to pay money on his own. James Murdoch: Just to clarify, the managing editor&apos;s office often manages a lot of the expenses and budgets, and is directed to do so with propriety. Q250 Dr Coffey: Do you require your executives to make annual statements that they have abided by your codes of conduct and ethics? I used to work for a family-owned company. James Murdoch: Every employee, every colleague around the world of News Corporation receives the code of conduct. It is a pamphlet that has some detail in it\u2014not too much, so that people read it. With respect to what ethical conduct is required\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: We would be happy to make it available to you. James Murdoch: We would be very happy to make it available to you. It is about ethical conduct, the law, breaking the rules and so on. Everyone who becomes an employee is required to do that. Our legal counsel also internally conducts workshops around the world with staff, from Mumbai to Manchester, around those rules and code of conduct. That is something we try hard to communicate as crisply as we can to everyone in the business. Q251 Dr Coffey: I appreciate Mr Murdoch&apos;s statement at the beginning. Given that you have been in the media spotlight and perhaps, I expect, not appreciated the attention you have had, without wishing to suppress investigative journalism, will this make you think again about how you approach your headlines and targets in future? That could be people from Hillsborough 96 to celebrities to others. Will you think again about what your headlines will say in future? Rupert Murdoch: I think all our editors certainly will. I am not aware of any transgressions. It is a matter of taste. It is a very difficult issue. We have in this country a wonderful variety of voices and they are naturally very competitive. I am sure there are headlines that occasionally give offence, but it is not intentional. James Murdoch: It is important to say that one of the lessons, if you will, from all of this for us is, we do need to think as a business as well as an industry in this country more forcefully and thoughtfully about our journalistic ethics, about what exactly the codes of conduct should be, not just for News International, our UK publishing subsidiary, but the industry as a whole, and what sort of governance should be around the whole area.We welcomed last week the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement of a judicial inquiry into both journalistic ethics and relationships with police and politicians. That is a really good thing for the country and for all of the interested parties to engage with fully. One specific action we have taken to try to be as proactive as we can around this, is to set up what we call the management and standards committee, that is outside the management of our publishing company and reports through the independent directors of our global public board, precisely to look at, first, the specific issues of how we co-operate with the investigations and deal with allegations of wrongdoing and get to the bottom of it.It is also importantly about how we co-ordinate, co-operate and proactively engage with those judicial inquiries, and how we start to set a code of conduct and a code of ethics that we and it think can be both a paragon for all of our newspapers and all of the industry, but also something that has teeth and can hold the company to account. That management and standards committee is independently chaired, and we think it is going to be a much better way to go in future. We would like over the next six months and years, to be judged on the actions the company takes to put that right and put that in place. Dr Coffey: Thank you. Rupert Murdoch: I would just like to say, if I may, that it doesn&apos;t take away at all from what we have been saying about our apologies or our blame for anything, but this country does greatly benefit from having a competitive press and therefore having a very transparent society. That is sometimes very inconvenient to people. But I think we are better and stronger for it. Q252 Chair: Before I bring in my next colleague can I just come back to something Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey raised, which was the closure of the News of the World? Is it your intention to launch a new Sunday tabloid newspaper? James Murdoch: No, there are no\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: We have made no decision on that. James Murdoch: There&apos;s no decision on that. Q253 Chair: So for the moment there are no plans to have a News International title coming out on Sunday at the tabloid end of the market? James Murdoch: There are no immediate plans for that. Rupert Murdoch: But no guarantee that we won&apos;t. Q254 Chair: Fine. You have talked in the past about moving to seven-day newsrooms. There was speculation that the title &quot;The Sun on Sunday&quot; had been reserved\u2014 James Murdoch: I think we leave all those options open. That is not the company&apos;s priority now. In the last week it has come up in the company but my father&apos;s direction and my direction is that this is not the time to be worrying about that. The company has to move forward on all of these other actions and get to grips with the facts of these allegations and understand them as fully as we can. Chair: Can I appeal both to the witnesses and, indeed, to Members to try to keep brief because we still have quite a lot to get through? Q255 Mr Sanders: Good afternoon. This is to Mr James Murdoch: in your statement of 7 July 2011 you said, &quot;The Company paid out-of-court settlements approved by me\u2026 I did not have a complete picture when I did so.&quot; What do you know now that you did not know then? James Murdoch: Essentially the new information that emerged that is critical here is the information that came out of the ongoing process of civil litigations in 2010; and at the end of 2010 the presentation of evidence, which had not been in our possession previously from this civil litigation, widened the circle definitively, or at least made it very apparent that it is very likely that the circle was wider than the two individuals, Mr Goodman and Mr Mulcaire, from previously. It was that information that was really critical. If I can go back to my previous testimony just earlier today around the settlement with Mr Taylor, the commercial and legal rationality will around that settlement was very, very clear. The underlying fact was not in dispute. It was a known fact from a previous trial. The advice was very, very clear as to what sort of damages could be expected to be paid and it was quite clear and quite likely that if litigated, the company would lose that case. In the context of none of this other information\u2014this is a full year before some of the new allegations in the press arose from afar, so there was no reason to believe at the time that it was anything other than in the past.Now knowing then what I know now, would I have still directed to negotiate to settle that case? I would, actually, but I would have coupled it with the other actions that we have taken since the new evidence emerged at the end of September 2010. And that is to immediately go and look at whatever we can find internally around the individuals involved; to immediately contact the police about information that may be of great interest to them; to put in place the process, which took up a little while and we did it in the early part of 2011, around admitting liability to the civil litigants; putting a process in place to get to the bottom of what legitimate allegations there were; apologising unreservedly to the victims of those illegal voicemail intercepts, which were absolutely inexcusable; and having a system of compensation there. So if I knew then what we know now and with the benefit of hindsight we can look at all these things, but if I knew then what we know now we would have taken more action around that and moved faster to get to the bottom of these allegations. Q256 Mr Sanders: Were the settlements paid by News International, by News Corp or by News Group Newspapers? James Murdoch: I do not recall. I would imagine it was either News International or News Group Newspapers. I think it was News Group Newspapers, but I am sure we can provide you with that information. Q257 Mr Sanders: What advice did Tom Crone and Colin Myler give you on the payment to Gordon Taylor? James Murdoch: The advice from Mr Myler and Mr Crone was as I have described it. The underlying fact of the case was known because it had come up in the trial of Mr Mulcaire. Q258 Mr Sanders: Were you aware that the case involved the criminal act of phone hacking? James Murdoch: That was my understanding. The litigation was for damages for the illegal voice mail interceptions. Q259 Mr Sanders: When did you get that advice? James Murdoch: In the first half of 2008. Q260 Mr Sanders: In 2009, Mr Crone and Mr Myler informed us that they decided to settle Mr Taylor&apos;s claim on the advice of the company&apos;s external legal advisers. Was that advice from Farrer &amp; Co. solicitors? James Murdoch: Farrer &amp; Co. has done work for us. I do not know precisely which external counsel Mr Crone and Mr Myler engaged on that, but I can clarify it. Q261 Mr Sanders: Did you see the advice, whether it was from Farrer &amp; Co. or anyone else? James Murdoch: No. I received the advice orally from Mr Myler and Mr Crone. Q262 Mr Sanders: What was their advice? James Murdoch: It was as I described it. Q263 Mr Sanders: Simply to settle? James Murdoch: And that outside legal advice had been taken on the expected quantum of damages. Their advice was that the case would be lost and that, in the absence of any new evidence\u2014I was certainly not made aware of any new evidence\u2014it was simply a matter related to events that came to light in 2007 and in the criminal trials before I was there. It was a matter in the past.The police had also closed their case and said that there was no new evidence, so the context is of a case based on events that were a year old or more and on underlying activities prior to that. That is where we were. Q264 Mr Sanders: Was part of the advice that a high payment would ensure the matter was kept confidential? James Murdoch: No, not at all. Out-of-court settlements are normally confidential. I do not know of many out-of-court settlements that are not kept confidential, although I am sure there are some.There was nothing about confidentiality. I think I understand where you are going with this, Mr Sanders, but, no, the amount paid rested on advice from outside counsel on the amount we would be expected to pay in damages, plus expenses and litigation costs. Q265 Mr Sanders: Did you question why such high payments were made to Mr Taylor and Mr Clifford? It has been suggested that the figures were \u00a3700,000 and \u00a31 million respectively for invasions of privacy, but the record privacy damages awarded by a court remains \u00a360,000, ironically against News of the World. James Murdoch: I did question the amount, but not in relation to the \u00a360,000. If you recall the chronology, and I am sure you do, the \u00a360,000 award against News of the World, which I believe was the Mosley case, came after we sought advice from senior, distinguished outside counsel on the quantum of damages that we could be expected to pay to Mr Taylor and Mr Clifford. Their advice was that the damages could be \u00a3250,000 plus expenses and litigation costs, which were expected to be between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31 million. That is my recollection of it. The chronology is important, because afterwards we obviously would have had different information, but it was not afterwards, it was before. Q266 Mr Sanders: You have since said that when you approved the Taylor settlement, you did not have all the facts. What do you know now that you did not know then? James Murdoch: As I have testified, the key facts and evidence came to light at the end of 2010 as the lengthy due process on the civil litigations on the matters took its course. It was that process that unearthed the key evidence. It was really only after that that the police said that they should restart the investigation. As soon as we had that new information, at the end of 2010, which indicated to us that there was a wider involvement, we acted on it immediately. Q267 Mr Sanders: Tom Crone said last week he did not know why he left News Group Newspapers. Can you clarify why he was asked to leave after 26 years of service? James Murdoch: Last week\u2014two weeks ago, I guess\u2014the News of the World published its last paper. Mr Crone was very involved with News of the World matters over the years. The company believed and the management of the company believed that it was time to part ways. I was not involved in those direct discussions with Mr Crone, and I cannot comment on their nature or their content; I do not have knowledge of them. Q268 Mr Sanders: The New Statesman carried a story last week that News International subsidised Andy Coulson&apos;s wages after he left your employ. Can you shed any light on that? James Murdoch: I have no knowledge of Andy Coulson&apos;s wages after he left the company&apos;s employment. Q269 Mr Sanders: Finally, are you familiar with the term &quot;wilful blindness&quot;? James Murdoch: Mr Sanders, would you care to elaborate? Q270 Mr Sanders: It is a term that came up in the Enron scandal. Wilful blindness is a legal term. It states that if there is knowledge that you could have had and should have had, but chose not to have, you are still responsible. James Murdoch: Mr Sanders, do you have a question? Respectfully, I just do not know what you would like me to say. Q271 Mr Sanders: The question was whether you were aware\u2014 James Murdoch: I am not aware of that particular phrase. Q272 Mr Sanders: But now you are familiar with the term, because I have explained it to you. James Murdoch: Thank you, Mr Sanders. Rupert Murdoch: I have heard the phrase before, and we were not ever guilty of that. Q273 Philip Davies: I am not sure whether you acknowledged this at the start or not, but certainly the Chairman did: when we had our inquiry in 2009, the evidence given by News International executives was rather hopeless. They came with a game plan, which was to tell us that they did not know anything, they could not remember anything and they did not know anybody who would know anything. I wonder, just so that we can get off on a reasonable footing, what sort of coaching you have had for today. Who has advised you on how to handle this session and what was their advice? James Murdoch: With respect to today, after scheduling this appearance, we took some advice around the context of this sort of setting\u2014it is my first time and, I think, my father&apos;s first time, in a Committee meeting like this\u2014mostly on logistics, what sort of questions you would ask and so on. We were advised, fundamentally, to tell the truth, and to come and be as open and transparent as possible. That is my and my father&apos;s intent and intention, and we hope that we can show you that that is what is happening. Q274 Philip Davies: Mr Murdoch senior, in answer to some questions from Mr Watson, you seemed to indicate that you had a rather hands-off approach to your company. The point you made was that the News of the World was less than 1% of your entire worldwide business, so you would not really be expected to know the ins and outs of what was going on. Could you just give us an illustration of how many times or how often you would speak to the editor of your newspapers\u2014for example, how often you would speak to the editor of The Sun or to the editor of the News of the World? Rupert Murdoch: Very seldom. Sometimes, I would ring the editor of the News of the World on a Saturday night and say, &quot;Have you got any news tonight?&quot; But it was just to keep in touch. I ring the editor of The Sunday Times nearly every Saturday\u2014not to influence what he has to say at all. I am very careful always to premise any remark I made to him by saying, &quot;I&apos;m just inquiring.&quot; I&apos;m not really in touch. I have got to tell you that, if there is an editor that I spend most time with, it is the editor of The Wall Street Journal, because I am in the same building. But to say that we are hands-off is wrong; I work a 10 or 12-hour day, and I cannot tell you the multitude of issues that I have to handle every day. The News of the World perhaps I lost sight of, maybe because it was so small in the general frame of our company, but we are doing a lot of other things too. Q275 Philip Davies: I understand, but perhaps I can help you out here. If somebody had told me that you would speak to someone like the editor of The Sun at least daily and maybe twice a day, would you recognise that description or would that be\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: No. Q276 Philip Davies: You wouldn&apos;t historically\u2014traditionally\u2014have spoken to the editor of The Sun that number of times? Rupert Murdoch: No. I&apos;d like to, but no. Q277 Philip Davies: You said you speak to the editor of the News of the World, maybe on a Saturday night before publication\u2014not to influence what they have to say, I understand that. I am intrigued as to how these conversations go. I would have imagined that, to the editor of the News of the World, it would go something along the lines of, &quot;Anything to report?&quot; or &quot;Anything interesting going on?&quot; And the editor of the News of the World says, &quot;No, no, it&apos;s been a standard week; we paid Gordon Taylor \u00a3600,000&quot;. Rupert Murdoch: He never said that last sentence. Q278 Philip Davies: Surely in your weekly conversations with the editor of the News of the World, with something as big as that\u2014paying someone \u00a31 million or \u00a3700,000\u2014you would have expected the editor just to drop it into the conversation at some point during your weekly chat. Rupert Murdoch: No. Q279 Philip Davies: You wouldn&apos;t have expected them to say that to you? Rupert Murdoch: No. Philip Davies: So what on earth were you\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: Let me say, I did not really call him weekly, but I would have called him at least once a month, I&apos;d guess. Q280 Philip Davies: What would you discuss with them? If things like that were not on the agenda, what was on the agenda? Rupert Murdoch: I&apos;d say, &quot;What&apos;s doing?&quot; Philip Davies: Sorry? Rupert Murdoch: I&apos;d say, &quot;What&apos;s doing?&quot; Q281 Philip Davies: And what sort of response would you expect? Rupert Murdoch: He might say, &quot;We&apos;ve got a great story exposing X or Y&quot; or, more likely, he would say, &quot;Nothing special&quot;. He might refer to the fact that however many extra pages were dedicated to the football that week. Q282 Philip Davies: But he wouldn&apos;t tell you about a \u00a31 million payoff? Rupert Murdoch: No. Q283 Philip Davies: It is just interesting to somebody like me. Rupert Murdoch: He would expect other people to tell me that, if anyone was to. Q284 Philip Davies: James, would you acknowledge then that in your view you overpaid Max Clifford and Gordon Taylor? James Murdoch: I can&apos;t speak to the arrangements with Mr Clifford, as I do not have direct knowledge, in terms of\u2014I was not involved in that piece. With respect to the Taylor piece, I made a judgment given the advice of counsel and the advice of the executives involved. Going back and looking at what we knew in 2008, looking at that advice, remembering that advice and looking at the context of the time, if we step back those three years, it was a decision that, given that context, I would still stand by, I think. Q285 Philip Davies: It just seems\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: Apparently, there was a contract with Mr Clifford, which was cancelled by Mr Coulson. James Murdoch: I don&apos;t know about that. I don&apos;t know if you have knowledge of that. Mr Davies, sorry: you were going on? Philip Davies: It just seems strange to me that\u2014 Rupert Murdoch: I don&apos;t know what was in the contract, but there was a particular break with Max Clifford. Q286 Philip Davies: We might ask you to come back with details about that.It seems odd to me as a layman that while we are talking about \u00a3600,000 or \u00a31 million, Andy Gray had his phone hacked and did not get \u00a3600,000, \u00a3500,000, \u00a3200,000 or even \u00a350,000; he got \u00a320,000. It seems bizarre that somebody can have their phone hacked and get \u00a320,000 and somebody else gets their phone hacked and gets \u00a3600,000 or \u00a31 million. Surely you can see that the distinction that most people draw is that one payment was made when it was all out in the open and everybody knew about all these things\u2014Andy Gray\u2014and the other was paid when it was trying to be kept rather quiet\u2014\u00a3600,000. Do you not see that, to most people looking at that, it smells a bit? James Murdoch: Mr Davies, I understand where you are coming from and I understand that these are big sums of money we are talking about\u2014\u00a3100,000, \u00a3200,000, \u00a3600,000. That is a lot of money, and you look at that and say, &quot;Why would a company do that?&quot; I would go back to my answer to Mr Sanders&apos;s question, which was, just to be precise about the chronology\u2014I am not a lawyer, and I apologise, but my understanding\u2014 Philip Davies: I got your answer to\u2014 James Murdoch: Mr Davies, I would like to answer this question. My understanding is that the \u00a360,000 judgment in the Mosley case, which was after the advice given on the Gordon Taylor settlement, is an important chronology. Courts and judges have set a different standard here. What we knew, and what I knew, at the time was that we had senior distinguished outside counsel to whom we had gone to ask, &quot;If this case were litigated, and if the company were to lose the case, what sort of damages would we expect to pay?&quot; The company received an answer that was substantial. Q287 Philip Davies: The answer was \u00a3250,000, so you settled for \u00a3600,000. We will move on\u2014 James Murdoch: It is important to be clear, Mr Davies. I apologise, but it is important to be clear. The \u00a3600,000 or \u00a3700,000 included damages, legal fees and an estimation of what it would have cost otherwise, because the other side of the negotiation understands this. So it is damages plus cost that gets you to that number. Respectfully, it is important to be clear about that. I agree: they are big numbers. Q288 Philip Davies: I want to concentrate on payments that you have made to your staff. Going back to the trial of Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman, Clive Goodman pleaded guilty to phone hacking, a criminal offence. Did News International pay Clive Goodman&apos;s legal fees for his trial? James Murdoch: I want to be clear about the chronology. First, I do not have first-hand knowledge of those times. Remember that my involvement in these matters started in 2008. In 2007, up until December, I was wholly focused in my role as chief executive of a public company. I was not involved in those things. Q289 Philip Davies: Who would know? James Murdoch: I can try to answer the first question first. It is customary, in certain instances of employees with litigations, to pay some legal expenses on their behalf to try to bring all the evidence to a court. That has all been done, since I have had any involvement and knowledge of this, in accordance with legal advice about the proper way to do things. But I cannot speak to the 2007 arrangements; I do not have first-hand knowledge of those. Q290 Philip Davies: Again, I will try to help out. Clive Goodman employed the services of a QC called John Kelsey-Fry. I do not know whether you have come across John Kelsey-Fry or whether he is a lawyer whom News International uses a lot. James Murdoch: He is not known to me. Q291 Philip Davies: He is probably one of the most eminent lawyers in the country, certainly one of the most expensive ones. He is the sort-of go-to lawyer for celebrities; I think Steven Gerrard used him fairly recently. It seems odd to me that a journalist on the News of the World who is pleading guilty to a crime uses in mitigation probably the most expensive lawyer in the country, which obviously leads most people to suspect that his legal fees were not being paid by himself, but were being paid by News International. Given that he was pleading guilty to a criminal act\u2014phone hacking\u2014which presumably leads to summary dismissal over gross misconduct, why on earth would News International even think or dream about paying the legal fees of someone who was engaged in criminal activity and had committed something that was clearly gross misconduct? James Murdoch: Mr Davies, I do not have any direct knowledge of the specific legal arrangements with Mr Goodman in 2007, so I cannot answer the specifics of that question. What I can say\u2014because I have asked the question as well, more recently than that, with respect to whom the company pays and what contributions to legal fees the company makes, and so on\u2014is that I have been surprised that it is customary in here to sometimes make contributions to the legal costs of either co-defendants or defendants in related matters. This is legal counsel telling me this. I have no direct knowledge of the particular instance that you mentioned, and if you have any additional specific questions about that, perhaps, Mr Chairman, we can follow up with you on that. I am happy to do that. Q292 Philip Davies: It is all very well, but these are issues that go back some time. I am surprised that you have not followed up on them already. Were any payments made subsequently to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire after their convictions? Did News International make any payments at all to those two people following their convictions? James Murdoch: I would like to answer that question. I think it is a good question, and it is a specific question. To my knowledge, because allegations were made that legal fees had been paid after that time in 2007 to those people, I asked the question myself and I was very surprised to find that the company had made certain contributions to legal settlements. I do not have all the details around each of those\u2014not legal settlements, sorry; legal fees. I was very surprised to find out that that had occurred. Q293 Philip Davies: Who authorised them? James Murdoch: They were done, as I understand it, in accordance with legal counsel and the strong advice\u2014 Q294 Philip Davies: I did not ask who advised them. Who signed it off? Who at News International agreed to make those payments? Who signed the cheques? Who agreed to make those payments? James Murdoch: I do not know who signed off those payments. Q295 Philip Davies: Well, who would? We talked about corporate governance earlier\u2014you talked about the managing editor. Would you expect the managing editor to have made that decision?James Murdoch: It would have been the management of the legal cases, I would think. I am happy to go back and look at that, but it was not something that came to my attention for approval. Q296 Philip Davies: But who would make that decision? Rupert Murdoch: I would just like to say that figures of that amount would certainly not come before, or have anything to do with, the managing editors. Q297 Philip Davies: It wouldn&apos;t? Would it have been above the managing editor or below the managing editor? Rupert Murdoch: It would be above. James Murdoch: This would have been on legal advice payments made about how to handle litigations. Again, I do not have direct knowledge or details about the current status of those, but I can tell you that I was surprised as you are to find that some of those arrangements had been made. Q298 Philip Davies: Mr Murdoch senior, I seem to be getting further with you, for which I am grateful. Would it have been Les Hinton? Would he have had to sign that off? Rupert Murdoch: It could have been. Q299 Philip Davies: Would have been or could have been? Rupert Murdoch: Could have been. Q300 Philip Davies: Who else could it have been? Rupert Murdoch: The chief legal officer. Are we talking about signing cheques or approval? Q301 Philip Davies: Both. Rupert Murdoch: Signing cheques could be the assistant CFO, or someone, but it would be on the instructions of the chief legal officer. Q302 Philip Davies: James, you said that you were not involved in the decision to get rid of Tom Crone. Whose decision was that? James Murdoch: The management of the company at the time. Q303 Philip Davies: Who? James Murdoch: Recently, the chief executive Mrs Brooks. Q304 Philip Davies: It was her decision. James Murdoch: She is the chief executive of the company, and senior-level personnel decisions are made by them. Q305 Philip Davies: Stuart Kuttner left the company either the day, or the day after, allegations were made in The Guardian originally about phone hacking. Was that linked? Did he resign? Was he sacked? What happened to Stuart Kuttner, and how did he leave the company? James Murdoch: That I don&apos;t know; that would have been at the time a matter for News of the World. Rupert Murdoch: It is for you to ask him. Q306 Philip Davies: Why did Les Hinton resign? Rupert Murdoch: Les Hinton resigned, sadly, last Friday, following Rebekah Brooks&apos;s resignation, saying, &quot;I was in charge of the company during this period that we are under criticism for, and I feel I must step down.&quot; Q307 Philip Davies: Were either Rebekah Brooks or Les Hinton asked to leave, or did they ask to leave? Rupert Murdoch: They both asked to leave. Q308 Philip Davies: Why did you not accept Rebekah Brooks&apos;s resignation when she first offered it? Rupert Murdoch: Because I believed her and I trusted her, and I do trust her. Q309 Philip Davies: So why did you accept it the second time around? Rupert Murdoch: In the event, she just insisted. She was at a point of extreme anguish Q310 Philip Davies: Can you tell us how much all these characters have been paid off? How much have they been given as a financial settlement on their departure from News International? Rupert Murdoch: No, I can&apos;t tell you, but in the case of Mr Hinton, it would certainly be considerable, because there would be a pension for 52 years&apos; service, and a great deal of thanks. Q311 Philip Davies: Would it be ten million? Five million? Rupert Murdoch: Those are pounds? I do not know\u2014 James Murdoch: Those are confidential. Rupert Murdoch: They are certainly confidential. Q312 Philip Davies: Is there any confidentiality in their pay-off that means that they are not supposed to speak about what happened, their time at your company or what they know? Rupert Murdoch: No. James Murdoch: Mr Davies, in the settlement or compromise agreement when somebody resigns or leaves the business in circumstances like this, there are commercial confidentiality agreements, but nothing that would stop or inhibit the executive from co-operating fully with investigations, from being transparent about any wrongdoing or anything like that. It is important to note that these agreements are made on the basis of no evidence of impropriety. If evidence of impropriety emerges or was there prior to that departure, you would have a different piece. That is an important point to be clear about. Q313 Philip Davies: It seems on the face of it that the News of the World was sacrificed to try and protect Rebekah Brooks&apos; position at News International. In effect, instead of her departure being announced, the News of the World was offered up as an alternative to try to deal with the whole thing. Do you now regret making that decision? Do you regret closing the News of the World to try to save Rebekah Brooks? In hindsight, do you wish that you had accepted her resignation to start with, so that that paper with a fine tradition could continue and all the people who are now out of work or are struggling to find a job could still be in work? Rupert Murdoch: I regret very much the fate of people who will not be able to find work. The two decisions were absolutely and totally unrelated. Q314 Philip Davies: So when you came into the UK and said that your priority was Rebekah Brooks, what did you mean? Rupert Murdoch: I am not sure I did say that; I was quoted as saying that. I walked outside my flat and had about 20 microphones stuck at my mouth, so I&apos;m not sure what I said. Q315 Philip Davies: You were misquoted, so to speak. Rupert Murdoch: I am not saying that. I just don&apos;t remember. James Murdoch: Mr Davies, it is important to remember that the closure of a newspaper with a history of 160-some odd years is a grave and serious matter of regret for us and for the company. But much more serious than that is the violation of privacy, and the hurt that certain individuals at News of the World caused to the victims of illegal voicemail interceptions and their families. I can tell you that I advocated at the time that this was the step that we should take. This was a paper and a title that had fundamentally violated the trust of its readers. It was a matter of great regret and real gravity, but under the circumstances and with the bad things that were done at News of the World some years ago, it was the right choice for the paper to cease publication.It is important to note, and I want to be clear with the Committee on this, that the company is doing everything it can to make sure that we find re-employment, wherever we can, for journalists and staff at the News of the World who had nothing to do with any of these issues and who are completely blameless in any of these things. Many have done tremendous work journalistically, professionally and commercially for the business. The company is being as generous as we can under the circumstances, it is being as thoughtful and compassionate as we can for them and their families to get through this, but it is a very regrettable situation, and we did not take it lightly in any way. Chair: You have made that clear. Members, I am going to ask for brevity. I don&apos;t want to cut anyone off, but we have some way to go. Q316 Paul Farrelly: I want to return to how John opened the session and the evidence that was given to us previously. Mr Davies omitted to ask one key question. Mr James Murdoch, through all the civil actions, have you\u2014not you personally, but your organisation\u2014been paying Glenn Mulcaire&apos;s legal fees? James Murdoch: As I said earlier in answer to a question from Mr Davies\u2014[Interruption.] Q317 Paul Farrelly: Let&apos;s keep it short. Yes or no? It is a yes or no question. James Murdoch: I do not know the current status of this. You asked the question have I paid all Mr Mulcaire&apos;s legal fees. Q318 Paul Farrelly: Have you been paying legal fees for Glenn Mulcaire during the course of the civil actions? James Murdoch: I don&apos;t know the details of the civil actions, but I do know that certain legal fees were paid for Mr Mulcaire by the company. I was as surprised and shocked to learn that as you are. Q319 Paul Farrelly: Can you understand that people might ask why a company might wish to pay the legal fees of a convicted felon, who has been intimately involved in the destruction of your reputation, if it were not to buy his co-operation and silence? James Murdoch: No, it is not. I can understand that, and that is exactly why I asked the question\u2014when the allegations came out, I said, &quot;How can we? Are we doing this? Is this what the company is doing?&quot; On legal advice\u2014again, I do not want to be legalistic; I am not a lawyer, but these are serious litigations and it is important for all of the evidence from all of the defendants to get to court at the right time. The strong advice was that, from time to time, it is important, and customary even, to pay a co-defendant&apos;s legal fees. I have to rest on counsel&apos;s advice on some of these serious litigation matters. Q320 Paul Farrelly: Is the organisation still contributing to Glenn Mulcaire&apos;s legal fees? James Murdoch: As I said earlier, Mr Farrelly, I do not know the precise status of that now, but I do know that I asked for the company to find a way for those things to cease with respect to these things. Q321 Paul Farrelly: Will you let us know? James Murdoch: I am happy to follow up with the Committee on the status of those legal fees. Q322 Paul Farrelly: This is a serious question, Mr Murdoch senior. Is it not time for the organisation to say, &quot;Enough is enough&quot;? This man allegedly hacked the phone of the murdered schoolgirl, Milly Dowler. Is it not time for your organisation to say, &quot;Do your worst. You behaved disgracefully. We are not going to pay any more of your costs.&quot;? Rupert Murdoch: I would like to do that. I do not know the status of what we are doing, or indeed what his contract was and whether it still has any force. Q323 Paul Farrelly: If the organisation is still paying his fees, will you give the instruction now that that should stop? Rupert Murdoch: Provided that it is not in breach of a legal contract, yes. Q324 Paul Farrelly: I want to return to the question of making statements to Parliament without being in full possession of the facts. During our 2009 inquiry, all the witnesses who came to us testified to being intimately involved in, in particular, a huge trawl of e-mails after the arrival of Colin Myler. It seems that, over the past few days, they have been rather quick to try to distance themselves from that investigation, according to some of the quotes in the newspapers. It was stated to us clearly that that trawl, that investigation uncovered no new evidence: it was still a lone rogue reporter. Mr James Murdoch, can you tell us about the file of e-mails, the so-called internal report that was discovered, allegedly\u2014we read in the pages of The Sunday Times, a great newspaper\u2014in the offices of Harbottle &amp; Lewis. Can you tell us a bit more about when that was discovered, when you first came to know about it and what is in it? James Murdoch: I first came to know about that earlier this year, in 2011. Q325 Paul Farrelly: Can you be more precise about the time? You have a great grasp of knowledge. James Murdoch: It would have been in the spring time. I do not remember the exact date when I was told about it. Q326 Paul Farrelly: Before April? James Murdoch: It would have been April or May. I can try to find meeting schedules and what not and come back, but it was a few months ago. I can speak a little bit to it, but as to the activity that was carried out in 2007, again I piece this back together from the past\u2014it was before any of my involvement. At the company at the time that I think you are referring to, there was an unfair dismissal case that was brought by Mr Goodman and that was the basis for conducting\u2014it was right about the time of the convictions. It was all in that period of time. Q327 Paul Farrelly: That was what we inferred, as stated in our report last year, despite the assurances as to the other motivations. James Murdoch: It was right at the time Mr Myler had come in. Codes of standard had been talked about\u2014this was before my time\u2014all of the 2007 business was there, and an investigation was done, or a fact-finding piece around this. Outside counsel was brought in\u2014it was Harbottle &amp; Lewis\u2014by the company at the time. I understand that the legal executives\u2014I think it was Mr Chapman at the time, along with Mr Myler, who testified to this effect\u2014took a report. From then, the opinion was clear that as to their review, there was no additional illegality in respect of phone hacking in that file. As to their review, that opinion was clear. The company really rested on a number of things from then on. I certainly know that in 2009, when additional allegations came in the summer, the company really rested on a handful of things. Q328 Paul Farrelly: We know this. I want to move right up to date to what was discovered in the offices of Harbottle &amp; Lewis and when it was discovered. James Murdoch: In 2010, after the civil litigations had put a spotlight on or unearthed, if you will, to us, to the company, additional new evidence and new information that had not been there before and the police investigation started off, one of the things that was gone back and looked at\u2014I suppose it was in the spring, by senior people at News International\u2014was that file. It was re-looked at; it was opened up and looked at, and it was very rapidly brought to our attention that this was something that would be\u2014 Q329 Paul Farrelly: When did this happen? When was this looked at? James Murdoch: Again, this is between May and\u2014April, May and June in that period. Q330 Paul Farrelly: Who looked at it first? It was reputedly Will Lewis. James Murdoch: The people managing the work on behalf of News International from early this year have been led by Mr Lewis. That is correct. Q331 Paul Farrelly: What is in that file? It has been reported as a collection of 300 e-mails, or a loose-leaf binder\u2014what is it? James Murdoch: As you know, there is an ongoing criminal investigation. I think it would be wrong of me to talk about specific information or evidence that is subject to and could make problems for the police in doing the important work that they are currently doing. Q332 Paul Farrelly: I don&apos;t think it is going to cause problems for the police if you tell us whether it is A4, foolscap, e-mails, in a ring binder, loose-leaf\u2014what is it? James Murdoch: It is paper. I think there are some e-mails, some documents\u2014 Q333 Paul Farrelly: Have you read it all? James Murdoch: I have not read it all, but some e-mails, some things in it have been shown to me. Q334 Paul Farrelly: What was your reaction? Was there an expletive that you used when you first read some of these e-mails? James Murdoch: I try not to utter expletives.  Q335 Paul Farrelly: But when you do\u2014occasionally, when you do.  James Murdoch: My reaction immediately was to agree with the recommendation of the executives involved, which was that this was something that we should bring to the attention of the police with respect to their ongoing investigations, and perhaps new ones.  Q336 Paul Farrelly: When was it given to the police? It has been reported as 20 June.  James Murdoch: I believe it was in June, after we informed the board of the company as well.  Q337 Paul Farrelly: That date is accurate.  James Murdoch: I believe it was June, yes.  Q338 Paul Farrelly: The Sunday Times\u2014a great newspaper\u2014painted a picture on 10 July, from this file, that a cabal of six so-called gatekeepers on the news desk dealt with Glenn Mulcaire. It named them as Alex Marunchak, Greg Miskiw, Clive Goodman, Neville Thurlbeck, James Weatherup and Ian Edmondson. Do you recognise that summary from the file that you have had a look at?  James Murdoch: Mr Farrelly, respectfully, I would ask you to please understand that detailed questions about any of the evidence or information that we have passed to the police in relation to their ongoing criminal inquiries are difficult for me to answer. I would appreciate it if we could allow the police to undergo the important work that they are undergoing. There is a process that is important. We are co-operating with it. We are providing information on a regular basis\u2014the company is providing information on a regular basis, as needed by the police. I really believe that we have to allow the police to conduct their investigation and hold the people who did wrong to account in this area.  Rupert Murdoch: If we were to comment on anything now, it could result in guilty people\u2014  Q339 Paul Farrelly: I fully understand that. I will respect that. Clearly, the descriptions in the press\u2014they are on the record, including in The Sunday Times\u2014mention that the e-mails implicate Andy Coulson in knowledge of payments to the police, but I would not expect you to comment on that. I will turn to the Harbottle &amp; Lewis letter that was provided to us by Rebekah Brooks as evidence during our inquiry that this trawl of e-mails had produced nothing more. That letter from Lawrence Abramson, then senior partner of Harbottle &amp; Lewis, mentioned that e-mails of Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Ian Edmondson, Clive Goodman, Neil Wallis and Jules Stenson had been reviewed and that nothing had come to light that contradicted that it had been a lone, rogue reporter working with Glenn Mulcaire. Knowing what you know now from the other evidence you have discovered, have you looked back in detail at the basis on which Harbottle &amp; Lewis wrote that letter and why they gave such a clean bill of health?  James Murdoch: All I can say is that, having looked at some of the things in that and the advice of the senior people inside the company who looked at that more recently, it was the company&apos;s view, self-evidently, that it was right to bring this to the attention of the police and go forward. That opinion from the counsel was something that the company rested on. It was a clear opinion about a review that was done around those records, and in conjunction with the police continuing to say that there was no new evidence and that there was no reason to open a new investigation, and in conjunction with the PCC saying that it had done its review and its inquiry and that there was nothing new there, it was viewed that it was a settled matter. It was only when new evidence emerged that those three things began to be undermined.  Q340 Paul Farrelly: In a follow-up to the session, could you provide us with the instructions that were given to Harbottle &amp; Lewis, as well as the extent of the information that was given to them out of the totality of information that was available? That information would help us conclude what really happened.  James Murdoch: If additional detail is required around those legal instructions, we will consult and come back to the Chairman with a way to satisfy you with the information that you&apos;d like to have.  Q341 Paul Farrelly: Clearly, we spotted in our report that this view coincided not so much with Mr Myler&apos;s arrival, but with the timing of the industrial tribunal actions that Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire were planning. That begged the question of why these six individuals were named in there. Do you know why it was limited to these six individuals?  James Murdoch: Why it was limited to those six individuals, I don&apos;t know. I was not there at the time and I cannot tell you the circumstances and the conversations that people had with Harbottle &amp; Lewis or the terms of reference of that, but it had been viewed after the fact that it had been a thorough look at information, and based on that review, that opinion was issued.  Q342 Paul Farrelly: Neville Thurlbeck is one omission that immediately jumps out.  James Murdoch: Again, in hindsight we can all say, &quot;If somebody had looked at this,&quot; or, &quot;If somebody had known something that was not known at the time,&quot; but I cannot comment on why the terms and the scope were what they were.  Q343 Paul Farrelly: The proceedings by Goodman and Mulcaire for unfair dismissal, notwithstanding their criminal conviction, clearly never saw the light of day because they were settled beforehand, so we do not know what they were planning to serve on you. Do you know what sorts of allegations they were making? We can only imagine that they were saying that such-and-such a person knew and such-and-such a person knew. Have you satisfied yourself about what allegations they were making?  James Murdoch: Many of the individuals you mentioned are currently subject to criminal investigation and some of them have been arrested recently. These are important matters for the police. It is important that I do not stray into or that I am not lead into commenting specifically about individuals or allegations made in the past.  Q344 Paul Farrelly: The question was whether you had satisfied yourself about what Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire were alleging in the discussions and negotiations that led up to the settlements, if they brought industrial tribunal proceedings against you. That was the question: not about what they were alleging, but whether you have satisfied yourself about what they were alleging.  James Murdoch: As to Glenn Mulcaire, I am not aware of allegations at the time and other things. As to Goodman\u2014again, this was in 2007, before I was there\u2014it is my understanding that that is what Harbottle &amp; Lewis were helping to deal with, and that that opinion did satisfy the company at the time and we, the company, rested on that opinion for a period of time.  Q345 Paul Farrelly: I take it you would like to take the opportunity to withdraw this letter as an accurate portrayal of what really went on at the News of the World.  James Murdoch: Is that the letter of\u2014  Q346 Paul Farrelly: It is the Harbottle &amp; Lewis letter.  James Murdoch: I am glad you have asked about it, actually, because it is a key bit of outside legal advice from senior counsel that was provided to the company, and the company rested on it. I think it goes some distance in explaining why it has taken a long time for new information to come out. I would say, Mr Farrelly, it was one of the bases for, if you will, the sort of pushback that the company made against new allegations. It was one of the pillars of the environment around the place that led the company to believe that all of these things were a matter of the past and that new allegations could be denied.  Q347 Paul Farrelly: Again, the question was different, Mr Murdoch. I asked you whether this letter, which is still lying on the record as evidence given to this Committee, has not, for whatever reason\u2014no doubt, you will say it is to do with the criminal investigation\u2014been withdrawn. Would you like to withdraw it?  James Murdoch: Respectfully, I am not aware of the legal technicalities of withdrawing that or of submitting it on the record. I think it is a relevant document in trying to understand how News International was thinking at the time.  Paul Farrelly: We will ask you the question when\u2014  James Murdoch: I would say no, but I can come back after taking counsel and seeing if it is a better idea to do it.  Q348 Paul Farrelly: I want to wind up, but I have a few more questions. As you have described it, and as Colin Myler described it, the e-mail investigation was carried out by the IT department and it was overseen by the director of legal affairs, Jon Chapman, and the human resources director, Daniel Cloke. Is that your understanding?  James Murdoch: Pardon me, what was the question? Is it my understanding that\u2014?  Q349 Paul Farrelly: The investigation itself, which you and Colin Myler have described to us, was carried out by the IT department and overseen by the director of legal affairs, Jon Chapman, and the human resources\u2014personnel\u2014director, Daniel Cloke. Is that an accurate description?  James Murdoch: That is my understanding.  Q350 Paul Farrelly: Can you tell us why Jon Chapman has left the organisation?  James Murdoch: Jon Chapman and the organisation decided it was in mutual interest to part ways. I think one of the pieces here as well is for the company to move forward\u2014I think this is important\u2014and even if there is no evidence of wrongdoing or anything like that, and no evidence of impropriety, many individuals have chosen that it is time to part ways. I was not involved with the discussions with Mr Chapman. Q351 Paul Farrelly: You have no evidence of any complicity by Mr Chapman to cover up the existence of the file that was belatedly discovered.  James Murdoch: I do not have that.  Q352 Paul Farrelly: Can you tell us the employment status of Daniel Cloke?  James Murdoch: Mr Cloke left the company some time ago and I don&apos;t know what his employment is. He is not in the business. He was the director of human resources for a number of years\u2014not that many, actually; I am not sure\u2014but left over a year ago. I can follow up that status with you.  Q353 Paul Farrelly: Okay. Referring just very quickly to the witnesses who came to us, again in respect of the file that you discovered this year, regarding Les Hinton, when did he first become aware of this collection of e-mails and paper, as you called it, that clearly rendered the evidence given by him to us misleading? When did he know?  James Murdoch: I cannot speak to Mr Hinton&apos;s knowledge. Are you referring to 2011 or 2007?  Q354 Paul Farrelly: The document that was left\u2014  James Murdoch: In 2007. I cannot speak to his knowledge, but I know that Mr Hinton was aware of the work that had been carried out, and I think he has testified to this Committee to that effect.  Q355 Paul Farrelly: Mr Murdoch senior, have you asked Les Hinton whether he knew about this document?  Rupert Murdoch: No.  Q356 Paul Farrelly: Why not?  James Murdoch: Which document are you talking about, Mr Farrelly?  Q357 Paul Farrelly: The document that you discovered in April or May in the offices of Harbottle &amp; Lewis.  James Murdoch: I have not asked him, but I also think\u2014as he has testified\u2014that he, as Chief Executive of News International at the time, would not have been expected necessarily to read x-hundreds or thousands of emails, but would rely on the opinion of counsel about what they had done.  Q358 Paul Farrelly: Was Colin Myler aware of that evidence lying with Harbottle &amp; Lewis?  James Murdoch: I cannot speak to other individuals&apos; knowledge in the past. I simply don&apos;t know.  Q359 Paul Farrelly: Would Tom Crone?  James Murdoch: I simply cannot speak for them. Q360 Paul Farrelly: And Stuart Kuttner?  James Murdoch: The same goes, Mr Farrelly. I simply can&apos;t speak for them.  Q361 Paul Farrelly: And Rebekah Brooks?  James Murdoch: I simply cannot speak for their knowledge. I know that Mrs Brooks, when she was Chief Executive, was one of the people who brought it to my attention as a new thing.  Q362 Paul Farrelly: I am just going to wrap up this questioning. We are left now in a situation where you, having looked into this affair and co-operated with the police, cannot tell us who lodged the file with Harbottle &amp; Lewis, who was aware of its contents, and who kept you from being in full possession of the facts\u2014evidence that is clearly now being submitted to the police, but that clearly contradicts all the assurances that we were given, not in one but two Select Committee inquiries. I hope you would agree that that, frankly, is unsatisfactory.  James Murdoch: Mr Farrelly, I can say that the company at the time engaged an outside law firm to review a number of these e-mails. They were provided to the law firm, as I understand it. They were reviewed and an opinion was issued to the company based on that review by a respected law firm. The opinion was clear and the company rested on that. I cannot speak to individuals&apos; knowledge at different times, because I don&apos;t know. What I do know is that the company rested on that, rested on the fact that the police told us that there was no new evidence and no reason for a new investigation, and rested on the opinion of the PCC that there was no new information and no reason to carry it further. It was not until new evidence emerged from the civil litigations that were going on that the company immediately went to the police, restarted this, and the company has done the right thing in that respect.  Q363 Paul Farrelly: That was evidence lying in your lawyers&apos; possession all the time. It is not simply evidence that emerged through litigation.  James Murdoch: The Harbottle report was re-looked at in conjunction with the new and restarted criminal investigation. These are serious matters and we take them seriously. When it was looked at and it was deemed that these things would be of interest to the police, we immediately brought in additional counsel\u2014Lord Macdonald, whom you mentioned earlier, Mr Farrelly\u2014to help advise the company on the appropriate way forward in terms of full transparency and co-operation with police investigations. The company took those matters seriously.  Q364 Paul Farrelly: I have two questions for Mr Murdoch senior. I have just painted a situation where we are now here not knowing who at News International and the News of the World was complicit in keeping that file containing however many bits of paper. We are nowhere nearer knowing who knew what and when about that file\u2014evidence that clearly not only contradicts statements given to the Select Committee, but evidence that it would appear led your closest and trusted aide over many years, Les Hinton, to give misleading evidence. Do you find that a satisfactory state of affairs?  Rupert Murdoch: No, I do not.  Q365 Paul Farrelly: What do you think the company should do about it in a follow-up to this Select Committee inquiry? Rupert Murdoch: Mr Chapman, who was in charge of this, has left us. He had that report for a number of years. It wasn&apos;t until Mr Lewis looked at it carefully that we immediately said, &quot;We must get legal advice, see how we go to the police with this and how we should present it,&quot; etcetera.  James Murdoch: My understanding was that the file was with the lawyers\u2014it was with the law firm\u2014and there would have been no reason to go and re-look at it. The opinion of it was very clear based on the review that was done. As soon as it was in a new criminal investigation, it was deemed appropriate to look at it and that was immediately done.  Q366 Paul Farrelly: Mr Murdoch, you either haven&apos;t grasped the point or you are not reading your own newspapers in the form of The Sunday Times. My final question: given the picture that has been painted of individuals on the news desk acting as gatekeepers for a private investigator, do you think it is possible at all that editors of your newspaper would not have known about these activities? Do you think it is remotely possible?  Rupert Murdoch: I can&apos;t say that, because of the police inquiries and, I presume, coming judicial proceedings. That is all I can tell you, except it was my understanding\u2014I had better not say it, but it was my understanding\u2014that Mr Myler was appointed there by Mr Hinton to find out what the hell was going on, and that he commissioned that Harbottle &amp; Lewis inquiry. That is my understanding of it; I cannot swear to the accuracy of it.  Paul Farrelly: Thank you.  Chair: I appeal for brevity, because we have been going for two hours now.  Q367 Alan Keen: I will be as brief as I can. To James Murdoch, it is a mystery to us how Sunday newspapers are run. I am very familiar with the engineering industry. Could you try to paint a picture of a week&apos;s operation at the News of the World? At what period were you closely involved in controlling the News of the World?  James Murdoch: My involvement in the business is overseeing the region of Europe and Asia. Just to be clear, in 2008, starting in the middle of December 2007, I was chief executive for Europe and Asia, our European television business and our Asian television business as well as our UK publishing business, one title of which is the News of the World, so I cannot say that I was ever intimately involved with the workings of the News of the World.  Q368 Alan Keen: What results would come to you within seven days of publication? Presumably, the sales and the advertising income, and you would judge the newspaper on its profitability week by week. I know that Rupert Murdoch is far removed from that, but when you were in close proximity\u2014  Rupert Murdoch: I certainly get that from all over the world, every week.  James Murdoch: These are enterprises; and sales, advertising figures and personnel numbers are relevant. Managers look at those things.  Q369 Alan Keen: We understand from questions that have been answered already that when it comes to legal issues\u2014settlement of claims\u2014that is taken outside the day-to-day management of the newspaper. That is right, isn&apos;t it?  James Murdoch: Each group of companies or titles will have their own legal executives who deal with things such as libel, or other things. They will try to check that something does not go into the paper that is going to be wrong; sometimes that is gotten right, and sometimes it is wrong. Each has its own legal resource and the managing editor&apos;s office is very involved in those things as well as the counsel&apos;s office in the newspapers.  Rupert Murdoch: To give you an example of my son&apos;s typical week, it could well have been a day in Munich, or a day in Sky Italia where he had a particularly difficult situation with a particularly tricky competitor, if I may say so. He had a lot on his plate.  Q370 Alan Keen: I will leave some of the more mundane issues. It became clear from the first couple of questions to you, Rupert Murdoch, that you have been kept in the dark quite a bit on some of these real serious issues. Is there no\u2014  Rupert Murdoch: Nobody has kept me in the dark. I may have been lax in not asking more, but it was such a tiny part of our business.  Q371 Alan Keen: I understand that, but obviously you have come to this point\u2014you would not be here if it was not extremely serious.  Rupert Murdoch: It has become extremely serious.  Q372 Alan Keen: Are there no written rules that certain things have to be reported straight to the very top. It sounds as if there are no such rules; it is left to the trust\u2014  Rupert Murdoch: Anything that is seen as a crisis comes to me.  James Murdoch: Mr Keen, may I? It is important to know that there is a difference between being kept in the dark, and a company that is a large company, the management of which is delegated to managers of different companies within the group, and so on and so forth. To suggest that my father or myself were kept in the dark is a different thing from saying that the management and the running of these businesses is often delegated either to the chief executive of a different company, an editor, a managing editor or an editorial floor, and decision making has to be there. There are thresholds of materiality, if you will, whereby things have to move upstream, so something has to be brought to the attention. From a financial threshold point of view, we addressed that earlier with respect to the out-of-court settlement with Mr Taylor. But from the standpoint of things like alleged criminality, violations of our own code of conduct and things like that, those are things that the company&apos;s internal audit function\u2014the audit committee, as well as the senior executives of the committee\u2014expect to be made aware of, as they were in the case of the criminal prosecutions in 2007.  Q373 Alan Keen: Whatever efforts were made and whatever rules there were, News International has reached a crisis point, otherwise you would not be here today and the News of the World would not have been closed. Who really is responsible? Who do you hold responsible for that failure? You are saying that people should have told you. No, you are really saying to us now not that they should have told you, but that you let them get on and manage it, but they should have told you, shouldn&apos;t they? What has gone wrong?  James Murdoch: Mr Keen, that is a good question. But that is not to say that we are saying\u2014and I am not saying\u2014that somebody should have told me. To my knowledge, certain things were not known. When new information came to light with respect to my knowledge of these events\u2014to my understanding, when new information came to light\u2014the company acted on it. The company acted on it in a right and proper way, as best the company could, but it is difficult to say that the company should have been told something if it is not known that a thing was a known fact to be told. I have been asked today about what other people knew when, and I can only rest on what they have told me or what they have told you in previous hearings. I understand completely your frustration about this. You can imagine my own frustration in 2010, when the civil litigation came to a point where these things came out, to suddenly realise that the pushback or the denial of the veracity of allegations that had been made earlier, particularly in 2009, had been too strong. That is a matter of real regret, because all the facts were not known when that was done. That is a matter of deep regret, and it is why we are here with you today, trying to be as transparent as we possibly can.  Q374 Alan Keen: This is, I suppose, really a rhetorical question\u2014I am sure your answer will be what I expect\u2014but it is admirable that you have had such long-term employees who, I am sure, have become very close friends over the years. Mr Rupert explained that with his determination to look after Rebekah Brooks, so it is admirable. There was a lot of criticism in the financial press at the time\u2014this is not a criticism, James, of your ability\u2014that it was nepotism to appoint you, in retrospect. That is why I say that it is a rhetorical question and I know what the answer will be. Do you regret, Mr Rupert, that it has become really a family organisation for all its\u2014  Rupert Murdoch: Let me just go back over this. When the job became available of head of BSkyB, several people applied, including my son. He passed through all sorts of not just board committees but outside experts, etc. who made the conclusion that he was the right person. The press all had a field day. When he left to go to\u2014when I promoted him to take charge of much wider responsibilities, we had calls from all the big shareholders, or many big shareholders, saying that it was a terrible thing to take him away because he had done such a great job.  Q375 Alan Keen: I was not disputing James&apos;s ability. But the fact that he did not know about so many of these criminal activities that went on, do you not think that was made more likely because of the sort of family history? I do not just mean James here. I am talking about people who were not direct members of your family but became friends. It is admirable, but you don&apos;t think that that has had an effect.  Rupert Murdoch: I don&apos;t think\u2014  Q376 Alan Keen: You don&apos;t think that that is a factor in the mismanagement, because it has been mismanaged.  Rupert Murdoch: I don&apos;t think Mr Hinton misled me for a minute, but you must find out for yourself and make your own conclusion. Other people who gave the same evidence may well have been misleading you but he certainly did not know of anything that happened.  Q377 Damian Collins: Before I address my questions to the hearing, I just want to make a short declaration of my own, which is something that I previously declared to the Committee. My wife is an employee of a company called Edelman, which has been engaged by News Corporation. She has never worked on this account and has no access to information relating to it. I wanted to share that with you before asking any questions. Mr Rupert Murdoch, you said earlier that we live in a transparent society. Do you think it is right that people in public life can expect total privacy in a society like that?  Rupert Murdoch: No. Q378 Damian Collins: Where do you think the limits of that lie? I noticed that in the Watergate investigation, for example, that personal banking and phone records were used, belonging to one of the witnesses, that were relevant to that investigation. To what extent do you think the use of confidential, private information, even phone records and phone hacking, is permissible in the pursuit of a news story?  Rupert Murdoch: I think phone hacking is something quite different. But I do believe that investigative journalism, particularly competitive, does lead to a more transparent and open society, inconvenient though that may be to many people. And I think we are a better society because of it. I think we are probably a more open society than even the United States.  Q379 Damian Collins: Where do you draw the line with that? Where are the boundaries of legitimate investigation? What is that about?  Rupert Murdoch: There was a great\u2014well if we&apos;d done it there would have been a terrible outcry. I&apos;m sorry to say this and I don&apos;t know your circumstances or those of anyone else around here, but when the Daily Telegraph bought a series of stolen documents of all the expenses of MPs it caused a huge outcry, one which I feel has not been properly addressed. I think there is an answer to it and we ought to look at the most open and clear society in the world, which is Singapore, where every Minister gets at least $1 million a year, and the Prime Minister a lot more, and there is no temptation and it is the cleanest society you would find anywhere.  Q380 Damian Collins: Good luck in selling that idea.  Rupert Murdoch: I mean that seriously. It is ridiculous that people were reduced to doing what they did.  James Murdoch: May I help, Mr Collins? It is a very good question and I think it is a really important question. I understand it is going to be one of the subjects of the judicial inquiry which the Prime Minister announced last week, which as a company we immediately welcomed and look forward to. This question of public interest and the question of what is acceptable and what isn&apos;t in terms of investigative techniques is an important one. But let me be very clear, the codes of conduct of News Corporation globally, for our employees, journalists or otherwise, are very clear: breaking the law is a very, very serious matter. People who are lawbreakers should be held to account. In the matter of something like phone hacking or, topically, payments to police and things like that, we just don&apos;t think they should have any place in our business.  Q381 Damian Collins: So, James Murdoch, you would be very clear that within your company and within your organisation, senior people should have been very aware that phone hacking was not only illegal, but totally unacceptable.  James Murdoch: I think, particularly in light of the successful prosecutions and convictions of the individuals involved in 2007, it could not be taken more seriously. If new evidence emerges, as it has in cases, the company acts on it very, very quickly.  Q382 Damian Collins: To what extent do you think that you have a cultural problem? Rupert Murdoch, if I may? Do you think you have a cultural problem within your organisation in that people only tell you things that they think you want to hear and that even people who have been your trusted advisers and worked with you for years simply withhold information, because they want to curry favour? Rupert Murdoch: No, not my trusted advisers certainly. You should hear the conversations in my office. They are coming in all the time and arguing. Most people say I&apos;ve got crazy ideas and fight against me.  Q383 Damian Collins: Forgive me, I am asking because a lot of your trusted advisers have left your company.  Rupert Murdoch: We are a very big company. I am sure there may be people who try to please me. That could be human nature, and it&apos;s up to me to see through that.  Q384 Damian Collins: To what extent do you think there is pressure on editors and senior managers to get scoops, to outdo each other and to win favour within the organisation that leads them to take risks and, clearly in the case of News of the World, push boundaries that broke the law?  Rupert Murdoch: Can you ask that again? I am sorry.  Q385 Damian Collins: Do you think there was a pressure on editors of your newspapers that leads them to take risks and break boundaries? In the News of the World, there was illegal action and wrongdoing, and people broke the law in order to get scoops.  Rupert Murdoch: No, I think that&apos;s totally wrong. There is no excuse for breaking the law at any time. There is an excuse, if I may say so, and I think rightful, for all newspapers when they wish to, to campaign for a change in the law, but never to break it. I just want to say that I was brought up by a father who was not rich, but who was a great journalist, and he, just before he died, bought a small paper, specifically in his will saying that he was giving me the chance to do good. I remember what he did and what he was most proud of, and for which he was hated in this country by many people for many, many years, was exposing the scandal at Gallipoli, which I remain very, very proud of.  Q386 Damian Collins: I think that all students of history are well aware of that.  Rupert Murdoch: That just addresses the question of it being a family business. I would love to see my sons and daughters follow if they are interested.  Q387 Damian Collins: If I may, Rupert Murdoch, you said earlier on that you have had frequent meetings with Prime Ministers during your career.  Rupert Murdoch: I wish they would leave me alone.  Damian Collins: In the period after the arrest of Clive Goodman\u2014you said earlier that you were aware of the situation when he was sent to prison and you were aware of the case at that stage\u2014where there were numerous reports, investigations and hearings of this Committee, about which we have heard a lot today, did any senior politicians that you were in contact with during that period of time raise this as an issue with you, raise concerns about phone hacking or\u2014  Rupert Murdoch: Absolutely never. The politician I met most in those days was Mr Brown when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. His wife and my wife struck up quite a friendship, and our children played together on many occasions. I am very sorry that I am no longer\u2014I thought he had great values, which I shared with him, and I am sorry that we have come apart. I hope one day that we&apos;ll be able to put it together again Q388 Damian Collins: One final question, you said in your interview that you gave to The Wall Street Journal that you thought that your fellow executives at News Corporation had handled this crisis very well with just a few minor mistakes. Do you stand by that statement or do you believe the level of mistakes was far greater than that?  Rupert Murdoch: They seem very big now. What we did was terrible, but you&apos;re talking about handling the crisis\u2014I am sorry, my son has just told me not to gesticulate. I don&apos;t believe that either he or Mr Hinton made any great mistakes. Were mistakes made within the organisation? Absolutely. Were people that I trusted or that they trusted badly betrayed? Yes.  Q389 Damian Collins: Finally, to James Murdoch, it was reported that when Rebekah Brooks spoke to staff to announce the closure of News of the World, she said that in a year&apos;s time they might understand why the paper had to close. I won&apos;t ask you to comment on what she thought in saying that, but what is the significance of the period of time of a year? Do you expect there to be significantly more revelations that, with hindsight, made the closure of News of the World inevitable?  James Murdoch: I can&apos;t speak to what she was specifically referring to. She made those comments herself when she was saying goodbye, sadly, to the staff. I can say that what happened at the News of the World\u2014the events leading up to the 2007 affairs and prosecutions and what we know about those things now\u2014were bad. They are things that should not have any place in our organisation, and they are things that we are unreservedly and sincerely sorry for. We have not seen the end of this in terms of the ongoing police investigations. As you know, Mr Collins, a number of people have been arrested. We don&apos;t know what is going to happen in the future around those things, but given the breach of trust and given the allegations that were emerging at a rapid pace, it was clear to me, and the future will bear this out\u2014without any specific knowledge of the future, obviously\u2014that it was the right thing for the paper to cease publication.  Q390 Damian Collins: Your father said in his Wall Street Journal interview that you, Mr James Murdoch, &quot;acted as fast as he could, the moment he could.&quot; Does that suggest that you were held back at any point? Have you been frustrated in this process over the past few weeks?  James Murdoch: As I said to the Committee earlier\u2014I cannot remember to which Member; my apologies\u2014this has been a frustrating process. My frustration\u2014my real anger\u2014to learn that new evidence was emerging as late as the end of 2010 was real, and is real. What I have done, and what the company has tried to do, is take new information, adjust our course, behave with propriety, behave quickly, behave in a humble way with respect to what has happened and with respect to trying to put it right. That is what we are trying to do. It was enormously frustrating. That does not mean that I have any knowledge of anyone intentionally misleading me and the company. I don&apos;t, which makes it doubly frustrating. We are where we are. New information emerged through the legitimate due process of a civil trial. The company acted on it as fast as could possibly be expected. Actually, still new information, or new allegations are emerging, and we are trying to deal with them in as right a way as we can and in the best way possible.  Q391 Louise Mensch: The good news is that I am your last questioner. I would like to ask you a few very specific questions.Starting with you, Mr James Murdoch, I know we have been over at length the differences in the size of the Taylor settlement and the other settlements of far less monetary value. Can you tell me whether the Taylor settlement included a confidentiality clause and whether the other settlement did not? [Interruption.]  Chair: The sitting is suspended for 10 minutes. On resuming\u2014  Chair: I understand that we are now broadcasting proceedings again. However, we are going to continue in private, with the press and others able to watch in the overflow rooms outside. May I at this stage say that both of you have been very co-operative to this Committee and we have appreciated that. You have answered questions for a long time and I would like to apologise on behalf of the Committee and Parliament for the way you have been treated. I will make a report to Mr Speaker, and I assure you that we will take action to try and find out how that was able to occur. But it is extremely good of you to agree to continue the session and to allow my colleague, Louise Mensch, to finish her questions.  Rupert Murdoch: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.  James Murdoch: Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Louise Mensch: If I may start by saying, Messrs Murdoch, that I said on Sky News when discussing your initial appearance that it would show guts and leadership for you to show up today and answer questions. I must say that it shows immense guts, Mr Rupert Murdoch, for you to continue answering questions now under the circumstances and after such a lengthy evidence session. I thank you for it.  Rupert Murdoch: Thank you.  Q392 Louise Mensch: My questions will be just as tough as ever they would have been had that unfortunate incident not occurred. Mr James Murdoch, may I just take you back briefly to before we were so rudely interrupted and the question of the disparity between the settlements? Could you please tell me whether or not the Taylor settlement to your knowledge involved a confidentiality clause that was not present in the settlement for the lesser amount of money?  James Murdoch: I can tell you that the Taylor settlement was a confidential settlement. As to other settlements post that and more recent settlements, I believe that some have been confidential and some not. I don&apos;t believe any have been confidential settlements, but I can certainly follow up as to whether or not there have been any. It is customary in an out-of-court settlement of this nature for both parties to agree. There is nothing unusual about an out-of-court settlement being made confidential and being agreed to be confidential, but it was\u2014with respect to the basis of the question, which I think was about the disparity in the amount of money involved, there was nothing in the Taylor settlement, with respect to confidentiality, that spoke to the amount of money. The amount of money was derived, as I testified earlier, from a judgment made about what the likely damages would be and what the likely expenses and litigation costs would have been had the company taken the litigation to its end and lost.  Q393 Louise Mensch: Yes, you have been very clear about that. That is your explanation for the size of the settlement. I merely put it to you that an inference could be drawn if the larger settlements contained confidentiality clauses and the smaller settlements did not. Despite what you say about it being a pragmatic decision based on the costs to the company of not settling, an inference could be drawn that silence was being bought by the presence of the confidentiality clause in the larger settlements. James Murdoch: And that inference would be false.  Q394 Louise Mensch: Okay, fair enough. Many people\u2014I think this is the nub of it\u2014will find it quite hard to believe that two executives, who nobody would regard as passive, had such little knowledge of widespread illegality at one of your flagship papers. Can I ask you very specifically\u2014Mr James Murdoch first\u2014when did you become aware that the phones not merely of celebrities and members of the royal family but of victims of crime had been hacked? When did you become aware that the phone of the murder victim, Milly Dowler, had been hacked?  James Murdoch: The terrible instance of voicemail interception around the Milly Dowler case only came to my attention when it was reported in the press a few weeks ago and it was\u2014  Q395 Louise Mensch: So only when The Guardian reported it.  James Murdoch: I can tell you, it was a total shock. That was the first I had heard of it and became aware of it.  Q396 Louise Mensch: Is that the same for hacking of other victims of crime? In other words, have you been made aware prior to the Milly Dowler story breaking that your reporters hacked into the phones of any other crime victims?  James Murdoch: No, I had not been made aware of that.  Q397 Louise Mensch: Okay. Just for the record\u2014though you answered my colleague, Jim Sheridan, earlier, you will be aware that it is of lively interest to regulators in the United States\u2014the actor Jude Law is apparently alleging that his phone was hacked on US soil. Given that allegation, are you absolutely confident that no employee or contractor of News Corp or any of its properties hacked the phones of 9/11 victims or their families?  Rupert Murdoch: We have no evidence of that at all.  Q398 Louise Mensch: Have any credible allegations\u2014? I see you hesitating, Mr James Murdoch.  James Murdoch: No, I was just going to say that those are incredibly serious allegations and they have come to light very recently. We do not know the veracity of those allegations and are trying to understand precisely what they are, and any investigations\u2014I remember well, as all of us do, the September 11 attacks. I was in the far east, living there at the time, and it is just appalling to think that anyone associated with one of our papers would have done something like that. I am aware of no evidence about that. I am well aware of the allegations and will eagerly co-operate with any investigations or try to find out what went on at that time. These are very, very new allegations\u2014just a few days old, I think\u2014but they are very serious and that sort of activity would have absolutely no place; it would be appalling.  Q399 Louise Mensch: From the information provided to you so far\u2014I noted that Mr Rupert Murdoch&apos;s answer was emphatic, but your answer, Mr James Murdoch, was somewhat more nuanced\u2014have you received any information that gives you cause for concern that employees of News Corp or contractors of News Corp may have indulged in that kind of hacking? James Murdoch: No. Not at this moment. We have only seen the allegations that have been made in the press\u2014I think it was in The Mirror or something like that.  Q400 Louise Mensch: So no internal documents, records\u2014  James Murdoch: We are actively trying to know exactly what those allegations are and how to understand anything about them.  Q401 Louise Mensch: You have seen no internal documents, memos or records or received any verbal reports that any employee of News Corp hacked into the phones of 9/11.  James Murdoch: No, definitely not.  Q402 Louise Mensch: Fine, thank you. Have you as a result of a wider review\u2014clearly, this has been a shock to your corporate culture\u2014heard from any of your employees of papers in other countries that phone hacking, blagging or illegal practices may have been happening in those territories, for example, in your Australian properties or in any territory, indeed, where New Corps owns media properties? Are you doing a global review and have you heard of any allegations of phone hacking in your other territories?  James Murdoch: I am not aware of any allegations in any of those other territories. I haven&apos;t heard of those allegations. But I would go back to the code of ethics and code of conduct that all of our colleagues at News Corporation globally\u2014be they journalist or management\u2014are required to have. When they join the company and are briefed on those things, it is a matter of real seriousness\u2014the journalistic ethics of any of the newspapers or television channels within the group. Certainly, it is something that, on a global basis, we want to be consistent with and we want to be doing the right thing. When I say that illegal behaviour has no place in this company, that goes for the whole company.  Q403 Louise Mensch: Mr Rupert Murdoch, you are the Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corps. You are the head of the global company. The buck stops with you. Given these allegations, indeed, when you opened the session, you said that this was the most humiliating day of your life\u2014  Chair: Humble.  Louise Mensch: Oh, I&apos;m sorry\u2014humble. I beg your pardon. That was a mistake. You said that it was the most humble day of your life. You feel humbled by these events. You are ultimately in charge of the company. Given your shock at these things being laid out before you and the fact that you didn&apos;t know anything about them, have you instructed your editors around the world to engage in a root-and-branch review of their own news rooms to be sure that this isn&apos;t being replicated in other News Corps papers around the globe? If not, will you do so?  Rupert Murdoch: No, but I am more than prepared to do so.  Q404 Louise Mensch: Thank you. Two final questions. The first is, you touched earlier, Mr James Murdoch, very briefly on the general culture of phone hacking, blagging and illegal practices that have in the past happened in this country. If I could put a couple of things to you. You do not appear to have asked Piers Morgan, who is now a celebrity anchor at CNN, any questions at all about phone hacking. As a former editor of the Daily Mirror, he said in his book The Insider recently that that &quot;little trick&quot; of entering a &quot;standard four digit code&quot; will allow &quot;anyone&quot; to call a number and &quot;hear all your messages&quot;. In that book, he boasted that using that &quot;little trick&quot; enabled him to win scoop of the year on a story about Sven-Goran Eriksson. That is a former editor of the Daily Mirror being very open about his personal use of phone hacking. Yesterday, in Parliament, Paul Dacre\u2014  Paul Farrelly: And News of the World.  Q405 Louise Mensch: And indeed he was a former News of the World executive. He was boasting about a story that happened when he was the editor of the Daily Mirror. Yesterday, Paul Dacre of Associated Newspapers said to a Committee of Parliament, in my view risibly, that the Daily Mail has never in its history run a story based on phone hacking or blagging in anyway. Yet Operation Motorman, of which I am sure your advisers, Mr James Murdoch, will have made you aware, found that the Daily Mail had 50 journalists paying for 902 pieces of information obtained by the private investigator, Steve Whittamore, who had been found to have used some\u2014shall we say?\u2014unorthodox methods. You told me earlier, Mr Murdoch, that your advisers in prepping you to come before the Committee had told you simply to tell the truth, which was excellent advice. Is it not the fact\u2014the truth of the matter\u2014that journalists at the News of the World felt entitled to go out there and use blagging, deception and phone hacking, because that was part of the general culture of corruption in the British tabloid press, and that they didn&apos;t kick it up the chain to you, because they felt they were entitled to use the same methods as everybody else? Isn&apos;t that the plain fact of the matter?  James Murdoch: Mrs Mensch, I am aware of those reports and the questions around other newspapers and their use of private investigators. But all I can really speak to in this matter is the behaviours and the culture at the News of the World as we understand it and how we are trying to find out what really happened in the period in question. Importantly, it is not for me here today to impugn other newspapers, other journalists or other things like that.  Q406 Louise Mensch: I am asking you if the News of the World felt inured to engaging in these illegal practices, particularly phone hacking, because it was so wide in British tabloid journalism. Did they see it as not as evil as it was because it was so widespread?  James Murdoch: Mrs Mensch, I don&apos;t accept that; if journalists on one of our papers, television channels or internet news operations feel that they don&apos;t have to hold themselves to a higher standard, I think it is important that we don&apos;t say, &quot;Listen, everyone was doing it, and that&apos;s why people are doing this.&quot; At the end of the day, we have to have a set of standards that we believe in, and we have to have titles and journalists who operate to the highest possible standard. We have to make sure that, when they don&apos;t live up to that, they are held to account. That is the focus for us.  Q407 Louise Mensch: Mr Rupert Murdoch, have you considered suing Harbottle &amp; Lewis? You said in the past\u2014in one of your first answers to my colleague, Tom Watson\u2014that the reason you did not do an internal investigation is that you relied on the investigation by the police, the investigation by the Press Complaints Commission and the investigation undertaken by your solicitors, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, under whose care this enormous pile of documents was found. There is an old saying, that if you want something doing, you should do it yourself. In this case, you relied on three sets of people, all of whose investigations were severely lacking. Have you considered suing Harbottle &amp; Lewis?  James Murdoch: Any future legal claims or actions in any matter are a matter for the future. Really, today is about how we actually make sure that these things do not happen again. I won&apos;t comment or speculate on any future legal matters. Q408 Louise Mensch: Okay. The file of evidence: you were asked by my colleague Mr Farrelly whether you had read it yourself, and you said no. In the circumstances, where you have relied on other people and advisers and they have severely let your company down, do you not think, Mr Murdoch and Mr Rupert Murdoch, that you ought to take the time and read through everything in that folder personally?  James Murdoch: For clarity, Mrs Mensch, I did say that I did read some of the contents\u2014they were shown to me\u2014and what I saw was sufficient to know that the right thing to do was to hand them over to the authorities to help them with their investigations.  Q409 Louise Mensch: I understand that, but you were shown a representative sample, which can be tricky. In the circumstances and given the enormous reputational damage which I am sure you will be the first to admit has been done to News Corp, do you not think that, as senior executives of the company, you should take the time and read through the entire file, so that you are completely apprised of what happened and are not reliant on everyone else?  James Murdoch: I am happy to do so. I think I have seen a bit of it.  Q410 Louise Mensch: Okay. My last question is for you, Mr Rupert Murdoch. You said that your friend of 52 years I think, Les Hinton, had stepped down and resigned because he was in charge of the company at the time. In other words, he said that he was the captain of the ship, and therefore he resigned. Is it not the case though, sir, that you in fact are captain of the ship? You are the Chief Executive Officer of News Corp, the global corporation\u2014  Rupert Murdoch: Of a much bigger ship, but yes.  Q411 Louise Mensch: It is a much bigger ship, but you are in charge of it. As you said in earlier questions, you do not regard yourself as a hands-off Chief Executive; you work 10 to 12 hours a day. This terrible thing happened on your watch. Mr Murdoch, have you considered resigning?  Rupert Murdoch: No.  Q412 Louise Mensch: Why not?  Rupert Murdoch: Because I feel that people I trusted\u2014I am not saying who, and I don&apos;t know what level\u2014have let me down. I think that they behaved disgracefully and betrayed the company and me, and it is for them to pay. Frankly, I think that I am the best person to clean this up.  Louise Mensch: Thank you, Mr Murdoch. As I said, I very much appreciate your immense courage in having seen this session through, despite the common assault that just happened to you. Thank you.  Chair: I will allow Mr Watson a very brief question.  Q413 Mr Watson: James\u2014sorry, if I may call you James, to differentiate\u2014when you signed off the Taylor payment, did you see or were you made aware of the full Neville e-mail, the transcript of the hacked voicemail messages?  James Murdoch: No, I was not aware of that at the time.  Q414 Mr Watson: But you paid an astronomical sum, and there was no reason to.  James Murdoch: There was every reason to settle the case, given the likelihood of losing the case and given the damages\u2014we had received counsel\u2014that would be levied.  Q415 Mr Watson: If Taylor and Clifford are prepared to release their obligation to confidentiality, will you release them from their confidentiality clause, so that we can get to the full facts of those particular cases?  James Murdoch: I cannot comment on the Clifford matter at all. I was not involved in that matter. As to the Taylor matter, it is a confidential agreement. I do not think that it is worth exploring hypotheticals.  Q416 Mr Watson: The facts of this case help us get to the truth. If he removes himself from an obligation, if he allows his papers to be released, will you let\u2014  James Murdoch: Mr Watson, it is a hypothetical scenario. I am happy to correspond with the Chairman about what specifically more you would like to know about those settlements, other than the detailed testimony I have given you today.  Q417 Mr Watson: Why? Do you want me to carry on with a few more questions so that I can get to the end of this? Chair: I am getting galled. We have covered this at some considerable length.  Mr Watson: Actually, Chairman, we have not, but I respect you. Mr Murdoch, your wife has a very good left hook.  Q418 Chair: Mr Murdoch, you did ask if you could make a closing statement. The Committee are entirely content for you to do so.  Rupert Murdoch: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Members of the Committee, I would like to read a short statement now. My son and I came here with great respect for all of you, for Parliament and for the people of Britain, whom you represent. This is the most humble day of my career. After all that has happened, I know that we needed to be here today. James and I would like to say how sorry we are for what has happened, especially with regard to listening to the voicemail of victims of crime. My company has 52,000 employees. I have led it for 57 years, and I have made my share of mistakes. I have lived in many countries, employed thousands of honest and hard-working journalists. I own nearly 200 newspapers of very different sizes and have followed countless stories about people and families around the world. At no time do I remember being as sickened as when I heard what the Dowler family had to endure\u2014which I think was last Monday week\u2014nor do I recall being as angry as when I was told that the News of the World could have compounded their distress. I want to thank the Dowlers for graciously giving me the opportunity to apologise in person. I would like all the victims of phone hacking to know how completely and deeply sorry I am. Apologising cannot take back what has happened. Still, I want them to know the depth of my regret for the horrible invasions into their lives. I fully understand their ire, and I intend to work tirelessly to merit their forgiveness. I understand our responsibility to co-operate with today&apos;s session as well as with future inquiries. We now know that things went badly wrong at the News of the World. For a newspaper that held others to account, it failed when it came to itself. The behaviour that occurred went against everything that I stand for\u2014and my son, too. It not only betrayed our readers and me, but also the many thousands of magnificent professionals in other divisions of our company around the world. Let me be clear in saying: invading people&apos;s privacy by listening to their voicemail is wrong; paying police officers for information is wrong. They are inconsistent with our codes of conduct and neither has any place in any part of the company that I run. But saying sorry is not enough. Things must be put right. No excuses. This is why News International is co-operating fully with the police, whose job it is to see that justice is done. It is our duty not to prejudice the outcome of the legal process. I am sure the Committee will understand this. I wish that we had managed to see and fully solve these problems much earlier. When two men were sent to prison in 2007, I thought this matter had been settled. The police ended their investigations, and I was told that News International conducted an internal review. I am confident that when James later rejoined News Corporation, he thought the case had closed, too. These are subjects you will no doubt wish to explore, and have explored today. This country has given me, our companies and our employees many opportunities. I am grateful for them. I hope our contribution to Britain will one day also be recognised. Above all, I hope that we will come to understand the wrongs of the past, prevent them from happening again and, in the years ahead, restore the nation&apos;s trust in our company and in all British journalism.

His claim comes after seven Zambians and two Georgians received suspended sentences following a court case into match-fixing in Finland on Tuesday. Wilson Raj Perumal of Singapore, viewed as the mastermind behind a criminal group that sought to influence the outcome of matches between 2008 and 2011, was found guilty of bribing the players and was given a two-year sentence. The nine former players of the Finnish League side Rovaniemi were said to have accepted bribes ranging from \u20ac500 (\u00a3440) to \u20ac40,000. The court said 24 Rovaniemi matches were fixed, and that Perumal&apos;s involvement was proven in seven of them. Eaton is concerned by the increasing number of players implicated in such cases and fears the match-fixers are targeting players from poorer nations, helping them to find clubs and then asserting pressure on them to play a part in scams. &quot;It is a form of trafficking,&quot; Eaton told the Independent. &quot;There are examples of players who have been abandoned because they did not perform. &quot;It is only anecdotal evidence at this stage, but it is clear. They [match-fixers] often target people from humble origins. They will go to junior competitions and recruit families of players basically through the attraction of cash. &apos;I can get you a contract, or a game in Europe or South America&apos; \u2013 they will invest in the development of players and officials and then they expect payment. They want their cut. &quot;These people are criminals, they are organised. They are well funded and have a long-term plan. They are a real and present danger to the sanctity and ethics of sport.

Liverpool and Arsenal may have run riot here, but the latest Premier League club to visit these parts spluttered in the muggy heat. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas is still experimenting and will not be alarmed, but even he will hope his side discover some slickness in the weeks ahead. The new manager is still considering those at his disposal, though quite what he could have learned from this occasion is open to debate. There were 12 substitutions in all, including the anticipated new line-up after the interval, to suggest this was more a fitness exercise. But, if Chelsea inevitably dominated possession, they laboured to prise apart a Malaysian XI devoid of the regulars to play in Singapore on Saturday. The shape was solid enough, a customary 4-3-3, but there still lacks a spark. If those already at the club cannot provide evidence of one soon, then Chelsea will have to step up the search for new invention. It is dangerous to read too much into pre-season friendlies, particularly those played in such alien conditions, but familiar concerns continue to surface. Fernando Torres was denied by Mohamed Farizal Marlias after 109 seconds and later steered a shot from closer range wide of a post. His only reward in pre-season to date was against Wycombe behind closed doors. The Spaniard is hoping this season will be a new start after one goal in 18 competitive fixtures since his \u00a350m record transfer from Liverpool, but he still does not seem at ease within the system. He had started flanked by his former Liverpool team-mate Yossi Benayoun and Salomon Kalou, with Florent Malouda employed on the left of a midfield trio and Frank Lampard on the right. The significance of that might be the England midfielder&apos;s deployment given that the ambition remains that Luka Modric, who thrives on the left, can be prised from Tottenham Hotspur. Yet the tempo was never upbeat enough to expose the Malaysians. The pace in possession was stilted, the creativity too rare. Chelsea were marginally more threatening as this contest drifted, with Daniel Sturridge injecting some pace and thrust up front. Yet Marlias turned his shot behind and it was left for good fortune to provide a victory. Didier Drogba&apos;s free-kick cannoned back from a post and on to the diving Mohamed Izham Tarmizi, the ball bouncing back towards the goal before the substitute goalkeeper could claim it. The linesman was eager to flag that it had crossed the line, though the decision appeared somewhat dubious. That, at least, provided the locals with something to shout about.

Not that you would know it to listen to the chairman, Lord Moynihan. He says he has overhauled the executive team, ushered in a new era of financial stability, moved to glitzy new offices in the heart of the West End of London and made the BOA more athlete-friendly. But a different story is told by the organisation&apos;s critics, who claim they have wasted millions duplicating services already provided elsewhere, lavished money on high salaries that could leave them financially stretched and are in the habit of upsetting the equilibrium among British sporting bodies that has largely held since the vote was won in Singapore in 2005. The cuttings file also outlines a more tumultuous picture. In the spring, a long\u2011running dispute with the organising committee, Locog, over how any surplus from the Games should be divided exploded into the public eye just as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were in town. After threatening to take Locog and the IOC to the court of arbitration for sport, and drawing the ire of the government, a settlement was negotiated that involved the BOA largely backing down in return for help signing up Games sponsors beyond 2012 and revenues from two, as yet unrevealed, &quot;iconic pieces of merchandise&quot;. Moynihan is bullishly unrepentant, insisting he has &quot;absolutely no regrets&quot; and that the action has left the BOA in a &quot;far, far stronger&quot; position. Another target for the BOA&apos;s critics has been the role of its well-remunerated director of sport. Sir Clive Woodward&apos;s coaching programme was suspended earlier this year and, to the critics, became emblematic of the BOA&apos;s desire to over reach their traditional role of supporting athletes at Games time. Since then, Woodward has also become an offstage cast member in the farce enveloping the Rugby Football Union. Moynihan says Woodward, who will be deputy chef de mission next year, is going nowhere and will prove his worth at Games time. &quot;Clive is one of the most outstanding sports directors, coaching, performance directors, inspirational leaders in sport that I&apos;ve ever worked with,&quot; he says. &quot;His contribution as a member of the team is a huge asset to the BOA and Team GB. He&apos;s one of the best in the world.&quot; Andy Hunt, the chief executive, insists the programme, which angered some sports and UK Sport, who felt it was leading to duplication and confusion, was value for money. In recent years, the BOA have broken even only through one-off windfalls. Last year, they avoided a loss by selling their Wandsworth headquarters for \u00a31.6m and moving to rented offices in Charlotte Street. The previous year, they were forced to ask Locog for an emergency loan. Moynihan, who joined as chairman in 2005, and Hunt, installed as chief executive in 2008 and subsequently named chef de mission for 2012 despite a lack of sporting experience, insist the transitional period has been vital to enable the organisation to seize the opportunity on offer. &quot;There is zero mortgaging of the future,&quot; Moynihan says. &quot;We&apos;ve got a first-rate team because athletes deserve the best support you can make available to them.&quot; The BOA have taken a calculated risk that, by investing heavily ahead of the Games, they will be in a position to reap the rewards afterwards, when the marketing rights return to them at the end of 2012 under the terms of their contract with Locog. Since his days as a Tory sports minister, Moynihan \u2013 a silver medallist as cox of the men&apos;s rowing eight at the 1980 Moscow Olympics \u2013 has always violently polarised opinion. But the logic that led most to side with Locog in the recent dispute \u2013 the BOA signed a contract and now were refusing to honour it \u2013 and the personality clashes that it engendered obscured a genuine debate to be had about the post-Games landscape. It is a debate that suits neither the government \u2013 which has, after all, promised to maintain funding for elite sport until 2015 and is focused on reaping the benefits of the &quot;greatest show on earth&quot; \u2013 nor Locog, inevitably focused on delivering that show. But at its heart are two truths. One, investing in high-performance sport and sending teams to the multiplying number of Olympic events will not get any cheaper, and, two, the amount of public money going into sport is not going to go up at a time when expansive\u00a0promises on the 2012 legacy must be delivered. &quot;Will there be a lasting sports legacy? The BOA&apos;s input on that is really important,&quot; Moynihan says. &quot;We have a long way to go to ensure we can deliver a lasting sports legacy that impacts on the lives of kids and sportsmen and women the length of the United Kingdom.&quot; Against that backdrop, Hunt and Moynihan argue their strategy of building commercial revenues and taking on a broader role remains sound. The chairman points to a lengthy list of rights and responsibilities conferred on the BOA as a riposte to those who say he is merely empire building. Hunt insists the books balance, that they can afford the \u00a313m it will take to support the biggest British team at a Games. They defend the \u00a34.76m total salary bill by saying it was necessary to attract quality staff. And they are planning an even broader role for after the London Olympics. Woodward&apos;s coaching programme will be reactivated as part of a wider drive to build a coaching legacy from the Games, and it will also look to improve the governance of Olympic sports. &quot;Everyone would recognise we need greater investment and focus on coaching. Although it [Woodward&apos;s programme] caused a few ruffles here and there, it&apos;s an area where as a nation we haven&apos;t poured enough resources,&quot; says Hunt. To realise those ambitions, the BOA will have to capitalise on the commercial opportunities that will flow from the Olympic rights that will return to them from Locog after the Games. Hunt is eyeing the \u00a3700m Locog secured from domestic sponsors and hoping for a hefty slice. Work has begun on building the Team GB &quot;brand&quot;, he says, making it more of a &quot;year-round&quot; proposition rather than\u00a0something that comes to life only every two years (including for the Winter Olympics). The next nine months will be crucial in terms of signing those deals and part of the rationale behind building the expansive Team GB House in the Westfield shopping centre overlooking the Olympic Park is to reel in those sponsors. &quot;We&apos;re in good shape in terms of making the Team GB brand famous. We&apos;re in good shape in terms of the next round of negotiations for the next quad from 2012,&quot; Hunt says. Which sounds great in theory. Talk to sponsors, though, and, while they say they will probably want to continue a relationship with British sport beyond the Games, there is more reticence about whether they will do so with the BOA. &quot;The BOA will be at the top table of British sport, working with other stakeholders, to deliver the benefits of sports and recreation to future generations,&quot; Moynihan says. &quot;Working for our governing bodies, working for the athletes, supporting them with expertise, funding and programmes. And helping to take sport and recreation\u00a0to a new level as a result of being a host nation.&quot; Moynihan and Hunt could not be more confident that they will be able to deliver the funds to realise their vision. Their plan will stand or fall on whether they&apos;re right \u2013 and whether they can avoid falling out with the rest of the sporting world in the process."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/25/2012-olympics-amber-charles", "sentences": ["As a talented east London schoolgirl basketball player, Amber Charles, from East Ham, was one of the 30 children of the Olympic bid who travelled to Singapore in 2005 to woo votes.", "&quot;I was really honoured when I was asked to go to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-25T14:23:18Z", "title": "2012 Olympic dream recedes for one young east London hopeful", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "GB basketball", "Sport", "London", "UK news", "Olympics 2012: basketball", "Olympic Games"], "article": "As a talented east London schoolgirl basketball player, Amber Charles, from East Ham, was one of the 30 children of the Olympic bid who travelled to Singapore in 2005 to woo votes.

So, if all goes well, I may be competing in it.&quot; Otherwise, having heard little from the Olympic organisers in the past 18 months, and her family having failed to get tickets, she will be watching it on television. &quot;I was really honoured when I was asked to go to Singapore.

Jacques Rogge will discuss the issue of match-fixing and illegal betting \u2013 which has been most high-profile in football and cricket, but which he said was also a serious risk in Olympic sport \u2013 with the British government and 2012 organisers when he arrives in London this week. &quot;I can&apos;t open my newspapers without finding an article on the prevalence of cheating and match fixing. In Germany, Italy, Belgium, Hungary, Turkey, Greece. In China, in South Korea, in Singapore. It is a world problem and it is a very pernicious problem. With the introduction of broadband, you can bet worldwide,&quot; he said. &quot;The danger is that from illegal betting comes match fixing and you see more and more attempts to manipulate matches. It is as dangerous as doping for the credibility of sport. It&apos;s only the beginning of a huge battle.&quot; He said Olympic athletes could be tempted to cheat because many may not be as well paid as those in other sports. &quot;That is the reality we have to live with. We are going to monitor the London Games very closely. Whenever there is an abnormal betting profile, the betting company can stop the bets and refuse to hand out the money,&quot; said Rogge. &quot;We will make inquiries and also ask the support of the police. The arsenal is there. I hope we don&apos;t have to use it.&quot; He recently held summits with Interpol and government ministers, including the Olympics minister, Hugh Robertson, to try to formulate a co-ordinated plan to tackle illegal betting. On the issue of drug cheats, he said there would be a record number of tests (5,500) in London next year. &quot;We are progressing. Let&apos;s not be naive. There will be no time when you can say with certainty that there is no doping in sport. Cheating is embedded in human nature. But we are making much progress,&quot; said Rogge. He also issued a warning to athletes who, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency, are going to ever more sophisticated lengths to evade detection. &quot;We are going to sample your urine and your blood. We might not find the illegal drugs at first testing, but we will freeze your samples and they will be retested later on,&quot; said Rogge. &quot;There is a permanent check and you will be found.&quot; At an event on Wednesday Rogge will formally invite the world to London from a stage in Trafalgar Square to mark the milestone of one year to go, alongside the London mayor, Boris Johnson, and the London 2012 organising committee (Locog) chairman, Lord Coe. &quot;Preparations are excellent. They are on time, on budget. Quality-wise we have not the slightest concern,&quot; said Rogge. &quot;There is no doubt about that. London is very well organised, the team is very strong. We are very optimistic.&quot; While London&apos;s preparations have been well ordered compared with the rush to finish the venues in Athens and the protests that preceded the Beijing Games, Rogge said security was a huge issue. &quot;Since Munich, security has been the number one priority for every organising committee. This is something that is dealt with in conjunction with the government and public authorities,&quot; said Rogge in an interview with the Guardian. He said he had been &quot;reassured&quot; by Robertson that the resignations of the London Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, and the assistant commissioner John Yates would not affect the force&apos;s preparations for the Games. &quot;The Metropolitan police do not depend on one single person. Leadership is very important but I&apos;m sure that given the amount of time in front of us that the leadership issue will be solved rapidly. That is what I expect Hugh Robertson and Boris Johnson to tell me when I come to London,&quot; said Rogge, who has been IOC president since 2001. London was awarded the Games on the back of a string of legacy promises about what it could do for sport, east London and the Olympic movement, but there have been persistent question marks over whether it will deliver. &quot;There is a great urban legacy in the remediation of east London and Stratford. There are going to be great cultural and leisure activities, there is better transport, new housing. I think this is a great legacy,&quot; said Rogge. &quot;The other legacy is in terms of the appetite and desire for sport. That will be done after the Games.&quot; He said interest in playing sport tended to &quot;skyrocket&quot; after the Games and called on the government and sports governing bodies to ensure they were in a position to take advantage. &quot;You see an inflow of new young people. This has to be sustainable. It should not be one shot for a short period because of the hype and the enthusiasm,&quot; he said. He praised Locog&apos;s international inspiration programme, which has invested \u00a338m \u2013 raised through a range of partners including the British Council, the government, the Premier League and Comic Relief \u2013 in projects around the world. Coe announced on Monday that the programme had already hit its target of reaching 12 million young people around the world and could expect to reach 20 million by next year. Projects have included training swimming coaches in Bangladesh to help prevent drowning and introducing PE programmes in Indian primary schools. His deputy chairman, Sir Keith Mills, said Locog was in talks with organisers of the 2016 Games in Rio about how to continue the programme and expected the 20 three-year projects initiated under the international inspiration umbrella to continue beyond that time frame. Turning to the ticketing system employed by London organisers, Rogge said it was fair but that he could understand the disappointment of the million-plus applicants who missed out on tickets. &quot;You are always going to have people disappointed. I understand the disappointment.

She had returned all the money that she had stolen. Unmoved, the prosecution pushed for a deterrent sentence. The judge imposed a fine of $2,000. This is a scenario played out repeatedly all over Singapore. The unforgiving high cost of living in the city, coupled with low wages, has led many to commit crimes out of financial desperation. It is, of course, trite to argue that just because one is poor doesn&apos;t mean that one is entitled to commit criminal acts. There are many who face economic hardship but don&apos;t resort to crime. This is why comments made by Rupert Murdoch in his testimony before the culture and media select committee are so jarring to reason. He described Singapore as &quot;the most open and clear society in the world&quot;, and that since every minister is paid at least $1m a year, &quot;there is no temptation and it is the cleanest society you would find anywhere&quot;. If ministers need to be paid the amounts that they are in Singapore to prevent corruption, which is a criminal act, why can&apos;t we pay people like Letchmi enough to sustain her livelihood and health so that she doesn&apos;t resort to stealing? The Global Wage Report 2009, a study by the International Labor Organisation, found that among 13 countries surveyed (Singapore, Cyprus, Japan, South Korea, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Taiwan, Denmark, Spain, UK, and US) Singaporeans worked the most hours. Yet they saw their real wages decline. There is no minimum wage in Singapore. Prices and Earnings, a 2010 survey conducted by UBS, revealed that Singapore was the 11th most expensive city in the world out of 73. In that same study, it was found that the domestic purchasing power of Singaporeans was ranked at 49th. One of the most expensive cities in the world with its inhabitants paid poorly: are these not factors that drive workers like Letchmi to committing criminal acts? Even the elderly in Singapore are not spared. They are pushed to work way into their retirement years, and for less pay. It is a common sight to witness folks in their 70s, doubled over from old age, working as cleaners at public toilets and food centres in Singapore. And yet Singapore&apos;s government ministers defend their enormous salaries by making the case that if they are not paid more than excessively they will be tempted by corruption, an argument that now finds an adherent in Murdoch. In addition, the &quot;open&quot; system that Murdoch claims exists in Singapore is more a figment of his imagination. Let&apos;s start with the media. In the 1960s and 70s, many journalists were imprisoned. Independently owned newspapers were shut down. Today all Singaporean publications, TV channels and radio stations are owned and run by the government. Civil society is nonexistent. Non-government organisations, student bodies and trade unions are tightly controlled. Public assemblies outside a small and demarcated area are banned. The opposition is in a moribund state. Many of its leaders have been arrested and detained without trial, prosecuted in court, and sued till bankruptcy for defamation. The election system is far from free and fair. The &quot;election&quot; of the country&apos;s president to be held in a few weeks&apos; time, for example, is restricted to a handful of candidates allowed by the prime minister. Political power amassed in the hands of the few in Singapore is also used to ensure that a disproportionate amount of financial power is accumulated in those same hands. Officials who seek authority as custodians of political power must have the character to keep away from crime no matter what the temptation might be. The argument that ministers should be paid millions of dollars to keep them from corruption does not hold water. No one denies those in charge of government should be paid well. But when politicians start to climb on to pedestals and insist that they be rewarded with stratospheric levels of remuneration, it raises serious questions of moral leadership. Public service enriches one&apos;s sense of loyalty and mission, not one&apos;s bank account. There are other vocations if one&apos;s goal is to amass financial fortunes. Public service and greed don&apos;t mix well. Perhaps Murdoch is just beginning to find this out himself."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/26/countdown-london-2012-calendar", "sentences": ["July 2011 27 Jul BMX World Championships, Copenhagen, to 31 Jul 28 Jul Slalom canoeing, Lee Valley White Water Centre, to 31 Jul Modern Pentathlon, European Championships, Medway, to 1 Aug 31 Jul Hadleigh Farm Mountain Bike International Sailing, Weymouth &amp;

There can be nothing less than a paradigm shift. We can no longer assume the economy is in essentially good health but held back by regulation and taxation, along with insufficient commitment to free markets. Instead, there has to be a purposive and enterprising national commitment to development and growth \u2013 but in a 21st-century knowledge economy. Tuesday&apos;s faltering growth figures were yet another reminder that the old ideas are not working. There has to be change. The mounting concern within government \u2013 whatever the public protestations \u2013 is more than justified. Britain has had three other big recessions since 1929, and in each of them the recovery phase was stronger than this one. Put bluntly, this is the slowest, weakest recovery Britain has experienced in modern times. Not even a massive devaluation and over two years of ultra-cheap money has pulled things around. The British economy is flat on its back. Nor should this be a surprise. McKinsey Global Institute recently confirmed its devastating analysis of 2008; Britain has the highest levels of private debt in the developed world, and has scarcely begun the process of reducing it \u2013 &quot;deleveraging&quot;, in the jargon. The banking system, having nearly collapsed three years ago, is rebuilding its capital base and wary about new lending. There has been a massive misallocation of resources over two decades into sectors that were dependent on high growth of consumer spending for their success; demand will not recover for years. Meanwhile, the export sector is cruelly shrunk. Worse, superimposed on all this is the\u00a0commitment to eliminate the structural budget deficit in four years \u2013 a tough enough ask in fair-weather times. And the coalition has made a bad situation worse by the accompanying rhetoric that the pain was necessary because Britain was on the point of bankruptcy. Self-evident nonsense, this has magnified the fragility of consumer confidence and the uncertainties of the business community. If the British government feels its position is so fragile that it has to take so many self-defeating and self-harming measures, why should business invest? Is a country plagued by so many problems to which policymakers seem oblivious likely to be where the economic action is going to be in the years ahead? A growing number of senior business leaders have recently spoken to me privately in these terms. But what worries them most is that \u2013 despite the evidence that there needs to be a paradigm shift in policy \u2013 it may be beyond the capacity of Cameron and Osborne to make it. The leak that a potential &quot;plan A+&quot; to boost the economy might prioritise cutting the 50% top rate of income tax had one business leader in quiet despair; he was no friend of the higher rate tax band, but the obvious target for any tax cuts must be the hard-pressed majority of standard-rate taxpayers whose real incomes \u2013 and spending power \u2013 is being so severely squeezed. What was Osborne thinking even to hint at such a priority? Of course the deficit has to be reduced, but there can be smart ways of making the process less self-harming. How about creating an infrastructure bank charged with financing a reinstatement of the infrastructure projects that the government \u2013 continuing Labour&apos;s policy \u2013 has so brutally cut to a fraction of what was planned? The government has to become a leading change agent in its own right, rather as the Singaporean, South Korean and Japanese governments have been, but in a wholly different context. It has self-consciously to create the architecture to support business investment and innovation. It has to promote long-term business ownership and lean towards the insurgent companies rather than protecting incumbents. The pace of technological change is accelerating, and there has to be massive social investment, especially in the capabilities of our young people. This is a far cry from the language of yet more labour market deregulation, enterprise zones, cutting planning restrictions and having the lowest corporation tax rate in the G20. We know that such policies, continuing the disappointments and mistakes of the past two decades, cannot turn the economy around. What is needed is a sea change.

Lim was recently forced to deny the boast from Joe Sim that they were planning to buy an English club together after the latter bragged about it to undercover reporters on the Dispatches programme. Still, they do have at least one business link, since it is known that Sim leases the Bangkok outlet of the Manchester United Cafe franchise that is part of Lim&apos;s empire. Now the $10m (\u00a36.1m) Peter Lim Scholarship has been launched in his native Singapore, aimed at funding the coaching of young athletes who cannot afford to concentrate full\u2011time on their coaching development. It has gained the support of the former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, who spoke warmly of the &quot;huge commitment from Peter&quot; in the fund when in Singapore last month. Adding his voice to it was the United winger Nani, who gave a talk to scholars and gave lengthy interviews to local media at the Lim launch. Most intriguing is the involvement of the agent Jorge Mendes, who represents Nani, Beb\u00e9 and Cristiano Ronaldo and was last month involved in taking the goalkeeper David de Gea to Old Trafford. According to an interview in the Singaporean newspaper Today, Mendes has been engaged to take the fund&apos;s best players to European clubs. &quot;This is what Peter and I are talking about,&quot; said Mendes. According to the newspaper, Lim and Mendes have been friends for two years after &quot;moving in the same football circles with mutual friends such as the United manager [Sir] Alex Ferguson and the Real Madrid boss [Jos\u00e9] Mourinho.&quot; Whether the fund intends to retain third-party economic rights to the players it invests in will be interesting. Mendes could not be reached on Tuesday. Young blood Joe Sim, according to Dispatches, has close links with the London Nominees fund that sought ways of buying two English football clubs on behalf of a single investor. Another of that fund&apos;s key players is Neil Sillett, the son of Coventry City&apos;s FA Cup\u2011winning co-manager John Sillett. In one of his separately held interests, Sillett is upfront about his investment in indentured footballers. &quot;The underlying principle is straightforward: investors buy shares in the company, and the money raised is used to secure contractual rights on young footballers,&quot; a prospectus for Sillett&apos;s Sillsport Sports Development reads. Yet subscribing shareholders would be going in with their eyes open about the risks involved. &quot;It should be noted that investments into Sillsport Sports Development Ltd are not regulated by the Financial Services Authority nor are the investments covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,&quot; it adds. &quot;There may not be a market to sell the shares were the company to be wound up. Future returns are not guaranteed and investors may receive back less than they originally invested.&quot; Boxing clever Perhaps the investment risk in taking stakes in players is not so great after all. Third-party involvement in player contracts is illegal in England under Premier League and Football Association rules. Overseas it is not outlawed, but Fifa&apos;s Transfer Matching System \u2013 the global electronic clearing house for cross-border deals \u2013 seeks to dissuade clubs from making third-party payments. Yet senior lawyers\u00a0in\u00a0the game believe the practice is rife even among clubs who say they do not hold any third-party contracts. Wouter Lambrecht, the head of legal affairs at the European Club Association that groups together the top clubs in the European game, said at the World Sports Law Report conference this month that the TMS safeguards against it are inadequate. He says there is evidence that clubs are pledging not to make third-party payments by ticking the relevant box in the TMS documentation but then do so anyway. &quot;A box is a box,&quot; said Isabelle Solal, TMS&apos;s head of integrity and compliance. &quot;It is something we can use as evidence that a club has lied. It is something that we plan to use going forward during investigations.&quot; Dope risk warning As the sprinter Bernice Wilson fights a positive drugs test for testosterone and clenbuterol, the government will warn every sports governing body on Wednesday that they are expected to guarantee British sport is drug free at London 2012.

With many economies thriving abroad, the opportunity for a lucrative promotion, a tax-free salary and a full research funding pot mean that more and more people in the sector are thinking about a position in China, America or the Middle East. There are plenty who are already loving working life in a foreign country. Lecturer David Bartsch is one American academic who moved overseas to teach at the University of Qatar in Doha. He told jobs.ac.uk about how much &quot;respect&quot; lecturers have there, how &quot;well-organised&quot; the institution is and how &quot;positive, supporting and encouraging&quot; his fellow lecturers are. But is working abroad in higher education always so sunny and rewarding? Some university tutors wouldn&apos;t say so. One Chronicle forum entry from October last year warned fellow HE tutors about certain cases of &quot;academic apartheid&quot; and workplace discrimination. The poster, an academic in Japan, mentioned that jobs were usually given &quot;with lower salaries, higher teaching loads and no research funding.&quot; Often, these contracts are nonrenewable, or renewable only once and other posters added that attitudes to foreign academics could be quite &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;unfriendly&quot;. With opposing experiences and with such a variety of countries and cultures to consider - even if you&apos;re already set to move - it makes sense to get a heads-up on what to expect and how to settle in.

Where does the AAA rating come from? Rating agencies date back to the 19th century, and the heady early days of the US railways. In the rush to lay track and build railway stations across the American continent, investors craved information to help them profit without losing their shirts. Many railway companies went bankrupt, with some businessmen \u2013 among those later dubbed &quot;robber barons&quot; \u2013 using borderline-illegal tactics to cripple their rivals. Henry Varnum Poor (one of the &quot;fathers&quot; of Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s (S&amp;P) credit-rating agencies) was one of the first analysts to tackle the railway tycoons. He collected and published analyses of the financial health of the various railroad companies that sprang up across the country. John Moody launched a similar venture, called Analyses of Railroad Investments, in the early 20th century. Fitch says it was the first agency to create an alphabetical ranking for bonds issues by countries, called sovereign debt, and corporations in 1924. Fitch, Moody&apos;s and S&amp;P, in 1975, became the first three companies to be recognised as &quot;statistical rating agencies&quot;. Today, there are 10 rating agencies approved by the US securities and exchange commission. What is special about the AAA rating? The &quot;triple A&quot; rating is the highest possible rating that can be given to a company or country. S&amp;P says that it only awards AAA when there is an &quot;extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments&quot;. This gold standard means an AAA-rated borrower can usually secure a loan at lower interest rates, as there is much less risk that the money will not be repaid. Is AAA a guarantee, then, that a borrower will not default? No. The rating agencies are careful to point out that their opinions exist &quot;within a universe of credit risk&quot;, So, there is less chance of an AAA bond defaulting than a BBB one, but still some danger. How many countries have an AAA rating? Because the ratings agencies use slightly different methodologies, there is no single list of AAA-rated sovereign debt. As an example, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s have assigned the AAA rating to the following: Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Territories that are not sovereign are also included: Guernsey, Hong Kong and the Isle of Man. Why don&apos;t China or Japan make the cut? Japan lost its AAA rating in 2001, when S&amp;P warned that its weak economic growth and large deficit made it more of a credit risk. It is now only rated as AA-, the fourth-highest rating, with S&amp;P. As Credit Suisse&apos;s Andrew Garthwaite pointed out, it is ironic that the world biggest net creditor has a lower credit rating than the world&apos;s biggest net debtor [the US]. In practice, the lower rating has little impact, as much of Japan&apos;s government debt is bought by its own citizens or corporations. Despite its strong economic growth, China does not qualify for the AAA rating either. S&amp;P says that &quot;contingent liabilities&quot; (ie unknown but possible future debts) in the Chinese banking system could knock its growth off course, and assigns it an AA- grade. Does one cut lead to another? Once a country is downgraded once, it can quickly see its rating deteriorate. This happened to Greece, which was cut from A to A- in January 2009, and two years later is about to default. Gary Jenkins, a City analyst at Evolution Securities, believes that &quot;from a rating agency perspective the first cut is the hardest ... once that initial downgrade has been made, no doubt others will follow.&quot; Once a triple-A rating is lost, is it gone for ever? No, it is possible to regain the faith of the rating agencies. Back in 1994, Moody&apos;s stripped Canada of its &quot;Aaa&quot; rating, citing concern over its rising debts. Seven years later, after a strict austerity programme helped to rebuild the nation&apos;s finances, it was upgraded to triple-A."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/27/jail-singapore", "sentences": ["Now the 76-year-old great-grandfather is enjoying a new lease of life after being imprisoned for writing a book that dared to criticise the judiciary in Singapore.", "&quot;And I came back from Singapore with two suitcases and nothing of my life in between \u2013 no houses, no cars, no wives.&quot; Shadrake has enjoyed a rip-roaring, itinerant writing career, his life shaped by the stories that he has pursued.", "But Shadrake&apos;s family feared his determination to expose injustice in Singapore was an adventure too far.", "After his third wife died, Shadrake was just about to go to Cuba when a journalist friend phoned and asked him to write some travel stories about Singapore.", "On his only night off he was sitting alone at a bar when he met a Singaporean-Chinese woman who was to become his fourth wife.", "&quot;The very morning I moved into her flat in Singapore I switched the TV on and there was an announcement about a British guy wanted for two murders who had run off to Australia,&quot; remembers Shadrake.", "Shadrake was surprised to hit it off with Darshan Singh, Singapore&apos;s chief executioner for nearly 50 years who once executed 18 men in one day.", "Singapore only recently started revealing its execution rates \u2013 killing six criminals in 2008 and five in 2009 \u2013 and Shadrake argued the death penalty disproportionately applied to the young and the poor, while high-ranking criminals, wealthy foreigners and well-connected drug lords escaped.", "He suspected his book would upset the Singaporean authorities but daringly ignored a warning from the British High Commission not to return to Singapore for his book launch.", "He was also asked to promise not to impugn the integrity of Singapore&apos;s judiciary again.", "I was nobody and I&apos;m nobody now but I&apos;ve just become famous through their stupidity.&quot; Facing 14 charges for &quot;scandalising the judiciary&quot; \u2013 in essence, writing a critical book that could undermine public faith in Singapore&apos;s judicial system \u2013 Shadrake became a global media story.", "Before he went into jail, Shadrake made a vow: &quot;When I come out, I&apos;m going to continue to be a thorn in the side of the Singapore authorities for as long as I live.&quot; He is proud of what he considers his best work in his 50-year career and has &quot;no regrets&quot;.", "After recuperating in Britain he will return to Malaysia, where his book has sold 10,000 copies \u2013 many to traders who have smuggled it into Singapore, where his book is not officially banned but is, mysteriously, unavailable in any shops.", "&quot;The Singapore government scored an own-goal by persecuting Alan.", "His book has drawn the international spotlight to Singapore&apos;s use of the death penalty,&quot; said Lance Lattig, south-east Asia researcher at Amnesty International.", "&quot;When it comes to drug trafficking, Singapore operates an institutionalised system of unfair trials with automatic presumption of guilt and a mandatory death penalty.", "Singapore doesn&apos;t recognise the universal right to free speech.", "Instead, the government tightens or loosens restrictions on free speech as it pleases.&quot; Shadrake is in touch with human rights activists and Singaporean dissidents who have been energised by his book.", "He hopes that repression, injustice and the lack of separation between executive power and the judiciary in Singapore \u2013 criticisms that so inflamed the authorities \u2013 will come crumbling down just as surely as the Berlin Wall did as well.", "&quot;I&apos;ve had tremendous support in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-27T20:00:00Z", "title": "Jailed in Singapore for writing a book they didn't like", "tags": ["Capital punishment", "Singapore", "Books", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Alan Shadrake&apos;s career sparked into life when he uprooted his young family and relocated to Berlin shortly after the wall went up in 1961. Now the 76-year-old great-grandfather is enjoying a new lease of life after being imprisoned for writing a book that dared to criticise the judiciary in Singapore. &quot;I took two suitcases to Berlin, all the stuff I needed,&quot; he says when we meet at his daughter&apos;s house in Essex. &quot;And I came back from Singapore with two suitcases and nothing of my life in between \u2013 no houses, no cars, no wives.&quot; Shadrake has enjoyed a rip-roaring, itinerant writing career, his life shaped by the stories that he has pursued. &quot;What have you done now, Dad?&quot; his children laugh when he phones them from far-flung destinations. But Shadrake&apos;s family feared his determination to expose injustice in Singapore was an adventure too far. When he was found guilty of contempt of court last year for claims in his bestselling book, Once a Jolly Hangman, his youngest daughter emailed to ask: &quot;Will they hang you Dad?&quot; They did not but Shadrake has only recently been freed \u2013 and deported back to Britain \u2013 after five weeks in Changi prison. Shadrake is still recovering from his imprisonment. &quot;It was a pretty horrendous experience,&quot; he says. But he looks younger than his years. He began as a 15-year-old on the Hornchurch and Upminster News and worked his way up to the Daily Express in Manchester before moving to Berlin. There he filed stories for all the UK papers and wrote a book about the people-smuggling racket created by the wall. Later on, he moved to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, writing showbiz features for British tabloids. After his third wife died, Shadrake was just about to go to Cuba when a journalist friend phoned and asked him to write some travel stories about Singapore. So he flew to south-east Asia. On his only night off he was sitting alone at a bar when he met a Singaporean-Chinese woman who was to become his fourth wife. &quot;The very morning I moved into her flat in Singapore I switched the TV on and there was an announcement about a British guy wanted for two murders who had run off to Australia,&quot; remembers Shadrake. That suspect was protected from extradition until it was guaranteed that he would not be put to death and yet Shadrake also spotted the case of Nguyen Van Tuong, a young Australian who was found guilty of heroin trafficking at Changi airport and was hanged. &quot;I saw it as double standards,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought: find a hangman and interview him.&quot; The hangman he eventually tracked down changed his life. Shadrake was surprised to hit it off with Darshan Singh, Singapore&apos;s chief executioner for nearly 50 years who once executed 18 men in one day. &quot;We&apos;re old codgers together,&quot; he says. &quot;I used to talk to him about Manchester United. He loved it.&quot; Shadrake envisioned a biography of Singh&apos;s life but as he spoke to more local people he became convinced the judicial system did not always deliver justice. And so Once a Jolly Hangman tells of a judiciary that embraced the death penalty for murder, drug trafficking and firearms offences. Singapore only recently started revealing its execution rates \u2013 killing six criminals in 2008 and five in 2009 \u2013 and Shadrake argued the death penalty disproportionately applied to the young and the poor, while high-ranking criminals, wealthy foreigners and well-connected drug lords escaped. By the time the book was published, Shadrake had moved to Malaysia. He suspected his book would upset the Singaporean authorities but daringly ignored a warning from the British High Commission not to return to Singapore for his book launch. The evening before he flew in, he called his eldest daughter, Kim, and, with typical black humour, told her he was having his &quot;last dinner&quot;. She joked: &quot;Make sure it&apos;s a good one, it may be your last for a long time.&quot; Inside the launch party, 150 diplomats and activists toasted Shadrake&apos;s book. Outside, police circled in unmarked cars. At 6.30am the next morning, Shadrake was woken in his hotel room by four police officers who ordered him to get dressed. He was interrogated for more than 10 hours a day for five days, a vent of cold air angled on to his neck. An officer opened a copy of his book and repeatedly asked him why he wrote certain sections. &quot;It was a bit ridiculous. I said: &apos;This book is true,&apos;&quot; he remembers. Twice Shadrake was given the chance to publicly apologise before his trial and sentencing. He was also asked to promise not to impugn the integrity of Singapore&apos;s judiciary again. &quot;I suddenly thought, what is this all about? I&apos;m going to apologise and they&apos;ll let me go? Then I thought, I&apos;m not going to apologise. They had fallen into their own trap. They had got me and they didn&apos;t know what to do. They had caused this global outcry. I was nobody and I&apos;m nobody now but I&apos;ve just become famous through their stupidity.&quot; Facing 14 charges for &quot;scandalising the judiciary&quot; \u2013 in essence, writing a critical book that could undermine public faith in Singapore&apos;s judicial system \u2013 Shadrake became a global media story. He was found guilty of nine charges and sentenced to six weeks&apos; imprisonment and a S$20,000 (\u00a310,000) fine. Shadrake, who has heart problems and chronic back pain from a slipped disc, was forced to sleep on a hard floor with only a couple of thin blankets, just along from the prisioners on death row. He fell ill and was rushed to hospital \u2013 chained to the bed \u2013 and put on a drip. His care improved, he says, when he warned the authorities it would be a PR disaster for them if he was photographed arriving back in Britain in a wheelchair. Before he went into jail, Shadrake made a vow: &quot;When I come out, I&apos;m going to continue to be a thorn in the side of the Singapore authorities for as long as I live.&quot; He is proud of what he considers his best work in his 50-year career and has &quot;no regrets&quot;. After recuperating in Britain he will return to Malaysia, where his book has sold 10,000 copies \u2013 many to traders who have smuggled it into Singapore, where his book is not officially banned but is, mysteriously, unavailable in any shops. &quot;The Singapore government scored an own-goal by persecuting Alan. His book has drawn the international spotlight to Singapore&apos;s use of the death penalty,&quot; said Lance Lattig, south-east Asia researcher at Amnesty International. &quot;When it comes to drug trafficking, Singapore operates an institutionalised system of unfair trials with automatic presumption of guilt and a mandatory death penalty. Singapore doesn&apos;t recognise the universal right to free speech. Instead, the government tightens or loosens restrictions on free speech as it pleases.&quot; Shadrake is in touch with human rights activists and Singaporean dissidents who have been energised by his book. He hopes that repression, injustice and the lack of separation between executive power and the judiciary in Singapore \u2013 criticisms that so inflamed the authorities \u2013 will come crumbling down just as surely as the Berlin Wall did as well. &quot;It&apos;s going to be very slow. It might take 10 years but there are definitely changes going on. It&apos;s moving in the right direction now,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve had tremendous support in Singapore. I&apos;m not a hero but I&apos;m treated like one.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jul/28/mps-teachers-education-plan", "sentences": ["&quot;However, the evidence is unclear as to whether entering more disadvantaged students for Ebacc subjects would necessarily make a significant contribution to this aim.&quot; Japan and Singapore, whose education systems are lauded, have models that are similar to the Ebacc."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-27T23:05:01Z", "title": "MPs, teachers and academics criticise education reform plan", "tags": ["Education", "Schools", "Secondary schools", "Vocational education", "Politics", "UK news", "Education policy"], "article": "One of the coalition&apos;s flagship education reforms, the English Baccalaureate, has major flaws and there is no evidence that it improves the prospects of disadvantaged pupils, a powerful cross-party committee of MPs has warned. The English Baccalaureate, or Ebacc, which was introduced into league tables in January, measures the percentage of pupils who have obtained GCSE passes in traditional academic subjects. To achieve the Ebacc, a pupil must score an A* to C grade in English, maths, at least two sciences, history or geography and a modern or classical language. Ministers decided on the measurement partly out of concern that schools in low-income neighbourhoods were not encouraging their pupils to take traditional subjects, thus preventing them from obtaining places at top universities. In May, schools minister Nick Gibb told MPs that the Ebacc was a &quot;key component&quot; in the &quot;overall objective of closing the attainment gap between wealthier and poorer children&quot;. But an Education Committee inquiry into the Ebacc found no evidence that the flagship reform will improve the life chances of low-income pupils. The inquiry \u2013 which gathered evidence from more than 360 teachers, academics and educationalists \u2013 calls on ministers to rethink the Ebacc programme. &quot;The committee fully supports the government&apos;s stated intention to improve the attainment of the poorest young people,&quot; the MPs argue. &quot;However, the evidence is unclear as to whether entering more disadvantaged students for Ebacc subjects would necessarily make a significant contribution to this aim.&quot; Japan and Singapore, whose education systems are lauded, have models that are similar to the Ebacc. But so does Germany, and its education system performs below the OECD average on some indicators, the MPs stated. The report adds: &quot;The evidence which we received does not suggest a link \u2026 between the prescribed study of certain academic subjects and improved attainment and prospects for poorer students.&quot; The commitee calls for ministers to state how they will monitor the performance of children who receive free school meals in relation to the Ebacc. The MPs warn that the reform could lead to teachers devoting more time to pupils who are most likely to achieve the Ebacc, which will &quot;have a negative impact on the most vulnerable or disadvantaged young people&quot;.The MPs said the importance of school league tables is such that headteachers are likely to direct teachers to focus their attention on so-called borderline pupils, who may narrowly miss out on the Ebacc, rather than on brighter pupils or those struggling at the bottom. The government should focus on each pupil&apos;s progress rather than whether they pass the Ebacc, the report argues. Conservative MP Graham Stuart, the committee&apos;s chair, said the Ebacc had generated a &quot;mainly negative response&quot; from teachers and academics. The report warns that the suggested subjects for study in order to obtain the Ebacc are &quot;fairly narrow&quot; and likely to deter pupils from taking art, music and other excluded subjects.&quot;Academic subjects are not the only path to a successful future, and all young people, regardless of background, must continue to have opportunities to study the subjects in which they are likely to be most successful, and which pupils, parents and schools think will serve them best,&quot; Stuart said. He went on to state that: &quot;Our inquiry has uncovered significant issues with the Ebacc&apos;s current composition, and there are certain subjects and qualifications where we are not clear on the rationale behind their exclusion. A focus on a fairly narrow range of subjects, demanding considerable curriculum time, is likely to have negative consequences on the uptake of other subjects.&quot;The MPs argue that ministers were too hasty to introduce the Ebacc, and teachers were outraged when ministers told schools that January league tables for last summer&apos;s exam results would include the measurement. Their pupils had taken their exams before the Ebacc introduction had been announced. Gibb said all children had the right to a broad and balanced education that included English, maths, science, a language and a humanity. &quot;These academic subjects reflect the knowledge and skills young people need to progress to further study or rewarding employment,&quot; he said. &quot;It cannot be right that children from the poorest backgrounds are significantly less likely to have the opportunity to take GCSEs in these subjects than children from more advantaged areas. Closing the attainment gap between children from wealthier and poorer backgrounds is a key objective of the government and the Ebacc measure plays an important part in helping to deliver that objective.&quot;According to the latest league tables, just over 4% of pupils on free school meals \u2013 a key indicator of poverty \u2013 achieved the Ebacc, compared with 17% of pupils who were not."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/28/illegal-wildlife-trade-snakes-plane-bangkok", "sentences": ["Live lizards, snakes and big mammals are increasingly in demand in the Middle East as exotic pets, while tiger bones and bear gall bladders are exported to China, Hong Kong and Singapore for use in Chinese medicine.", "Acres, which campaigns to stop the illegal wildlife trade, recently ran an undercover operation in Singapore which found tiger parts for sale at just under half of all jewellery and antiques shops visited."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-28T09:08:14Z", "title": "Illegal wildlife trade is far more terrifying than just snakes on a plane | Andrew Chambers", "tags": ["Endangered species", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Thailand", "World news", "Conservation", "Animals", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Last week, an Iranian man was stopped by customs officials trying to smuggle 50 live snakes on to a plane in Bangkok, hidden in rolled-up socks in his hand luggage. The &quot;snakes on a plane&quot; headlines have once again focused attention on Thailand as an international hub for the illegal trade in wildlife, a trade worth a staggering \u00a36bn a year. The arrest is the latest in a number of high-profile detentions at the Thai airport. However, local environmental organisations have expressed frustration that police enforcement remains inadequate to tackle a trade that is decimating local ecosystems, hastening the extinction of scores of endangered animals and plundering the resources of developing countries for profits abroad. In May, a passenger bound for Dubai was found to have a gibbon, an Asiatic black bear cub, a marmoset and four baby leopards in his carry-on baggage. Having got through the security checks he was reportedly only stopped after one of the leopards made a &quot;muffled cry&quot; at the departure gate. Other recent seizures also include a drugged tiger cub hidden among stuffed toy animals and three suitcases full of 200 live animals \u2013 containing everything from endangered tortoises to pythons, boa constrictors and a parrot. While superficially promising, these headline arrests actually reveal a deeper problem with law enforcement. The smugglers involved in these cases had not engaged in shadowy criminal networks to procure their animals, they had simply gone shopping in Bangkok&apos;s sprawling outdoor Chatuchak market. One local environmental organisation is so frustrated by this state of affairs that it has published an open letter questioning how &quot;wildlife can be openly sold every weekend&quot; just down the road from the offices of the Thai authorities who regulate the illegal trade. With rare native creatures, a large international airport and long land borders with its south-east Asian neighbours, Thailand is an attractive hub for both the import and export of rare animals. Live lizards, snakes and big mammals are increasingly in demand in the Middle East as exotic pets, while tiger bones and bear gall bladders are exported to China, Hong Kong and Singapore for use in Chinese medicine. Acres, which campaigns to stop the illegal wildlife trade, recently ran an undercover operation in Singapore which found tiger parts for sale at just under half of all jewellery and antiques shops visited. The organisation runs public awareness campaigns to challenge such cultural traditions \u2013 something that is essential in tackling the demand side of the trade. Thailand has also become a major importer in the illegal ivory trade, mostly from Africa. Ivory from domestic Thai elephants can be sold legally \u2013 so illegal ivory is taken to Thailand to be &quot;laundered&quot; into the legal domestic market. Thai customs have seized over 8.5 tons of ivory since 2009 \u2013 equating to more than 1,000 elephant tusks. Traffic, the global wildlife trade monitoring network, explains that Thailand now hosts the world&apos;s largest unregulated domestic ivory market, and argues that &quot;Thailand needs to close [this] domestic ivory loophole once and for all&quot;. Corruption and insufficient sentencing deterrents also create regulation difficulties. Freeland Foundation, an international conservation and human rights organisation based in Bangkok, has described official corruption as the biggest problem that it faces in tackling the trade. A recent example is the Dubai-bound passenger arrested with the four baby leopards. Immediately after his detention the police reported they had been politically pressured to not charge him. The smuggler&apos;s client was allegedly a Dubai prince with connections to influential Thai politicians. He was released on bail and promptly escaped the country. Freeland Foundation director Steven Galster remarked: &quot;Over the past six years we&apos;ve seen only one trafficker go to prison. And that was because the prosecutor [...] happened to be an animal lover.&quot; While police may make low-level arrests, those ultimately controlling the trade have repeatedly gone unpunished. A draft law to increase trafficking sentences was proposed eight years ago \u2013 but has still not passed. The Thai politician and human rights and environment activist Kraisak Choonhavan admits that previously, with &quot;so many urgent laws to consider, something like [a new] wildlife law just never saw the light of day&quot;. However, with the recent elections providing a large democratic mandate and signalling an end to the political instability of recent years, there is real potential for a new political emphasis on tackling the illegal trade in wildlife. Without this political will, Thailand and south-east Asia risk a massive and irreversible loss of biodiversity as natural resources continue to be plundered overseas."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/28/reg-gwilliam-obituary", "sentences": ["He and his wife, Margaret, then briefly held teaching posts in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-07-28T16:35:37Z", "title": "Reg Gwilliam obituary", "tags": [], "article": "My friend Reg Gwilliam, who has died aged 86, was headteacher of Monk&apos;s Walk school, a new comprehensive in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, from 1964 to 1982.

Born in Pembrokeshire and educated in Chester, Reg did his national service from 1944 as a Royal Marine, witnessing the aftermath of the Japanese surrender. The experience, especially the comradeship, helped form his enduring leftish loyalties and was recalled in a memoir, published in\u00a01989 and dedicated to his fellows. Our friendship began at Liverpool University, where he arrived in 1946 to study history. He graduated in 1949 and went on to do an MA. In 1948 he married Margaret Hatchwell. According to Reg, he first saw her as\u00a0they queued in primary school for a\u00a0vaccination, and he announced to his sister that he would marry her. This rings true: clarity and steadfastness of purpose were among his defining characteristics, as was good judgment. In retirement, Reg was president of the United Nations Association in Welwyn, a member of the Council of the Navy Records Society (2000-2005) and co-editor of\u00a0its newsletter (1998-2004). He was president of the local Rotary club several times. Rotary allowed him to combine his natural sociability and dedication to good causes with his passion for exercise and fun. In his 80s, he undertook three sponsored walks, each of seven miles.

So here&apos;s a question: when did everyone start taking the qualifying draw for the World Cup so damn seriously? When Fifa began giving it preposterously grandiose titles like The 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 Preliminary Draw, that&apos;s when.  Anyway, here&apos;s when it starts: 7pm.  And here&apos;s where it starts: The Marina da Gloria, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  And here&apos;s what&apos;s going to happen: Two hours of Fifa dignitaries and apparatchiks failing to shut their yakking necks. In between all the hot air and bluster, some stuff will be decided...  1: The confederation pairings for the two intercontinental play-offs.\u2022 The Asian, North, Central America and Caribbean, Oceanian and South American zones all have place up for grabs via one of these two play-offs. But which confederations will be paired together? We find out, at The 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil\u2122 Preliminary Draw - LIVE!  2. The draw for the African qualifying zone.\u2022 The 24 lowest-ranked nations have been put into the following pots:Pot 5: Mozambique, Congo DR, Togo, Liberia, Tanzania, Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Namibia, Burundi, Madagascar.Pot 6: Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Swaziland, Comoros, Lesotho, Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, Mauritius, Seychelles, Sao Tome e Principe.\u2022 They&apos;ll get drawn together in Round One, and will play each other home and away between 11 and 15 November this year. The winners advance to Round Two, where they join the remaining 28 African nations, to be drawn into ten four-nation round-robin groups. Those groups will come from these pots:Pot 1: Cote d&apos;Ivorie, Egypt, Ghana, Burkino Faso, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Cameroon, Algeria, Tunisia.Pot 2: Gabon, Libya, Morocco, Guinea, Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Mali, Cape Verde Islands.Pot 3: Benin, Zimbabwe, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Niger, Angola, Gambia, winners 1 and 2 from Round One.Pot 4: Winners 3 to 12 from Round One.\u2022 The winners of each group will then advance to Round Three, where they&apos;ll be paired into five home-and-away ties. The five winners of those will be off to Brazil.  3. The draw for the Asian qualifying zone.\u2022 This is already onto Round Three. No, me neither. Anyway, there are 20 teams remaining, and they&apos;ll all be drawn into five groups of four, from the following pots:Pot 1 (this lot received a bye to this stage): Australia, China, Iran, Japan, South Korea.Pot 2: Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan.Pot 3: Bahrain, Iraq, Oman, Syria, United Arab Emirates.Pot 4: Indonesia, North Korea, Lebanon, Singapore, Thailand.\u2022 Then it&apos;s Round Four, where the winners and runners up of each Round Three group will be drawn into two round-robin groups of five. The two group winners and runners-up go to Brazil. The third-placed teams play off (this is needlessly titled Round Five) for Asia&apos;s place in the Intercontinental Play-Off.  4. The draw for the North, Central America and Caribbean qualifying zone.\u2022 We&apos;re onto Round Two already here. Teams from the following pots will be popped into six groups of four:Pot 4: Panama, Canada, El Salvador, Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti.Pot 5: Antigua and Barbuda, Guyana, Suriname, St Kitts and Nevis, Guatemala, Dominica.Pot 6: Puerto Rico, Barbados, Curacao, St Vincent &amp; Grenadines, Cayman Islands, Nicaragua.Pot 7: Bermuda, Belize, Dominican Republic, US Virgin Islands, St Lucia, Bahamas.\u2022 The winners move on to Round Three, where three groups of four will be drawn from the following pots:Pot 1: USA, Mexico, Honduras.Pot 2: Jamaica, Costa Rica, Cuba.Pot 3: The six winners from Round Two. Are you not asleep yet?\u2022 The three group winners and runners-up will be chucked into a round-robin group of six teams for Round Four, with the top three heading to brazil, and the fourth going to the Intercontinental Play-Off.  5. The draw for the Oceanian qualifying zone.They&apos;re just going to do paper, scissors, stone.  5. OK, this is what they&apos;re doing in Oceania.\u2022 The four lowest-ranked teams - American Samoa, Cook Islands, Samoa and Tonga - will contest a league in Round One. The winner advances to Round Two, which is also the group stage of the 2012 OFC Nations Cup. The two groups of four are drawn from these pots:Pot 1: New Zealand, Fiji, New Caledonia, Vanuatu.Pot 2: Solomon Islands, Tahiti, Papua New Guinea, Round One winner.\u2022 The top two teams advance to the semis of the OFC Nations Cup, but also move into Round Three of this business, which is a round-robin league, the winner advancing to the Intercontinental Play-Off.  6. The South American zone.This lot just get thrown into a big round-robin group. Nothing to see here.  7. And so to Europe, which should be drawn around 8.15pm.\u2022 You know the pack drill here. There will be eight round-robin groups of six teams, plus one of five, drawn from the following pots:Pot 1: Spain, Netherlands, Germany, England, Portugal, Italy, Croatia, Norway, Greece.Pot 2: France, Montenegro, Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Slovenia, Turkey, Serbia, Slovakia.Pot 3: Switzerland, Israel, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Czech Republic, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belarus, Ukraine, Hungary.Pot 4: Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia, Lithuania, Albania, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Austria, Poland.Pot 5: Armenia, Finland, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Moldova, Macedonia, Azerbaijan, Faroe Islands.Pot 6: Wales, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Malta, Andorra, San Marino.\u2022 If Russia draw Georgia, they&apos;ll redraw, or pop the ball in another group, or something.\u2022 The winners of each group make it to Brazil. The eight best runners-up are paired into four home-and-away play-offs, the winners of each one booking their tickets to Rio (which may or may not be a good idea depending on where their matches will be held, but you know what I&apos;m getting at).  And that, I think, is all we need to know in order to embrace Fifa Qualifying Event\u2122 with gusto. But don&apos;t be going through any of that with a fine-toothed comb. Just don&apos;t. I&apos;ll be back here from 6pm, when things slowly get moving.  6.01pm: Things aren&apos;t really moving yet. Not even slowly.  6.10pm: In the meantime, here&apos;s Paul Wilson on the spectre of France in this skewed World Cup draw. Wilson&apos;s angle is very much from an English perspective, which in some ways does make his article, while very fine, totally redundant, as we all know France will be drawn in the same group as Scotland and Germany or Spain. Wild speculation and guesswork, you might argue, but that&apos;s how the Scottish roll at these things.  6.20pm: A weather report from the Marina da Gloria: it&apos;s blowing a gale. This is causing the Fifa Apparatchiks\u2122 at the swanky Rio venue no end of worry, as there&apos;s some temporary roofing over the marina, and it&apos;s in danger of flying out to sea. Let&apos;s hope if that does happen that all the delegates are safe, all the delegates use top-of-the-range rug glue, and Fifa have employed an official Fifa Swannee Whistle Operative\u2122 to soundtrack proceedings.  6.40pm: You&apos;ll notice I&apos;ve not put any updates up for 20 minutes. A third of an hour. There is a reason for that.  6.50pm: &quot;I presume the reason for the lack of reports is that, even though the roof survived the high winds, the excessive amount of hot air inside floated it away like a balloon?&quot; quips Paddy Reilly. Don&apos;t even think about joking about stuff like that, Paddy, there&apos;s a very real danger that it could happen. I hope Fifa have booked Fifth Dimension.             Altogether now: the world&apos;s a nicer place in my beautiful balloon / it wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon...  7pm: According to Rob Wotton, chairing this nonsense on Sky Sports News, it&apos;s a good omen for England that today is the 45th anniversary of their World Cup win. The straws folk grasp at. Meanwhile, World Cup fever rages in Brazil already. &quot;At the request of Fifa, Santos Dumont Airport, which is right next door to Marina da Gloria, has shut down for the afternoon,&quot; reports Isabela Rosito. &quot;I love football but I am sick of this World Cup already.&quot;  7.10pm: There is a big protest going on outside the marina, led by folk who are being evicted from their homes so tournament infrastructure can be put in place. Ricardo Teixeira, head of the Brazilian federation, is copping for most of the flak. Like he cares, being whisked past the placards and a ring of steel, and into the venue, where canap\u00e9s and fizzy booze await. To think we actually wanted to stage one of these things. &quot;I&apos;ve read your explanation twice,&quot; boasts/admits Steve Rackett. &quot;You have probably greatly simplified the process, but it&apos;s giving everyone a headache. Are you taking a bung from Anadin?&quot; You&apos;ll not catch me peddling pills, Steve. Stop the pusher. Having said that, Laphroaig usually takes the edge off. Have you tried Laphroaig?  7.20pm: So, Jerome Valcke, head gimp at Fifa, takes the stage. He&apos;ll be running the show here. He&apos;s not hanging about, either, and from two small green plinths, their design influenced by old-school bubblegum machines, he draws the balls to determine the confederation pairings for the two intercontinental play-offs: Asia v North, Central America and CaribbeanSouth America v Oceania &quot;Now, let&apos;s get on with the big draw.&quot; Cafu and Neymar take the stage and begin to talk. I couldn&apos;t care less what either of them have to say. I&apos;m assuming you don&apos;t either, and would be so disappointed in you if I was wrong.  7.30pm: Right: here&apos;s the draw for Round One of the African zone: Seychelles v KenyaGuinea-Bissau v TogoDjibouti v NamibiaMauritius v LiberiaComoros v MozambiqueEquatorial Guinea v MadagascarSomalia v EthiopiaLesotho v BurundiEritrea v RwandaSwaziland v Congo DRSao Tome e Principe v CongoChad v Tanzania All those ties courtesy of Neymar from A Flock of Seagulls.  7.40pm: And now to Round Two of the African zone: Group ASouth AfricaBotswanaCentral African RepublicSomalia or Ethiopia Group BTunisiaCape Verde IslandsSierra LeoneEquatorial Guinea or Madagascar Group CCote d&apos;IvoireMoroccoGambiaChad or Tanzania Group DGhanaZambiaSudanLesotho or Burundi Group EBurkina FasoGabonNigerSao Tome e Principe or Congo Group FNigeriaMalawiSeychelles or KenyaDjibouti or Namibia Group GEgyptGuineaZimbabweComoros or Mozambique Group HAlgeriaMaliBeninEritrea or Rwanda Group ICameroonLibyaGuinea-Bissau or TogoSwaziland or Congo DR Group JSenegalUgandaAngolaMauritius or Liberia  7.50pm: So now, with a little help from Brazil legend Zico, and Lucas (not that one, the one from S\u00e3o Paulo), it&apos;s the draw for the Asian qualifying zone. We begin, as you do, with Round Three: Group AChinaJordanIraqSingapore Group BSouth KoreaKuwaitUnited Arab EmiratesLebanon Group CJapanUzbekistanSyriaNorth Korea Group DAustraliaSaudi ArabiaOmanThailand Group EIranQatarBahrainIndonesia  7.55pm: The Fifa shindig has paused for a musical interlude, so how about one of our own? Here&apos;s Tom Jobim, which isn&apos;t a very imaginative choice, but it is very good:             Anyone for a caipirinha and some cigarettes?  8pm: We&apos;re back. Note the lack of exclamation mark. We&apos;re moving onto the draw for the North, Central America and Caribbean qualifying zone. Helping us here is Bebeto and soon-to-be-Chelsea-star Lucas Piazon. They yak platitudes.  8.10pm: The first round we&apos;re bothered with is Round Two, for the smaller countries in this zone.

And this time they actually are playing some Tom Jobim: the Girl from Ipanema. It&apos;s a really quite bad version, though, by some chancer relative of Jobim&apos;s. So let&apos;s hear a proper version:             Aaaah. Anyone for a caipirinha and some cigarettes?  8.25pm: That samba classic has put me in a wisful mood. Speaking of which: &quot;Oh God, Wales are in Pot 6 with Liechtenstein, Andorra and San Marino,&quot; notes Martin Gwynn Jones. &quot;The country of Johnny Charles, Ryan Giggs, John Toshack, Dai Davies, Ian Rush. Brings a tear to your eye.&quot; Mario Zagallo and the Vasco da Gama youngster Fellipe Bastos will be on to do the business for Oceania. Zagallo mentions 1950, and that it won&apos;t happen again. They&apos;ll win their sixth title, he promises. I predict meltdown, myself, but time will tell. Either way it promises to be quite a spectacle.  8.30pm: Nice and simple in Oceania. This is how Round Two will look: Group AVanuatuNew CaledoniaAmerican Samoa, Cook Islands, Samoa or Tonga (the winners from Round One)Tahiti Group BFijiNew ZealandSolomon IslandsPapua New Guinea  8.32pm: Some chat about the South American zone. No qualifying draw required, of course, because they all go into a league. This is the sort of qualifying format I appreciate. Brazil, of course, are already in the thing, on account of hosting the tournament. Europe is coming up, folks, but not before more music. And a symphonic orchestra are playing Brazil. I&apos;ve already posted that one up, so no point going over old ground. That ended up being quite prescient. Or have the musical choices at this event been stupefyingly obvious?  8.35pm: Here&apos;s Robin Hazlehurst, trying to make me feel better about tapping away furiously to write this report, but not quite managing it: &quot;Just noticed that your Saturday night extravaganza of blokes we don&apos;t much know about waffling at great length before distributing teams we don&apos;t much care about hasn&apos;t yet made it into Guardian Football&apos;s top ten most viewed of the last 24 hours. Why&apos;s that then? And why am I viewing it? Please don&apos;t answer that.&quot; Altogether now: thank you, my Guardian Sport!  8.40pm: So, we&apos;ve finally arrived at this evening&apos;s big one, the European draw. The stars pulling out the balls: the ball-shaped Ronaldo, who has scored 14 goals in World Cup finals but been credited for some reason with 15 - that one against Costa Rica in 2002 was not on target - and Santos&apos;s young Ossie Ardiles lookalike Ganso. Yak yak yak, they both say. Yak yak yak.  8.45pm: Right, we&apos;ll be off in a sec. Keep refreshing. Anyone Scottish can start crying in a few minutes.

They couldn&apos;t become the first champions not to get the chance to defend their trophy in the finals, could they?  9.10pm: Anyway, that&apos;s your lot. England surely can&apos;t balls that group up. Can they? Actually, let&apos;s not bet the ranch. As for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland? Nobody will be spinning cartwheels, but it could have been a whole lot worse. Optimism, people. You might as well, nothing&apos;s starting for a good while yet.

US Treasuries (bonds) account for 54% of the money invested in AAA sovereign debt. The most attractive AAA economies like Sweden and Denmark account for barely 1% each. The only real alternative are German Bunds. David Page, senior economist at Lloyds Corporate Markets, believes the move to corporate bonds could become an established investment pattern if US Treasuries are downgraded: &quot;If the debt ceiling issue is a sideshow and the ratings agencies are unimpressed by whatever measures Congress comes up with on national debt, it may be the start of a more long-lasting trend as investors search for new areas to place cash.&quot; If the US is downgraded, the ratings agency league tables will place the world&apos;s largest economy on a lower rating than Guernsey and the Isle of Man."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/01/credit-ratings-which-country-next", "sentences": ["National debt: 56.1% Singapore As one of the hubs of global trade, Singapore moves with the economic cycle.", "Although Singapore has a debt to GDP ratio in excess of 100%, it runs a budget surplus.", "Data for Hong Kong and Singapore from the World Bank."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-01T19:29:23Z", "title": "Credit ratings: which country will be next in the firing line?", "tags": ["Global economy", "Rating agencies", "US economy", "Financial sector", "Economics", "Business", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Despite the eleventh-hour debt deal in Washington, the US is still almost certain to be turfed out of one of the world&apos;s most exclusive clubs when it is stripped out of its prized triple A credit rating.

Australia With strong banks, a low national debt and an economy that has boomed as a result of exports of commodities to China, Australia is at no immediate threat of having its debt downgraded. Its weakness is that the commodity boom has pushed up its real exchange, damaging its manufacturing sector. 2011 growth forecast: 2.9%. 2011 budget deficit: 2.8% GDP.

National debt: 80% Canada Similar to Australia in that it has benefited from exports of its natural resources, Canada is vulnerable to an economic and financial crisis in the US and to a plunge in oil and other commodity prices that would result from a global double-dip recession. It has a solid banking system. Growth 3%. Budget deficit: 4.9%. National debt 85.9% Denmark A low-risk country, Denmark has a relatively modest national debt and because it is not part of the eurozone has exchange-rate flexibility should demand for its exports suffer as a result of problems in its key European markets. Growth 1.9%. Budget deficit: 3.8%. National debt: 57.1% Finland An ageing population means that there are long-term fiscal challenges for Finland, but it would be a major surprise if it were to be put on negative watch. It has seen solid growth of consumption, investment and exports, and by European standards has a low level of debt. Growth 3.8%. Budget deficit: 1.4%. National debt: 62.7% France Despite being the second biggest economy in the single currency, France looks to be the most vulnerable European country to a downgrade. It has had solid if unspectacular growth over the past couple of years, but has a debt to GDP ratio of close to 100%, is running a high budget deficit and has a generous welfare system. The OECD has warned France has long-term fiscal issues. Growth: 2.2%. Budget deficit: 5.6%. National debt: 97.3%. Germany The sky would have to be falling in on global capitalism for Germany to lose its triple A status. Growth, helped by exports of investment goods to China, has been healthy, the budget deficit is the lowest in the G7 group of industrial nations, and the government in Berlin is strongly committed to fiscal rectitude. Germany would be hard hit by an existential euroone crisis, but would be one of the last dominos to topple. Growth: 3.4%. Budget deficit 2.1%. National debt 87.3%. Hong Kong Robust growth, a budget surplus, a low level of national debt, and China to fall back on should times get rough all mean that Hong Kong&apos;s debt will continue to be assessed as top notch. Its economy was sorely affected by the recession of 2008-09 but its recovery was swift. Growth (2010): 6%. Budget deficit (2009) 0.6%. National debt (2009) 30.5%. Luxembourg Perhaps even lower risk than Germany, Luxembourg&apos;s only real risk is the vulnerability of its pivotal financial sector to a generalised banking crisis or much tougher international re-regulation of the sector than currently looks likely. Debts are low and the budget deficit tiny. Growth: 3.2%. Budget deficit: 0.9%. National debt: 20.5% Netherlands The rating agencies are likely to be impressed that the Netherlands embarked on fiscal tightening almost as soon as the country started to emerge from recession. Like Germany, growth has been heavily dependent on the performance of exports. Growth: 2.3%. Budget deficit: 3.7%. National debt: 74.3% Norway Oil prices would have to fall below $10 a barrel and stay there for years to come for Norway to come under serious scrutiny from S&amp;P, Moody&apos;s and Fitch. It runs a double-digit budget surplus and, unlike Britain, has salted away North Sea revenues over the past 30 years into a war chest that can be raided in future years as the population ages. Growth: 2.5%. Budget surplus: 12.5%. National debt: 56.1% Singapore As one of the hubs of global trade, Singapore moves with the economic cycle. It had a rapid and deep contraction in the winter of 2008-09 but bounced back impressively in 2010, growing by 17.5% according to the World Bank. Although Singapore has a debt to GDP ratio in excess of 100%, it runs a budget surplus. Low risk. Growth (2010): 17.5%. Budget surplus (2009): 1.7%. National debt (2009): 113.3%. Sweden Like the other Scandinavian countries, Sweden looks relatively fireproof. Growth is strong, national debt is one of the lowest in Europe and the budget is in surplus. Exports would suffer were the global economy to go sour but for the time being Sweden is Norway without the oil. Growth: 4.5%. Budget surplus: 0.3%. National debt 45.4%. Switzerland Along with gold, the Swiss franc has been the bolt hole for anxious investors during the sovereign debt jitters of recent months. Switzerland has two big potential headaches: the impact on its banks of a second financial crisis and the loss of export competitiveness caused by the appreciation of the franc. Even so, a downgrade is the remotest of possibilities. Growth 2.7%. Budget surplus: 0.6%. National debt: 38.7% United Kingdom With so many other triple A countries looking pretty secure, the UK still appears to be one of the riskier nations despite George Osborne&apos;s tough austerity programme. The budget deficit is high, national debt is rising and last week&apos;s growth figures showed the economy struggling to emerge from the UK&apos;s deepest and longest post-war recession. The rating agencies have so far been impressed by the government&apos;s fiscal plans; a prolonged period of sluggish expansion that prompted a U-turn on tax and spending would lead to a reassessment. Growth: 1.4%. Budget deficit: 8.7%. National debt: 88.5% Tax havens Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Liechtenstein all receive a triple A rating by virtue of their status as tax havens.

Police have imposed a nighttime curfew in the centre of Kashgar and armed paramilitary police are guarding major junctions following the weekend&apos;s violence. Officials have blamed extremists trained in camps in Pakistan for Sunday&apos;s attack, which left 11 dead. Pakistan, one of China&apos;s closest allies, has condemned the violence and pledged support in tackling terrorism. A police officer said the incident appeared to be linked to violence the previous night \u2013 when two blasts and a knife attack left seven dead, including one assailant \u2013 but authorities have yet to say who was responsible for that assault. A notice posted on the Xinjiang regional government website said police shot Memtieli Tiliwaldi, 29, and Turson Hasan, 34, who had been hiding in fields on the outskirts of Kashgar. Police had issued a reward of 100,000 yuan (\u00a39,400) for information leading to their arrest, believing they were among a group who stormed a restaurant on Sunday, killing the owner and waiter and setting fire to the building. The assailants then hacked to death four people on the street and wounded 12 more. Police shot dead five suspects at the scene and arrested four others. Authorities later said the group&apos;s leaders received firearms and explosives training at terrorist camps in Pakistan run by the separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). The region&apos;s Communist Party boss, Zhang Chunxian, has ordered a crackdown on &quot;illegal religious activities&quot; in the wake of the attacks, the state news agency Xinhua added. It is less than a fortnight since officials said 18 people were killed in an attack on a police station in Hotan, another city in the region. Uighur exiles disputed that account. Exiled Uighur leader Rebiyah Kadeer, president of the World Uyghur Congress, said she opposed violence but blamed the Chinese government for Sunday&apos;s attacks. Kadeer said in a statement: &quot;I am saddened that Han Chinese and Uyghurs have lost their lives. At the same time, I cannot blame the Uighurs who carry out such attacks for they have been pushed to despair by Chinese policies. I condemn the Chinese government for the incident. &quot;The Chinese government has created an environment of hopelessness that means it must take responsibility for civilian deaths and injuries caused by their discriminatory policies.&quot; She added that the congress was sceptical of claims the attackers had connections to international terrorist groups. The Uyghur American Association said in a statement that it feared Uighurs could face arbitrary detention and torture. &quot;Chinese officials have sown the seeds of instability in East Turkestan through the repressive measures they have enforced since the unrest of July 5, 2009&quot;, added president Alim Seytoff. Xinjiang has been under tight security since the ethnic riots in the capital Urumqi, which killed almost 200 mostly Han Chinese people. Professor Rohan Gunaratna of Singapore&apos;s International Centre for Violence and Terrorism Research said he believed the weekend&apos;s attacks were carried out by ETIM or people inspired by the group. He added that ETIM \u2013 which he believes is the same organisation as the Turkestan Islamic Party \u2013 had been in decline since its leader was killed in 2003. Its size and influence was further reduced by the death of a new leader in a US missile strike in Waziristan last year. Gunaratna said ETIM now numbered a few dozen members and relied on overseas terrorist groups for training because it did not have its own infrastructure. While there is evidence of links between al-Qaida and ETIM, some experts question whether the contacts were substantial and how long they lasted. There are also disputes about whether ETIM is a group as such, or little more than an umbrella term. Nicholas Bequelin, senior Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;The reason the Chinese government always points at foreign involvement in violent incidents in Xinjiang is to take the focus off local discontent.&quot; Many in the large Uighur Muslim population are angered by religious and cultural controls, economic discrimination and large-scale Han migration."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/data-centres-air-conditioning-cooling", "sentences": ["Data centre operators in some of the hottest and most humid places in the world \u2013 like Singapore and Saudi Arabia \u2013 only need to switch on their mechanical cooling systems for part of the year."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-02T11:45:03Z", "title": "Datacentres: time to take the chill out of the air", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Low carbon ICT", "Data centres"], "article": "Many in my sector get hot under the collar over data centre cooling. The accepted folklore says that for a variety of reasons, you can&apos;t ever allow the temperature of your data centre IT equipment rise above a certain temperature \u2013 normally 25 degrees C. The concern is that above this temperature, data centre IT equipment will fail or start to consume vast amounts of energy. Perhaps understandably, this means that operators tend to be cautious. They often take what they consider to be the safe route and over-cool their data centres with expensive mechanical cooling systems. However, the reality is that in most current data centres, issues in the design and operation mean that they&apos;re exposing themselves to unnecessary levels of energy cost and increased risk anyway. A recently released technical paper, co-authored with the BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, presents hard evidence that there is opportunity to both stabilise risk profile and save large amounts of cash and carbon as well. The paper finds that operators can make far better use of their existing IT equipment&apos;s temperature and humidity ranges and that doing this can significantly reduce operating costs and energy consumption \u2013 without any significant increase in IT energy consumption or risk. In fact, it demonstrates that in many countries, data centres can be operated without any mechanical cooling whatsoever. And by many countries, I&apos;m not just talking about countries in the colder North. The report shows that data centres can operate without mechanical cooling across much of Europe and North America. Data centre operators in some of the hottest and most humid places in the world \u2013 like Singapore and Saudi Arabia \u2013 only need to switch on their mechanical cooling systems for part of the year. With this in mind, there&apos;s certainly no reason for businesses in the UK or across much of Europe to be refrigerating their data centres at all. So how is this possible? The problem is not with the equipment itself, as IT equipment has been able to operate in wider ranges than most data centres attempt to maintain for years, but rather, with how data centres are currently being designed, built and operated. In order to unlock the dramatic cost and energy savings that can be made operators must modernise their data centre designs and improve their operational processes \u2013 and that&apos;s what&apos;s been going wrong so far. Many of the big internet operators have claimed very high efficiency through the use of external air instead of any cooling system but this is not for everyone as the substantial swings in both intake temperature and humidity required to allow this approach shorten the working life of the IT equipment. To achieve the operating efficiency and cost benefits this radical approach is unnecessary and in fact, operators can continue to run the re-circulated (clean) air systems with well controlled humidity that they are comfortable with. For example, inefficient air flow often creates large temperature differences between the coldest point in a cooling system and your IT equipment intake \u2013 and that&apos;s what needs to be eliminated because it forces the air conditioning equipment to work much harder to provide even colder air to make sure the IT equipment with the worst managed airflow stays in the recommended range all the time. Properly managing the airflow allows the operator to increase the temperature of a data centre&apos;s cooling system through the use of best practices like air flow containment resulting in multiple benefits to energy consumption, capacity and risk. Through taking relatively conservative actions, operators can reduce their chiller hours to less than four months per year across most of the world. In Europe and North America it can be reduced to less than two months per year and due to the compounded benefits the majority of energy and operational cost savings have been achieved. By being more aggressive and completely eliminating mechanical cooling, operators can release either substantial capital cost savings or increased IT equipment capacity \u2013 indeed we found that the benefit of cutting out mechanical cooling is a huge reduction in the cost of delivering each kWh of IT equipment power (and let&apos;s be honest that&apos;s what data centres actually do) \u2013 by up to 20%.

British investors now hold more than \u00a340bn in emerging market funds \u2013 typically invested in China, Brazil and India \u2013 and those who jumped in early have done well. The average fund invested in China has made a 112% gain since 2006 while the very best fund, run by First State, has notched up a breathtaking 159% gain for its investors. Meanwhile, the average fund invested in UK shares has limped in with a rise of 18% over the same period. But last week the head of global emerging market equities at First State, Jonathan Asante, told investors that the good times may be over. Asante wrote to investors saying that most stocks in emerging markets are &quot;fully valued&quot;, which in fund manager speak means he believes that they are not worth investing in and could be headed for a fall. A formal warning to investors from their fund manager is extremely rare, as it could prompt investors to bolt for the exit \u2013 and shrink the funds from which they are paid. Asante takes a longer view than most of his rivals. Profit sharing and bonuses at First State are only paid out on the basis of three-year numbers rather than quarterly or half-yearly figures. Managers are also required to put most of their personal wealth into their funds. &quot;It means that managers have to eat their own cooking,&quot; he says. Asante, who used to teach at the London School of Economics before becoming a fund manager, is not forecasting an abrupt halt to the Chinese economic miracle, or an end to India&apos;s growth. But he says that so much money has flooded into the shares of emerging market companies that even the best of them may now be overvalued. Many companies command share price ratings which are a multiple of their equivalents in the west, he says, yet are trading in areas where corruption is rife, inflation rising, where legal systems are immature and where back-door state control is common. Overvaluations are perhaps most severe in Latin America, particularly Brazil, he says. Indeed, he was so concerned that last December he wrote a separate warning note to clients in his Latin American portfolios. It was a good call \u2013 the S\u00e3o Paulo Bovespa index was then around 70,000, and is now around 56,000. He continues to believe that the Brazilian currency, the real, is the &quot;most ridiculously over-valued currency in the world&quot;. It is telling what First State managers are doing with their own cash tied up in First State funds. They now only have around 60% in equity funds, with 40% in cash (sterling, Hong Kong dollar and Singapore dollar) and gold. &quot;The world is a very risky place right now. I would have to be sceptical of the China story. The central planners have in some senses been wonderful at balancing growth, inflation, banking and environmental concerns. I applaud them but wonder if they can keep this going forever.&quot; However, Asante&apos;s views are not shared by the majority of emerging market fund managers. In contrast, the manager of another giant emerging markets fund, Michael Konstantinov, of the \u00a3870m Allianz RCM Bric Stars fund, this week told potential investors that valuations are currently &quot;very cheap&quot; (his italics) and that they offer an &quot;outstanding entry point&quot;. &quot;I think it is important to remind ourselves that the Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries came through the global economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 quite well. Brazil did not even go into recession in 2009 while India and China continued to grow very strongly in the range of 8%-9%. Only Russia had a short-term setback, but has recovered well and is, again, leading the global growth dynamic. &quot;As the demand side of these economies is mainly driven by domestic demand, not by exports, they are more resilient to a global crisis.&quot; Fidelity, which took more than \u00a3500m from UK investors into a China fund launched by its most high-profile manager, Anthony Bolton, has struggled to make money for them yet. The trust is currently trading at 96p compared to its launch price of 100p in April 2010, although Fidelity remains bullish on the region. Nick Price, manager of Fidelity Emerging Markets fund and the Fidelity EMEA fund, says: &quot;As an emerging market fund manager you&apos;d expect me to be bullish wouldn&apos;t you? Clearly, many of the markets are facing headwinds right now and these may last for some months. But having just come back from China where I spent a week visiting 30 companies, I remain convinced that the China consumer story is as strong as ever.&quot;On a longer-term basis, emerging market stocks represent a fraction of their potential worth. It&apos;s a strong statement I know, but look at the facts. Emerging markets represent 90% of the world&apos;s oil reserves, over 80% of the world&apos;s population, over 60% of the world&apos;s forex reserves, 30% of global GDP, but yet are only 13% of global stock market capitalisation.

Yet millions of Muslims around the globe choose to do just that when they fast in Ramadan. Those with purchasing power must surely see this enforced austerity in a world of plenty as something akin to a warped practice: Why live like paupers when you can afford more? In this very question also lies the spirit of Ramadan: empathy for the &quot;other&quot;, or that which is different from one&apos;s self if we accept the definition provided by the German philosopher Hegel. By way of divine decree, Ramadan has come to denote a month where Muslims who can must not, an act that accords them a chance to feel for the have-nots. Writing for the people&apos;s panel on fasting just a few days back, Guardian commenter Zarka Anwar describes Ramadan as &quot;a time when beauty moulds in a Muslim&apos;s heart to remember the unfortunate&quot;. It is a point that is lost to some in the Malaysian media. With about 60% of the nation&apos;s population professing Islam, the local broadcaster 8TV ran a trio of 30-seconds clips in the first week of Ramadan aimed at instructing its non-Muslim ethnic minorities about the etiquette of proper conduct appropriate to this Islamic holy month. The advertisements feature a young Chinese woman behaving greedily, obnoxiously and wearing tight clothings at a Ramadan bazaar to the chagrin of the Muslim Malays around her. Rightly so, the racist undertone has caused a public uproar as multitudes registered their displeasure on the station&apos;s official Facebook page. While the station retracted the advertisements within 48 hours of first screening them and issued a public apology, this episode is telling of the dominant interpretation among members of the Malay bourgeoisie there about the value of Ramadan. Ending each advertisement is a condescendingly moralising message that puts the onus of betterment on the culturally &quot;other&quot; when the focus should be an improvement of the self. In one, non-Muslims are explicitly told: &quot;Do not be loud or obnoxious.&quot; In another, it was: &quot;Do not be greedy and eat in public.&quot; Such a didactic view of Ramadan ignores the inclusive leanings of this holy month. Indeed, empathy for the other is not just theologically expressed through the act of fasting. It is also invoked in the injunction to pay the zakat al-fitr, or the obligatory Ramadan alms. As spelled out in verse 9 :60 of the Qur&apos;an, zakat proceeds are to be distributed to eight classes of people, or asnaf, that includes the destitute and poor, as well as travellers in need. This is normally done at the end of Ramadan. Some Islamic theologians argue that these categories of zakat recipients should include non-Muslims. Embracing this interpretation is the UK-based international aid agency Islamic Relief, which dispenses zakat funds to non-Muslims in Africa. Back in the 1980s, Indonesian theologian and politician Amien Rais even went as far as to suggest a radical form of tiered zakat, which taxes Muslims according to the salaries they draw. Rais argues that proceeds from this zakat should be invested in ventures that benefit all, specifying education as a priority area. Such progressive interpretations signal that Muslims are to be charitable not just to the less fortunate, but also to the culturally other \u2013 an important nuance that the 8TV advertisements fail to capture. Sadly though, Malaysian Muslim elites are not alone in their insularity. Even in neighbouring Singapore where Muslims make up about 15% of the cosmopolitan population, the official stance is that non-Muslims could not receive the zakat proceeds, even if they &quot;fit into one of the asnaf&quot;. Even though 8TV&apos;s advertisements run counter to the Ramadan spirit of hospitality, it is tenuous to read this episode as further proof of Islam&apos;s intolerance. Rather, this is a textbook example of how the humanistic elements of a rich religious tradition have been drowned by the contextual concerns of its practitioners. More than spell out the exclusive nature of Islam, the advertisements are revelatory of the inability of Malaysia&apos;s ultra-Malay elites to overcome ethnic tensions with the minority Chinese. Ramadan or not, the advertisements suggest that their rose-tinted view of Malaysia is one coloured by race-tinted glasses."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/10/china-aircraft-carrier-launch", "sentences": ["Nevertheless, the vessel is a potent symbol of China&apos;s aspirations to become a global maritime power and is yet another indication that the military balance of power is gradually shifting in China&apos;s favour,&quot; said Dr Ian Storey, of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-10T14:16:00Z", "title": "China's first aircraft carrier launches with pride amid regional tensions", "tags": ["China", "India", "Taiwan", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "China&apos;s first aircraft carrier has embarked on sea trials, in a potent demonstration of the growing naval power that is creating pride at home \u2013 and concern elsewhere in the region. While China says it will only ever use naval power for defensive purposes, others say it is increasingly aggressive in pursuing its claims. Hours after the trials began, Taiwan pointedly unveiled its most advanced missile, hailing it as &quot;an aircraft carrier killer&quot;. The refitting of the former Soviet vessel is part of China&apos;s broader naval modernisation programme \u2013 which includes heavy spending on submarines and the development of an anti-ship missile system \u2013 and comes amid growing competition with the US and India, and a string of maritime disputes with closer neighbours. &quot;This is showing to the whole world that China&apos;s maritime mobility is expanding drastically. This is showing that China is in the process of acquiring capability to control the South China Sea as well as the East China Sea,&quot; Yoshihiko Yamada, a professor at Japan&apos;s Tokai University, told Reuters. In the past year China has had seen a series of territorial spats with Japan over islets in the East China Sea; and with the Philippines, Vietnam and others over the South China Sea, the location of essential shipping lanes and important natural resources including oil and gas. Those disputes are complicated by underlying competition with the US and India. &quot;By itself, the ship does not erode the credibility of America&apos;s military presence in the region nor greatly increase China&apos;s power projection capabilities. Nevertheless, the vessel is a potent symbol of China&apos;s aspirations to become a global maritime power and is yet another indication that the military balance of power is gradually shifting in China&apos;s favour,&quot; said Dr Ian Storey, of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. Last week, Japan&apos;s annual defence report said the Chinese navy were likely to increase activities around Japan and warned that China had acted &quot;in a way seen as coercive&quot; in conflicts. Beijing responded by accusing Tokyo of irresponsible exaggeration. The test is a small step in the long journey towards building a viable carrier group, but it is already stoking unease in India, and prompting fears of an arms race between Asia&apos;s two emerging powers. The Indian Ocean is fast becoming a zone of contested influence between Beijing and Delhi. Indian strategists have been particularly worried by a string of ports constructed with Chinese assistance in Burma, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. &quot;The carrier will add a new dimension to the burgeoning Chinese navy which could provide a major challenge to India in its backyard, the Indian Ocean,&quot; the Times of India commented on Wednesday. Despite a \u00a310bn modernisation programme, much of the Indian armed forces&apos; on equipment is outdated, and efforts to build or buy aircraft carriers have been hampered by political wrangling and red tape. The Indian navy has a small 50-year old 28,000-tonne carrier, which it bought from the UK in 1987, but it aims to have at least two aircraft carrier battle groups in operation by 2015. The ongoing refit of the 44,570-tonne Admiral Gorshkov, purchased from Russia in 2005, and the construction in India of a new 40,000-tonne carrier are expected to be completed in the coming three to four years.&quot;We are definitely looking at deploying two aircraft carriers by the middle of this decade,&apos;&apos; assistant chief of naval staff (foreign cooperation and intelligence) Rear Admiral Anil Chawla said earlier this year. Defence analyst Ajaj Shukla said that India retains the lead in naval aviation, but that there was a clear fear of &quot;the projection of Chinese power into the northern Indian Ocean in a new way&quot;. &quot;The Chinese are at an earlier stage but once they set their minds to operating a naval air arm they will catch up pretty fast so it is being carefully watched,&quot; he said. The People&apos;s Liberation Army Navy has also expanded its reach substantially in recent years \u2013 notably participating in international efforts to tackle Somalian pirates and more recently using a warship to support the evacuation of 35,000 Chinese citizens from Libya. &quot;[The trial&apos;s] symbolic significance outweighs its practical significance,&quot; Ni Lexiong, an expert on Chinese maritime policy at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said. &quot;We&apos;re already a maritime power, and so we need an appropriate force, whether that&apos;s aircraft carriers or battleships, just like the United States or the British empire did.&quot; China has spent almost a decade refitting the vessel, which was towed from the Ukraine in 1998 \u2013 without engines, weapons systems or other such equipment \u2013 although the defence ministry did not formally acknowledge the project until a month ago. The 300m-long vessel sounded its horn three times as it left its shipyard in Dalian, in north-east Liaoning province, amid thick fog, according to the state news agency. The trial is expected to last a few days and Xinhua said tests and refurbishment would continue when the ship returned. China has said it will use the carrier for research and training. It is believed to be building two carriers itself and experts think it wants up to four in all. In an interview published in the China Economic Weekly, Chinese navy Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo said that China planned to build a &quot;very strong battle group&quot; but warned it would be a long and difficult task. &quot;The construction and functional demands of an aircraft carrier are extremely complex,&quot; he said. Ashley Townshend at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney told Reuters that China would require three carriers for a viable strike group, as well as support ships and aircraft, and predicted it would take around a decade to develop. &quot;Many countries have, or are, investing in anti-ship missiles and attack submarines which make large, poorly defended warships such as the Varyag highly vulnerable,&quot; pointed out Storey. &quot;US military officers are very dismissive of the Varyag&apos;s operational capabilities, but are much more concerned about the development of China&apos;s own anti-ship ballistic missiles, which are designed to target US aircraft carriers.&quot; China&apos;s official military budget has more than doubled since 2006, from 298bn yuan to 601bn yuan this year, although it is still dwarfed by that of the US. Thailand, Brazil and India each have a carrier, while the US has eleven.

As ever, a good pitch doesn&apos;t mean a good product, and vice versa. There were presentations today that were slick and funny but failed to succinctly explain the product, while otherwise were softly spoken and modest but quietly impressive at the same time. These three sites, plus 17 others, are buried in intensive mentoring sessions all afternoon. Some, like Croatian Farmeron, were both. The team, most of whom have grown up with families involved in agriculture, have achieved the increasingly hard task of identifying an as-year undisrupted market with massive potential for what I hesitate to call a Web 2.0 interface - light, easy to use and consumer focused service. Farmeron provides an adaptable data management tool for farmers with a delightful, fun interface a world away form dull, agro-industry rivals - of which there are only two. Very impressive. Anything that tries to solve the burden of email is worth watching, and ReplyDone is trying to help by learning how you respond to common emails and intervene to automate those replies. Simple, and brilliant. It&apos;s starting life as a Gmail plug in but there&apos;s potential here, at least until email is usurped by something that was actually designed to handle our communications, rather than something that just ended up doing it. Italian site iubenda is a customisable, embeddable tool for the small print on your website. Great idea, bypassing costly lawyers. For most smaller websites, that will be a real benefit. Photo by c3o on Flickr. Some rights reserved Mini Seedcamp, London \u2022 CityMapper (London, UK) Travel tool. CityMapper combines buses, tubes, bikes, taxis and walking to suggest the best routes through the city. How is it different to otters apps on this space? By focusing on design and usability, claims co-founder Azmat Yusuf, a VC turned entrepreneur. With partner Mattias Linnap, who is studying at Cambridge for a PhD in location tracking, CityMapper claims to have a better routing algorithm than the competition, creating use cases around navigation. There&apos;s potential for building an ad network around movement in cities, using navigation is a platform. Expanding in the US would be boring; CityMapper wants to pursue growing markets in megacities like Istanbul and Jakarta. \u2022 ComodIT (Liege, Belgium) IT management tool. ComodIT co-founder Laurent Eschenauer believes IT should be comoditised, greatly simplifying management of corporate IT systems through a web user interface. &quot;The idea is to formalise, integrate and orchestrate your company&apos;s IT system,&quot; said Eschenauer, who says ComodIT has started direct sales and is targeting mid-sized firms. A software-as-a-service version is due out next year and ComodIT is hoping to stake out a chunk of the $14bn IT management market. \u2022 ContactUsPlus (London, UK) Customer service tool. Ever contacted an e-commerce website but had no response? ContactUsPlus estimates that 27% of consumers have had that experience and 45% have abandoned their shopping carts. In the context of a market that has lost \u00a312.8bn in sales, there&apos;s a big opportunity to help firms provide the customer support to complete those sales. ContactUsPlus provides a toolbar that can be added to the top of site, explained co-founder Adi Ben-Ari, inviting consumers to email, live chat or speak to a customer service rep. Response rates are shown to the customer, along with average response time. &quot;We think this adds a new dynamic, a game dynamic, to sites to make them more responsive,&quot; said Ben-Ari.  \u2022 Crowd (Paris, France) Photo-sharing service. &quot;Crowd is the closest thing to ubiquity until we sort out teleportation,&quot; begins Gabriel Hubert, with no shortage of gusto. Crowd lets users experience and share locations through real-time, geo-tagged photo sharing. There&apos;s potential for geo-targeted ads, and to bring in online newspapers who could offer a live feed from professional photographers at news events. Crowd currently has 80 beta testers. Strapline: The World. Live. Now. \u2022 CubeSocial (Basingstoke, UK) Professional relationship management for social networks. CubeSocial&apos;s pitch is about new ways for professionals to win new businesses, and they think the way to do that is through social media. CubeSocial filters the most relevant content from networks, filters out the noise, &quot;join the right conversations&quot; and form the right relationships. Financial services, lawyers, accountants, consultants - these professionals are the target group. There&apos;s a focus on Twitter and LinkedIn and co-founder Linda Cheung (former Morgan Stanley executive director) and Mark Bower (former lead program manager at Microsoft) think there&apos;s far more potential in social networks than pushing daily deals to Facebook fans. \u2022 EarningsCast (London, UK) Shareable, interactive media tool for earnings calls. Earnings calls are the most valuable interaction between investors and a business, but calls are not very accessible, recordable or personalisable. EarningsCast&apos;s attempt to solve this is a management system that lets investors organise a portfolio of earnings calls with private chartroom, integrated live commentary from social networks, and shareable and embeddable files. Co-founder Madhusudana Ramakrishna said the plan is to make money by running advertising around these calls with a freemium model, and the private beta has engaged 3,000 companies so far. Public beta starts next month. \u2022 EnergyBob (Munich, Germany) Smart heating meter. This is a smart domestic energy control system, adjusting your heating through The EnergyBob server which talks to Google&apos;s Latitude&apos;s API to determine when you&apos;re on your way home, and when the heating needs to come on. The price is \u20ac99 installation and then \u20ac9 per month. There are rivals, but a rich potential market of 300m European homes and partnerships with European telcos and utility firms. \u2022 Farmeron (Osijek, Croatia) Agricultural data management tool. The Croatian team behind Farmeron want to help farmers struggling with boring data management, putting a useable, simple interface on a business management tool. The team come from families with agricultural backgrounds but are trained programmers and have already raised \u20ac12,000 funding. In an industry where there are only two major competitors there&apos;s the opportunity to exploit a huge market worth $3.34bn a year in agriculture and food advertising alone. Farmeron will offer animal and grain management (down to a field that lets users assign names to each animal. Nice) and production planning and performance. The tea is planning to launch the site latter this month. \u2022 Fractal (London, UK) Email design tool. Fractal wants to make it easier to build and distribute email newsletters that work across multiple email clients. Co-founder Abs Farah said it&apos;s a massive problem that isn&apos;t addressed by current solutions, and is providing the service to marketing clients who can package Fractal as one benefit to their clients, as well as direct to designers. Fractal&apos;s beta version launched eight weeks ago and version two is due out in two weeks. Farah quoted LinkedIn Reid Hoffman: &quot;If you&apos;re embarrassed by your first version, you&apos;ve launched too late.&quot; &quot;And we&apos;re terribly embarrassed,&quot; said Farah. Fractal has finally settled for a cost of a $300 base fee, plus $100 per 1,000 API requests and a subscription model for regular users. \u2022 Gnergy (Sofia, Bulgaria) Energy efficiency service. &quot;Our vision is to enable people to make better energy efficiency decisions,&quot; said Gnergy co-founder Martin Gogov. Current solutions demand expensive smart meters or geeky engineering apps. Gnergy, however, asks questions to build a profile of your home and suggests steps for energy efficiency. There&apos;s a gameification element where customers are motivated to create the most efficient home possible. Gnergy is freemium: free for consumers, and paid for industry professionals. \u2022 iubenda (Bologna, Italy) Small print for websites. Any website in the world has a legal obligation to respect privacy, but most companies have the choice of either paying an expensive lawyer or copying and pasting privacy terms from another site that might not be relevant. iubenda offers a customisable, easy to embed tool to frame legal T&amp;Cs for websites, and charges a small subscription fee. &quot;We make lots of money!&quot; co-founder Andrea Giannangelo gleefully exclaims. Six weeks since launch iubenda has already delivered to thousands of sites. And the goal: Conquer the footer of every website in the world. \u2022 Myows (Singapore) Copyright management. Both founders Max Guedy and Chris Human have experienced their deisgn work and photography being reappropriated, but found it expensive and time-consuming to resolve infringement the traditional way. Myows - my original works - lets users store their copyrighted material (photos, artwork, music, videos) in one place, prove ownership of those, organise contracts that prove ownerships, manage rights and pursue infringements. In beta test until now, Myows is already storing 18,000 registered works and has solved 72 infringement cases. \u2022 OpenSignalMaps (London, UK) Real-world maps of mobile signal coverage. Coverage is unpredictable yet vital for mobile users, but coverage maps from operators are useless. OpenSignalMaps is crowd-sourcing coverage information instead - in real time, and for free, explains co-founder Sina Khanifar. OpenSignalMaps&apos;s Android app has had 800,000 downloads, and the site 40,000 site visitors per month so far. But the team of four Oxford physics graduates wants to do more with this data. For B2B, data could be sold back to the networks, who typically outsource this kind of data research. iPhone and Blackberry apps are coming soon. \u2022 ReplyDone (Vienna, Austria) Email efficiency tool. Ben Freundorfer thinks replying to emails is a waste of time, because humans are good at creating new content, and computers are good at finding old text. So ReplyDone intelligently suggests your reply. Starting as a Gmail extension, ReplyDone will learn how you reply to common emails and suggest replies. The long-term vision is more ambitious, and doesn&apos;t represent current email systems at all but is an intelligent, auto-responding email client of the future. Amen to that. \u2022 RolePoint (London, UK) Employee referral platform that uses social networks. HR managers can encourage staff to refer candidates they know, including the 85% of workers who are &apos;passive candidates&apos;- the ones who don&apos;t know they are secretly open to new job offers . Co-founder Chris Le Breton said RolePoint will charge set fees to its target medium-large consultancies depending on organisation size. The target is initially the US. Talent, the strapline goes, knows talent. \u2022 Sntmnt (Amsterdam, Netherlands) Market information service. Dutch startup Sntmnt helps pick stock to invest in by picking through market and online activity around companies and trends. Machine learning and predictive analysis tools are used to give a prediction of the &quot;bullishness&quot; of a particular market, accurate to 61% so far for the next 7 days. The Sntmnt team has been working on this for three months, but co-founder Vincent van Leeuwen says there&apos;s huge potential in a market where many of the rivals are academics who have tried unconvincingly to commercialise research tools. \u2022 StorkUp (Troon, UK) Shopping tool for parents. Shopping for baby products for first-time mums is expensive, time-consuming and expensive. StorkUp lets new mums create shopping lists and recommendations for other new mums, with personalised responses, price comparison and then allows them to buy online. Beyond birth, StorkUp wants to create lists for birthdays, school and beyond. The market is huge, with 4 million babies born in the US every year alone and an average $9,000 spend in the first 12 months. Big parenting sites like Mumsnet and BabyCenter aren&apos;t product focused and price comparison sites aren&apos;t focused on specific communities. \u2022 TransferWise (London, UK) Money transfer service. Taavet Hinrikus was the first employee at Skype, but his latest project is a money transfer solution that avoids expensive currency exchange fees. He said he knows of a North American bank that makes $100m profits per year from currency exchange alone. TransferWise is a P2P currency exchange; users say how much they want to send and to whom, transfer the money to a UK holding account, and TransferWise transfers the equivalent amount - based on market rates - to your friend for a flat fee of \u00a31. Most clients are ex-pats, foreign students - and there&apos;s one guy who uses the service to send his alimony payments. This time next year, TransferWise wants to be enabling \u00a3300m in transfers and will be adding support for US dollars and Swiss francs. \u2022 Travelstormer (London, UK) Travel organisation tool. There&apos;s an ugly truth about organising travel for your friends - it&apos;s a big burden, and they are often ungrateful, say founders Colin Armstrong and George Coltart. Travelstormer wants to make the process much smoother, helping organise the research, discussion, purchase of tickets, itinerary building and departure for travel groups of more than three. It&apos;s a very Facebook-like interface with maps for locations of hotels, voting tools to help decide on options and booking incentives that show deals available for various options. A nice touch is that the organiser gets a small commission if the group decides on the option he or she suggested - gameifying the decision making process. There&apos;s a lot of noise in the travel sector but the biggest competitor is email where most research and decision takes place. \u2022 UntapTV (London, UK) Mobile ad tool for TV. Why isn&apos;t TV more engaging? When we don&apos;t like ads, we find something to do for a few minutes. UntapTV wants to make ads more engaging by giving users incentives to keep watching the TV ads and interact more using their mobile, whether by entreating a competition, playing a game or giving feedback. It&apos;s fast, scalable and brand-specific, says co-founder Tee Vachiramon. Brands can customise the ad experience by using the app, tap social networks and build relationships with consumers. UptapTV has an iPhone app in alpha, is in discussion with various brands over trials and plans to make money through fixed fees or pay per interaction. \u2022 Read: Seedcamp&apos;s Saul Klein on four years of tapping startup trends"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/12/an-a-to-z-of-offal", "sentences": ["A type of head that people do not often think of is fish head, a great delicacy in Singapore prepared in a curry sauce."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-12T09:00:00Z", "title": "An A to Z of offal", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "Blood &quot;This is a dish (blood soup) that 6-8 years old girls make themselves but which young boys also prize highly. When it is ready, some of the soup is poured into a flat dish and the boys lie on their stomachs round this and eat like dogs, while the small girls\u00a0eat with their hands from the pot.&quot;\u2022 Sverdrup on the children of Reindeer Chukchi, 1901 The mention of blood as food immediately conjures up images of blood-sucking vampires biting into the necks of nubile virgins. However, you don&apos;t need to\u00a0be a vampire, real or imagined, to like animal blood.\u00a0 Most cultures eat blood in one form or another and blood puddings (boudin) are made all over Europe. The filling for boudin is basically pig&apos;s blood and fat, although the Irish use sheep&apos;s blood for drisheen\u00a0(their version of boudin). In France, they may add onions, chestnuts or small cubes of cooked head meats. In Spain they add rice and in Scotland oats. Whatever the mixture, it is seasoned with spices and herbs, funnelled into intestines and cooked very gently in a broth. In Iceland, where the women make a lot of blood sausages during the slaughtering season in the autumn, the sausages are pickled in whey-barrels.\u00a0 Boudin is not the only edible blood product. In Spain, congealed blood is sold in blocks for people to use\u00a0in different ways. The most common use is for it to\u00a0be diced and saut\u00e9ed with onions to serve as a tapa (encebollada in sangre). In Thailand, people add cubes of congealed blood to fish tripe soup. In France, they have Sanguette, a speciality from the Languedoc which was very common when chickens were killed at home. It is still prepared in some rural areas. The chicken is bled over a deep plate. Then the blood is seasoned with crushed garlic, chopped parsley and sometimes saut\u00e9ed cubes of lean bacon and left to congeal before being fried in a little lard. The pan is deglazed with a little vinegar and the resulting sauce poured over the sanguette.\u00a0 A very different version of sanguette is made in the B\u00e9arn. The B\u00e9arnais prepare theirs with the boiled cheeks, tripe and spleen of calf. These are diced and saut\u00e9ed with cubes of congealed calf blood. When the meats have coloured, chopped onion, garlic and parsley are added. A little flour is sprinkled all over, some stock added and the whole dish is simmered for about half an hour. Towards the end of the cooking, sliced cornichons and capers are added. The blood of hare, rabbit or chicken is also used to thicken sauces in civet dishes and others. Brazilian chicken in blood &apos;frango ao molho pardo&apos; is similar\u00a0to a chicken dish from the Nivernais called poulet en barboille, where the chicken is first cooked in red wine with bacon, baby onions and lots of garlic. When cooked, the sauce is thickened with the blood that was reserved for that purpose. In Italy, pig&apos;s blood is used in a sweet preparation, sanguinaccio, which is found with some variations in Calabria (al cioccolato, when it is cooked with milk, sugar, cocoa powder, almonds and cinnamon, or con il riso, when it is prepared with rice, sugar, raisins, cinnamon and lemon zest). Sanguinaccio is also found in Campania (alla napoletana, where the blood is cooked with milk, chocolate, sugar and candied fruit). A version also exists in Sicily where it seems to have its roots in Arab cooking as I found the recipe in a book called La Cucina Siciliana di Derivazione Araba.\u00a0The French also have a sweet boudin, from the Nord Pas-de-Calais region, boudin \u00e0 la flamande which dates back to the late 18th century. The blood is seasoned with onions, salt, ginger, cloves, pepper, sugar and cinnamon, then finally raisins are added. The Norwegians also use blood to make savoury cakes while the Japanese dry the blood of rattlesnakes to sell as an aphrodisiac.\u00a0 Brains &quot;Have I lived to be carried in a basket like a barrow\u00a0of butcher&apos;s Offal, and to be thrown in the Thames? Well, if I be served Such another trick, I&apos;ll have my brains ta&apos;en out and buttered.&quot;\u2022 Shakespeare, The Merry Wives of Windsor III.v.4-6 Brains are probably the most delicate and finest of all offal, perhaps not so much for their taste as for their soft, creamy texture. Some people think that calf&apos;s brains are superior to lamb&apos;s but I find both just as good. Brains are very fragile and you need to take great care while preparing them. They need to be soaked, for about half an hour in several changes of cold water to rid them of any excess blood, then the thin outer skin is peeled \u2013 no easy task, though dipping the brains in water every now and then helps loosen it. They are then poached in a court bouillon for about 3 minutes to firm them up before using in one of several different ways, the simplest being dipped in seasoned flour and shallow-fried in butter.\u00a0 Caul     Caul fat. Photograph: Mike Cooper/Absolute Press    &quot;The fold of membrane loaded with fat, which covers more or less of the intestines in mammals; the great omentum.&quot; Caul as defined by Webster&apos;s dictionary, a perfect description for a membrane that is often used to enclose fillings, meats, brochettes or different terrines. The purpose of using caul is dual, as an envelope but also, for its fat content, to help keep whatever is wrapped in it moist. You can buy caul fresh or salted. I prefer to use it fresh but if you can only find it salted, soak it for 10 minutes before using. Cocks&apos; combs The best-known use for cocks&apos; combs is in the\u00a0classic financi\u00e8re sauce, the garnish for the classic\u00a0vol-au-vent. I have never seen them sold in England but there is no reason why you cannot order them from an adventurous or knowledgeable butcher.\u00a0The preparation is rather fiddly. They need soaking, blanching, then whitening, ie cooking in a mixture of water, flour, lemon and salt for about 10 minutes to stop them from blackening. Then they need scraping with a small knife to get rid of the rough exterior.  Once this is done, they are rinsed and rubbed with\u00a0a little salt to get rid of the last rough bits. Cocks&apos; combs are very rarely used nowadays and when they are, it is more for their gelatinous texture and shape than for their taste. The Russians also use cocks&apos; combs to make a terrine where the diced combs are\u00a0set in an aspic made with chicken stock, wine and lemon juice.\u00a0 Ears     A pig's ear. Photograph: Mike Cooper/Absolute Press    Most people balk at the idea of eating ears but I love the contrast between the crunchy cartilage and the gelatinous skin. The preparation is rather tiresome and some of it will bring you dangerously close to feeling that you are dealing with a human ear, ie removing hair, scraping the wax, etc. As a result,\u00a0I prefer to eat them in a restaurant or at friends&apos; houses, but here is what you need to do if you want\u00a0to prepare them yourself. First make sure your butcher cleans them really well before he gives them to you. Even then, you still need to scrape them, singe them, wash, blanch and wash them again to get rid of any scum. After this they are ready to be boiled, for about\u00a02-3 hours with or without the rest of the head, and served as is with a sauce ravigote or gribiche, or breadcrumbed and fried in very hot oil. Eyes &quot;For dessert there was simply a handful of bird\u00a0and fish eyes picked out of the pot&quot;\u00a0\u2022 Vibe, 1938 Eyes are probably the biggest taboo when talking about offal. Even Fergus Henderson at St John&apos;s\u00a0has not served them yet. And, of course, there is the eternal clich\u00e9 about Arabs and their predilection for sheep&apos;s eyes. Well, apparently it is not only them who are keen on the delicacy. The Russians view them as an aphrodisiac. This unsubstantiated piece of information was passed on to me by Mr. Gu\u00e9rin who was one of my offal butchers in Paris when I tested recipes there. He also said that they eat them stuffed (imagine the number of heads you need to produce\u00a0a plateful of stuffed eyes).  Well, perhaps they do and perhaps they don&apos;t but I have never tried them nor even seen them. However, I have often eaten sheep&apos;s eyes, whenever we had sheep&apos;s head, and yes, I did from when I was very young. They have a nice chewy texture without being tough, a little like that of squid but without the slipperiness. The secret is to remove the inky, black middle bit without bursting it before you bite into the gelatinous eye socket. I have also eaten fish eyes which are equally delicious but not those of whales, which the Japanese consider choice morsels. The Eskimos eat seal eyes and here is what H\u00f8ygaard wrote in 1941 of the Angmagssalik Eskimos: &quot;The central nervous system and the eyes are considered very good and usually fall to the lot of the hunter who has caught the animal.&quot; Feet     Trotters. Photograph: Mike Cooper/Absolute Press    Feet are rich in gelatine and calf&apos;s feet are those normally used to thicken broth and give it body while pig&apos;s and lamb&apos;s are served in many different ways:\u00a0in salads and sauces, or breadcrumbed and grilled\u00a0or also in the case of pig&apos;s trotters, used as a casing\u00a0to make stuffed feet.\u00a0 One of the most famous French recipes for pig&apos;s feet is pieds de porc \u00e0 la Ste Menehould. The feet are tightly wrapped in cheesecloth, to keep their shape, and cooked for at least 24 hours, and sometimes up to 40 hours, in a strongly flavoured broth until the bones are so tender that you can eat the whole thing. It is said that they were the undoing of Louis XIV who stopped in Ste Menehould on the road to Varennes to feast on one of his favourite dishes. The delay allowed the revolutionaries to catch up with the royal family and arrest them.\u00a0 I was not able to find a proper recipe for pieds de porcs \u00e0 la Ste Menehould. All the good ones are jealously guarded by those who make them. The best thing I can do is to recommend trying them at Le Pied Rare,\u00a0a simple caf\u00e9 / restaurant in Paris, in the Bastille.\u00a0The owners were given the recipe by the inn-keeper they worked for in Ste Menehould and they regularly win prizes for their pieds de porc. You can also try them at the Soleil d&apos;Or in Ste Menehould. They are quite unlike any other pig&apos;s trotters you will have ever tasted. Another unusual way of preparing feet comes from Morocco, where they cook calf&apos;s feet in a sweet-spicy honey sauce. The result is astonishing and totally exquisite.\u00a0 The Italians are also very keen on trotters and one\u00a0of their best-known exports apart from pasta and Parmigiano is zampone, a kind of pig&apos;s feet sausage where the feet are boned and stuffed with ground\u00a0pork meat and rind. Zampone, as well as cotechino\u00a0(a sausage with the same filling but encased in pork skin) are traditionally served on New Year&apos;s Eve, with salsa verde and lentils. Both zampone and cotechino need long simmering, 3-4 hours, and have to be wrapped in cheesecloth to prevent them splitting and losing their shape during cooking.\u00a0 Giblets &quot; ... the burnished gold of the crusts, the fragrance \u00a0exuded by the sugar and cinnamon, were but preludes to the delights \u00a0released \u00a0from the inside \u00a0of the pie when the knife broke the crust. First came a soice-laden haze, then chicken livers,\u00a0hard-boiled eggs, sliced ham, chicken and truffles in masses of piping hot, glistening macaroni, to which the meat juice gave an exquisite hue of suede.&quot;\u2022 The Leopard, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa Giblets include neck, liver, gizzard and heart in England but in France where they are known as\u00a0abattis, they also include the head, feet and wings. The livers are saut\u00e9ed, grilled or made into p\u00e2t\u00e9s, the gizzards grilled or confit (cooked in fat) and the wings marinated and grilled. The head, neck and feet are used to impart flavour to sauces and stocks although they are perfectly edible and quite delicious.\u00a0 The Chinese are very keen on chicken, goose or duck feet and prepare them in myriad ways. Another edible part from inside the chicken that few people know about is unhatched eggs. These can be left inside the chicken to cook, sometimes forming an attractive necklace around the stuffing, or they can be carefully taken out and fried.\u00a0 Alycot is a famous old-fashioned French stew made from giblets. The word is made up of three different ones: ale (aile/wing), y (et/and) cot (cou/neck).\u00a0 &quot;The days of gatch\u00e9re, of ch\u00e8re-lie, when we sacrificed many subjects (geese, ducks, turkeys) we make, with the giblets, the gizzards and necks, an excellent starter that we call alicot.&quot; (from Simin Palay, The Cuisine of the B\u00e9arn).

Top and lashers going out.\u00a0Don&apos;t maul them pieces, young one.&quot;\u2022 James Joyce, Ulysses Only lamb&apos;s heads are cooked and served on the bone. They are boiled, steamed, roasted or even smoked as they do them in Norway (smalahove). Calf&apos;s and pig&apos;s heads are boned and the meat (snout, ears, tongue and sometimes cheeks) is either cut up and sold separately or rolled like a roast and boiled to serve with a sauce ravigote or gribiche. Another way of preparing head meat is en fromage (head cheese or brawn) where the meats are cooked until tender, diced and left to set\u00a0in their liquor. Of course, there are other ways of preparing head like in the following, extremely complicated recipe from Plumerey, published in his 1843 book l&apos;Art de la Cuisine au XIX siecle, where he explains how to prepare t\u00eate d&apos;agneau \u00e0 la Pascaline: &quot;Take four sheep&apos;s heads; they should be perfectly skinned; bone them, and put them to soak, as well\u00a0as the four brains and four tongues; take three lamb&apos;s livers that you will saut\u00e9 with half the amount of fresh lard, fine herbs, salt, pepper and spices to make a stuffing, and twelve sheep&apos;s trotters that you will cook with the tongues; you will also cook the brains, but separately; when the tongues and brains are done, you will cut them in large cubes and, with mushrooms, you will make twelve croquettes; now take the blanched sheep&apos;s heads and fill them with the stuffing; tie them tightly; cover them with a few slices of lemon; cover them with pork fat and cook in a good casserole; have ready about twelve studded lamb&apos;s sweeetbreads; reserve the trimmings; have a sauce tourn\u00e9e in which you will have put two handfuls of mushrooms; you will reduce the sauce and thicken it with six egg yolks; then you will strain the four sheep&apos;s heads; untie them; arrange on a large round plate, the nose part on the outside; cut each trotter in two, put three in between each head; cover with the sauce, and arrange the twelve fried croquettes all around, the twelve sweetbreads piques and twelve bread crusts cut in the shape of crests; throw the mushrooms and sweetbread trimmings in the sauce and over the heads.&quot; Not a recipe you are going to rush to make but it gives you a good idea of how elaborately offal was prepared in those days.\u00a0 A type of head that people do not often think of is fish head, a great delicacy in Singapore prepared in a curry sauce. The Asians are not the only ones to appreciate fish heads. The Scots were also very fond\u00a0of them. I have found several recipes for dressed cod&apos;s and haddock heads filled with fish liver in The Scots&apos; Kitchen by F. Marian McNeill. Here is a rather intriguing one for Crappit Heids, as stuffed heads are called, from the Isle of Lewis: &quot;Take half a dozen haddock heads and livers. Chop the livers, which must be perfectly fresh, mix them with an equal quantity of raw oatmeal, add pepper and salt, and bind with milk. Stuff the heads with\u00a0this mixture, and boil them with the fish. The liquor makes good stock for fish soup. A similar stuffing is made with cods&apos; livers, but the body, not the head,\u00a0is stuffed, through the gullet.&quot; Hearts It is sad that nowadays most English, or American people for that matter, consider hearts to be dog or cat food. They may not be the finest offal but they can be used in delicious preparations and have the added advantage of being very cheap. They can be stewed, stuffed and braised or grilled.\u00a0 Intestines &quot;Fish intestines are cut up, cleaned, washed, boiled and eaten; boiled by themselves in water, not to be mixed with other (other parts of) fish or else with the head if the rest of the fish is dried; these intestines, fat, are the Lapps&apos; delicacy ... &quot;\u2022 Drake, 1918 One of the most famous uses for intestines is in andouillettes, a fat French sausage made with pig&apos;s intestines that are either grilled or shallow fried and served with mustard. Andouille sounds similar but is quite different. It is made with intestines but in a very large sausage and is smoked for two months, hence the black skin. It is then tied, cooked in water or broth and dried. It is generally eaten cold, thinly sliced, but it can also be served hot after having been simmered in broth.\u00a0 In Italy, intestines from milk-fed calf or lamb are used to make pajata, a Roman speciality, or brochettes.\u00a0In Sicily the brochettes are grilled and sold on the streets \u2013 stigghiole is what you need to ask for if\u00a0you want to try them. Similar versions of intestines brochettes exist with slight variations in Sardinia and Umbria. The South Americans have their own version which they call chinchulines while the Turks and Greeks wrap skewered lamb&apos;s lights with intestines and grill them to produce kokore\u00e7 or kokoretsi.  The Lebanese fill intestines with rice, meat and chickpeas to cook alongside stuffed tripe and the Chinese cut them up to cook in a sauce and serve for dim sum. The English, Irish and Americans have their own chitterlings or chitlins, fried or grilled intestines, while the Eskimos eat fish intestines. These were also common food, in northern Sweden where the intestines of sea trout were boiled and considered to be full of goodness. And, of course, pig&apos;s or ox intestines are also used\u00a0as casings for all kinds of sausages.\u00a0 Kidneys &quot;Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs\u00a0of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liver slices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods&apos; roes. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.&quot;James Joyce, Ulysses The finest kidneys are those from calves although both lamb&apos;s and pig&apos;s kidneys are also very good.\u00a0The latter need soaking to rid them of the strong smell and taste. You can buy kidneys with or without their protective fat. I generally ask my butcher to remove the fat and the core. Whale kidneys are also eaten straight after the catch, boiled in salted water. Liver &quot;I am weary of whales. I have eaten whale boiled, fried and minced; the liver, heart, brains, and kidneys of young whale, and best of all, head fin boiled, cut in thin slices when cold, and eaten with thin slices of dry bread. It has a firm white substance and a pleasant nutty flavour.&quot;Elizabeth Taylor, 1890&apos;s The smooth, buttery texture of liver, be it that of calf, duck, goose, monkfish or cod to name but a few is one of the ultimate delicacies. The finest of red livers is undoubtedly that of calf, although both lamb&apos;s and pig&apos;s are also excellent. Chicken livers are in a league of their own, softer in texture and totally delicious provided that, first, they come from an organic bird and, second, that they are not overcooked. In fact, except for pig&apos;s, no liver should be cooked beyond pink, otherwise the texture changes from melting to rubbery. Liver can also be smoked. In the Tarn, they marinate pig&apos;s liver in a highly seasoned marinade before tying it like a r\u00f4ti and smoking it. The liver is thinly sliced, saut\u00e9ed in oil and the pan deglazed with a little vinegar to provide a sauce. In Alsace, people mix chopped calf&apos;s liver with chopped onion, parsley and a little fine semolina to make big quenelles.\u00a0The quenelles are poached in a white consomm\u00e9 and served with a beurre noisette. The best-known of white livers is foie gras, either duck&apos;s or goose. I prefer duck&apos;s foie gras. The liver is smaller and somewhat less fatty. The Japanese have their own &quot;foie gras&quot;, that of monkfish (ankimo) although, technically, it is not really foie gras as the fish is not fattened artificially and the texture is closer to that of roe than liver. Ankimo is generally steamed and served cold with ponzu (the juice of citric fruit) and chopped spring onions. I found monkfish liver in the fish markets in Spain. You can buy it separately or attached to the head. I tried it a la plancha on the advice of the fishmonger and steamed \u00e0 la japonaise. The latter was definitely the better way to prepare it.\u00a0I also found canned cod&apos;s liver in Spain which was melting and delicious, and I assume healthy as it was preserved in its own oil. Lungs Lungs are mainly used in sausage making. They are my least favourite offal. They have a spongy texture and are very red when raw but turn a rather off-putting grey colour as soon as they start cooking.\u00a0The Larousse Gastronomique recommends beating\u00a0the mou (lungs in French) to tenderise them. \u00a0 Marrow There are two kinds of marrow, bone marrow, from the shin of beef or calf and spinal marrow which is part of the nervous system and has a charming name in French: amourettes (little loves, a name that is also used for testicles). Bone marrow can be used in several different ways. It can be extracted and poached to serve on toast or on steak; or the bones can be roasted, a signature dish of Fergus Henderson at\u00a0St John&apos;s restaurant in London.\u00a0 The traditional way to make risotto in Italy is by using bone marrow instead of, or together with butter or oil. Bone marrow is in fact pure fat and will melt if left long enough on the heat. Spinal marrow is quite different, more like brain than marrow from the shin bone; and it doesn&apos;t melt when cooked for too long. Instead it hardens and turns rubbery. Before BSE, lamb&apos;s spinal marrow was a mainstay of the mezze menu in Lebanese restaurants. It was poached and dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. Both texture and taste are delicate but, because of BSE, you cannot get hold of it here any longer.\u00a0 Palates Palates were very popular in the past. There are several recipes for them, in the Larousse Gastronomique, in Hannah Glasse and in many other old cookbooks. They are no longer used today but if you were to find them, this is how to prepare them. Soak them first then boil until tender in a water and flour mixture so that they remain white. Once they are cooked, peel and serve with a sauce ravigote or gribiche. Sometimes you do get a piece of palate with t\u00eate de veau in French restaurants. More often than not, it is not peeled and has a most unpleasant gritty feel, a little like the skin of tongues.\u00a0 Spleen &quot;But I am pigeon-livered, and lack gallTo make oppression bitter, or ere thisI should have fatted all the region kitesWith this slave&apos;s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! ...For murder, though it have no tongue, will speakWith most miraculous organ.&quot;\u2022 Shakespeare, Hamlet II.ii.554-558, 570-571 Spleen is not used widely except possibly in sausage making. However, there are countries where it is appreciated. The Sicilians have a spleen sandwich, pani cu i meuza or put more simply milza, which is sold on the street. The sliced spleen and other bits of offal like lungs, etc. are fried in animal fat in large metal pans and stuffed into buns with ricotta cheese.\u00a0 I can&apos;t say it is one of the most appetising sandwiches I have ever had but many Sicilians are very keen on them. This is not to say that I don&apos;t like spleen. In fact, one of my all-time favourite dishes is t&apos;hal (a Lebanese spleen dish) where the spleen is stuffed with garlic\u00a0and coriander and braised in vinegar. Gorgeous. Sweetbreads There are two types of calf&apos;s sweetbreads, the gangly ones that come from the throat and the round, nicely shaped ones, called pomme de ris in French, that come from around the heart. The neck sweetbread is the thymus gland, and the heart or belly sweetbread is the pancreas. The thymus gland shrinks in size after puberty, but does not disappear. Calf&apos;s sweetbreads are finer than those from sheep. Depending on how bloody they are when you buy them, you may need to soak them first, until they become white. Then poach and press down (only calf&apos;s) to flatten them. After this they are ready to be prepared in all kinds of different ways, simply dipped in flour and fried, braised, grilled, baked, cooked in pastry, etc. Sometimes calf&apos;s sweetbreads are spiked with cubes of fat, truffles, tongue or ham.\u00a0 Tail There are two kinds of tails, the bony ones from the ox and pig that have rich meat on them or the fatty ones from the fat-tail sheep that have no bone and are highly valued in the Arab world. Oxtails and pig&apos;s tails are cooked in stews, while the fat from the fat-tail sheep is eaten raw, diced very small, with raw liver or used in cooking instead of butter or ghee to impart a rich, special flavour to stews and other dishes. Oxtail and pig&apos;s tails need long, slow cooking until the rich, juicy meat falls off the bone.\u00a0 Testicles (Fries) Testicles are a part of the fifth quarter that most people reject outright, simply because of what they are. If they only knew how delicious the taste is and what a delicate, melting texture testicles have, they wouldn&apos;t be so hasty in their rejection. Testicles need to be peeled before cooking but the butcher will generally do that for you. There is no need for any special preparation and by far the best way to cook them is\u00a0to dip them in seasoned flour and gently fry them in butter until golden, adding a squeeze of lemon juice just before they are ready. It is very important not to overcook them as they will lose their velvety texture and become hard and rubbery. In France, testicles are poached before frying but\u00a0I don&apos;t think this is necessary. In Iceland, ram&apos;s testicles are preserved in sour whey, while in Japan, whale testicles are boiled and served with a vinegar sauce. I prefer lamb&apos;s testicles to those of bull but there isn&apos;t that much in it except for the size. I haven&apos;t tried cock&apos;s or capon&apos;s testicles, known as rognons blancs (white kidneys) in France, but they are also highly prized.\u00a0 Because of the sexual connotation, testicles are almost always referred to by a different name except in the Arab world where they are simply called balls of sheep. The Italians call them gioielli (jewels) or animelle, while the French alternate between les joyeuses (the happy ones, in the feminine, and I guess one can understand why), animelles or amourettes (darling ones or little loves, confirming the opinion that the French know how to live). Amourettes is also the name given to spinal marrow. The Americans, puritanical as ever, refer to them as prairie or mountain oysters, also as Montana tendergroins, cowboy caviar, swinging beef, and calf fries (the latter two showing a less puritanical streak). Calf&apos;s testicles are reputed to be a favourite of former US president George W Bush, and were apparently a staple on the menu when he was governor in Texas.\u00a0 Tongues Tongues, ox or calf&apos;s, are sold either fresh or cured. Lamb&apos;s tongues are only used fresh as are ducks&apos; and goose, the latter two being great favourites of the Chinese. If used fresh, ox, calf&apos;s and lamb&apos;s tongues need to be soaked then boiled to rid them of the\u00a0blood and then peeled. Ducks&apos; tongues have a funny little bone inside them and those of geese need\u00a0some preparation before they are ready for use.\u00a0Whale tongues were also appreciated. There are several references to whale tongues being eaten in the middle ages, amongst them an account by the French surgeon, Ambroise Par\u00e9 (1517-90), describing a whaling expedition off the Atlantic coast of France.\u00a0Two bundles of whale tongues were then presented to King Charles IX and his mother Catherine de Medici \u2013 Par\u00e9 describes the tongue as tender and delicious. Tripe &quot;Till cramm&apos;d and gorg&apos;d, nigh burst With suckt and glutted offal.&quot;\u00a0\u2022 Milton, Paradise Lost X. 633 Ox tripe has four distinct sections, the four stomachs: honeycomb (bonnet in French), reed tripe (caillette), bible tripe (feuillet) and thick seam (panse). Honeycomb and thick seam are usually sold pre-cooked, often bleached. It&apos;s best to avoid bleached tripe as much of the flavour and texture will have disappeared in the process. Reed and bible tripe are hardly ever pre-cooked and need thorough cleaning before cooking. In fact, all tripe unless pre-cooked needs lengthy washing before use. The four types are needed for making tripes \u00e0 la mode de Caen, one of the most famous French tripe dishes, otherwise honeycomb or thick seam will do. Another famous French tripe dish is the tablier de sapeur, a speciality from Lyon, where large squares of cooked thick seam tripe are marinated in white wine, lemon juice and mustard, then dipped in egg and breadcrumbs and fried. Pig&apos;s and lamb&apos;s stomachs are obviously much smaller than calf&apos;s or ox and do not have the reed or bible section. The tripe itself is a lot thinner and more suitable for filling. William the conqueror loved tripe cooked in the juice of Neustrie apples and Rabelais&apos; Gargantua was conceived after his mother, Gargamelle, had eaten a large plate of gaudebillaux, the tripe of coireaux beef (fattened from when they were born on their mothers&apos; milk or in fields where the grass grew twice a year).\u00a0 Another kind of tripe that many people are unaware of is fish tripe. Salted cod&apos;s tripe is a great delicacy in Barcelona while other dried fish tripe is used in Thailand and in China to make soup.\u00a0 Udder &quot;Boil sow&apos;s udders and cut into pieces. Add some pike meat which has previously been ground in\u00a0a mortar, minced chicken, raw eggs and oil.\u00a0Mix together and season with pepper. Moisten with garum and wine and add a few raisins. Cook in an earthenware pot and once done, transfer the stuffing to which you will have added becfigues (a little bird found in abundance in the south of France, also known as b\u00e9guinette), peppercorns and pine nuts to another pot that has already been lined with pastry. Cover the filling with a layer of pastry and bake in the oven.&quot;\u2022 Apicius There are two places I know of where you can try udder. One is Jame&apos; el Fna in Marrakesh, the world-famous square with its ambulant cook-stalls, set up every evening as the sun sets. The cooks are grouped by speciality with an offal corner where the vendors sell boiled sheep&apos;s heads and other offal including udder. The other place is a caf\u00e9 / restaurant in Madrid that specialises in frying offal off-cuts, if there is such a thing. There I had a mixed fry-up of the glands that line the intestines (moist and tasty), udder (dry and bland), spleen (so-so) and even trachial tubes (pleasantly crunchy). The fat in the huge frying pans was rendered from the lining of the stomach, intestines, heart and other bits. This all-out offal meal has been my most extreme offal experience to date.\u00a0 I would not go so far as to say that it was exquisite but it was certainly memorable, both for me and for my Spanish friend, Alicia Rios, a wonderful food performance artist who found the place for me and took me there. We are both intrepid eaters but after the meal, we knew we would not be rushing back\u00a0to that place. The Madrilenos, on the other hand, seemed to be sold on it. The place was heaving when we ate there. \u2022 This is an extract from Offal: the fifth quarter by Anissa Helou with photographs by Mike Cooper (Absolute Press, \u00a325).

The coalition government announced in December that schools would be measured according to how many pupils achieved at least a C at GCSE in English, maths, two sciences, history or geography and a modern or ancient language. Musicians are furious that the new measurement \u2013 known as the English Baccalaureate (Ebacc) \u2013 excludes music and other creative subjects, such as art and drama. The Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM) and Music Teacher magazine said they had already noticed that fewer pupils were taking music as a result. The two organisations are calling on the public to write to MPs expressing their &quot;deep concern&quot; at the omission of music and other creative subjects from the Ebacc. Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the ISM, said that by forgetting music, ministers had forgotten the &quot;creative, social, academic, economic, emotional and intellectual benefits of an excellent music education&quot;. Christopher Walters, editor of Music Teacher magazine said the Ebacc would &quot;inevitably have negative consequences for any subjects that are excluded from it&quot;. Ministers decided on the measurement partly out of concern that schools in low-income neighbourhoods were not encouraging their pupils to take traditional subjects, thus preventing them from obtaining places at top universities. In May, schools minister Nick Gibb told MPs that the Ebacc was a &quot;key component&quot; in the &quot;overall objective of closing the attainment gap between wealthier and poorer children&quot; But last month, MPs on the cross-party Commons education select committee said the Ebacc had major flaws and warned there was no evidence that it improves the prospects of disadvantaged pupils. &quot;The committee fully supports the government&apos;s stated intention to improve the attainment of the poorest young people,&quot; the MPs argued. &quot;However, the evidence is unclear as to whether entering more disadvantaged students for Ebacc subjects would necessarily make a significant contribution to this aim.&quot; Japan and Singapore, whose education systems are lauded, have models that are similar to the Ebacc. But so does Germany, and its education system performs below the OECD average on some indicators, the MPs stated. The report added: &quot;The evidence which we received does not suggest a link \u2026 between the prescribed study of certain academic subjects and improved attainment and prospects for poorer students.&quot; A spokesman from the Department for Education said the Ebacc existed so that &quot;every single child gets a chance to study the core academic subjects which top universities demand&quot;. &quot;But the Ebacc is not the be all and end all ... and should not be the limit of schools&apos; ambitions for their pupils,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/16/dyson-profits-up-8-percent", "sentences": ["Dyson assembles its products in Malaysia and Singapore but employs 550 engineers at its R&amp;D centre in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, for what McCourt called &quot;the most vital stage&quot; for any manufacturing business."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-15T23:01:00Z", "title": "Dyson reports profits up 8% \u2013 and calls for more incentives to innovate", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "BAE Systems", "Rolls-Royce", "Business", "Engineering", "Research and development", "Technology"], "article": "The company founded by inventor Sir James Dyson has joined BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce in urging the government to boost industrial research and education in the UK amid signs that efforts to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing are faltering. Dyson, whose innovative products have revolutionised day-to-day tasks from vacuum cleaning to hand-drying, called for more incentives to generate new business ideas as it reported an 8% increase in annual profits to \u00a3206m last year, on revenues that rose 15% to \u00a3770m. Martin McCourt, Dyson chief executive, said the company&apos;s export-driven model, where it sells eight out of 10 of its appliances abroad, could be replicated at other businesses if the government was more supportive. &quot;We are consistently doing whatever we can to pressure the government and offer more incentives to encourage businesses like ours to invest in ideas,&quot; he said. &quot;When you invest in ideas it is a risky business. Until it comes to fruition and you make it, all you are doing is\u00a0spending money. We just need to offer\u00a0some relief, better tax credits, and\u00a0give companies some kind of incentive. That&apos;s the key to keeping manufacturing businesses successful on the world stage.&quot; Last month, the boss of Britain&apos;s largest manufacturer, the defence company BAE Systems, warned that the government &quot;cannot stand still&quot; on investment in research and development and education, amid fears that the Ministry of Defence&apos;s R&amp;D funding will be cut. George Osborne&apos;s call for a &quot;march of the makers&quot; to return the UK to strong economic growth has yet to have a galvanising effect. In the latest indicator that manufacturing is struggling to meet the chancellor&apos;s expectations, the Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output fell 0.4% in June compared with the previous month. The chief executive of Rolls-Royce, John Rishton, has raised concerns about the education system, saying that producing enough qualified engineers and technicians for industry remained a &quot;long-term issue&quot;. Dyson spent \u00a345m on R&amp;D last year and in 2009 it filed the second-highest number of patents in the UK after Rolls-Royce, which spent \u00a3923m on R&amp;D in 2010. Dyson assembles its products in Malaysia and Singapore but employs 550 engineers at its R&amp;D centre in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, for what McCourt called &quot;the most vital stage&quot; for any manufacturing business. &quot;It&apos;s not so much about manufacturing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s about the investment we have been making in phenomenal ideas and putting that technology into the heart of our machines, then putting it into export markets. Over 80% of our sales are made overseas.&quot; Dyson&apos;s airblade hand dryers are available in 34 countries including China and Romania, while sales of its air multiplier fan are up 150% in Japan and it leads the cylinder vacuum cleaner market in Britain, France, Switzerland, Belgium, Ireland and Spain. Amid warnings from UK manufacturers of an engineering skills shortage, McCourt added that he would like &quot;more evidence&quot; of the government&apos;s commitment to skilled jobs. &quot;The government has stated it wants to see significant scaling up of investment in ensuring that science, technology and engineering is encouraged. We would like to see more evidence of this. The encouragement has to start in the school system.&quot; A spokesperson for the business department said: &quot;The government is committed to giving businesses the incentives to invest in ideas to drive economic growth. We are introducing measures to give companies a reduced rate of tax on profits arising from patents. We are also increasing the amount of support for small and medium-sized businesses through the research and development tax credit, making it one of the most generous measures of its kind worldwide. &quot;The government&apos;s technology strategy board also invests around \u00a3300m annually in innovative technology businesses, with significant support for areas such as high-value manufacturing, regenerative medicine and low carbon energy.&quot; Sir James Dyson studied architecture at the Royal College of Art but soon became obsessed with engineering and invented his company&apos;s signature vacuum cleaner after seeing &quot;cyclone&quot; suction technology at a dust-free sawmill."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/aug/16/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["The new CBeebies app is being released in a limited number of countries as a pilot: Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and South Korea.iPhone You can follow Guardian Apps Blog&apos;s Apps rush on delicious To suggest links, tag articles on delicious.com with &quot;guardianappsblog&quot;"], "publicationDate": "2011-08-16T07:17:00Z", "title": "Apps rush: Carcassonne, Amazon Student, CBeebies and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Apps", "iPhone", "Android", "Mobile"], "article": "A super quiet day today, with only four apps for your consideration (two of which aren&apos;t available in the UK).

I&apos;m out of town and neglected to bring my Potter books, so fan-created sites like the Harry Potter Wiki really helped me out! The question was:  &quot;In the Gryffindor versus Slytherin Quidditch match, in Harry&apos;s third year, how many points is Gryffindor leading by before Harry catches the Golden Snitch? Multiply this number by 35.&quot; The answer, 60 x 35 = 2100, took me to a Guardian article about Pottermore. Considering I had spent the past two hours constantly refreshing Pottermore so as to read the clue exactly when it came out, I was agitated and confused. I thought I had mistyped the URL and ended up in the wrong place. I quickly read through the article and found it was not much help, until I saw a glowing feather in the right-hand corner. I was asked to levitate the feather, which took much more effort than it should have and made me feel a bit embarrassed. I lost several minutes trying to &quot;swish and flick&quot; the cursor before realizing that wasn&apos;t necessary. Soon I had levitated the feather and was able to register on Pottermore! Personally, I&apos;m most excited about the Sorting, because JK Rowling wrote the test herself and has tried it, successfully, on many of her friends and family. I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m a Gryffindor or a Hufflepuff, but I&apos;ll leave it to the test to decide :)Max I am one of those who belong to the Harry Potter generation. I grew up (like millions across the world) with the series&apos; protagonist and was easily sucked into the magical world. So, when word of Pottermore came out, I knew I had to somehow become one of the million that gain entry early. However I got lucky only on my third try. It was actually perfect as the third book is my favourite book and Sirius Black is the first fictional character to have my heart. Having missed the registrations by mere minutes on the first two days, I was rather dejected and apprehensive about my chances. It is true when they say that there is no sleep for the wicked as I had literally gotten four hours of sleep all three days put together and was completely groggy (which is saying a lot as I am someone in her 20s with a job to boot!). And then as I was losing hope, I refreshed one last time and there it was as enticing as a Veela herself, the clue was dancing in front of me.The question read - In the Gryffindor versus Slytherin Quidditch match, in Harry&apos;s third year, how many points is Gryffindor leading by before Harry catches the Golden Snitch? Easy enough as the third book is the one book in the series that I have re-read a number of times since I was 12. I knew that the answer was 12 and since I am not too swift in the math department, I quickly used the calculator in my mobile and was re-directed to the Guardian page which held the elusive quill. One problem - no matter how many times I tried, I could not get the quill to levitate (mostly because I was not paying attention and functioning on very little sleep). My friend came to the rescue and before I knew it, I was on my way to registering.  With a user name to boot and a quick email that validated my early entry, I was ready to go to sleep. But I was too excited. So I curled up with my tattered cope of Prisoner of Azkaban and read through the entire night as I had nearly 11 years ago and true enough the book still brings that elusive tear to my eye. Like I said, there is no rest for the wicked and the Harry Potter fan. Aishwarya  I am a great Harry Potter fan and I am really elated to see more Harry Potter-related things, especially since the last movie was just screened. Also, I think it&apos;s really exciting to read more notes and info on Harry potter and the awesome wizarding world! So I want to join this site because 1) I am really interested in the going-ons of the wizarding world and I want to know more about it and about Harry Potter, beyond what was published in the book; 2) It&apos;s cool to be able to pick an avatar and explore the wizarding world on my own, instead of through Harry&apos;s eyes; 3) I am a Harry Potter fan.\u00a0So what I really want to see on this site is more stories about Harry, Hermione, Ron and all the other characters, for example what happened to them after they defeated Voldemort and their jobs and future and even untold stories of their Hogwarts life. Also, maybe I would like to hear the book and Harry&apos;s adventures from the point of view of other characters like Malfoy or Ginny. It would really make me feel like the books are starting all over again. Also, maybe some games on Harry potter related adventures and forums and discussions on possible questions related to Harry and maybe even competitions where we submit Harry potter essays or short stories.\u00a0And I really want to thank you for starting pottermore and making it so exciting so fans like me can revive our thirst to find out more about the wizarding world.\u00a0Tay, Singapore A month or so ago I had been browsing the Harry Potter Website when I came across something new, saying that JK Rowling was going to be making a special announcement. Being an avid Harry Potter fan, of both the books and the films, I clicked on the link immediately and found a countdown clock for when JK would be making her announcement. I waited and waited for days, sometimes I would just sit at my computer and watch the hours, minutes and seconds slowly go down on the clock. Until finally the day arrived! I watched her announcement and was thrilled. Feeling absolutely heartbroken at the last film coming out, I was so glad that there would be something more to look forward after the films coming to an end. On the website it had said that the site would not be fully open until October so I registered my email for upcoming information and waited. A few days ago i had heard about something on Pottermore that was called the Magical Quill. I didn&apos;t fully understand so I went onto the website and was amazed when i saw that for 7 days 1 million lucky fans would have the chance to be able to enter Pottermore early. Unfortunately we were already on day 2 and the registration for that day had closed but feeling elated, i made sure i was up early the next day to answer day 3&apos;s question. I woke up and immediately opened my computer and the Pottermore website. The question read &quot;In Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban what was the goal difference before Harry caught the snitch in the Gryffindor and Slytherin Game. Times that by 35.&quot; As soon as I saw this I sprinted down the stairs and opened the book, flipping through the chapters till I found the Slytherin Gryffindor Quidditch match. I skimmed through the pages and found the goal difference of 60 and quickly multiplied that by 35 on the calculator. I then linked the answer on to the website and breathed a sigh of relief as I found the page with the magical quill and entered my registration details straight away. I was pleased and amused with the name I had been given and after reading that it takes around 40 minutes for the confirmation email to come through waited rather impatiently at my Google mail. Until Suddenly a confirmation email from Pottermore. I clicked on it feeling gleeful and signed into my account where I received a message saying that I was one of the lucky few that would be able to enter Pottermore early. I couldn&apos;t believe it, I had entered Harry Potter Prizedraws and Sweepstakes before and had never won. As a massive fan of the franchise I feel so happy at the thought that I will be one of the first to use this amazing new website. I am so grateful.Long live Harry Potter!Eleanor-Georgia  I too have a coveted Pottermore beta account in my possession. The site looks very slick! As a Harry Potter fan, and having read all the books and seen all the films, I am looking forward to when things get rolling. The site seems concerned for children&apos;s safety and experience, so that&apos;s great in my opinion.Sophia My name is Alex, I&apos;m 14 and a few days ago I became one of the 1,000,000 selected to enter Pottermore early! YAY!\u00a0I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and Jo Rowling, I find her very inspirational due to her determination and success writing the books\u00a0through which\u00a0she has now accomplished so much!\u00a0I also love the films, the whole franchise has to be my favourite book and film series of all time!\u00a0Having missed out on past book openings and premieres, I was desperate to go to the recent Deathly Hallows part 2 premiere in Trafalgar Square! Unfortunately I didn&apos;t manage to go but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it live on the internet! I also think the latest film is a huge success, I can think of no better way to end this amazing series than\u00a0with this fantastic film!\u00a0Anyway, on to Pottermore, having looked on the site when it was first revealed I was told that in order to find out more, we needed to come back on the 31 of July, so on that morning I went onto Pottermore at around 9am and found out about the Magic Quill clues.\u00a0The clue I had to solve was relating to the first book and it was &quot;How many different types of owl are there sold in Eeylop&apos;s Owl Emporium? Multiply this by 9&quot;. So I rushed to get my Philosopher&apos;s Stone book and turned to the chapter on Diagon Alley.\u00a0After scanning the chapter for a few minutes I found the answer and quickly added it to the link and sure enough it took me to a page where there were lots of feathers floating and I had to try and grab the magic quill (it was actually quite fun) but I managed to catch it!\u00a0When I next logged into my account there was a notice saying I had been selected! I was really pleased, I&apos;m still not entirely sure what it entails but I can&apos;t wait to find out! It has informed me that I have to wait a few weeks to receive a confirmation email that allows me to enter...I can&apos;t wait that long!\u00a0Alex  I&apos;m Victor and I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I like Harry Potter starting the twelve years of age and I am thrilled with the news. But I&apos;m very excited to release Pottermore, I&apos;m sure I will be participating.Thanks everyone, I&apos;m the biggest fan club leader of Rio de Janeiro Brazil.Hugs and up to the platform 9 / 34.Victor I am a 17 year old girl and am absolutely fanatic about Harry Potter, so far so that even though I&apos;m on holiday in Gran Canaria, I went on the internet each day to try and gain early access to Pottermore. On the third day I succeeded and cannot wait to help shape the magical experience. After all, this is the closest I&apos;m ever going to get to getting into Hogwarts!Hannah  My name is Rebecca and I am 13 years old. I&apos;m writing to say that I got early access to Pottermore. This occurred on the third day as I had missed the fist two due to the fact that I did not receive an email in advance to tell me about the magic quill scavenger hunt despite the fact that I had entered my email previously. I only remembered what the website had said the last time I checked on Tuesday 2nd. I registered once I had found the magic quill and 15 minutes later, after frantic checking I received an email that told me I had to validate my account. After doing so I was led back to the Pottermore page where is informed me that I would have to wait up to 3 weeks to receive my welcome email as they could not allow everyone to access the website at the same time.  I found that the question was very easy to answer and I wonder why. I would like to add that I found the article that was written by Harry Cockburn about Pottermore was ironic and odd the way there were such distinguished similarities between him and Harry Potter (best fictional character ever!).Just thought I&apos;d let you know about my experience!Rebecca When I heard about Pottermore, excited would be an understatement. Harry Potter had been a huge part of my life, since, at the age of 7, I had opened the first page of Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone and begun my adventures with Harry, Ron and Hermione. I finished the book on the same day, and demanded more, up\u00a0until\u00a0years later when the final book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out. I started and finished it in the long journey to the\u00a0Lake District\u00a0in my mums car, and cried, laughed and scared my family all the way there. All the books were over- then all the films were over. So when I filled out the\u00a0registration\u00a0form for Pottermore, I did so with shaking fingers, and when I got on I jumped for joy - another Potter adventure was beginning! I think it&apos;s great that JK Rowling is giving something else to her fans, and I, for one, can&apos;t wait to see what Pottermore is like.Rachael When the Harry Potter books came out, I had a son that was a reluctant reader.\u00a0 I used the books to entice him into reading.\u00a0 Sitting in the waiting room of our dentist I brought out my newly purchased copy of the first book and offered to read it to him while we waited.\u00a0 He was suspicious and refused my offer.\u00a0 I said, &quot;Ok, I&apos;ll read it to myself then.&quot; And sat down and did just that.\u00a0 I was, after all, curious what all the hubbub was about.\u00a0 I hadn&apos;t gotten very far when I came across a section I thought would pique his interest, and read it out loud to him.\u00a0 It worked and he became hooked on the books.\u00a0As the years went by and he moved into middle school, it was with delight I heard him chuckle while reading of Harry&apos;s awkward tries for romance.\u00a0 I was delighted that the movies were so well done.\u00a0 Of course, the books were still better, but then it would be a rare case for a movie to be better than the book.\u00a0As time went on my older children became hooked on the books too, reading and re reading them. By the time Half-blood Prince came out no one wanted to wait until the other finished the book so we ended up with three copies.\u00a0 My daughter, with a kind heart, donated her copy to a foreign exchange student from Brazil.\u00a0 He was delighted because they hadn&apos;t come out yet in Brazil.\u00a0When the announcement came out on the Harry Potter theme park, I was thrilled and excited.\u00a0 How wonderful, I thought, to be able to walk the streets of Hogsmeade sampling the goodies there and to see the castle and go through it.\u00a0 I&apos;m not at all surprised at what a big hit it has been.\u00a0Then the announcement of Pottermore came.\u00a0 At first I was puzzled about just what it would be, but the JK Rowling video on it was awesome (might I say magical?).\u00a0 I became a fan of JK Rowling&apos;s writings while reading the books which entertained on many levels, but it was her web site where I truly found gold.\u00a0 In answering the many questions she was asked, I began to learn more of the process she used in writing.\u00a0 Her rags to riches story thrilled me.\u00a0 I&apos;ve always loved success stories.\u00a0 Now I understand she will be giving even more back story to the Harry Potter books.\u00a0 The opportunity to more fully explore Harry&apos;s world, to see what kind of wand would choose me, what house I would be put in, to see what I could do when faced with challenges intrigues me.\u00a0 But first I had to become one of the million to gain early access if I didn&apos;t want to wait until October.\u00a0July 31st I checked on her website, knowing it was the birthday of both Harry and JK\u00a0 Then I moved on to see what changes were taking place at the Pottermore site.\u00a0 It was the afternoon of the 31st and already I was too late to register for that day.\u00a0 I checked early the next morning and found I was too late again.\u00a0 That evening I checked all the sites I could to find out what needed to be done and when the window of opportunity would open.\u00a0 The third day&apos;s luck was no better, but I did find some information on timing from one of the fan sites.\u00a0This morning I arose at 5:40 and went straight to the computer to check.\u00a0 The third day was still closed so the window for the 4th hadn&apos;t opened yet.\u00a0 I kept checking every few minutes, and then finally it happened!\u00a0 I was so excited.\u00a0 I quickly read the clue, which seemed almost too simple.\u00a0 I answered it and added it to the end of the link only to find myself at a page obscured by an invisibility cloak telling me to go back to the main page and see what I could discover.\u00a0 Hmm, I knew my answer was right.\u00a0 What else could I do? \u00a0I reread the instructions and realised my mistake.\u00a0 I had added the answer to the end of the wrong link!\u00a0 I quickly corrected my mistake, hoping the whole time I wouldn&apos;t be too late.\u00a0It worked!\u00a0 I was declared magical and my name was added to the magic quill&apos;s book.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Can a 62-year-old grandma do a happy dance?\u00a0 You bet!\u00a0 The fun I can have with my kids and grandkids, talking about Pottermore, make my grin go from ear to ear.\u00a0 All day long when I remembered my success a big smile would appear (like magic).\u00a0Thanks to the article you published, I was able to fine tune my attempts at registration and succeed.\u00a0 Thank you!\u00a0Anita, California, USA I&apos;m about as much of a Potter fan as you could get, but that didn&apos;t mean that my parents would be nice enough to let me stay up for Pottermore. On Days 1 and 2, we were traveling and staying at a place without wifi. My sister and I were practically dying, knowing that our chances for early access were slipping away. Then, by Day 3, we had travelled to a place with internet, and thought we were saved and could get in. Our parents, however, wanted to go sightseeing. We had planned to leave at 9:00, but that was when the time slot for registration started. I was emailing my friend, who also wanted to get in, but she was on a different time zone while travelling, and was about to go to dinner. Through quite a bit of delaying in ways of long showers and slow eating, we managed to delay out departure until 11:00. I was emailing and refreshing the Pottermore page every minute, with a timer set to remind me. Finally, finally, the clue popped up, asking me to find the number of points Gryffindor was ahead before Harry caught the snitch in the Gryffindor-Slytherin match in the third book, then to multiply that by 35. I sent a two word email to my friend: it&apos;s up. My only problem was I had no clue what the answer was, and since I was on vacation, I didn&apos;t have the third book on me. I asked my friend if she knew the answer, then started putting in random multiples of 35 &amp; 10 (due to the fact that all point scores are multiples of 10). No success. I looked back over to my email to find that my friend had the audiobooks on her iPod, and had found the answer: 2100. I typed in the URL and was redirected to the Guardian website. I immediately spotted the Pottermore colors on a box, with a quill inside. Underneath it told me to levitate the quill by moving my mouse underneath. I did so, and after a few fruitless tries, was redirected to the Pottermore registration. There I put in my info, chose a username, and suddenly I had a Pottermore account. I sat there, stunned, then helped my sister set up her account before registration closed.  My sister and I started celebrating, and my mom remarked that she was glad we had accomplished something in the 4 hours of sitting there. My dad told us to stop making so much noise or we&apos;d annoy the neighbours, but was really quite glad we got in.  Overall, it was a long time to wait, but it was really worth it. I&apos;m really glad we get to experience Pottermore before it opens to all, and know it&apos;ll be really interesting to see more of what JK Rowling has hidden in her mind.Julia I just saw a post in your website and yes, it feels great to be selected. Like the writer, even I cannot wait weeks for my welcome mail. I have got a registration mail and a congratulations, you have been selected mail from Pottermore. It&apos;ll be great if Guardian gets a JK Rowling interview giving more exclusive behind the scenes of Pottermore.Ankita"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/16/the-fiver-arsenal-robbie-keane", "sentences": ["Manchester United are planning to raise \u00a3610m by selling shares on the Singapore stock market, according to the Wall Street Journal."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-16T14:54:30Z", "title": "The Fiver | Famously bohemian; and Robbie Keane | Barney Ronay", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "BIG CUP IS BACK, BACK, BACK! The Fiver has always been of a ruminative, philosophically-minded bent. Many times it can be seen strolling along the left-bank of the famously bohemian King&apos;s Cross urban wasteland canal arm-in-arm with its cheese-eating, white flag-waving French cousin Strutting Alcoholic Intestine-Muncher Fiver, perusing the burning piles of household waste, the semi-derelict crack homes, and all the while contemplating life&apos;s larger questions. With something resembling excitement building ahead of tonight&apos;s Big Cup qualifier first leg between Arsenal and Udinese, these questions have tended to involve various important philosophical issues currently surrounding M Wenger&apos;s Academy of the Performing Backheel. The most obvious of these is related to the paradox known as The Ship of Theoseus or Gervinho Washington&apos;s Axe. At what point, with various bits falling off, being replaced and pretending to cry so they can &quot;go home&quot; to a much more successful football team, do Arsene Wenger&apos;s Arsenal stop being Arsene Wenger&apos;s Arsenal and become instead something else entirely? If we remove their attractive midfield fulcrum and replace it with a slightly more limp and tiresome midfield fulcrum, are they still identifiably the same bunch of soft-shoe sideways passers? If we take away their prancing Dutch spearhead and replace him with a meandering Moroccan, are they still unlikely to shoot on goal other than by mistake? And if an arm-waggling, duvet-clad Frenchman isn&apos;t there to watch them, are they still the same underachieving gaggle of lily-gilders? In fact, are they still Arsenal at all? This is, at the very least, a very weird-looking version. Firstly M Wenger himself will not be on the touchline doing his concerned-disappointed-but-ultimately-let-down-by-others face, having been banned by Uefa for going on about the referee after last season&apos;s defeat in Barcelona. Then there is the team itself. Who are these people? And what have they done with Arsenal? With new captain Robin van Persie suspended for the crime of shooting on goal while wearing an Arsenal shirt, Udinese will now face a forward line of Marouane Chamakh, Andriy Arshavin and Gervinho. While on the bench there could be places for such junior hopefuls as exciting Keith Pot-Noodle, the current captain of Malaysia&apos;s all-conquering Under-12s and an as-yet-unnamed Brazilian foetus of indeterminate gender. And still the questions present themselves. Is the fact the Italian season hasn&apos;t even started yet and Udinese have also lost their two best players enough to justify Arsenal being favourites in a tie where defeat would be catastrophic for both finances and morale? At what stage does a &quot;transfer kitty&quot; become so vast it stops being a kitty and becomes instead an enormous teetering mound of high denomination notes that M Wenger likes to hug and roll around in and vow never to be parted from? And more importantly, when will Arsenal ever win another troph \u2026 ahem. Sorry. Some questions are a little too vague and hypothetical even for the Fiver to muse on.

The future intentions of the Glazers, who took the club private after they bought it in a deal that valued it at \u00a3790m in 2005, have long been the subject of speculation. They are believed to be in talks with Credit Suisse to handle the initial public offering (IPO), which could take place before the end of the year. No final decision has yet been made. Given the allure of the Manchester United brand in Asia, and successful attempts to drive global commercial revenues, analysts said the move could allow the Glazers to establish a true market value for the club, reduce debt and realise cash for use within the business or elsewhere. Any IPO could raise up to $1bn, reports in Asia suggested, which would be an ambitious valuation if the Glazers were to stick to plans to float a stake of between 25% and 30%. The family are believed to value the club at more than \u00a32bn. The Premier League champions carry about \u00a3500m in bond debt, acquired in 2010 when the Glazers launched a bond issue to pay off existing loans taken out to facilitate the leveraged buyout. The bond issue sparked protests from some supporters because it laid bare the extent to which the Glazers had funded the interest payments from the club&apos;s cashflow and built in the ability to draw dividends in future. But David Gill, the club&apos;s chief executive, has insisted that it can easily absorb the \u00a345m-a-year interest payments attached to the bond while competing on the pitch with European rivals. Trophies and a more active position in the transfer market have helped to quell fans&apos; anger, though protest groups remain active. Last year the Glazers paid off the \u00a3225m high-interest, payment-in-kind hedge fund loans they took out in an earlier refinancing round, which did not sit on the club&apos;s balance sheet but were housed by their parent company and accrued interest at 16.25% a year. They have never revealed where they found the money to do so. If they borrowed it, they could use the proceeds of an IPO to repay that loan. The Glazers could also pay down some of the bond debt, plough some proceeds back into the club or take cash out for use elsewhere in their business empire. It emerged this year that Wall Street financiers were talking to the Glazers, who also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a string of shopping centres in the US, about a possible IPO in Hong Kong. However, attention has switched to the Singapore exchange, which has been competing with Hong Kong for international listings and would see the Manchester United name as a major coup. It is not thought likely that the &quot;Red Knights&quot;, a group of wealthy supporters angry about the Glazers&apos; business model, would be interested in a minority stake. They withdrew from the fray despite preparing a \u00a31bn takeover bid, insisting that the Glazers were overvaluing the club. &quot;The key question is: where does the money end up? It doesn&apos;t benefit the fans if it all ends up in Florida,&quot; said Andy Green, a fan and fund manager who blogs on the club&apos;s finances as Andersred. &quot;It shows a total lack of vision. The people who should be offered the chance to buy a stake in the club are the fans. It shows a total lack of imagination not to even consider engaging with them.&quot; The Glazers have continued to insist the club is not for sale, despite rumours about the interest of the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, which denied claims it had tabled a \u00a31.5bn offer before going on to buy the French club Paris St Germain. The London-based commercial arm launched by the Glazers, headed by chief of staff Edward Woodward, has succeeded in substantially growing overseas sponsorship revenues. It is targeting another steep rise in shirt sponsorship income, worth \u00a320m a season from Aon, when the current deal expires in 2014. The market for overseas broadcast rights, valued at \u00a31.3bn over three years, could outstrip that for domestic rights, valued at about \u00a32.1bn, when the next round of collective Premier League deals are negotiated next year. The popularity of the Premier League overseas has also fuelled commercial growth. A Forbes survey this year named Manchester United as the most valuable sports franchise in the world, calculating that the club is worth \u00a31.13bn Yet Manchester United last year racked up a record annual pre-tax loss of \u00a3109m, though much of that was attributable to one-off costs associated with the \u00a3500m bond issue. Its most recent quarterly results showed that while matchday and media income had remained largely flat, annnual commercial income was on course to top \u00a3100m for the first time. Since the Glazers bought the club, annual turnover has doubled to \u00a3300m. The results, for the nine months to 31 March 2011, showed that the club had \u00a3113m in the bank. That was on course to swell to more than \u00a3170m after season ticket income had been banked, notwithstanding more than \u00a350m spent on summer transfers. A Manchester United spokesman said: &quot;We don&apos;t comment on speculation.&quot; A Credit Suisse spokeswoman also declined to comment. The club&apos;s results are due in October, when it will be expected to clarify its future plans to bondholders."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/16/manchester-united-sinagpore-exchange-listing", "sentences": ["But the smaller Singapore exchange has aggressively wooed international companies as part of an attempt to position as a global exchange under its Asian Gateway strategy.", "There was surprise among bankers yesterday that Singapore looked likely to be chosen by the Glazers and their advisers ahead of Hong Kong, but some speculated that this might be because Premier League clubs have found it hard to make headway in China while the wider growth story in Asia is more attractive."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-16T17:24:00Z", "title": "Manchester United would join a host of luxury brands on Asian stock exchanges", "tags": ["Stock markets", "Business", "Football", "Manchester United", "Shares", "Investments", "Money", "Singapore", "Premier League", "The Glazer family", "Financial sector", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Manchester United would become the latest, and perhaps best known, international brand to list on an Asian exchange.

Hong Kong has become the listing vehicle of choice for luxury international consumer brands such as Prada and cosmetics group L&apos;Occitane. But the smaller Singapore exchange has aggressively wooed international companies as part of an attempt to position as a global exchange under its Asian Gateway strategy. A Manchester United IPO (initial public offering) would be seen as its biggest coup yet. By the end of last year, 321 foreign companies were on the SFX, representing 47% of the listed capital. There was surprise among bankers yesterday that Singapore looked likely to be chosen by the Glazers and their advisers ahead of Hong Kong, but some speculated that this might be because Premier League clubs have found it hard to make headway in China while the wider growth story in Asia is more attractive. Others said regulatory considerations might have been a factor. Under the Glazers&apos; ownership, Manchester United have forged ahead of their rivals in growing global revenues. The club has been looking for new offices in the region to capitalise on its estimated supporter base of 190 million and boost its commercial operations. Manchester United&apos;s segmented sponsorship approach is a model that other clubs are now trying to copy, doing regional deals in a range of categories. The club, which like its Premier League rivals tends to alternate its pre-season brand-building tours between the US and Asia, is due to return to the Far East next summer. &quot;The multitude of local events we run with global and local partners, and a prospective tour of Asia in 2012, necessitate expanding our footprint both with people and office space,&quot; United said recently . &quot;This is consistent with the huge appeal of Manchester United in the region, born out of nearly 40 years of visiting.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/16/manchester-united-singapore-stock-exchange", "sentences": ["So why would anyone think Singapore is a natural place to list the current champions of England?", "Second, they think they&apos;ll get a higher price for their asset in Singapore.", "The Singaporean financial authorities will probably regard the arrival of the most famous name in English football as a coup and they&apos;ll milk the event for favourable publicity.", "But even Singapore&apos;s institutional investors may pause to ask why they are being sold an English football club."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-16T19:57:14Z", "title": "Glazers pin Manchester United's hopes on eastern promise", "tags": ["Business", "Stock markets", "Manchester United", "Football", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Manchester United is an English football club playing in the English league.

So why would anyone think Singapore is a natural place to list the current champions of England? We can guess the Glazers&apos; calculation. First, if they go east, they will escape the risk of seeing hostile fans burn copies of the flotation prospectus outside the London Stock Exchange. Second, they think they&apos;ll get a higher price for their asset in Singapore. The first assumption seems safe. The Singaporean financial authorities will probably regard the arrival of the most famous name in English football as a coup and they&apos;ll milk the event for favourable publicity. But do they really pay higher prices in Asia? OK, the Hong Kong market fell in love with branded goods companies such as Prada. But even Singapore&apos;s institutional investors may pause to ask why they are being sold an English football club.

But be warned, you can lose hours watching them. When big companies attempt to lend themselves an air of cool by embracing new music, they tend to be purveyors of\u00a0the things young people buy: mobile phones, alcohol, games consoles and the like.

The former is found at Rolls-Royce, an industrial titan turning out aircraft engines that allow millions of travellers to cross the globe every year. The latter, represented by Bombardier, carries an even greater resonance and has been producing trains for 172 years. As the British historian Tony Judt said: &quot;The railways\u2026 are a collective project for individual benefit. They cannot exist without common accord and, in recent times, common expenditure.&quot; But the city&apos;s two great traditions are now seeing contrasting fortunes. Rolls-Royce, a mile along the road from its struggling peer, is thriving, while trade union leaders fear that Bombardier is hovering near extinction. Rolls-Royce&apos;s head of manufacturing engineering and technology, Hamid Mughal, is so optimistic that he believes that the proportion of UK GDP accounted for by manufacturing \u2013 12.8% \u2013 can be practically doubled: &quot;Could we be up at 25%? Sure, why not?&quot; Rolls-Royce was a government-owned business, like the former British Rail facility now run by Bombardier, when it was struggling for survival in the 1970s. Its current thriving position, which is based on large contracts from privately run airlines, is arguably a collective effort: it was rescued by the government in the 70s and the UK education system provides the school-leavers, graduates and academic research that help underpin its global reputation. It is now an innovative, competitive business that specialises in high-value manufacturing. Exports account for 85% of its sales, underlining that this company makes something other countries cannot: its Trent engines for large commercial aircraft, from the Airbus A380 superjumbo to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This approach, say manufacturing&apos;s backers, is the key to making Britain a pre-eminent industrial player in other sectors. According to Mughal, companies can learn from Rolls-Royce&apos;s technique of keeping a close relationship between researching and developing a technology, designing a product around it and manufacturing it. &quot;The integration of core design technology with manufacturing is very important,&quot; he says on the Derby campus where the design, manufacturing, fitting and testing of the company&apos;s Trent engines all takes place in an area of less than half a square kilometre. In one facility, giant A380 engines are assembled in a quiet, brightly lit atmosphere that belies manufacturing&apos;s clattering image, while the gentle thrumming emanating from an adjacent concrete box conceals a screaming Boeing 787 engine being tested at full throttle. Mughal is speaking in Rolls-Royce&apos;s new technology exhibition centre, which displays how its focus on powering aircraft efficiently has spun off into successful products for warships, power stations and oil rigs. For all the talk of collective projects, this was a commercial bet that paid off, helping the company generate sales of \u00a311bn last year. The technology centre was opened this year by David Cameron, who proclaimed on the Rolls-Royce campus that his government would wean the economy off financial services while pledging to &quot;do everything we can&quot; to help local businesses create jobs. Three months later, his ministers announced that Siemens of Germany would be preferred bidder for a \u00a31.4bn contract to build 1,200 carriages for the London Thameslink rail route, knocking Canadian-owned Bombardier into second place. Soon afterwards Bombardier announced plans to cut 1,400 jobs from its 3,000-strong workforce, blaming the Siemens decision and triggering accusation that Cameron had failed to defend British manufacturing jobs. The regional officer for the Unite trade union, Tony Tinley, says the Bombardier situation underlines the flaws in the government&apos;s manufacturing policy. &quot;A UK manufacturing strategy has got to be more than vague aspirations and assurances. It has got to create a support system for UK plc,&quot; he says. Colin Walton, chairman of Bombardier Transportation UK, will not discuss the Thameslink contract ahead of a transport select committee next month. But with the polite but emphatic tone of someone who has had to repeat himself a lot in recent months, the Yorkshireman says Bombardier&apos;s UK operation, and train manufacturing in general, measures up to Rolls-Royce&apos;s pedigree. &quot;Rail manufacturing is very highly skilled. It is different to aerospace but it does not require less expertise,&quot; he says, pointing, as one example, to the aerodynamics of high-speed trains. He argues that Bombardier&apos;s Derby operation also replicates the Rolls-Royce approach: its research and development work has created a monitoring system that now tracks trains in Switzerland, France and Germany, while its designers created Italy&apos;s Zefiro high-speed train. On the manufacturing side, production lines at Derby are still busily churning out trains for London Underground and the London Midland franchise. As those disparate jobs suggest, however, it is the unique nature of each train manufacturing order that is threatening to undo the business. It is difficult to plan for the long term, says Walton: &quot;The big difference between a plane and a train is that, by and large, all runways are the same. A rail network could have a different track gauge, a Victorian viaduct or the Channel tunnel.&quot; In other words, a plane engine can be sold around the world, but the same cannot be said for rail carriages. As a result, Bombardier struggles to stand on its own in the way that Rolls-Royce can. The latter generates half its revenues from the thriving Middle East, South America and Asian markets, as exemplified by a recent $1bn order from Singapore Airlines. &quot;We recognise that the UK is a competitive market and nobody wants to support a lame industry,&quot; says Walton. &quot;But this is not a lame industry. Derby has the biggest cluster of rail industry companies in the world.&quot; As with BAE Systems and its Glasgow shipyards, Bombardier still needs that sense of common accord, supported by taxpayer-backed common expenditure."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/aug/19/rolls-building-court-complex-london", "sentences": ["Its rivals will be New York, Hong Kong, Dubai and Singapore; the French and German justice ministries have also just produced a glossy brochure together.&quot; The UK&apos;s legal sector is already a significant earner, generating \u00a323.1bn in 2009 \u2013 equivalent to 1.8% of GDP."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-19T18:53:29Z", "title": "Rolls Building court complex can make London 'global legal centre'", "tags": ["Law", "UK news", "London"], "article": "A \u00a3300m state-of-the-art law court complex will open in the next few weeks as the government tries to make the UK the world&apos;s pre-eminent destination for swiftly resolving international high-value legal disputes \u2013 and making a lot of money in the process. The curvaceous, 11-storey Rolls Building in Fetter Lane, close to the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, will contain 31 courts, including three &quot;super-courts&quot; configured to accommodate big, multiparty disputes. The marketing of the Rolls Building, and British justice in general, to a global business audience has already begun, the Queen is being lined up for the building&apos;s inauguration ceremony, and the court&apos;s cutting-edge electronic filing system, which is intended to make it mostly paperless, is being tested. There are, however, dissenting voices who argue that the Rolls Building is about to be unveiled just as the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is closing around 140 magistrates and county courts around the country and preparing to slash the legal aid budget. From October it is hoped that the Rolls Building will become the new home of the chancery division of the high court, the admiralty and commercial court, as well as the technology and construction court. The government hopes it will attract high-profile business disputes from around the world, such as rows over pipelines and property ventures, contested insurance payouts, environmental pollution claims and disagreements over complex contracts. When the project was launched five years ago, it was claimed the Rolls Buildings would develop into &quot;the biggest dedicated business court in the world&quot;. The development comes as the MoJ and UK Trade and Investment are promoting British courts as the gold standard for resolving international disputes, hoping to profit from their excellence. &quot;The message is that it will be a focus for settling international and domestic disputes,&quot; said Michael Todd QC, an expert in company law who is chairman elect of the Bar Council, which represents barristers. In the same way that the City has promoted itself as an international financial centre, he said, London can become a global legal centre. &quot;It&apos;s right that London should be seen as a place where financial disputes can be resolved.&quot; The Rolls Building courts will also be used for mediation and arbitration cases, both increasingly popular alternatives to the traditional confrontations involved in litigation. &quot;There will be 31 courtrooms and 55 consultation suites,&quot; said Todd, who has been involved in developing the project as a previous head of the Chancery Bar Association. &quot;The super-courts are looking particularly good. It&apos;s going to bring together all sorts of experts in tax, shipping, finance and trust law. &quot;The idea is to have an almost paperless court. As lawyers, we are so accustomed to thumbing through bundles of paper. It should be possible to work with less paperwork.&quot; Chris Dale, an Oxford lawyer and software expert who has been developing &quot;e-disclosure practices&quot;, is among those who have been critical of the Rolls Building. &quot;It is no good just inducing wealthy foreigners to spend their money in the commercial \u2026 and specialist courts while small and medium-sized companies (who generate most of our GDP) cannot afford to bring and defend claims,&quot; he wrote on his blog. &quot;It is disingenuous to boast of one shiny new building while neglecting the courts in which most of our litigation is run.&quot; Two-thirds of the Rolls Building, which has a glass and portland stone facade, will be leased by Her Majesty&apos;s Court Service. The courts complex, which occupies the first four floors, was scheduled to cost \u00a370m; the top floors and the basement have been rented out to commercial law firms. The entire building is currently being sold to Legal and General for just over \u00a3300m. The CityUK, a lobby group which represents finance firms, has also been eagerly supportive of the project. &quot;There are a lot of advantages for companies if they use English common law,&quot; said Richard Normington, a senior manager. &quot;The Rolls Building is the physical embodiment of London and the UK&apos;s commitment to provide a modern court service. Its rivals will be New York, Hong Kong, Dubai and Singapore; the French and German justice ministries have also just produced a glossy brochure together.&quot; The UK&apos;s legal sector is already a significant earner, generating \u00a323.1bn in 2009 \u2013 equivalent to 1.8% of GDP. It contributed \u00a33.2bn in exports, triple the level of a decade ago. Of commercial arbitration cases, 90% of those handled by London law firms involve an international party. In a little noticed document released in May, &apos;Plan for Growth: Promoting the UK&apos;s Legal Services Sector&apos;, the MoJ and UKTI urged that London should become an international &quot;hub of expertise&quot;. &quot;People turn to us because they know they will find world class, highly specialised practitioners and expert judges in the specialist courts,&quot; it declared. &quot;They understand that a decision from a court in the UK carries a global guarantee of impartiality, integrity and enforceability.&quot; Among promotional tours already undertaken to drum up business are trade missions to Qatar, the UAE, Oman and Bahrain &quot;to promote the litigation, arbitration and mediation advocacy services&quot;. There has also been an English Law Week in Russia and an Alternative Dispute Resolution event in India, both supported by the MoJ. The official opening of the Rolls Building as well as the 2012 London Olympics are listed in the government document as other events that can be used to market legal services. There will also be a &quot;pro-bono legal advice and representation service&quot; for the London Games, showcasing the high-quality range of services the UK legal profession can offer. Referring to the Rolls Building, the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, said: &quot;The provision of modern, high-quality services for all parties will present the opportunity to market the facility at a global level in order to maintain the unrivalled work of the high court and English law.&quot; There is no sign so far that such yoking together of finance and justice \u2013 evidence, perhaps, of the Treasury&apos;s belief that every government department must contribute towards the economic recovery \u2013 has caused any judicial unease. The price of justice The cost of the project is reported to have exhausted ministry funds, leaving no money available for the purchase of artwork. &quot;Judicial representatives&quot;, according to a legal newsletter, have instead been exploring &quot;charitable funding and other options to ensure that the [Rolls] Building has distinctive images on display&quot;. The judges have already selected their rooms. Some have expressed a note of regret at leaving the Victorian labyrinth of the Royal Courts of Justice. &quot;Some of us will look back a little wistfully from our new state of the art building to the glorious architecture of our old habitat,&quot; Mr Justice Briggs informed Legalweek magazine. Few will regret leaving St Dunstan&apos;s House, also in Fetter Lane, where the Technology and Construction Court sits. Its cramped facilities were recently described as an &quot;embarrassment to lawyers&quot;. How smooth and complete the transition to electronic filing of documents will be is uncertain. At least one senior chambers clerk has questioned whether sufficient lifts have been installed to ensure that boxloads of files can be wheeled into court without creating &quot;bottlenecks&quot; first thing each morning. There have been hiccups in developing &quot;online payment arrangements&quot;. Computers will be installed in every court to enable judges while on the bench to use online diaries for fixing future hearings. Some of the courts will have video conferencing screens. One comment on a legal website feared that electronic filing of cases would not be ready in time. &quot;The future might look bright to a rabbit staring into the lights of an oncoming car,&quot; the anonymous poster noted, &quot;but it may also get more stressful.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/20/rhinos-threatened-extinction-cancer-cure", "sentences": ["A policeman who visited the scene 36 hours later estimated that the horn would already be in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-20T18:50:26Z", "title": "Rhinos threatened with extinction to meet demand for bogus cancer cure", "tags": ["Endangered species", "South Africa", "World news", "Africa", "Animals"], "article": "The vultures are startled and take flight as our pickup truck arrives at the giant carcass lying in the lowveld.

Some 265 rhinos have been poached so far this year, according to government figures, an average of more than one per day. This puts 2011 on course to surpass last year&apos;s record death toll of 333. In 2007, it was just 13. Why? There is no mystery about it. Experts agree the carnage results from a false belief, widespread in the far east, that rhino horn can cure cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. There is now soaring demand from the newly moneyed consumers of China and Vietnam. Poaching gangs here are increasingly sophisticated, using helicopters, silent tranquillisers, body armour, night vision equipment and mercenaries experienced in rhino tracking. Once a rhino&apos;s horn has been hacked off, they leave the animal to bleed to death. The horn is then smuggled out of the country by an international syndicate. The price of rhino horn is \u00a335,000 per kilogram, making it more expensive than gold, according to the International Rhino Foundation. The lucrative black market was the subject of intense debate at a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Geneva last week. Calls to action have come too late for &quot;Izzy&quot;, who was about to reach breeding age and was expected to produce 10 calves over the next 30 years. As a deterrent to poachers, her horn had been surgically removed under anaesthetic two years ago, but regrew to about 2.5kg \u2013 enough to sign her death warrant. Three poachers came at dead of night, it is believed, shooting her with a .375 rifle and removing the horn with apparently clinical expertise (some rhinos are crudely hacked and disfigured). The animal appears to have walked for about 80 metres before collapsing and dying. A policeman who visited the scene 36 hours later estimated that the horn would already be in Singapore. The killing was all the more shocking to Bezuidenhout and his staff at the Mauricedale Game Ranch in Malelane because it has seen no poaching incidents since 2007. The estate tries to de-horn all its rhino and employs rangers to patrol its 6,500-hectare grounds and alert the local police if they see anything suspicious. By day, the grassy top of &quot;warthog hill&quot; offers the kind of vista that has brought generations of travellers to the African bush: a wide sweep of acacia trees, lakes and hills that go on undulating to the far horizon, bathed in a clear golden light. It is a seemingly peaceful haven for aardvarks, bushbucks, crocodiles, elands, giraffes, hippos, impalas, kudus, ostriches, sables, warthogs, waterbucks, zebras and other creatures \u2013 none of which prey on rhinos. But by night, this is the observation point from which rangers such as Khululani Sibuyi work from 6pm to 6am, staring intently for the faintest sign of intruders. &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s boring, but I think it&apos;s good to protect the rhinos,&quot; said the 25-year-old. &quot;It&apos;s dangerous because they&apos;ve got guns and, if you meet them on the ground, they could shoot you. I would like a weapon.&quot; Armed confrontations have been increasingly common in South Africa&apos;s low-level rhino war. Seventeen poachers have been killed in Kruger Park alone this year by rangers acting in self-defence, South African National Parks (SANParks) says, up from 15 in the whole of last year. This followed an official pledge to &quot;fight fire with fire&quot; and the return of army soldiers to patrol the park&apos;s borders. Some rhino owners have turned to hiring ex-military security guards. Tom Milliken, director of the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic&apos;s east and southern Africa programme, said: &quot;Heavily armed people are moving into protected areas to kill rhino. Those charged with their protection face great challenges and gun fights are part of the equation. There is a rhino war going on out there and it continues to get ugly.&quot; SANParks believes its tough approach has resulted in a significant drop in poaching over the past two months. Police have made 131 arrests so far this year, ranging from poachers to couriers to kingpins. Earlier this month two Vietnamese men were handed prison sentences of 10 and eight years after horns were found in their luggage at Johannesburg&apos;s airport. But under such pressure, there are fears that gangs will be displaced to private game reserves such as Mauricedale, where a three-metre electric fence and razor wire may not be enough. Mauricedale&apos;s owner, John Hume, says he is the biggest rhino farmer in the world with six estates in South Africa, although he is reluctant to give numbers. Hume works from an office inside his personal aviary. Exotic birds fly across the room, and have left their mark on his chair. Today, one knocked water over his computer, which he is attempting to remedy with a hair dryer. On the main table, carved from a variety of trees, is a dish full of live worms. Fish trophies adorn the walls and feisty dogs scamper around the room. The recent rhino death was a bitter blow. &quot;You&apos;re devastated because it makes you realise how vulnerable you and your rhinos are,&quot; Hume said. &quot;Poachers are becoming more sophisticated and that&apos;s worrying. An investigator told us they had identified 27 gangs operating here and have arrested three \u2013 and they are probably out on bail.&quot; The 69-year-old believes the true depth of the crisis is hidden. &quot;I think the escalation in poaching is much worse than they officially know, and that&apos;s a problem for rhinos. How are we going to stop this? The market is growing, the Chinese are growing affluent, the demand for horn is escalating at a horrific rate.&quot; Hume has proposed a bold solution. &quot;I am of the very firm opinion that the only way to save the rhinos from extinction is by legalising the trade in their horns. I am against the futility and stupidity of the current system. It is so illogical, I believe the world will see the light. I only hope they see it in time.&quot; Hume and other rhino farmers argue that legalising the trade would bring it under control, driving prices down and squeezing the black market. South Africa is studying the idea. Opponents contend there is no control system along the trade chain, supplying horn might stimulate further demand and it would be immoral to feed a false belief in the horn&apos;s medicinal value. There are an estimated 25,000 rhinos left in Africa. Some 20,800 are in South Africa, of which 19,000 are white rhinos and 1,800 black rhinos. This represents a major triumph for conservation given that white rhinos numbered fewer than a hundred when they were hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century. The population is still growing, but experts fear that poachers could undo all the good work. Dr Joseph Okori, Africa rhino programme manager at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), said: &quot;There is no room for complacency on this issue. We believe the situation is still very alarming and we see it escalating. We do recognise there may have been an apparent slowdown of late but poaching pressure is still up. The demand is still strong across the world and the value of rhino horn is still rising.&quot; Okori said Cites&apos; meeting last week saw a strong commitment from African countries and a working group was set up, but warned that China had failed to come up with specific proposals. He added: &quot;We believe that if the current escalation in poaching continues, rhinos will be faced with the threat of extinction down the line. We know this from history.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/21/observer-editorial-think-again-chancellor", "sentences": ["Just as generals in 1942 had the guns of Singapore pointed out to sea when the threat came from the Japanese in their rear, leading to a military disaster, so Mr Osborne and the government have their economic guns pointed in exactly the wrong direction."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-20T23:01:02Z", "title": "UK economy: think again, Mr Osborne, before it's too late | Observer editorial", "tags": ["George Osborne", "Economic policy", "Economics", "Global economy", "US economy", "UK news", "Recession", "Business", "Austerity"], "article": "Since taking office, the chancellor has boasted about the low rate of interest on British government debt, now sinking to 2.2%, the lowest since 1899, as panic-stricken financial markets last week gave up hope of economic recovery and instead bet on years of stagnation with attendant stagnating prices. But George Osborne continues to claim that such low interest rates are proof of the effectiveness of his policies, a saving to the taxpayer and \u2013 because they represent a generalised lowering of borrowing costs \u2013 a substantial stimulus to the economy. He could hardly be more wrong. Mr Osborne&apos;s analysis will come to match other calamitous British policy misjudgments that disfigure our history. Just as generals in 1942 had the guns of Singapore pointed out to sea when the threat came from the Japanese in their rear, leading to a military disaster, so Mr Osborne and the government have their economic guns pointed in exactly the wrong direction. They cling to a wholly incorrect diagnosis of the threats facing the economy and what the response should be. The lowest interest rates on government debt for more than 100 years are a cause for profound concern. It is because the prospect for economic growth is so poor, when there is so little demand at home and abroad, that government debt, even at astonishingly low interest rates, seems to offer a better reward than investment in company shares. It is a flight from risk and rising unemployment figures added one more validation. The international investment community plainly thinks that the overhang of private debt across the European and US economies \u2013 the legacy of decades of excessive credit growth \u2013 is unserviceable and, worse, is sucking governments and banks into the crisis. Policy-makers seem to have no answer except to stick together, recommending measures that will diminish growth prospects still further while fearing the markets&apos; response to any proposal that might weaken their freedoms. Britain&apos;s predicament, as the markets well understand, is the most acute of all. We have more private debt \u2013 three-and-a-half times our national output \u2013 than any other G20 country; our banks are thus more vulnerable and overstretched than others; and the degree of demand the government is taking out of the economy through its crash deficit-reduction programme is larger and more abrupt than anywhere else. Britain&apos;s position is analogous to Japan&apos;s in the early 1990s, a country that has now spent nearly 20 years in the economic doldrums trying to deal with its legacy of private debt from the 1970s and 80s. Only successive Japanese governments&apos; willingness to lift public borrowing to compensate for the private debt overhang has kept the Japanese economy alive. But the Cameron government is not contemplating that, nor measures to relieve the pressure on banks, nor imaginative ways of relieving the private debt burden. Instead, the coalition, is going full speed ahead rather than thinking of cleverer and smarter ways of managing the crisis. The markets&apos; grim verdict is perversely portrayed by the chancellor as an endorsement. Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron argue that the situation is hardly of their making. The crisis is international, they say, made worse by Gordon Brown&apos;s bequest of Britain&apos;s largest peacetime budget deficit. The government can hardly be blamed for the colossal strains that threaten the cohesion of the eurozone, nor the reluctance of Germany to accept the leadership role that is central to any solution. Nor can it be blamed for the absurd economic stance taken by the American Tea Party movement that so constrains economic policy options in the US. Its only option is to try to balance the books and do as much as it can to let the private sector drive recovery. Yet it is this approach, reproduced in both the eurozone and in the US, that is magnifying rather than reducing the crisis. If all countries simultaneously tighten economic policy when their economies are encumbered by huge levels of private debt, the result will be deflation and depression. Some governments&apos; public debts and deficits require tough austerity measures, which makes it incumbent on those in stronger positions to use what scope they have to boost their economies. Despite the government&apos;s chilling rhetoric, Britain is in the stronger camp with only moderate levels of government debt. We have options apart from austerity and an obligation to take them. But to accept such a proposition requires a shift in the way policy-makers conceive of how market economies operate, what they consider the proper relationship between business, finance and the state, and how the pain of adjustment should be distributed. Osborne and Cameron cannot be reasonably criticised for the wider economic conjuncture, but they can be held to account for being among the most vocal cheerleaders for the consensus that brought this mess about \u2013 and is making it worse. Markets need architectures in which to operate best; they do not spontaneously create such architecture or arrive at best outcomes on their own. The government should be developing options for better managed international currency regimes and ideas on what rules are needed to make all financial asset prices less volatile. Instead, when an idea is floated \u2013 such as Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s Robin Hood tax on financial transactions \u2013 the coalition is unconstructive. Markets and the interests of banks must not be challenged. At home, Britain should be considering a package of radical monetary and fiscal measures to stimulate the economy. For example, even within a regime that requires banks to hold more capital to support lending, there should be short-term derogations to make it easier for banks to boost business lending. And there should be an emergency package of spending increases on public infrastructure accompanied by tax cuts for the moderately and lower-paid to assure business that there will be some demand for goods and services. Above all, there needs to be a change in the mindset that suffering economies and citizens should be endlessly grateful to wealth-generating business whose privileges are unassailable and whose leaders&apos; incomes should be taxed as low as possible. Instead, there is a mutual dependence between governments, societies and business and it has been in periods when that has been recognised, such as in the 30 years after the war, that capitalism has best prospered. In effect, Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron have to change their minds. If they don&apos;t, the chances of the coalition&apos;s survival will become vanishingly small, along with the prospects of a sustained economic recovery."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/aug/21/philip-glass-qatsi-trilogy-review", "sentences": ["The Singapore-born Tan, better known as a fortepianist, brought an entirely new, quixotic beauty to bear.", "The established T&apos;ang Quartet, also from Singapore, excelled in two contemporary works, the folk-inspired Some Aspects of Peltoniemi Hintrik&apos;s Funeral March by yet another 1930s boy, Aulis Sallinen (b 1935), and the third string quartet by Bright Sheng (b 1955) which mixed Chinese and western techniques to nimbly embroidered effect."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-20T23:06:12Z", "title": "Philip Glass Ensemble: the Qatsi trilogy; BBCSO/Volkov; Melvyn Tan; T'ang Quartet; Bo Skovhus; Montreal SO/Nagano; Llyr William; Ten Plagues \u2013 review", "tags": ["Edinburgh festival 2011", "Classical music", "Philip Glass", "Music", "Culture", "Edinburgh festival"], "article": "A short stint in Edinburgh during festival time, even in fine weather which for the most part it decidedly wasn&apos;t, can leave you like a ship struggling against a powerful headwind. On day one, the experience of fighting off a swarm of girls dressed as pink mice singing winsome barbershop baroque in the Royal Mile nearly had me packing my bags. These siren distractions are also part of the revelry. Music is everywhere. For a critic this has its difficulties. It&apos;s impossible to walk up Princes Street without stopping to wonder if you should review that apprentice piper&apos;s endless piobaireachd, or whether an event for roadworks and car horns was art or just the city&apos;s usual mid-August speciality. After a dozen events in four days, principally from the international festival, whose broad theme is far east meets far west, all one can do is think white thoughts and see what rises from the silt of richly varied aural experience. A highlight in the opening week was the presence of Philip Glass to perform \u2013 with his ensemble and in three successive evenings \u2013 his own live soundtrack to the Qatsi trilogy. The wonder of this triptych of films, directed across two decades by Godfrey Reggio, is that it exists at all. Koyaanisqatsi (1982), Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002) lack the usual, and advised, commercial assets: none has actors, dialogue, narrative or meaning. Fortunately three insightful Hollywood titans, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas and Steven Soderbergh, provided backing when no one else would. A fourth film has been made, with no money yet to complete it. Taking their titles from Hopi words, each offers a sequence of images of forests, factories, space, decay. We see a planet at risk of destruction. Cityscapes are speeded up manically, humans reduced to mechanised ants. Safari animals roam, alienated, in despoiled landscapes. The films are somewhat old-fashioned now yet paradoxically prophetic. But in each case Glass&apos;s score retains its power and, if anything, grows in majesty, helped by watching the figure of the 74-year-old American guru playing keyboards with his younger colleagues, his characteristic repeated chord patterns expanding rhythmically to create overarching, ever longer phrases. Glass&apos;s long-term collaborator Michael Riesman conducted with formidable precision. The Playhouse was packed. Muhammed Bahram, an Iraqi now working in Glasgow&apos;s Scottish-Kurdish community centre, was the well-found singer for the call to prayer in Powaqqatsi. Cellist Matt Haimovitz found glorious eloquence in his marathon solo in Naqoyqatsi (played by Yo-Yo Ma on the original). There was a sense of collective memory when the audience rose to give these virtuosic musicians, and the composer himself, a standing ovation. I missed Koyaanisqatsi (the only one of the trio I had seen before) because of a frustrating clash with a superb concert given by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ilan Volkov. The entire programme was by another 1930s-born composer, Jonathan Harvey, now 72. It too was a trilogy, wholly contrasting in style, written between 2005 and 2008 when he was composer-in-residence with the BBCSSO, in which he himself once played as a young cellist. Harvey&apos;s interest in Buddhism has inspired music of quiet, transcendental brilliance. These three works \u2013 Body Mandala, Speakings and \u2026 towards a Pure Land \u2013 combine distinctive orchestral invention with strange, glistening electronics so that the borders are blurred. Life and death, physics and metaphysics combine. The impact is singular, fierce and tranquil. He was honoured by fine performances from his orchestra and Volkov \u2013 joint dedicatees \u2013 whose playing added love to skilfulness. In a long and steady career, Harvey has never courted fame or followed fashion. His aim, pursued with humanity and integrity, has always been higher. In his book Music and Inspiration (1999) he celebrates the ways in which the greatest composers, through music, have transformed the everyday and achieved, as he puts it, paradise on earth. He would never admit that of his own compositions. I will strike out and say it for him. One other event stood out on this highest level: Melvyn Tan&apos;s Queen&apos;s Hall recital, a delicious yin-yang pairing of sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti with Cage&apos;s Sonatas and Interludes. These 16 sonatas and four interludes, played on a prepared piano using nuts, bolts, screws and various bits of plastic, rubber and wood, have infinite variety, in large part dependent on the performer. The Singapore-born Tan, better known as a fortepianist, brought an entirely new, quixotic beauty to bear. Colours were delicate and oriental (if that word can be allowed ever again), the textures ethereal. Tan became an elegant, waif-like gamelan Orpheus teasing his strange, choked instrument to airy life. The Scarlatti, played on a standard grand and with its own chance elements as hands leap across octaves, offered complementary heat and warmth. Everything else must be gathered into a round-up of pleasures noted. The established T&apos;ang Quartet, also from Singapore, excelled in two contemporary works, the folk-inspired Some Aspects of Peltoniemi Hintrik&apos;s Funeral March by yet another 1930s boy, Aulis Sallinen (b 1935), and the third string quartet by Bright Sheng (b 1955) which mixed Chinese and western techniques to nimbly embroidered effect. Their Schubert Quartettsatz felt undernourished, but the famous adagio from Barber&apos;s string quartet had all the proper muscularity of tone called for. The Queen&apos;s Hall morning series, a favourite Edinburgh tradition, had opened with a strong, if at times uneven all-Mahler recital by Danish baritone Bo Skovhus and pianist Stefan Vladar, which gave insight into the composer&apos;s span of lieder writing from Nine Early Songs to &quot;Der Abschied&quot; from Das Lied von der Erde in the composer&apos;s own piano and voice version, lost until 1989. Since the ubiquitous rain was especially torrential on the night of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra&apos;s first concert at Usher Hall, the irony of its aquatic programme was lost on no one. La mer and Beethoven&apos;s &quot;Pastoral&quot; symphony, conducted by Kent Nagano, formed agreeably played bookends to Tan Dun&apos;s acrobatic and splashy Water Concerto which is exactly as its name suggests: three percussionists, led by the extraordinarily agile Wang Beibei, conjured amplified drips, drops and trickles from transparent bowls of water, while the orchestra acted as a conduit for more conventional east-west sounds. It was entertaining and adroitly done. A few in the front-row stalls were rained on and merrily waved brollies. Others in the audience inevitably cast aspersions. Which leaves a squeezed few lines for the fringe. I heard three of Ll\u0177r Williams&apos;s complete Beethoven piano sonatas recitals at Greyfriars kirk, each yet better than the last. As inward and serious as Melvyn Tan is outgoing and smiling, Williams communes with the piano as if seeking new layers in a palimpsest. The results, as in the Op 10 set last Monday, can be revelatory. Another pianist, Bob Broad, was the persuasive advocate of a new score by Conor Mitchell to Mark Ravenhill&apos;s text for singer Marc Almond, once half of Soft Cell. Ten Plagues at the Traverse may have confused those who expected theatre. Instead it was an intriguing song cycle in that English ballad tradition which travels from The Beggar&apos;s Opera via The Rake&apos;s Progress and Butterworth to the present. The slight, big-eyed figure of Almond singing in declamatory chest voice, until some hushed falsetto near the end, held the stage tellingly. A film projection showed a city \u2013 London \u2013 in urban-crazed fast motion. It reminded me of something: ah yes, Koyaanistqatsi. There&apos;s nothing new under the rain."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/22/manchester-united-kit-deal-dhl", "sentences": ["As the club&apos;s owners proceed with plans to float a stake of up 30% on the Singapore stock exchange, the club&apos;s brokers are likely to point to the deal with logistics firm DHL as further evidence of their global commercial clout.", "&quot;Everyone knows about the passion of our fans in that part of the world and this deal makes it a lot easier for us to keep in touch with them.&quot; The Glazers have submitted the initial documents required to float a stake of between 25% and 30% on the Singapore stock exchange before the end of the year in a move that they hope could raise up to $1bn."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-22T13:07:16Z", "title": "Manchester United complete \u00a340m training kit sponsorship deal with DHL", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Business", "Football", "Sport", "Business"], "article": "Manchester United have signed a new \u00a340m sponsorship deal for their domestic training kit that exceeds the value of all but five main shirt sponsors in the Premier League.

Now schools are now being targeted by organisations offering them private arrangements for careers advisers ranging from \u00a3150 to \u00a3200+ a day. Schools are having to choose between buying in a adviser and retaining teachers, admin staff and TAs. Many of the schools in my area are working with a deficit in the budget, so how they are supposed to buy in impartial advice with no extra funding when they are balancing these other demands? The richer schools will be able to buy in advisers, while the poorer ones will have minimal provision. This will result in a service which is &apos;patchy and inconsistent&apos;.

After months of near-constant negative headlines around the company&apos;s BlackBerry devices, it has just unveiled a genuinely innovative new music service built on top of its crown jewel: the BBM messaging app. And yet the unveiling happened just as Apple CEO Steve Jobs resigned, sucking the blogosphere&apos;s attention and energy away from any other technology story. BBM Music deserves to regain some of that attention though: it has plenty of potential, and is far from a me-too rival to popular music services like iTunes, Spotify and Pandora. Powered by British music services firm Omnifone, it has licences from all four major labels in the bag in time for the launch today of its closed beta in the UK, US and Canada, with a global rollout to follow later this year in those countries plus Australia, Columbia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The basic facts: BBM Music will be a subscription service costing $4.99 a month in the US, although how that converts elsewhere in the world has yet to be announced. Users will choose 50 songs from the BBM Music catalogue for their profiles, which can be used to create playlists, and cached locally on their BlackBerry smartphone for offline listening. 50 songs? That&apos;s not much, but this is where the BBM angle kicks in. Users will also be able to access the 50 songs of any of their BBM contacts who subscribe to the service. That means a theoretical choice of 100 songs if one friend signs up, 200 songs if three do, and 2,000 songs if 39 do. And so on. RIM has not given details of any upper limit, but in an interview with BerryReview, senior project manager Nick Patsiopoulos says &quot;during the beta the BBM Music connections is limited to 140 BBM Music contacts until launch but it can scale past there&quot;. Licensing agreements are likely to be the key factor in whatever ceiling is eventually set. The BBM Music app itself is built around an activity stream of the songs friends are adding to their profiles, as well as the friends they are sharing those tracks with, and the playlists they are creating. Users can comment on one another&apos;s songs, and fire up full BBM chats from within the application. The app also ties into Amazon&apos;s MP3 music store to buy and download tracks beyond the 50-song limit, with the choice of partner being slightly surprising, given RIM&apos;s previously close relationship with British firm 7Digital. BBM Music is interesting and genuinely disruptive in the wider scheme of music services. An addressable user base of 45 million BBM users is a strong base to start from, although BBM Music is more likely to appeal to BlackBerry&apos;s younger customers rather than its business users. There are some pitfalls in store. First: will those younger users be willing to pay for a subscription music service, even if it is tied into BBM? Second: how will it stack up to competition from other streaming services which offer desktop as well as mobile access, with no 50-song limit? RIM&apos;s launch of its BBM Social API means those services can build BBM into their own BlackBerry apps, after all. Perhaps most importantly, BBM Music&apos;s success will be tied to the overall performance of RIM itself. It&apos;s a bold and innovative move, but its long-term prospects will depend on the success of the current wave of BlackBerry 7 OS handsets, but more importantly on how next year&apos;s new generation of devices running RIM&apos;s QNX software perform. RIM&apos;s challenge remains proving that it can halt its sliding market share against fierce competition from iPhone and Android, but at least BBM Music shows its strategy is not just about playing catch-up."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/aug/25/gcses-beginning-end-grade-inflation", "sentences": ["At the post-GCSE results press briefing, Ziggy Liaquat, head of exam board Edexcel, echoed one of Gove&apos;s favourite themes, saying: &quot;We ought to be looking at comparisons internationally \u2013 what 16-year-olds in countries like Finland and Singapore are able to do.&quot; Alan Smithers, director of the centre for education and employment research at the University of Buckingham, said: &quot;The government is sending out the message that you have to stand up for standards."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-25T18:11:46Z", "title": "GCSE results 2011: the beginning of the end of grade inflation", "tags": ["GCSEs", "Education", "A-levels", "Michael Gove", "Schools", "Politics", "Sixth form", "Exams"], "article": "Rises in the pass rate and the accompanying claims of grade inflation have become an integral part of the annual exam results season. But this year looks different. The GCSE pass rate at A* to C is up by just 0.8%, and there is an equally modest rise in the proportion of candidates getting the highest A* or A grades. In last week&apos;s A-levels, the overall pass rate was up slightly on last year, but the proportion of A-grades (including the new A*) plateaued for the first time in 15 years. The apparent stalling of grade inflation has been accompanied by a change in the political climate. Under Labour, the annual improvement in results was seen as testament to the government&apos;s investment in education. But Michael Gove, the education secretary, attacked Labour&apos;s record by focusing on international rankings that appear to show that England has plummeted in comparison with other countries. In a statement last year, the government said: &quot;In just nine years we have dropped from seventh to 25th in reading, eighth to 27th in mathematics and fourth to 16th in science. This is despite England spending far more on education than comparable nations such as Germany.&quot; This line of attack is questionable \u2013 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, on whose data it is based, warns against making comparisons between the latest data and figures gathered nearly a decade ago. A Durham University study said grade inflation was a very real phenomenon over the past two decades, particularly at A-level. The 2008 study said: &quot;Candidates of comparable ability are being awarded higher grades each year, both at A-level and at GCSE. From 1988 to 2007, achievement levels at A-level have risen by an average of just over two grades in each subject considered in the research.&quot; The study found that in maths, results had risen by more than 3.5 grades. The researchers compared standards achieved in exams with the outcome of aptitude tests over the last two decades, which measure pupils&apos; skills in subjects without testing their curriculum knowledge. Results published on Thursday showed that the GCSE success rate is still high compared with 1988, when the exams were introduced. Around three times as many pupils get the top A or A* grades now. Changes to GCSEs by the coalition \u2013 including the scrapping of modular exams and a sharper focus on grammar, spelling and punctuation \u2013 are expected to make exams tougher to pass. There are indications that examiners are paying close attention to political priorities. At the post-GCSE results press briefing, Ziggy Liaquat, head of exam board Edexcel, echoed one of Gove&apos;s favourite themes, saying: &quot;We ought to be looking at comparisons internationally \u2013 what 16-year-olds in countries like Finland and Singapore are able to do.&quot; Alan Smithers, director of the centre for education and employment research at the University of Buckingham, said: &quot;The government is sending out the message that you have to stand up for standards. They&apos;re beefing up Ofqual so exam boards come under closer scrutiny.

S&amp;P cut the United States&apos; prized AAA rating one notch to AA+ on 5 August, exacerbating a sell-off in global stock markets that had already been hit by Europe&apos;s growing sovereign debt crisis and fears of a renewed US recession. &quot;From our perspective, it&apos;s an oversimplification to say this was happening because of S&amp;P&apos;s downgrade,&quot; said David Beers, S&amp;P&apos;s global head of sovereign ratings, referring to criticism that the move caused volatility in the market. S&amp;P is one of three main firms that analyse the creditworthiness of businesses and sovereign states, along with rivals Moody&apos;s and Fitch. They have faced severe criticism for their failure to predict the credit crunch and subsequent bank insolvencies. S&amp;P&apos;s officials have said the US downgrade was mostly based on their view that politics in Washington has become too divisive to ensure more deficit-reduction measures are adopted next year. The US vice-president, Joe Biden, said he believed the downgrade was excessive and the resignation of the S&amp;P president, Deven Sharma, this week was recognition by the firm that it had been wrong to be overly cautious. World stocks, as measured by MSCI&apos;s All-Country World Index, have fallen more than 17% from their May high as markets lose faith in the ability of politicians in rich economies to tackle debt burdens. In Europe, investors are increasingly worried that eurozone leaders have been unable to contain the debt crisis that has swamped Greece, Portugal and Ireland and now threatens bigger, much harder to save economies such as Spain and Italy. Japan, meanwhile, with a public debt twice the size of the $3tn economy, is looking for its sixth leader in five years after prime minister Naoto Kan confirmed on Friday his intention to step down. &quot;We&apos;re waiting to see if the governments can get their act together and address both the short-term and long-term issues,&quot; Beers told journalists at a press conference in Singapore, referring to developed countries in general. He added that monetary and fiscal tools that could be used to boost sluggish economic growth would be of limited use if households in rich nations continued to focus on reducing their own debt rather than spending. &quot;One of the lessons that we&apos;re perhaps learning from this crisis, and this applies to many countries, not just the US, is the limits of what these sorts of fiscal and monetary policies can achieve,&quot; Beers said. S&amp;P,also said that the outlook for Asian sovereigns was stable, but was showing some downside risks.

Our Dying Planet: An Ecologist&apos;s View of the Crisis We Face. 2011. University of California Press. Hardbound: 339 pages. Price: $34.95 U.S. [Amazon UK; Amazon US]. SUMMARY: Coral reefs are on track to become the first ecosystem actually eliminated from the planet. So says leading ecologist Peter F. Sale in this crash course on the state of the planet. Sale draws from his own extensive work on coral reefs, and from recent research by other ecologists, to explore the many ways we are changing the earth and to explain why it matters. Weaving into the narrative his own firsthand field experiences around the world, Sale brings ecology alive while giving a solid understanding of the science at work behind today&apos;s pressing environmental issues. He delves into topics including overfishing, deforestation, biodiversity loss, use of fossil fuels, population growth, and climate change while discussing the real consequences of our growing ecological footprint. Most important, this passionately written book emphasizes that a gloom-and-doom scenario is not inevitable, and as Sale explores alternative paths, he considers the ways in which science can help us realize a better future.IAN&apos;S RECOMMENDATION: A must-read for those that care about the planet Earth.   .

One is the incongruous sight of Libyan rebels advancing on Tripoli wearing replica shirts, underlining the global reach of the Premier League champions. Second, fleeting shots of United players donning tracksuit tops bearing the DHL brand, for which the logistics firm was prepared to pay an extraordinary \u00a310m a year. Third is the sight of Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s youthful side demolishing Arsenal 8-2, as if to send a signal about the club&apos;s ongoing ability to compete with the cream of Europe on the field. After being put on a &quot;fast track&quot; by the Singapore stock exchange it is believed the Glazers, who bought the club in a \u00a3790m debt-financed deal in May 2005, are preparing to launch the initial public offering (IPO) prospectus and roadshow that will market the idea of owning a minority stake in the club to Asian investors. Some senior City figures are cautious about whether institutional investors will be interested but believe that will not stop the issue being fully subscribed. While United would not comment, sources in Asia suggest the goal remains to raise up to $1bn (\u00a3614m) by floating a stake of up to 30% in the club. Other sources close to the discussions have confirmed that the float will involve a dual share-class structure that waters down the voting rights of those who buy them and allows the Glazers to maintain control. United fans already well versed in the finer points of UK takeover law, media ownership rules, leveraged buyouts and the junk bond market, must now bone up on the regulations of a fast-growing Singaporean stock exchange desperate to attract globally recognised brands. Since buying the club, the Glazers have engaged in a series of complicated financial manoeuvres in order to respond to events, not least the global downturn. They were forced to refinance their initial borrowings with bank loans and high-interest &quot;payment in kind&quot; (Pik) instruments. The \u00a3500m bank debt was paid off with the proceeds of the 2010 bond issue, under the rationale that it offered more long-term certainty. The Glazers pressed on even though it sparked a huge wave of protest and came with huge one-off costs attached that pushed the club to a pre-tax loss of \u00a379.6m last year. Fears that the Glazers would suck upwards of \u00a3100m out of the club to pay off the still spiralling \u00a3240m Piks were never borne out. Protesters claim it was due to their pressure, United insiders insist it was never on the agenda. Then it emerged the cash had been found to repay the Piks from a mystery source, removing them from the balance sheet of United&apos;s holding company. Many believe they were merely refinanced at one step removed and suspect those loans could be paid off with some of the money raised by the float. Now it appears they went through all that pain only to change course 17 months later, using the proceeds from the IPO \u2013 with all the attendant charges and scrutiny that will attract \u2013 to pay down the bond debt. Meanwhile, persistent takeover talk suggesting a bid from Qatar has come to naught. The suspicion was that they would not meet the Glazers&apos; \u00a32bn-plus asking price. If they get the IPO away at the figures suggested, it would set a market price at or around that level. Singapore has been chosen, according to those close to the deal, because it better reflects Manchester United&apos;s pan-Asian success story. Analysts say that if the larger Hong Kong exchange had been chosen then there might have been more focus on the relative failure of Premier League clubs to crack China, given issues with piracy and the march of the NBA. As well as paying down debt \u2013 a calculation that must be calibrated so as not to affect the share price too much \u2013 the proceeds of the float will be used to further grow their Asian commercial operation. But another reason is potentially as significant. Those taking up the offer will have to buy one non-voting share for every voting share. Such a dual share structure is frowned upon by many institutional investors in the UK and was a feature of recent criticism of News Corp by shareholders at the height of the hacking scandal. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: &quot;From an investor&apos;s point of view, the reason you wouldn&apos;t favour a dual share structure is because you would not put capital into something that didn&apos;t mirror the same level of control. It is highly unusual to do so in the UK market.&quot; Respected corporate governance consultancy Pensions Investment Research Consultants said it &quot;approves of the &apos;one share, one vote&apos; structure for companies&apos; share capital, and generally disapproves of dual class stock structures which have varying voting and dividend payments rights&quot;. A spokesman added: &quot;In our view, shareowners who have the same financial commitment to the company should have the same rights. Where a company is creating a new class of shares, or seeking an increase in the number of shares of the class of stock that has superior voting rights, we will usually oppose the capital restructuring.&quot; Such dual structures have generally been used by family-owned companies looking to raise money but retain control \u2013 see News Corp, Daily Mail &amp; General Trust \u2013 or by dotcom businesses so sure of their appeal that they can afford to do so \u2013 see Google. Sources argue the family need to retain control due to the peculiar nature of a football club&apos;s business. Long-term investment decisions may not be in the best immediate interests of the shareholders, they say, and decisive action is often required in the transfer market. Ferguson has previously praised the Glazers for their swift decision making, citing Wayne Rooney&apos;s pay negotiations as one example. But it is hard to see how that would change if a minority stake was sold. To outsiders, it looks like a means of maximising returns while retaining control. For those who have long protested against the Glazers, it puts the success of the share issue in doubt. &quot;The whole thing is looking a bit precarious especially if the rumours of non-voting shares turn out to be true. They were already pushing for a really ambitious valuation so I can&apos;t see how that looks attractive to any smart investor and we have no reason to believe the Asian market investors are any less smart than those in the UK,&quot; the Manchester United Supporters Trust chief executive, Duncan Drasdo, said. &quot;As you&apos;ll be a minority investor in a company under their control you can only be looking at it from a direct return on investment point of view. It&apos;s difficult to see how it will be as attractive as the bonds as an investment. What&apos;s the advantage to the club? If they offer higher-yielding non-voting shares is that any better than the bond debt for the club?&quot; But others, including some of those involved in the ultimately ill-fated Red Knights takeover bid, believe that the Glazers will attract enough interest. There were also doubts ahead of the bond issue about whether it would succeed \u2013 in the end it was twice oversubscribed. It has left the supporters groups that have protested against the Glazer regime, a campaign that reached its high point at a Champions League tie against Milan where an Old Trafford swathed in green and gold rocked to chants of &quot;Love United, hate the Glazers&quot;, in a tricky position. Since then a combination of success on the field, with another Premier League trophy and a third Champions League final in four years, and the ability of Ferguson to fashion another youthful, exciting side on a relatively modest budget has dulled the atmosphere of rebellion. While large pockets of resistance remain outside Old Trafford, at the first two home matches of the season it has been notable that the free red scarves doled out by new sponsor DHL far outnumbered any rare sightings of the green and gold that came to signify the movement at the point at which a takeover by the so-called &quot;Red Knights&quot; looked a realistic possibility. On the one hand, they are keen to see the debt paid down and for the club&apos;s ownership base to be widened. On the other, the Glazers look set to retain overall control and eventually walk away with a handsome profit. Other troubling consequences could include the fact that the rights issue may give the Glazers an excuse to start paying themselves dividends, something that MUST and other protest groups campaigned long and hard against when the bond issue was launched. &quot;Our first priority is for them to pay down all of the debt using the IPO. That is the biggest issue for many supporters. I don&apos;t see it as the club&apos;s debt because it was their acquisition debt,&quot; Drasdo said.&quot;I think the IPO is the first phase of their exit, but it is the crucial phase in that whatever happens with the debt at this stage will solidify the position for the future and whoever is holding any residual debt will be responsible for the interest and ultimately repaying it. The important thing is to clear the debt first, then we can look at widening share ownership.&quot; The Glazers have been blessed with Ferguson&apos;s ability to reshape his squad and the acumen of the chief executive, David Gill, at a time when they have had to juggle their finances. At the same time, the club&apos;s London-based commercial unit, overseen by the chief of staff, Edward Woodward, has helped vastly increase revenues. When full-year results are released on Thursday, they will show United&apos;s commercial revenues have exceeded \u00a3100m for the first time. They will also reveal record operating profits of more than \u00a3100m and, in contrast to last year&apos;s record loss, a net profit. Club executives are expected to argue the figures, together with a healthy bank balance, bear out their claims that they can weather the \u00a345m interest repayments on the \u00a3500m bond debt and continue to compete on and off the pitch. Historically, overseas income contributed just 3% of the club&apos;s revenue. But that underplays the extent to which overseas customers have driven the growth of media and commercial revenues. As the amount brought in by the Premier League for overseas broadcasts has risen exponentially, so too has the amount that the biggest clubs in the world can charge to be associated with them and reach those eyeballs. Manchester United hold details on 10 million fans across the world and have 1 million credit customers in South Korea alone. More than 22 million might watch a live match in Indonesia, global linear TV figures are up 36% on last year, and the club claims to have 333 million fans worldwide and 190 million in Asia alone. The \u00a340m over four years brought in by the DHL could just be the start, is the bullish claim. There is a well-founded belief that existing contracts with Nike (\u00a323m) and Aon (\u00a320m) can be doubled in value when they come up for renegotiation and new categories can be created in a range of regional markets. But the central point of the campaigners \u2013 that \u00a3434m in interest payments and fees has flowed out of the club since 2005 that could have been invested in players, keeping down ticket prices or facilities \u2013 stands. They continue to hope this might be the beginning of the end for the Glazer regime. &quot;I just look at what is taken out and what debt is on the club. The thing that drives people is whether there is an opportunity for change. When the bid from the Red Knights failed to materialise in 2010 the fervour died down,&quot; Drasdo said. &quot;What might be interesting is to see how this flotation changes perceptions in that respect. People will see that this is the beginning of an opportunity and it is surely a matter of when rather than if they sell the rest of their shares and to whom.&quot; Meanwhile, those marketing the IPO will argue United have barely scratched the surface of their commercial potential. Much will depend on whether they can persuade investors to believe them. A sponsorship deal with Malaysian crisp brand Mister Potato, yet to be announced and one of dozens that have been sealed since the 2008 overhaul of commercial operations to bring names from Concha y Toro to Kumho Tyres on board, will be part of that story. It is yet another reminder of the changing nature of Premier League business models that a Malaysian snack, a Chilean vineyard and a South Korean tyre manufacturer are as important, if not more so, to United&apos;s future success as those streaming on to the Stretford End."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/aug/30/manchester-united-record-operating-profits", "sentences": ["Manchester United will this week report record operating profits of more than \u00a3100m and are set to use Thursday&apos;s financial results as a springboard for a bid to raise up to $1bn (\u00a3614m) by floating a minority stake in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-30T20:27:31Z", "title": "Manchester United set to post record profits before Asia flotation", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Business", "The Glazer family", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Manchester United will this week report record operating profits of more than \u00a3100m and are set to use Thursday&apos;s financial results as a springboard for a bid to raise up to $1bn (\u00a3614m) by floating a minority stake in Singapore. An increase in revenues, understood to have topped \u00a3300m for the first time from last year&apos;s figure of \u00a3286.4m, has been driven by new overseas sponsorship deals that are likely to have pushed commercial income above \u00a3100m for the first time. That figure does not include the \u00a310m a year DHL training kit sponsorship deal or other recently signed contracts. The club is likely to point out that operating profits have more than doubled from \u00a343m since the Glazers took over in 2005. In contrast to last year&apos;s record losses of \u00a383.3m, driven by one-off costs related to a \u00a3526m bond issue, the club is expected to record a net profit for the year ending June 2011. But campaigners against the Glazer regime will point to the impact of \u00a345m in annual interest repayments on the club&apos;s bottom line. They calculate that \u00a3434m has flowed out of the club in interest, fees and debt repayment since 2005. The chief executive, David Gill, has repeatedly insisted the club can shoulder the interest burden and still compete for the best players. For the ambitious flotation scheme to succeed when it goes ahead in mid-October, Manchester United will have to overcome doubts about the way it is structured. It is understood that the club will pursue a dual share structure, whereby investors will have to purchase one &quot;non-voting&quot; share for every voting share, allowing the Glazers to raise funds while staying in control of the club. Sources argue it is modelled on the US sports model, where clubs in the NFL and the NBA must have a single designated owner, and will allow for strategic long-term planning and swift decision making. &quot;This structure works best for the club, Manchester United as a company and shareholders and the evidence is the club&apos;s results in the last five years,&quot; a source said. &quot;It is what works well in football given the rapid nature of decisions required and specialist knowledge of the football transfer market.&quot; But corporate governance experts said it was out of step with best practice and increasingly frowned upon by investors. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: &quot;Investors in the UK market in particular, and to a lesser extent across Europe, do not favour dual share structures. There is a common idea of one share, one vote, so that your economic interests are the same as your voting interests.&quot; Corporate governance consultancy PIRC said it &quot;approves of the &apos;one share, one vote&apos; structure for companies share capital, and generally disapproves of dual class stock structures which have varying voting and dividend payments rights&quot;. A spokesman added: &quot;In our view, shareowners who have the same financial commitment to the company should have the same rights. Where a company is creating a new class of shares, or seeking an increase in the number of shares of the class of stock that has superior voting rights, we will usually oppose the capital restructuring.&quot; At the height of the hacking scandal, there was much criticism from shareholders of News Corporation&apos;s dual share structure. Anne Simpson, the corporate governance chief at the California Public Employees&apos; Retirement System (CalPERS), said last month that not having one vote for each share was &quot;a corruption of the corporate governance system&quot;. She added: &quot;We believe that the control of a company should reflect its ownership. That&apos;s capitalism.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/31/stephen-bates-diary-alistair-darling", "sentences": ["Interesting to think\u00a0of champagne as a universal emollient for hurt feelings, but then she did come from a City background, and has returned to it with consultancy roles in Dubai and Singapore to add to several directorships."], "publicationDate": "2011-08-31T21:50:01Z", "title": "Stephen Bates diary", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news"], "article": "\u2022 Ah, the season of mellow fruitfulness draws on, nights close in, and that strange scraping sound we can hear is the knives of the political memoir season being sharpened.

Word is that John Sentamu, the archbishop of York \u2013 who has been severely ill with appendicitis this summer \u2013 would be ambitious for the job, a thought to make many bishops blanch, since they rate his abilities rather lower than he does himself. And it is said that Richard Chartres, bishop of London and third in line of seniority, might back Sentamu if only to make sure he is not appointed, and Chartres himself would then gain the primacy. Positively Trollopean and surely wrong-headed, except that it is being circulated by some senior clergy. Such febrility is anyway surely unnecessary, as Rowan still has another nine years before he need retire and both Sentamu and Chartres are older than he is.

Blues&apos; payback for Yang Birmingham City&apos;s chairman Carson Yeung, pictured below, may have found himself in hot water with the Chinese authorities lately but it seems his club have forged strong links with the country&apos;s establishment in recent days. On Tuesday, Blues appointed as their deputy chairman Yang Yuezhou, who in the 1990s chaired two state-owned businesses in China. Yang is an elected member of a major political body in China, the Chinese People&apos;s Political Consultative Conference. Joining him as an executive director is Hua Yong. A Birmingham International Holdings announcement said he had &quot;worked in a nuclear industrial development corporation in the People&apos;s Republic of China from September 1986 to March 2005, mainly responsible for its import business&quot;. These men appear to have been entrusted with major or sensitive roles within the Chinese state apparatus, which may have implications for the club in future. One factor that will certainlyaffect Birmingham is that Yang has loaned the club almost \u00a36.3m from his British Virgin Islands investment company. Over the course of the two-year term of the deal Blues will have to repay Yang his investment as well as a further \u00a31.5m in interest alone.

The results show revenues rose to a record \u00a3331.3m in the year ending June 2011, an increase of 16% on the previous year&apos;s total, as Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s side won the Premier League and reached the European Cup final. Ahead of next month&apos;s planned flotation of a minority stake in Singapore, the club delivered a record operating profit (before interest, amortisation and exceptional items) of \u00a3110.9m, a figure that topped \u00a3100m for the sixth year in a row. But United paid out \u00a351.7m in interest payments on the \u00a3526m bond scheme that replaced bank loans in 2010. The club spent almost \u00a364m buying back some of those bonds in the past year. In 2009-10, the club posted pre-tax losses of \u00a379.2m, largely as a result of write-downs and one-off charges relating to the bond issue. They have now shifted to a different accounting standard, using IFRS rather than the UK GAAP standard, under which that loss would have been \u00a314.9m. The figures show a sharp rise in overall costs, up to \u00a3220.5m from \u00a3185.2m the previous year, including a 16.1% increase in staff costs as a result of increased player wages and bonuses. However, the crucial wages-to-turnover ration remained at a healthy 46%. Those who have campaigned long and hard against the Glazers&apos; ownership model will point to the \u00a351.7m paid in interest as evidence that is still acting as a drag on the club&apos;s finances.  Andy Green, who blogs on United&apos;s finances as Andersred, has calculated that a total of \u00a3478m has been spent on servicing debt at the club since 2005. That figure comprises \u00a3373m in interest and fees and \u00a3105m repaying debt. But United executives are likely to point to continued success on the field and strong growth. Net debt stands at its lowest level since the Glazers bought the club in a \u00a3790m leveraged deal in 2005. With \u00a3150.6m cash in the bank at the end of the financial year, and \u00a363.8m of debt repurchased during the year, the net debt stood at \u00a3308.3m at the end of June. The amount in the bank will now have decreased by around \u00a350m after the signings of David de Gea, Ashley Young and Phil Jones. Upward pressure on wages, in part due to Wayne Rooney&apos;s \u00a3180,000-a-week deal, and bonuses paid to players, saw staff costs rise by 16%. However, since the accounts were filed, several high earners have been moved off the wage bill. &quot;It&apos;s a continued improvement year after year, but that improvement has been driven by Ferguson and the players,&quot; the United Supporters Trust chief executive Duncan Drasdo said. &quot;The growth in revenue is positive, but it&apos;s what happens to that income. Does it stay in the club or go out in interest, bond repayments or payments to the owners? That&apos;s why the Initial Public Offering is potentially such an important opportunity.

It provides the mouth with a steady duty so the brain can deal with other things. Alex Ferguson&apos;s touchline guppy-mouthing helps him concentrate on the game, and a Bavarian school encourages children to chew gum in order to help them concentrate. Humans have chewed for pleasure and leisure for a long time. In 2007, a British archaeology student unearthed a 5,000-year-old gum derived from a Finnish birch tree. The Greeks chewed mastic gum, a substance that gave our language its most expressive word for chewing. Native Americans made a resin from spruce sap and shared their technique with the arriving Europeans.  Modern chewing gum was born in the United States when an itinerant pedlar named John B Curtis developed a sweetened and flavoured product which he called State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum. William Wrigley introduced his own version at the end of the 19th century and his company grew to be the largest chewing gum manufacturer in the world, with revenues today of almost $5.5bn. When American soldiers fought in Europe during the first world war they carried packs of gum in their rations, bringing the habit to the Old World. Almost all gum these days is made from a synthetic rubber instead of the saps and resins of the past. The manufacturing process is hypnotically fascinating. The rubber is just that, the same stuff that&apos;s used to make clingfilm and inner tubes. Peppersmith, founded by two former Innocent employees a couple of years ago, makes a natural and nicely branded gum from a traditional source, but even it sticks to the street. The litter from gum and its inability to biodegrade caused Lee Kuan Yew&apos;s Singaporean government notoriously to ban it in 1992. Although this injunction was partially lifted for medical and nicotine gums after the state signed a free trade agreement with the US in 2003, it remains illegal to bring even small quantities of ordinary chewing gum into Singapore, rendering it unsuitable territory for artist Ben Wilson, who beautifies splats of gum by using them as miniature canvasses. At the Texas State Fair over Labor Day weekend, &quot;deep fried bubblegum&quot; will make its first appearance. In reality this is deep-fried, bubblegum-flavoured marshmallow, which prompts the question: what exactly is bubblegum flavour? Contrary to the old wives&apos; tale, the more usual gums do not stay lodged inside you if swallowed. Those who make a habit of swallowing gum may end up with a stomach blockage that requires surgery, but such people are thankfully rare. According to Peppersmith, people swallow up to 75% of every piece of gum they &quot;eat&quot; \u2013 many of the chemicals enter the body even if the mottled scrap of rubber ends up on the pavement."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/sep/02/3", "sentences": ["  Mystery Bird photographed in Singapore, a southeast Asian city-state off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula.", "[I will identify this bird for you in 48 hours] Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 28 August 2011 (with permission) [velociraptorize].Nikon D7000   This gorgeous Singaporean mystery bird resembles dead leaves -- until it flies!"], "publicationDate": "2011-09-02T15:30:00Z", "title": "Today's mystery bird for you to identify #birds #MysteryBirds", "tags": ["Science", "Zoology"], "article": "  Mystery Bird photographed in Singapore, a southeast Asian city-state off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula.

For some in Britain, the empire was much less about governing the ethnically &quot;other&quot;, than about community with fellow British subjects in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada. There were parts of the world, such as Argentina, which were never coloured a cartographic red, but which were nonetheless dominated for long periods by the British. And as to whether the British imperial project force-fed modernity or its antithesis, confusingly it did both, sometimes in the same territory. By the late 1800s, New Zealand was a world-leader in social welfare programmes and women&apos;s suffrage. Its white settlers also used brute force to exterminate large numbers of Maoris. The protean nature of this empire \u2013 as well as the passions it arouses \u2013 makes it easy for historians and writers to reach widely differing conclusions about its dynamics and significance. There is always a temptation to cherry-pick from myriad imperial moments and places in order to advance a particular case. In this very well written, lucid and often perceptive book, Kwasi Kwarteng&apos;s aim is to reconstruct &quot;what the British empire was really like, from the point of view of the rulers, the administrators who made it possible&quot;. In the process, he also offers a conservative critique of the revived enthusiasm, evident on both sides of the Atlantic, for invading and fighting &quot;small&quot; wars in non-western countries, ostensibly for their own good. He focuses on six imperial sites, most of them consolidated after 1870, when Britain began to face stiffer competition from other, rival powers: Iraq, Sudan, Burma, Nigeria, Kashmir and Hong Kong. In none of them, as Kwarteng describes, was London much (or at all) concerned to advance liberal democracy; and in most of them the quality of its rule helped to store up trouble for the future. In Kashmir, where the population was and is mainly Muslim, the British propped up a Hindu ruling house, which they recognised from the outset was unpopular and oppressive. In Burma the monarchy was abolished after 1885, and the country reduced to a province of British India. In Iraq, conversely, the British created a new monarchy &quot;without any antecedent foundation&quot;; while in Nigeria, different regions and tribal groupings were ruthlessly and imperfectly amalgamated. Kwarteng attributes much of this to a lack of adequate central planning, and a consequent over-reliance on the &quot;men on the spot&quot;, the members of Britain&apos;s imperial class. He supplies incisive pen portraits of some of these individuals: the fanatic, such as George Gordon, who believed that the Garden of Eden had been located in the Seychelles; hard men such as George Goldie, &quot;born to dominate and impress&quot;; and worthy spirits such as Sir Mark Young, who survived being a Japanese prisoner of war, and tried unavailingly to introduce measures of democratic reform in Hong Kong. More broadly, Kwarteng confirms how narrowly recruited Britain&apos;s imperial administrators were, how many of them were funnelled through the public schools and Oxbridge. Between 1902 and 1956, 70% of the Sudan Political Service, long regarded as the elite of British African administration, were graduates of Oxford or Cambridge. It followed that \u2013 with some few exceptions such as Gertrude Bell \u2013 the upper echelons of British colonial administration was a very masculine world. Sudan, it was said, was &quot;a land for energetic bachelors&quot;. Yet Kwarteng examines Britain&apos;s empire too much through the characteristics and quirks of individuals. At one level, this leads him to downplay those international and economic pressures that always shaped this global system of power. At another level, we learn little about the ideas of these people, as distinct from their exclusivity and frequent snobberies. The conviction of many colonial officials that stable government was more important than self-government rested on a set of political, legal and religious ideas that were also influential within Britain itself. It is unlikely to have been a complete coincidence that the era during which most of these six overseas &quot;possessions&quot; were seized was also one in which the franchise in Britain became almost the narrowest in Europe. The democratic deficit in parts of the empire, and indeed in late 19th and early 20th century Britain itself, is not necessarily a proof of a lack of modernity. Kwarteng wants to challenge those like Niall Ferguson who argue that British imperium &quot;made the modern world&quot;. The empire could not be &quot;further removed&quot;, he insists, &quot;from the world we now inhabit&quot;. But one has only got to visit Singapore, say, to see how political authoritarianism can work side by side with extreme economic and technological advance. By the same token, some of the oldest British imperial devices \u2013 such as helping to prop up corrupt rulers in order to secure control over minerals and trade routes \u2013 are still in use today, in regions of American and Chinese influence and investment. Modernity is a shifting entity, not easily defined. Exactly the same is true of empire.

Once the dust cloud \u2013 visible 20 miles away \u2013 had settled, all that remained was a cathedral-sized mound of rubble and over 3m cubic metres of air. In the subsequent decade, New Yorkers have instinctively turned to the twin towers to orientate themselves, only to find nothing there. But over the last few months, and with the 10th anniversary of the 21st century&apos;s most notorious event imminent, a new structure has started to stretch upwards, piercing the Manhattan skyline, its roof sprouting cranes like the leaves of a young plant. The building already stands boldly above the others around it and it is only two-thirds complete. With every week that passes, it is claiming its status as the pre-eminent Manhattan landmark. By early next year it will supersede the Empire State Building in height. Even now it draws the eye, particularly at night when its construction lights twinkle like a brooch from Tiffany. This week the tower stands at 80 floors and counting. It is going up at the rate of a floor a week, the product of 24/7 activity by a team of 1,100 workers. By the time it opens, it will be 104 floors; a beacon will take it to the historically resonant height of 1,776ft (541 metres). Up on the 55th floor of the emerging skyscraper \u2013 once called Freedom Tower but now known by the more temperate name 1 World Trade Centre \u2013 the stunning views are ample evidence of the building&apos;s potential. You can see way across the water, beyond Ellis Island and Lady Liberty to New Jersey, while below us, the memorial gardens are being assembled in honour of those who died. &quot;This is the worst disaster in our country&apos;s history and we&apos;re up 55 storeys and climbing,&quot; says Lee Ielpi, a New York firefighter who knows more about Ground Zero than most. For the past 10 years he has spent most of his waking life here. He arrived at the site soon after the towers fell and for the next nine months he worked 12-hour days atop the rubble searching for bodies. After the site was cleared, he founded a tribute centre that houses a 9/11 exhibition and works with bereaved families. Ielpi&apos;s son Jonathan, also a firefighter, was called out with the Queens-based Squad 288 after the first plane struck and he was in the south tower helping people escape when it came down. His body was discovered three months to the day after the disaster; Ielpi carried his son out with his own hands. Ielpi rattles off the key statistics, by now as familiar to him as his son&apos;s name. &quot;On this site 2,749 people were murdered in a matter of 102 minutes. There are still 1,125 people missing, 10 years later. Only 174 whole bodies were found. One of them was Jonathan.&quot; Later, he says: &quot;People ask me, &apos;It&apos;s been 10 years, what&apos;s it like?&apos; Well, it&apos;s like I haven&apos;t seen my son for 10 years. Nothing more than that.&quot; Ielpi takes us on a tour of the 16-acre site, which, on 12 September will be opened to the public for the first time. We walk around the footprint of the south tower and come to a stop in front of an oak tree, one of 415 planted at Ground Zero. &quot;This is the first time I&apos;ve seen that guy blooming,&quot; Ielpi says. &quot;I see it and I think of my son. Twenty nine. Married with two little boys. Loved helping people. Knew where he was going on the 11th, knew what he had to do. So yeah, I look at this tree, and this is nice.&quot; Jonathan&apos;s name is etched in a bronze panel that runs around the four sides of the footprint of the south tower. Also named here are the other victims \u2013 those on the aircraft, the emergency workers, and the victims of the Pentagon and Pennsylvania crashes. A second tribute at the north tower bears the names of those who died there as well as those killed in the first terror attack on the World Trade Centre, on 26 February 1993. From Sunday both footprints will be transformed into massive reflective pools with water falling 30 feet from their edges. &quot;I can&apos;t tell you how powerful it is,&quot; Ielpi says. &quot;I&apos;ve stood by that edge and listened as the water cascades down. If you want to hear somebody, there&apos;s a good likelihood you&apos;re going to hear somebody.&quot; Standing in the middle of Ground Zero, you can now start to appreciate the fusion of commemoration and rebirth that is gathering pace. Next year the 9/11 Memorial Museum will open, running underneath the plaza and housing many artefacts from the twin towers, including two enormous tridents from the north tower that are already in place. In 2013 the fourth tower on the site, a 60-floor skyscraper designed by Fumihiko Maki that is now going up, is scheduled to open, followed in January 2014 by 1 World Trade Centre. Towers two and three, by the British architects Lord (Norman) Foster and Lord (Richard) Rogers respectively, have yet to have firm completion dates. The relief that there is something finally happening at the site is palpable. To have had nothing to show a decade after the attacks would have been an enormous embarrassment for New York and for America. Part of the reason for the painfully slow progress has been physical \u2013 the World Trade Centre was built on more than 20 metres of landfill on the Hudson river which, added to the maze of commuter and subway lines that runs beneath it, makes for a fiendishly complicated infrastructure. But a less acceptable cause of delay has been the messy and at times ugly interaction between the countless entities that have vied to control aspects of the project, from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that owns the site, to the private developer Larry Silverstein who leases much of it, through New York city, the railway and subway authorities, insurance companies, local businesses and residents of Lower Manhattan and, of course, the relatives of those who died. Paul Goldberger, the New Yorker&apos;s architecture critic, who has tracked the project over the last decade, says the rebuilding has been beset by &quot;enormous battles between all the participants who could not agree on what to do, how to do it and who should pay for it&quot;. At its lowest point, the paralysis that took hold after 9/11 made a mockery of New York&apos;s reputation as the can-do city where anything is possible. &quot;That&apos;s a myth left over from another age. As New York has become older and more mature, it has lost the we&apos;ll-do-it-no-matter-what attitude that it pioneered but that now exists in places like Dubai or Singapore.&quot; Goldberger has mixed feelings about the redevelopment as it takes shape. He praises the memorial features of the project, with the footprints of the twin towers as their centrepiece, which he thinks will honour the victims in a moving and important way. But he harbours doubts about the buildings that will surround the memorial, particularly 1 World Trade Centre. Designed by the American architect David Childs, it has gone through several incarnations, each one more conventional than the last. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a good building, but no more than that,&quot; Goldberger says. &quot;We lost the opportunity to build a great building by being overly conservative in the design, overly concerned with security. It saddens me that we didn&apos;t take this opportunity to reassert American leadership. America is where the skyscraper began. We could have taken this piece of land, in the city of skyscrapers, and built the greenest, most exciting and innovative skyscraper that will show a whole new direction. We didn&apos;t do that.&quot; Despite the reservations of the city&apos;s pre-eminent architecture critic, commercially 1 World Trade Centre looks set on a path towards success. Tara Stacom, vice chairman of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the property firm handling the leasing of the office space, predicts it will be the &quot;most important building in the western hemisphere \u2013 it&apos;s going to be the coolest, hippest place to work and live.&quot; She says a range of media and law firms, entertainment companies and financial businesses have expressed interest in taking up space, including some from Europe and the UK. In the biggest deal to date, the magazine publisher Conde Nast has signed up for one million square feet \u2013 more than a third of the building. When the idea of another vast tower, which on completion will be the tallest in the Americas, was first suggested, sceptics argued that it would never be built because nobody would ever want to sit in an office high in the New York sky for fear of a repeat attack. But Stacom insists that has not been a worry for prospective clients. &quot;When we tour the site it&apos;s all about what an incredible place this is going to be.&quot; Back at Ground Zero, overlooking the pool at the south tower where his son died, Lee Ielpi says it&apos;s time to move on. &quot;There are some family members \u2013 and you can understand it \u2013 who can&apos;t get beyond 9/11. Their loved ones were taken away in a horrible way. But you have to get on. You never forget, but if you don&apos;t get on you&apos;re going to be trapped.&quot; Ielpi believes that when the rebuilding is finally finished, it will radiate its message far beyond the limits of Manhattan, of New York or even of the US. &quot;We&apos;re putting a memorial here, a museum here, we are going to remember our loved ones, and then we are going to surround it with beautiful buildings to replace those that were destroyed through hatred. We&apos;re going to show the terrorists that through our resilience \u2013 ours, as a world&apos;s \u2013 we can do it. We will overcome the obstructions that come along.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/sep/05/cambridge-tops-league-table-universities", "sentences": ["The highest ranking Asian universities are Hong Kong at 22, Tokyo at 25, and the National University of Singapore at 28."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-04T23:05:00Z", "title": "Cambridge tops league table of world's best universities", "tags": ["University of Cambridge", "Higher education", "Education", "US news", "World news", "UK news", "Harvard University", "MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology"], "article": "Cambridge has topped a league table of the world&apos;s best universities, with Harvard and MIT ranked second and third. The annual QS World University Rankings remains dominated by US institutions, which took 13 of the top 20 places.

The only university in the top 20 which is not from the English speaking world is the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Zurich, at 18.

Individual attention is one of the key attractions of the Oxbridge tutorial system.&quot; Government and private funding for technology-focused research is eroding the dominance of traditional comprehensive universities, compilers of the rankings said. The average age of the top 100 institutions has dropped by seven years since 2010, reflecting the emergence of newer specialist institutions, QS said. Nine UK universities were in the top 50, and 17 in the top 100. Sowter said: &quot;This year&apos;s QS rankings show that the worst effects of the funding cuts have yet to be felt by UK universities. &quot;However, pre-emptive redundancies and increased student intake have led to worse student to faculty ratios relative to their international peers. &quot;Of the 37 UK universities in the top 300, 34 fared worse in this measure than in 2010.&quot; Tuition fee information has been published for the first time alongside the 2011 world rankings.

Starting this week in Chicago, the US will be hosting the first major trade negotiations since the &quot;Battle in Seattle&quot; World Trade Organisation talks came here in 1999. This occasion is for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with a wide range of industrialised and developing Pacific Rim countries. As part of his plan to revive the US economy and create jobs, Obama claims he will be unveiling &quot;a trade agreement for the 21st century&quot;. Ironically, though, he will be pushing the same &quot;Nafta-style&quot; trade pacts he campaigned against, and to howls of protest from his own electoral base. Let us not forget what he said: &quot;I voted against Cafta, never supported Nafta, and will not support Nafta-style trade agreements in the future,&quot; Obama told Ohio voters (pdf) in 2008. &quot;While Nafta gave broad rights to investors, it paid only lip service to the rights of labor and the importance of environmental protection.&quot;  &quot;Lip service&quot; would be a good way to describe the reforms in US trade policy under Obama. As co-chairs of a three-country task force to reform Nafta, we can say that not only do the administration&apos;s TPP proposals fail to reform most of Nafta&apos;s worst provisions, they actually take several steps backward. From an economic perspective, the TPP would be the largest US trade agreement since Nafta, since it involves not only developing countries (Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore), but also four OECD countries (Chile, the United States, Australia and New Zealand). But while some argue that this makes the TPP &quot;the single most important US trade initiative&quot;, a UN study (pdf) points out that the economic impact of the TPP will be quite limited because most of the participants already have bilateral trade agreements with TPP counterparts.  &quot;Lip service&quot; would be a good way to describe the reforms in US trade policy under Obama. In 2007, congressional Democrats won some minor but important reforms to post-Nafta trade agreements, in the areas of labour enforcement, environmental protection and intellectual property rules. Obama hasn&apos;t even held onto these in current negotiations, giving up important language to allow easier access to generic medicines in the pending agreement with Korea. By all accounts, the administration won&apos;t put them in the TPP either. As one unnamed trade official told Inside US Trade, &quot;2007 was 2007, 2011 is 2011.&quot; US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton recently gave the TPP her own lip service in Hong Kong. There, she touted the TPP as setting &quot;a new high standard for multilateral free trade&quot;, one that could achieve &quot;sustainable, inclusive growth&quot;. Clinton alluded to the agreed 2007 protections on labour rights, the environment and intellectual property, then added that these &quot;21st-century&quot; US proposals actually are all about &quot;regulatory coherence&quot;. If that sounds to you like a sanitised term for deregulation, you&apos;re right. The &quot;21st-century trade agreement&quot; will not better balance the rights of multinational firms with the needs of the majority; rather, it will grant more rights to investors.  By all accounts, the US TPP negotiators continue to push for the controversial investor-state dispute provision, which allows multinationals to directly sue a foreign government for regulatory actions \u2013 rather than have such disputes be conducted by governments, as is the case at the WTO. The US-Australia free trade agreement does not include the investor-state investment provision, and the Australian government has indicated strongly that it will not consider such a provision for the TPP. No matter. What did Obama say in 2008 about no longer &quot;giving broad rights to investors&quot;? Then, with the power to sue other governments that try to regulate in hand, the US proposals would force trading partners to open their financial services sectors to the very companies that brought us the recent financial crisis. Such provisions fly in the face of recommendations on investment from a group of over 250 US and globally renowned economists, recommendations that merely echoed those from some of the members of President Obama&apos;s own state department panel named to review the US language. At this point, US proposals for the TPP hardly break from the Nafta mold, and many weaken or eliminate the few important advances we&apos;ve seen since Nafta in US trade proposals. Like Nafta, current US proposals fail to account for asymmetries among trading partners and restrict the ability of the US and its trading partners to provide the regulations that their democracies want to enable financial stability, economic growth and jobs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/11/renault-f1-team-makes-loss", "sentences": ["The team slumped from a \u00a34.8m after-tax profit the previous year, hit by an exodus of sponsors after it was charged in September 2009 with rigging the result of the Singapore Grand Prix."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-10T23:35:26Z", "title": "Renault Formula 1 team makes \u00a334m loss", "tags": ["Renault", "Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Sport"], "article": "The Renault Formula 1 team made a \u00a334.3m net loss in 2010, the French car manufacturer&apos;s last year as an F1 owner, according to its latest accounts.

Turnover in the year to 31\u00a0December 2010 was down 49% to \u00a382.2m, with the loss of the team&apos;s title sponsor, Dutch bank ING, alone accounting for an estimated \u00a341m. The team&apos;s world champion driver, Fernando Alonso, defected to Ferrari and Renault itself began to pull out. Luxembourg-based private equity firm Genii Capital bought a 75% stake in the team from Renault in December 2009 and then acquired the remaining 25% a year later. Renault does remain in F1 as an engine supplier to several teams. Alonso was paid an estimated \u00a312.5m annually and his departure is believed to helped the team&apos;s costs fall by 18% to \u00a3122.2m. He was replaced by the rapidly rising Polish star Robert Kubica, who steered the team to fifth in the standings last year, up from eighth in 2009. However, Kubica has not raced this year after being injured in a serious rally accident before the start of the season and his future, like that of the team, is unclear. The accounts state that the team is a going concern &quot;as it is anticipated that the owners will continue to support the operation of the company as a Formula 1 team for the foreseeable future&quot;. While Genii is currently the owner it is reportedly in discussion about selling the team, with the Lotus car company in pole position to get it.

Could these fervent fans have guaranteed him the win through enthusiasm and cheering alone, the victory would have belonged to the prancing horse at that very moment. But passion alone is not enough. The race was yellow-flagged after several cars collided at the first corner, restarted on lap four and one lap later the natural order was restored. Vettel retook the lead in a brave manoeuvre, putting two wheels on the grass at Curva Grande (to the sound of a silent circuit-wide shrug) and drove on to a flawless, uncomplicated victory. He was followed home by Jenson Button, who gave another great fightback performance to take second, with Alonso in third. Lewis Hamilton, who was fourth, toiled well and with care while stuck behind Michael Schumacherh, whose fifth placing meant the top five slots were all occupied by world champions. Uncomplicated it may have been but that is not to belittle Vettel or his team. Ferrari inflame the emotions of fans around the world and it has to be said there is little similar feeling for Red Bull. But over the weekend the team principal, Christian Horner, responded to dismissive remarks from the Ferrari principal, Stefano Domenicali, by pointedly remarking: &quot;I think we&apos;ve earned respect in the pit-lane.&quot; Which they have and which this emphatic win only reinforces. The victories here and at Spa, high speed, low-downforce circuits, both of which Horner has described as &quot;bogey&quot; tracks, prove that, while Red Bull may yet lack the heritage of their peers, they are, quite simply, an extraordinarily good motor racing team. Many point to the designer, Adrian Newey, as the source of the their success. McLaren&apos;s team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, likened him to a precious metal on Saturday, noting wryly that: &quot;Adrian is a scarce resource.&quot; All of which is true, to an extent. Red Bull&apos;s access to Newey meant he brought the packages to the car that finally let them face down Monza. It is not the whole story \u2013 witness the team&apos;s final pit stop here. With a comfortable lead it was still executed as if the race depended on it, in a dazzling 2.9sec. They have been doing this all season and when it is combined with Vettel&apos;s pace they are untouchable, a word Hamilton used to describe Vettel&apos;s speed in qualifying. Red Bull had gambled on using a shorter gear ratio for Vettel, limiting his top speed but hoping he would quickly find the greater-than-one-second gap that would prevent rivals from passing him using DRS. With the world champion in such form it proved a solid roll of the dice. After passing Alonso, he had three seconds on the Spaniard by lap seven and was under no threat from then on. It was a lead he would extend and consolidate to the chequered flag. Behind him both McLarens suffered. Button had a clutch problem, dropped to sixth and was relegated to seventh as Mark Webber passed him on the restart, where Hamilton too also struggled, jumped by Schumacher and dropped to fourth. Schumacher&apos;s straight-line speed proved difficult to counter and the wily former world champion gave Hamilton no room, indeed closing the door on him at Curva Grande allowed Button, who caught up quickly, to pass his team-mate and Schumacher in short order. Clearly feeling the circuit and the car well, Button also soon caught and passed Alonso to take second, a place he, too, would retain with relative ease but without threatening the gap to Vettel. Hamilton also finally cleared Schumacher at Ascari and began the chase for Alonso but although he had a clear track, there were no longer enough laps left to catch and pass him, while the Spaniard, whose team had struggled with the balance of the car all weekend, wrung all he could from the Ferrari to take the final podium place. &quot;It is the best podium in the world. The only thing that could make it better is probably wearing a red suit,&quot; said Vettel but this was no come\u2011and\u2011get\u2011me plea. Ferrari may have the passion but Vettel knows Red Bull have the pace and this was merely a driver wondering how experiencing even the finest moments may yet be improved. He might find out at the next grand prix after this, his eighth win of the season. If he takes the ninth in Singapore and Alonso finishes fourth or lower with Button and Webber third or lower \u2013 the 24-year-old will experience becoming the youngest double world champion in history."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/12/jenson-button-lewis-hamilton-mclaren", "sentences": ["The racing is still going to be bloody amazing like it has been for the last few races.&quot; He is currently on 167 points, 117 behind Red Bull&apos;s current world champion, Sebastian Vettel, who could claim the title at the next round in Singapore, and nine points ahead of Hamilton, who has never been beaten by a team-mate throughout his career."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-12T21:00:00Z", "title": "Title dream over but Jenson Button relishes battle with Lewis Hamilton", "tags": ["Jenson Button", "Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Formula One 2011", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Jenson Button has acknowledged that while the fight for the Formula One world championship is over, his battle with his McLaren team-mate Lewis Hamilton will continue and that the action on track for the last six races of the season will remain just as intense.

We have known that for a little while. It won&apos;t change anything. The racing is still going to be bloody amazing like it has been for the last few races.&quot; He is currently on 167 points, 117 behind Red Bull&apos;s current world champion, Sebastian Vettel, who could claim the title at the next round in Singapore, and nine points ahead of Hamilton, who has never been beaten by a team-mate throughout his career. But Button insists it is not about the numbers, saying: &quot;The points at the end of the year will not be what gets my pulse racing.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a lot of fun racing with Lewis because we are so competitive and we do push each other very hard,&quot; he added. &quot;We have found each other quite a lot on the circuit this year which has made for some great racing. We are fair but still tough on each other. That is great for Formula One as a whole, having two world champions in the same team, fighting it out on the circuit.&quot; The fans, who no doubt would have preferred to see McLaren fighting for the championship, will still have much to enjoy, Button insisted: &quot;It is great for the British public because even though the championship is over, we are still going to have some great racing. We&apos;ll be fighting it out with each other probably more than we&apos;ll be fighting it out with other guys because we have got the same equipment. If we are doing a good job we are going to be next to each other a lot of the time. Hopefully, we will put on a good show.&quot; Hamilton was unafraid that Red Bull&apos;s dominance would continue for the long term. &quot;It is not a fear for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I think next year&apos;s car will be quicker than this year&apos;s car. We&apos;ll have to wait and see. I am going to get back to the factory and work as hard as I can with the guys to improve on it and see how we can close the gap.&quot; Despite being punished by the stewards several times this season, Hamilton maintained that they had been consistent, despite not punishing Schumacher for weaving ahead of him during the race and that he was right to take his time passing the German. &quot;I didn&apos;t have an opportunity but I wasn&apos;t up for making any silly mistakes. Maybe I showed people I can drive cleanly and not get into trouble. The guy in front made it very difficult for me,&quot; he said. Button was gracious towards Vettel, admitting that the German &quot;just sails away. But he is driving very well. And as a team they are doing a great job.&quot; The championship aside, that a relaxed and confident Button really is enjoying himself more than ever on the track was reflected in his pleasure at passing the multiple world champion Schumacher on lap 16: &quot;It is just satisfying because I pulled off a lovely move and I always enjoy overtaking Michael as he has achieved a lot in the sport. It is always exciting overtaking anyone but especially a seven-times world champion when he is in good form and his car is performing well.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/13/weekly-sports-diary-16-september", "sentences": ["Vettell is now 115 points clear and could clinch the drivers&apos; title next up in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-13T13:05:20Z", "title": "Peerless Novak Djokovic strips Rafael Nadal of his US Open title", "tags": ["Sport"], "article": "Novak Djokovic might still be the king of tennis but it took a struggle of epic proportions at Flushing Meadows to rip Rafael Nadal&apos;s fingers from his remaining crown.

In a scathing report, Ann Abraham said the department had forced the family to relive their ordeal time and again, while stubbornly refusing to pay them thousands of pounds in compensation. Abraham said she had ordered the MoD to pay the money and demanded ministers apologise \u2013 recommendations that have both been accepted. She said the case was &quot;the worst example I have seen in nearly nine years \u2026 of a government department getting things wrong and then repeatedly failing to put things right or learn from its mistakes&quot;. The episode centres on compensation offered to Britons who were interned by the Japanese in Singapore. In 2000, the government set up an &quot;ex-gratia&quot; scheme to provide payments to internees who had survived imprisonment by the Japanese. This was intended to recognise the &quot;debt of honour&quot; for the treatment meted out to them because they were British. One man, known as Mr A, and his siblings, applied to the scheme, but were refused payment because they failed a so-called &quot;blood-link&quot; test \u2013 essentially, they were not deemed British enough. Mr A was born in British Malaya. The family, who wanted to remain anonymous, fought the decision and received \u00a3500 and an apology. In 2007, the MoD set up a second &quot;injury to feelings&quot; scheme, designed to compensate families left out of the first one. Despite being invited to apply by the MoD, Mr A&apos;s family was turned down again. They were also told that the &quot;previous apology and payment had been given to them in error&quot;. Abraham described the MoD&apos;s behaviour as &quot;disgraceful and unfair&quot;. The family challenged the decision and, though Mr A has since died, his wife and his siblings will now receive the compensation he fought for. In her report, Abraham describes how Mr A was captured and taken to the Sime Road internment camp in Singapore on 25 March 1945. He was eight years old. His future wife was also a child prisoner at the camp. They were liberated on 6 September 1945. During the six months of imprisonment, Mr A was separated from his parents and older brothers. He suffered from scabies and was forced to stand naked in the sun before getting treated by doctors. &quot;Mr A said that the protracted dealings with the MoD caused him and his siblings to relive their traumatic experiences in the internment camp. He described this as &apos;not just mental anguish, but torture&apos;,&quot; the ombudsman&apos;s report says. Abraham said the MoD had aggravated Mr A&apos;s distress in the last years of his life, and she described the retraction of the first apology as &quot;offensive and incorrect&quot;. &quot;Those failings are unacceptable in any context,&quot; said Abraham. &quot;In the context of a compensation scheme intended to recognise the unique circumstances and exceptional suffering of British people held captive in the far east during the second world war, they were unforgivable.&quot; Mr A&apos;s widow, who now lives in Australia, and 11 of his siblings, will each be paid \u00a34,000 compensation and a further \u00a35,000 each for the distress they have suffered. The MoD has also been forced to offer compensation to other people in this position. A spokesman said it had contacted three other individuals who have similar cases and another 13 who have already received a payment of \u00a3500 and may be entitled to the full amount. The minister for veterans, Andrew Robathan, admitted the ombudsman&apos;s report had highlighted &quot;significant failings by the Ministry of Defence in dealing with these and other similar cases&quot;. He added: &quot;The payments to Mr A&apos;s family have already been made and my officials have identified a very small number of similar cases. &quot;While we cannot be answerable for the conduct of the previous government \u2026 I offer my sincere apologies for the distress, anger and frustration caused to this family throughout this long and painful period.

The lineup: Sarah Ruba (vocals, synths) and Adam Pavao (keyboards, production). The background: You might imagine that New Look are offering a pithy comment on consumerist culture by assuming the name of a popular retail outlet (who said &quot;chav mecca&quot;?), but it&apos;s unlikely, because it only has branches in the UK (and France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates), and this duo are from Canada. Besides, they&apos;ve got bigger priorities than poking fun at the peculiarities of British fashion, such as recording one of the albums of the year. We are fond of listing our new acts of the year (Odd Future, Jensen Sportag, StewRat, AlunaGeorge, Keep Shelly in Athens) and our tracks of the year, but we haven&apos;t given much thought to our albums of the year, mainly because there haven&apos;t been that many. But now we have a fine addition to the 2011 canon that includes such latter-day quiet-storm classics as Frank Ocean&apos;s Nostalgia, Ultra, the Weeknd&apos;s House of Balloons and Class Actress&apos; Rapprocher. New Look&apos;s self-titled debut \u2013 issued on !K7, home to the mighty Chromeo and the DJ Kicks series \u2013 is almost a companion piece to Rapprocher by Brooklyn&apos;s Elizabeth Harper, being an album of electronic pop sung by a female, in this case Sarah Ruba, a part-time model who, with her producer/multi-instrumentalist husband Adam Pavao, has spent the last three years recording New Look in Brooklyn, as well as Berlin and their home town of Hamilton. Apparently, they have experience in ambient jam bands (Pavao) and as jazz belters (Ruba), but mercifully they&apos;ve put all that behind them and are focusing on shiny dubstep pop, or post-dubstep pop seeing as how it takes some of the rhythmical devices and production methods of dubstep and allies them to pure pop melodies. Yes, it would be nice just once for the producer/sidekick to be the woman and the frontperson/eye-candy to be the man, but these darlings of blogs and the style press, who recently supported the xx on tour, are such masters and mistresses of icy emotionality, we forgive them. They&apos;re also pretty good self-editors, hence all the lovely dub space in their songs. &quot;We try not to keep anything superfluous in,&quot; they explain. &quot;We&apos;re always conscious of the negative space in our music and that&apos;s a constant theme.&quot; They&apos;ve cornered the market in less-is-more. Nap on the Bow is the perfect blend of crispness and melodic concision. Has there been a single instance of this stuff getting any daytime radio play, though, let alone charting? Possibly not. And yet this feels like a hit, just as New Look&apos;s London counterparts, AlunaGeorge, are fantasy top 10 heroes of ours. Relax Your Mind is a brilliantly raw, sparse sort of feminised grime. On Numbers the words are haiku-like in their simplicity but convey just the right amount of fear and yearning: &quot;The telephone is not a toy/ It has power to destroy.&quot; Have you ever noticed that? We have, often. A Light has an itchy, quirky arrangement that is more Bj\u00f6rk than Benga. The Ballad has the austere atmosphere of Fade to Grey/Being Boiled. So Real is like Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam doing late-90s/early-00s UKG. Does that make it R&amp;G? While you&apos;re pondering that, Everything is like a showdown between dub creator Scientist and St Etienne. Ruba visits every song like a hologram of passion, and the music is a mirage of immaculacy. And now we&apos;re going to vanish, before we say too much.

The Cabinet Office&apos;s behavioural insight team \u2013 better known as the nudge unit \u2013 wants to adopt the new technology because policy officials believe the rigid &quot;quit or die&quot; approach to smoking advice no longer works. Rather, they want nicotine addiction to be managed to help smokers who otherwise won&apos;t quit \u2013 an approach the unit believes could prevent millions of smoking deaths. Ten million people in the UK smoke, and smoking claims 80,000 lives a year. The nudge unit&apos;s first annual report, published on Thursday, says the unit \u2013 the first of its kind around the world \u2013 has, in the face of criticism, implemented a series of measures they believe could save thousands of lives a year, as well as \u00a3100m over the course of the next parliament. Ideas already being rolled out include &quot;nudging&quot; people to donate organs by asking someone to opt out rather than opt in when filling out an online driving licence application. The report also says the government is to change tax forms to tell people how many people in their area have paid their taxes ahead of them. Now the unit wants to explore and encourage new products that deliver nicotine to people&apos;s lungs but without the harmful toxins and carcinogens in tobacco smoke that kill. The annual report reads: &quot;It will be important to get the regulatory framework for these products right, to encourage new products. A canon of behaviour change is that it is much easier to substitute a similar behaviour than to extinguish an entrenched habit (an example was the rapid switch from leaded to unleaded fuel). If alternative and safe nicotine products can be developed which are attractive enough to substitute people away from traditional cigarettes, they could have the potential to save 10,000s of lives a year.&quot; Current alternatives to smoking range from smokeless tobacco to the Swedish snuff-like product Snus, which is illegal in the UK. Versions of smoke-free cigarettes are illegal in Australia, and banned in Canada, Brazil, Singapore and Thailand because side-effects haven&apos;t been tested. But experts have advised the UK government that the nicotine contained in some new, smoke-free cigarettes is no more harmful than caffeine in coffee. A Cabinet Office source said: &quot;A lot of countries are moving to ban this stuff; we think that&apos;s a mistake.&quot; John Britton, professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham, told the Guardian that on top of the current smokeless range \u2013 which includes electronic or &quot;e-cigarettes&quot; that simulate smoking by producing an inhaled mist \u2013 there are three or four devices in different stages of development. But he said some companies have been reluctant to develop this technology because they had expected it to be as tightly controlled as pharmaceutical drugs. Britton said: &quot;If a manufacturer makes a health claim for anything then it becomes a drug, and drugs have to be regulated with tight controls. The current nicotine replacements are sold as drugs; however, e-cigarettes contain nicotine but get around this by making no health claim and so can be sold freely, but with little or no information on safety or standards. What we&apos;re asking for is a regulation change to bring all nicotine products into a light-touch regime that will guarantee reasonable purity and safety standards but make them as available as cigarettes in a shop.&quot; The Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is looking into approving these devices for use. If it finds in their favour, the government is likely to push for them to be placed prominently in shops alongside tobacco cigarettes, where they would be sold at a cheaper rate. The unit is keen to engage with those critics who believe its analysis and intervention in people&apos;s behaviour is &quot;nanny statism&quot;. David Halpern, the unit&apos;s head, told the Guardian: &quot;As with seatbelts and the smoking ban, these ideas were unpopular at first but after a while when you explain them to people, they understand and say, &apos;Yeah, alright then.&apos; &quot;A year in,&quot; Halpern added, &quot;we&apos;re much more confident about how well this can work, and the early trials have also made us much more confident about public acceptability. There&apos;s no doubt it can save many lives and hundreds of millions of pounds. In fact, our problem has become that we have so many inquiries from across Whitehall, we have to turn down many of the requests for help.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/15/who-are-worst-rogue-traders", "sentences": ["Working in Barings&apos; Singapore office, Leeson initially made large profits for the bank by dealing in derivatives and futures.", "In December 1995 Leeson was sentenced to six years imprisonment in Singapore, and was released in 1999."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-15T12:34:19Z", "title": "Who are the worst rogue traders in history?", "tags": ["Banking", "Business", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel", "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale"], "article": "Rogue traders are back in the headlines after UBS admitted on Thursday that &quot;unauthorised trading&quot; has cost the bank $2bn (\u00a31.3bn). That may be enough to ensure UBS makes a loss for its third quarter, the bank said, but it will not top the list of the worst rogue traders in banking history. That title belongs to J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, who lost Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale a staggering \u00a33.7bn in 2008. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 \u00a33.7bn SocGen revealed in January 2008 that a rogue trader had lost the bank \u00a33.7bn. The trader was swiftly named as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, then 31 years old, who had been taking unauthorised positions on stock futures, the bank said. A subsequent court case suggested Kerviel had been betting \u20ac50bn of the bank&apos;s money on the trades. Kerviel said that the bank had turned a blind eye when his trades were turning a profit. Kerviel had worked in compliance, and bank bosses suggested he was adept at hiding his losses and bypassing checks. Kerviel was sentenced to three years in jail in October of last year, and told he must repay the money lost, a conviction which is currently subject to appeal. Coming in the midst of the banking crisis, the losses had surprisingly little impact on the market generally, with US losses from sub-prime mortgage lending dwarfing Kerviel&apos;s activities. Barings Bank \u2013 \u00a3827m The most famous &apos;rogue trader&apos; in history, Nick Leeson brought down one of the grandest names in British banking. Working in Barings&apos; Singapore office, Leeson initially made large profits for the bank by dealing in derivatives and futures. But after running up losses, he hid his bad trades in a single account in 1992. These losses grew over several years, forcing him into a series of increasingly desperate but unsuccessful attempts to make the money back. Leeson finally fled in February 1995 after a bet that the Tokyo stock market would rise went badly wrong. Once the full scale of the losses became apparent, Barings was sold to Dutch bank ING for just \u00a31. In the aftermath, Leeson&apos;s managers were criticised for giving him too much leeway. Crucially, he had been allowed to settle his own trades, letting him disguise his actions. In December 1995 Leeson was sentenced to six years imprisonment in Singapore, and was released in 1999. He subsequently ran Irish football club Galway United, and is now an after-dinner and conference speaker. Allied Irish Bank \u2013 \u00a3697m Friends and colleagues saw John Rusnak as a typical &apos;Mr Middle America&apos;, but the Baltimore-based trader was jailed after hiding trading losses of almost $700m (\u00a3355m). He was hired by Allfirst Financial, a division of Allied Irish Bank, in the mid-90s as a dealer on the foreign exchanges. Betting mainly on the Japanese yen, Rusnak used fictitious options contracts to hide his losses over several years. Some outsiders suspected that all was not well, with Goldman Sachs reportedly refusing to do business with Rusnak. But it took until 2002 before routine checks finally uncovered the true nature of the bank&apos;s exposure. By that stage, rather than sticking to his trading limit of $2.5m, Rusnak had secretly bet $7.5bn of AIB&apos;s money on the yen rising against the dollar. At his subsequent trial, prosecutors said he had created a false identity under the name David Russell and used an address in New York to send confirmations of false trades. Rusnak was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in a plea bargaining deal. Daiwa Bank \u2013 $1.1bn The president of Japan&apos;s Daiwa Bank received a particularly nasty shock on 13 July 1995. Toshihide Iguchi, one of its senior US executives, confessed in a 30-page letter that he had lost $1.1bn through unauthorised bond trading. Like Leeson and Rusnak, Iguchi ran up the losses over several years. Having risen from the back offices to become a trader in 1984, a lack of segregation within his division meant he could hide his losses from his superiors while he tried, and failed, to trade back to profit. Following his confession, it emerged that he had conducted the cover-up for over a decade, falsifying some 30,000 trading slips. Having once been seen as the golden boy of the department, in 1996 he was jailed for four years and fined $2.6m. In court, he told the judge that his life was filled with guilt, fear and deception after 11 years trying to recover his losses. Interviewed in jail, Iguchi said he had seen his earlier actions as merely a violation of internal rules. &quot;I think all traders have a tendency to fall into the same trap. You always have a way of recovering the loss&quot;, he told Time magazine. Daiwa was also penalised heavily. The Federal Reserve ordered it to end all of its operations in America, leading to a sale of most of its US assets in January 2006. Sumitomo Corporation \u2013 $2.6bn Yasuo Hamanaka was jailed for eight years for fraud and forgery in 1997 after the one-time king of the copper market was found to have conducted rogue trading and fraud for more than a decade. At the height of his power, Hamanaka was said to control 5% of the global copper market. His off-the-book trades forced prices up and generated large profits for years, but ultimately cost Sumitomo $2.6bn when the scandal was uncovered. A year after his conviction, Sumitomo paid about $150m to settle claims from British and US regulators. In 1999, Merrill Lynch was fined a total of \u00a316m for helping to finance a copper trading scandal. The London Metal Exchange said it had provided the finance to clients to undertake actions that it should have known was the basis of an attempt to manipulate the market Other major trading losses Although actual fraud is rare, many other traders have run up huge losses simply through a bad call on the markets. These include Brian Hunter, an energy trader at hedge fund Amaranth. He had made large profits by speculating on natural gas prices, but ended up losing $6.6bn in 2006 after betting that the price of gas would rise. Unfortunately for him (but not for traders who took the opposite view), they plunged after a heatwave helped to slash the price of gas future contracts. And Morgan Stanley&apos;s oil trader David Redmond risked $10m in a frantic series of trades following a drink-fuelled lunch. Redmond managed to recover most of the losses the next day, but was still banned from the City."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/15/banks-rogue-trader-kweku-adoboli-2bn", "sentences": ["Nick Leeson is perhaps the highest profile after he was jailed in Singapore for bringing down Barings Bank in 1995 but there have been many others, including Yasuo &quot;Mr Copper&quot; Hamanaka and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, a trader at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, whom the French authorities sentenced to three years in prison last year after he ran up losses of \u20ac4.9bn."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-15T20:20:36Z", "title": "Banks under new pressure as 'rogue trader' loses $2bn", "tags": ["UBS", "Banking", "European banks", "Business", "Financial Services Authority (FSA)", "Regulators", "Financial sector", "Europe", "World news", "Kweku Adoboli"], "article": "Pressure to accelerate reform of the banking industry is mounting as a star trader at the UBS investment bank remained in police custody in London amid allegations that he was at the heart of a rogue trading incident that has cost the Swiss bank about $2bn (\u00a31.2bn). Kweku Adoboli, 31, faced a night of questioning by officers from City of London police after being arrested at 3.30am when his managers became suspicious about his trading activities and alerted police and financial regulators. Police said he was being held on suspicion of &quot;fraud by abuse of position&quot;. Adoboli&apos;s father, a retired United Nations employee from Ghana, told Reuters in Accra that his &quot;Godfearing family&quot; was &quot;heartbroken because fraud is not our way of life&quot;. John Adoboli, who had worked in trouble spots around the world, said his son&apos;s girlfriend had confirmed his arrest. Adoboli Sr said he was calling his son&apos;s phone and he hoped he would &quot;be granted bail soon so I can hear his side of the story&quot;. The Nottingham University graduate&apos;s arrest coincided with the third anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and sparked a 10% fall in UBS&apos;s shares as it warned it might make a third-quarter loss. Days after the government pledged to endorse ringfencing ideas put forward by Sir John Vickers&apos;s Independent Commission on Banking, senior political figures used the UBS incident as ammunition to encourage reform. Lord Oakeshott, the former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman in the Lords, said it exposed the &quot;toxic banking risk&quot; still in the system. Lord Myners, Labour&apos;s City minister during the banking crisis, warned taxpayers were still on the hook should a UK bank fail. UBS, which had been fighting to restore its reputation after it became one of the biggest continental European casualties of the 2008 banking crisis, alerted City of London police at 1am on Thursday after it uncovering alleged &quot;unauthorised trading&quot; in the late afternoon and embarked on a wide-ranging internal investigation. City of London police arrested Adoboli at the sprawling UBS office complex near Liverpool Street in central London, where around 6,000 people are employed. &quot;The man was taken to a City of London police station for questioning and he remains in custody while officers are continuing to investigate this matter,&quot; police said. The allegations facing Adoboli follow a series of rogue trading incidents in the financial markets. Nick Leeson is perhaps the highest profile after he was jailed in Singapore for bringing down Barings Bank in 1995 but there have been many others, including Yasuo &quot;Mr Copper&quot; Hamanaka and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, a trader at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, whom the French authorities sentenced to three years in prison last year after he ran up losses of \u20ac4.9bn. Kerviel is appealing against the sentence. Adoboli now risks entering that list if charges are brought against him. The bank would not confirm his position at the bank but his entry on LinkedIn, the social networking site, described him as director of exchange traded funds (ETF) and delta one trading at UBS. This operation, in the equities division on the third floor of the UBS head office, was known internally as a profitable \u2013 and risk free \u2013 area of business. But it is understood that the trading desk was largely silent on Thursday Staff were said to be stunned as Adoboli and his colleagues were regarded as &quot;stars&quot; by their colleagues and top management.ETFs are complex financial instruments that comprise a basket of investments intended to mimic a market&apos;s movements. They have become an area into which firms have expanded since the subprime mortgage crisis. Traders on so-called delta one desks try to make huge profits on tiny differences between prices. The Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, is understood to have been alerted in the early hours and Swiss regulators were watching the situation closely. The Serious Fraud Office may also become involved after it said it was &quot;seeking discussions&quot; with the bank, the City of London police and the FSA about how to proceed if fraud needed to be investigated. The SFO had already issued a warning about the &quot;inherent dangers&quot; of ETFs because of their complexity. UBS is expected to reveal more details on Friday about the allegations facing Adoboli but the City was rife with speculation that he had been caught out by the sudden move by the Swiss National Bank last week to lower the rate of exchange of the Swiss franc. On 6 September, the Swiss National Bank warned that it would no longer allow one Swiss franc to be worth more than \u20ac0.83 \u2013 equivalent to SFr1.20 to the euro. &quot;The Swiss currency moved by 8% straight away which is a huge move for foreign exchange markets. Probably a good guess as to where the loss came from, but at the moment we do not know,&quot; said Louise Cooper, analyst at BGC Partners. Amid concerns about the health of Europe&apos;s banking system, Oakeshott told a debate on the Vickers reforms in the Lords that &quot;this reminds us how much toxic banking risk remains in the system, and how urgent radical reform is&quot;. He added: &quot;The problem is that big investment banks are full of rogue traders: it is what they do.&quot; Lord Myners, Labour&apos;s City minister at the time of the banking crisis, told the Guardian: &quot;Until this government does something \u2013 either Vickers or Vickers &apos;plus&apos; \u2013 the taxpayers remain on the hook.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2011/sep/16/rogue-trader-reporter-kweku-adoboli", "sentences": ["Nick Leeson, who brought down the ancient Barings bank in a back room in Singapore, got six and a half years for &quot;unauthorised&quot; losses of $1.4bn, and Jerome Kerviel, who lost France&apos;s SocGen bank $7.2bn \u2013 he&apos;s the current world record holder \u2013 is serving a five-year (two of them suspended) sentence."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-16T10:40:32Z", "title": "'Rogue trader'?

He&apos;s the one who gets caught and sent to jail when the people who presided over the system that allowed him to lose $2bn \u2013 or, in Clive Goodman&apos;s case, to hack some royal phones \u2013 say &quot;how deplorable&quot; before business as usual is restored. As the City tough guy Paul Myners reportedly said, we never hear about the unauthorised rogue profits that arise from casino-style speculations \u2013 only about the rogue losses that are adding to market instability at a really unhelpful time. But hey, let&apos;s be cheerful, too: they also make a powerful case for implementing the Vickers reforms, which are designed to make high street banks safer from this kind of hooliganism (looting, as we call it in nearby Tottenham). So I&apos;m not especially keen to see Kweku Adoboli, the UBS trader currently helping police with their inquiries, sent to jail, though precedent suggests he will be. Nick Leeson, who brought down the ancient Barings bank in a back room in Singapore, got six and a half years for &quot;unauthorised&quot; losses of $1.4bn, and Jerome Kerviel, who lost France&apos;s SocGen bank $7.2bn \u2013 he&apos;s the current world record holder \u2013 is serving a five-year (two of them suspended) sentence. He&apos;s appealing against it. What we want is a few of the boss class to have their collars felt, as sometimes happens in New York (though not enough lately) but rarely in Europe. That might concentrate a few minds and encourage them to behave more responsibly with their shareholders&apos; and customers&apos; money, as well \u2013 of course \u2013 as with the taxpayers&apos; money that has had to be deployed to bail them out. Banks, alas, are like sewers \u2013 we just can&apos;t do without them. That&apos;s not me talking. The Guardian&apos;s Simon Hoggart wrote a wonderfully affectionate sketch this week about Sir Peter Tapsell, the 81-year-old Father of the Commons (ie the longest serving MP), whose utterances can be a touch pompous but who is also smart about money. Here&apos;s Hansard&apos;s Un-Hoggarted version of Tapsell&apos;s exchange with David Cameron at Question Time:  Sir Peter Tapsell (Con): &quot;Was my right honourable friend taught, at whatever school he happened to attend, that one of the key functions of parliament over the centuries has been to diminish what the historians have called the over-mighty subject. &quot;In the 18th century, it was the Indian nabobs, denounced by Edmund Burke. In the 19th century, it was the ruthless industrialists, humanised by Shaftesbury. In the 20th century, it was the trade union leaders, tamed by Lady Thatcher. &quot;Today, the over-mighty subject is the bankers. In the United States, the federal authorities are prosecuting a wide swath of the top banks. When will that happen here?&quot;David Cameron: &quot;My right honourable friend obviously had a much better education than I did \u2013 that is apparent. Also, it was very good to hear him say something very positive about Margaret Thatcher. &quot;The serious point that my right honourable friend makes is right: we do need to see responsibility from our bankers. I support what Vickers has said in terms of the reforms that we need, and to answer my right honourable friend&apos;s question directly, if people break the law, no matter where they come from or who they are, they should face the consequences and be punished.&quot;  No sign there that Dave is about to unleash what is left of the Met (100 detectives are belatedly on the &quot;rogue&quot; phone-hacking case they did so much to suppress) to round up Adoboli&apos;s supervisors and their supervisors. Whereas the PM was briefly a PR for Carlton TV, Tapsell has been a City man for decades and resigned from Thatcher&apos;s shadow Treasury team in the 70s because he rejected her monetarist analysis. He once described himself as &quot;the second richest self-made man in the house&quot; (ie after Hezza). Yet UBS was one of the three major universal banks \u2013 Citibank and our own RBS were the others \u2013 to need rescuing in the 2007-09 bank crisis, and has made further mistakes since its original $50bn hit. It&apos;s a Swiss bank, for heaven&apos;s sake \u2013 aren&apos;t they meant to be cautious? Some reports are saying this latest loss will wipe out the current round of savings via cost-cutting, chiefly a euphemism for 3,500 UBS staff jobs. Read in any of today&apos;s newspapers \u2013 and ponder \u2013 about Adoboli&apos;s background and lifestyle. Like most &quot;rogue traders&quot; he&apos;s basically an outsider, keen to get ahead, keen to make money, keen to prove himself and be accepted. He is not a provincial Frenchman or a working class Brit, but a Ghanaian from a respectable family where dad \u2013 hugely distressed on Thursday, the press reports \u2013 worked as a senior UN official. They sent him to Ackworth school, a fee-paying Quaker set-up in Pontefract, Yorkshire. He did well (sporting, head boy and all that) and, after flirting with chemical engineering, ended up reading e-commerce and digital business at Nottingham, a good university. He graduated in 2003, always dabbling in little business opportunities, investments, buying and selling on eBay. Fast forward to March 2006, when Adoboli joined UBS as a trainee. Very soon, he was getting stuck into burning a lot of candles at both ends: work hard at his terminal, then play hard in his \u00a31,000-a-week ground floor flat in Spitalfields, the again-fashionable quarter near both the City and Brick Lane occupied by generations of immigrants. Noisy parties, good wine and restaurants, girlfriends, a copy of his favourite novel, Jason Belfort&apos;s cautionary the Wolf of Wall Street (&quot;I partied like a rock star, I lived like a king&quot;) close to hand (the hero ends up in jail, as Adoboli may) \u2013 it sounds like a bad taste caricature of the Masters of the Universe types Tom Wolfe mocked in Bonfire of the Vanities 20 years ago. Have we learned nothing? Apparently not. Adoboli is 31, with less visible expertise and experience than his evident ambition to make money. Who left him in charge of the tea money? Yet he was able to lose $2bn in a corner of the investment market known as exchange traded funds (ETFs), which even the FT is having a struggle explaining to its more ignorant readers (bank chairmen, people like that) in today&apos;s edition. Apparently, they&apos;re the hottest thing since the collateralised debt products that blew up Lehman and others in 2008. The FT columnist Gillian Tett says she wrote a column in May warning that ETFs were heading for a scandal, but not quite this soon. Never mind. As the Guardian&apos;s City columnist, Nils Pratley, writes, the timing of UBS&apos;s shame is handy for Sir John Vickers and his supporters, who believe in ring-fencing the retail activities of banks \u2013 what they routinely do for you and me and (if they&apos;re lucky) for small businesses \u2013 from the investment arm, the casino side where billions can be won or lost betting on tiny movements in price \u2013 &quot;like a surfer trying to spot a wave and ride it for a tiny moment&quot;, says our new banking blogger, Joris Luyendijk. It&apos;s commended and attacked (from both sides) as a compromise, short of breaking up the &quot;too big to fail&quot; universal banks which have cost the taxpayer and the flattened western economies so much, and don&apos;t seem to do very well what they pay themselves for doing. Adoboli was apparently being paid around \u00a3300,000 a year \u2013 plus bonus, of course. Or do we call that a &quot;rogue bonus&quot;? So the jolliest headline in the crop is atop a piece by the FT&apos;s chief economics analyst, Martin Wolf, a member of the Vickers panel who carries the much-abused label of &quot;public intellectual&quot; (justified in his case). The headline: &quot;Thank you, UBS.&quot; Wolf&apos;s article then demolishes critics who said the Vickers package was &quot;irrelevant, damaging or toothless&quot;. The BBC&apos;s Robert Peston is reporting that UBS&apos;s &quot;we&apos;ve learned our lesson&quot; internal risk controls didn&apos;t even turn up Adoboli&apos;s gambling, though he left hints on Facebook. They found out when he told them. No City PR or spin doctor (they are far worse in the City than at Westminster) could manipulate events to achieve such a coup as this. In hard times, when cruel financial realities are sweeping away wishful thinking all the time, in Wall Street, Brussels and Frankfurt, as well as the City, even the smug, insular Swiss are not immune. Every day, our troubles deepen.

But campaigners and experts greeted Najib Razak&apos;s announcement cautiously, warning that while the measures were a step forward the scope of changes and the impact of the new laws remain to be seen. The move is widely regarded as an attempt to boost support before the elections, with Najib under pressure from within as well as outside the ruling National Front coalition. The move comes two months after police detained hundreds and fired teargas as a 20,000-strong crowd demonstrated for electoral reform in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in the country&apos;s biggest political rally for years. The colonial-era Internal Security Act (ISA), under which 37 people are held, and the emergency ordinance, under which 6,000 are held, allow indefinite detention without trial. Najib said they would be replaced with anti-terrorism laws affording suspects greater protection. He pledged: &quot;No Malaysian will ever be arrested or detained because of their political affiliations or ideas.&quot; In a televised address on Thursday night, he said: &quot;Many will question whether I am moving too far, too fast ...There may be short-term pain for me politically, but in the long term the changes I am announcing tonight will ensure a brighter, more prosperous future for all Malaysians.&quot; Najib also said media outlets would have to be approved only once, rather than applying for licences to be renewed annually \u2013 a system that critics say has been used to keep them in line. He promised to review police laws on controlling assembly and other legislation restricting civil liberties. Amnesty International called the announcement a &quot;significant step forward for human rights in Malaysia&quot;. But the group&apos;s Asia-Pacific director, Sam Zarifi, said the government must ensure new security laws comply with international human rights standards and urged it to remove barriers to free speech and peaceful assembly. Dr Bridget Welsh, an expert on Malaysian politics at the Singapore Management University, said: &quot;I think everyone recognises this is a product of political expediency \u2013 he is facing pressure from the opposition and civil society and opposition in his own ranks. But good things can come out of political expediency.&quot; She said the detail of new legislation, and its implementation, would be crucial, but added: &quot;From their perspective this is a historic break. I want to give him credit because from the perspective of his personal history, the party&apos;s history, the fact he has been part of the system for a good 40 years \u2013 he&apos;s stepping away from some of the things of the past and particularly out of Mahathir&apos;s [Mohamad, the former prime minister] shadow.&quot; Dr Graham Brown, director of the centre for development studies at Bath University, was more sceptical. &quot;I think at the moment most people in Malaysia will probably be taking this with a pinch of salt ... He has not flinched from using the draconian powers these laws allow him,&quot; said Brown, a Malaysia specialist. He said while the ISA was the &quot;headline&quot; repressive law, others had more impact in restricting people&apos;s day-to-day lives and freedoms, adding: &quot;It&apos;s not clear how far he&apos;s willing or promising to go in reforming the broader set of laws.&quot; Tony Pua, an opposition MP, warned: &quot;We have yet to see the fine print. We&apos;ve seen sufficient U-turns when Najib comes under pressure from rightwing groups, and we won&apos;t be surprised if the same happens again.&quot; The next election is due in 2013, but Najib, who became prime minister two years ago, is widely expected to call one within months. The National Front, which has been in power for the half-century since Malaysia won independence from Britain, suffered its worst performance in the 2008 elections. The opposition alliance led by former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, which won more than a third of the parliamentary seats in 2008, has struggled since then due to infighting and Anwar&apos;s second trial. He denies charges of sodomy, which he described in court last month as &quot;a vile and desperate attempt at character assassination&quot; and a bid to consign him to political oblivion. The government denies the case is politically motivated. Anwar was imprisoned on similar charges in 1998 and freed six years later on appeal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/16/the-fiver-weekend-preview", "sentences": ["Manchester United&apos;s plan to float the company on the Singapore stock exchange has been cleared."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-16T15:24:16Z", "title": "The Fiver | Stramash; and ultrasviolence | Scott Murray and Rob Smyth", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "HONK!

For a fixture that&apos;s always hyped up to preposterous levels, it&apos;s a bit of an oddity, in that it nearly always delivers one way or another. United&apos;s record against Chelsea at home is, for a club that keeps winning the league, not all that: seven wins, seven draws, and five losses in the Premier League era. And in the quarter century before that, when United were truly awful, check this out: United one win, eight draws, eight Chelsea wins. Chelsea are no Arsenal, is what we&apos;re getting at here. This may explain the slight nervous edge to Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s press conference today \u2013 &quot;The two Manchester teams are enjoying the publicity that comes from the predictions that they are going to win the league, but in the background lurks Chelsea. They don&apos;t need the publicity, and will enjoy being out of the profile at the moment&quot; \u2013 and also Andre Villas-Boas&apos;s more relaxed attitude. &quot;I&apos;m just happy to be with you,&quot; he lied to the assembled press corps. And we know this was a lie, because he followed that quote up with this \u2013 &quot;Nothing I say or do here will make the nature of the game change&quot; \u2013 which was the equivalent of walking up to each and every journalist in the room and displaying two erect fingers in their phizogs (while just out of focus, because the eyes are concentrating on the fingers, Villas-Boas&apos;s face would be seen in the background, its centrepiece a manic grin, his pearly white teeth glistening, looking a bit like the Fiver behind the wheel of the Fivermobile, only with a more stylish continental coiffure, of course). QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;The wind was howling and I saw a bag blow over my garden fence and as I looked up, I saw the wolf&apos;s head. I just looked at it for a couple of minutes then thought I have to get a picture of this to show my mates. I think it proves beyond doubt that God is a Wolves fan&quot; \u2013 is it a bird?

The Fiver is excited, but then you&apos;ll know that from the smell. It&apos;s Millwall v West Ham tomorrow in the Championship, and you know what that means. Jellied eels and jellied kneecaps, right? The Fiver is well up for a bit of the old ultrasviolence. We&apos;ve bought a ringside ticket \u2013 a pass to an illegal website feed that allows us to experience it all vicariously \u2013 and a knuckle duster to keep our computer screen clean. Who &apos;kin well wants some? As it turns out, we might have wasted some of our Special Internet Feelgood Budget. Our West Ham-supporting cousin, Bald Corpulent Tattooed Mess Fiver, reckons that there won&apos;t be much trouble tomorrow. There are two reasons for this. The first is Millwall&apos;s policing, with a fenced-off walkway for cattl- sorry, for away supporters, and West Ham being given only the top tier. More important is the fact that the game kicks off at lunchtime, when the hold-me-back massive will be restrained by that pesky law-enforcement agent known as sobriety. There&apos;s also the better nature of Joseph Bloggs, an almost entirely imaginary phenomenon to which Millwall&apos;s American chairman John Berylson has made an endearingly naive appeal. &quot;I can assure you that in the States there are sporting rivalries which are equally fierce, intense, passionate or however you want to call it,&quot; he said of those infamous under-12 Spelling Bees that are periodically the subject of a documentary on More 4, involving uber-wedgies and extended debates over whether the word &apos;Lolz&apos; is even in the dictionary. &quot;What characterises them is ... sharp wit and humour. I wonder whether now isn&apos;t the time for us to take the lead in moving our relationship with our East End neighbours on to a new, more mature footing.&quot; Good luck with that, pal! When that fails, and if there is trouble tomorrow, they can just start the next match at 8am, when most wrong&apos;uns are in the midst of a tanking comedown and/or losing a battle of wills with Armitage Shanks, after failing miserably to pace themselves, a proud Englishman to the last retch.

The exact structure of the IPO has not yet been made public, but it is thought that the Glazers will float up to 35% of the club using a structure that enables them to retain up to 88% of the voting rights. A source close to the discussions said that no decision had yet been made on when the IPO would launch but noted the Glazers were in no hurry and are prepared to wait until market conditions are more favourable. It is understood that the Glazers will use the money raised to pay down existing debt arising from last year&apos;s \u00a3526m bond scheme, which in turn was used to refinance earlier bank loans taken out to buy the club in a \u00a3790m deal in 2005, and expand their Asian commercial operation.

The view comes after the latest in a string of incidents to hit the financial sector, with the emergence of a $2bn (\u00a31.2bn) loss at Swiss bank UBS and the arrest of trader Kweku Adoboli on Thursday morning. The UBS case follows the infamous exploits of Nick Leeson at Barings Bank in 1995, and multibillion pound frauds including Sumitomo Corporation&apos;s Yasuo &quot;Mr Copper&quot; Hamanaka in 1997, Allied Irish Banks&apos; John Rusnak in 2002 and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale&apos;s J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel in 2008. Roger Philby, the chief executive of psychometric profiling firm the Chemistry Group, said: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want to comment specifically on UBS, but some of these places get the behaviour they deserve because they&apos;ve created the monster.&quot; There were signals, he said, which indicated the individuals most likely to go rogue: &quot;I would be looking at four scales [to predict rogue trading]. Firstly conformity, so how likely is somebody to break rules; secondly, emotion, as low-emotion people tend to worry less about implications [and can] hide things; thirdly, what we call &apos;project leader&apos; or ego; and fourthly &apos;self-starting&apos; or self esteem, which shifts depending on the environment. Those four scales show how likely somebody is to break rules, cover up and believe they can get away with it.&quot; But, Philby added, the problem is that these traits can be regarded as strengths as well as weaknesses in the City. His comments were reiterated by other experts in the field. Professor Nigel Nicholson, of the London Business School, added: &quot;[Traders] are low on those personality dimensions that involve control, order and doing things through disciplined achievement. They want to cut corners. They are robust people, in the sense that they will be insensitive and tough. There is a general weakness in traders that they don&apos;t talk a lot. Managers have to be quite proactive in understanding what is going on in the trader&apos;s mind, especially the slightly introverted and isolated ones \u2013 who might also be geographically isolated.&quot; In previous cases, Leeson brought down one of the grandest names in British banking from Singapore; Rusnak was living in the US as he cost his Dublin-based bank hundreds of millions, while Toshihide Iguchi ran up losses of $1.1bn in 1995 from New York as his bosses at Japan&apos;s Daiwa Bank sat in Tokyo. Leeson, Rusnak and Iguchi also carried out their fraud over several years and City experts questioned how many other rogue trader cases never get exposed. Onno Steenbeck of Erasmus University in Rotterdam, a co-author of a paper on Leeson&apos;s strategy, said: &quot;Leeson believed in doubling up, like a naive gambler. He sometimes got lucky and got out of the misery but nobody knows how many Nick Leesons there are who got lucky and we never found out about.&quot; One current hedge fund trader, who declined to be named, added: &quot;Of course there are bound to be people on the other side [of the UBS losses] who made miraculously large sums of money that weren&apos;t authorised. They will be kept quiet.

Philosophy is part of religious, moral and philosophical education in secondary schools, and at least one local authority has introduced Matthew Lipman&apos;s Philosophy for Children into all of its primary schools. More recently, as part of the ongoing reform Curriculum for Excellence, a working group has been established to look at what is being termed higher-order thinking skills.     Illustration: Gary Kempston    There is a problem, however, with the idea that &quot;philosophy lessons&quot; should be introduced. The curriculum is already overcrowded and the last thing we need is another subject, which will probably have to be examined at some stage if it is to have credibility. Why don&apos;t we promote critical thinking, creativity and problem-solving across the whole curriculum, from the sciences to the humanities, from the arts to physical education? As Singapore is trying to do, maybe we could turn our schools into &quot;thinking schools&quot; and their pupils into thoughtful, creative and questioning human beings. That&apos;s what we want, isn&apos;t it?Brian BoydEmeritus professor of education, University of Strathclyde \u2022 It is not only philosophers who want philosophy taught in schools. How many parents have complained about the teaching of religious education in schools \u2013 but no moral philosophy? How many assume that natural philosophy is one of the bedrocks of our culture, but are saddened to find that by the end of their formal education their offspring know nothing about Aristotle, Locke, Newton or Darwin? My daughter was taught philosophy in primary school (by an English teacher) and the whole class loved it. But this all stopped in secondary school. The meagre provision of a philosophy A-level course was so over-subscribed that she could not get in.Dr Virginia SmithLondon \u2022 I&apos;ve been involved in the Royal Institute of Philosophy&apos;s work in schools since 1996. As a charity, we deliver free introductory philosophy courses to more than 20 schools across the UK each year. Thousands of children have had new thoughts about the world, and their place in it, thanks to this scheme. Why bother teaching philosophy in schools? For one thing, a properly functioning democracy depends on the ability to listen to, understand and respond to the views of others. That&apos;s what philosophers do, and it&apos;s a large part of what philosophy has always been.James GarveyThe Royal Institute of Philosophy \u2022 I absolutely agree that teaching philosophy in schools from a young age would have a hugely positive effect upon developing our citizens of the future. Evidence shows us and logic tells us that the more young people develop the ability to think and reason, the greater the likelihood of them developing into responsible and confident citizens. We have developed Philosophy for Children in our primary school with the expertise of a specialist teacher, and this has been shown to impact on behaviour and attainment. On a recent visit to the House of Commons one of our 10-year-olds said: &quot;Maybe they could do with philosophy lessons like we have in school!&quot; What more can I say?Carol MachellHeadteacher, Broadgreen primary school, Liverpool \u2022 Children are naturally philosophical, but I am not sure there&apos;s much to be gained by giving them lessons in the discipline. Many children leave primary school without a basic understanding of vital subjects like maths, science and English, so throwing philosophy into the mix would be quite unhelpful. Besides, the spirit of inquiry and reflection can be nurtured in all sorts of ways, and decent schools surely do this already. It doesn&apos;t help when exaggerated claims are made for philosophy which it simply cannot live up to. Sadly, it is often esoteric and trivial, with little connection with everyday life. Students hoping for synthesis \u2013 an understanding of how things join together \u2013 are unlikely to find it in modern philosophy, which prides itself on narrow conceptual analysis. It is certainly not a pedagogical panacea.Gary Kitchen(Doctor of philosophy and father of three), Southport, Lancashire"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/17/friedman-mandelbaum-that-used-review", "sentences": ["Only into a slightly calmer, colder reading room where scarifying dust jackets don&apos;t keep citing Singapore and Finland as exemplars-cum-humiliators \u2013 menacing trailblazers alongside a ubiquitously invoked China."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-17T22:30:01Z", "title": "That Used to Be Us by Thomas L Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum \u2013 review", "tags": ["Politics", "Business and finance", "Books", "Tea Party movement", "Ronald Reagan", "George Bush", "US politics", "Culture"], "article": "There&apos;s a curious Dale Carnegie feel to this fascinating, chilling book. On the one hand, two great American gurus \u2013 from the New York Times and Johns Hopkins University respectively \u2013 pile on the doom of superpower decline. Funereal orations don&apos;t come much more devastating than this. But, on the other hand, they also roll out prescriptions for recovery as smoothly as travelling salesmen. Whatever happened to the American dream? Well, political partisanship \u2013 fanned by the 24-hour Fox News cycle \u2013 happened, so that the political system itself became snarlingly dysfunctional. Baby-boomer complacency happened: a George W Bush misreading of Ronald Reagan&apos;s deficit doctrine ordained too much heedless spending today with no thought of tomorrow. Drive and investment for future growth? In 2009, US consumers spent $7.1bn (\u00a34.5bn) on potato crisps while Washington spent $5.1bn (\u00a33.2bn) on energy research and development. Education? Tsinghua and Beijing universities are the biggest suppliers of PhDs in the US while &quot;49% of American adults do not know how long it takes the Earth to revolve round\u00a0the sun&quot;. Throw in rampant obesity, deadbeat teachers, feeble leaders, greedy bankers, ineffective regulators, gridlock, delusion, mountainous debts, puny growth prospects, pension black holes and the Tea Party movement \u2013 and what have you got? A catalogue of dismay that must, apparently, be tackled under four terse headings. First, a profound, discombobulating lack of focus \u2013 purpose lost since the cold war was won. No threat, no concentration. Second, a chronic failure to address obvious problems \u2013 education, energy shortages, climate change. Third, the abandonment of the formula, built on investment, industry and innovation, that made America strong. And, last, a bitter, intransigent hostility that has soured any attempt at consensus building. Make progress under all those headings and perhaps the dream can live again. It&apos;s an almighty ask as Friedman and Mandelbaum lay out their road to sunnier uplands: &quot;Learning, working, producing, relearning and innovating twice as hard, twice as fast, twice as often and twice as much&quot; \u2013 because globalisation means that there aren&apos;t any no-brainer white-collar or blue-collar jobs around any longer. Millions of jobs have vanished through this downturn and they&apos;re not coming back. You can, and in fact do have, many in manufacturing doing well, cranking out profits again. What you don&apos;t have is the employment that used to go with recovery. New jobs can only come from new enterprises, new ideas, new creativity. The old routines have lost relevance. The world of early George W, let alone Ronnie Reagan, is dead. This means not just transforming school education but finding ways of rescuing the millions of adults washed up on the cape of no hope by digital change. It means agreeing that science trumps religion, that Darwin trumps the Old Testament, that there is such a thing as global warming. It means putting up taxes to pay off debt and pay for wars as well as slashing spending that can&apos;t be afforded any longer. It means recapturing the spirit of the New Deal \u2013 working together, making common sacrifices for a common purpose. But in practical terms most of this seems pretty unlikely, going on totally impossible. Does consensus begin to bathe Capitol Hill in a kindly light as the 2012 election nears? Isn&apos;t Rick Perry, the most formidable Republican challenger, a global warming denier? Where does Michelle Bachman fit in? And as for the big emerging answer (from page 334 on)of &quot;shock therapy&quot; via a third-way push for the White House by some centrist-pragmatist who&apos;ll drag Republican and Democratic extremists back towards the middle, don&apos;t even bother to think about it. Friedman and Mandelbaum are probably right: most Americans want to keep their heads down, put meat and potatoes on the table, live a quiet, hard-working life. But &quot;most Americans&quot; don&apos;t run for political office, head giant corporations, or vote in party caucuses. They&apos;re outside the system until it&apos;s too late. There is, already, no way of making their voices heard. And this book is daunting because it doesn&apos;t only apply to superpower America but to shrunken-power UK. Much the same diagnosis; much the same lack of real remedies. Give Ken Clarke&apos;s &quot;feral underclass&quot; a chapter of its own, indeed, and we&apos;re in a worse longtime plight than we even glimpse now, challenged by a future that, frankly, pushes tinkering over free schools, aircraft carriers or bank restructuring towards irrelevance. As Friedman and Mandelbaum fundamentally argue, we haven&apos;t begun to wake up yet. There&apos;s no full-fledged appreciation of the mess we&apos;re in. So where do we go in search of modest reassurance, let alone cheer? Only into a slightly calmer, colder reading room where scarifying dust jackets don&apos;t keep citing Singapore and Finland as exemplars-cum-humiliators \u2013 menacing trailblazers alongside a ubiquitously invoked China. The city state Lee Kuan Yew built is bent on survival, not conquering the world. Homogeneous Helsinki is struggling to rescue Nokia. And modern China itself is a communist sub-dynasty built of the political straw of discipline and intimidation. Twenty years ago, Tom Friedman would have been transfixed by a surging Japan. Now it doesn&apos;t get a mention. There&apos;s little for your comfort from this expert, stirring dose of polemic and dismaying research \u2013 except, perversely, a muted reminder that in a world of proclaimed experts and digital snake oil vendors, we mutts in the middle have to keep muddling on somehow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/19/jamie-spencer-wigmore-hall-woodbine", "sentences": ["Michael Bell&apos;s four-year-old, whose four previous races had been in Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States, started favourite at 6-4 and beat Simmard by a neck."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-18T23:13:19Z", "title": "Jamie Spencer guides Wigmore Hall to Grade One success at Woodbine", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Frankie Dettori", "Johnny Murtagh", "Sport"], "article": "Wigmore Hall recorded the first Grade One success of his wide-ranging careeron Sunday when he took the Northern Dancer Turf at Woodbine in Canada.

Johnny actually rang up to congratulate everybody when we were in the winner&apos;s enclosure. &quot;It is going to be difficult a problem working out who will ride him at Ascot if he gets there. Johnny has ridden him to win a Wokingham and a Group Three and Frankie has ridden him to win two Group Threes.

While Japan&apos;s Nikkei was closed for a national holiday, Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng lost 2.4% and markets in Taiwan, Seoul, Singapore, Shanghai and Jakarta were down more than 1%. Oil prices also slipped, with Brent crude falling below $112 a barrel. Gold, seen as a safe haven investment, strengthened. Spot gold hit $1,824 an ounce. More austerity ahead? Greek prime minister George Papandreou has scrapped plans to attend the IMF meeting and held an emergency cabinet meeting on Sunday to discuss additional austerity measures, ahead of a crucial conference call with EU, European Central Bank and IMF officials \u2013 the troika \u2013 on Monday. This call will take place at 5pm BST, having been pushed back from an earlier start time of 1pm. The Greek government will continue its meeting after being told that the next tranche of the bailout, \u20ac8bn due at the end of the month, hinges on further belt-tightening. &quot;The timing of a Greek default remains in the hands of the troika and it is difficult to believe that they will decide to pull the plug at this stage because of the potential impact upon the other troubled sovereigns and the banking sector,&quot; said Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income at Evolution Securities. &quot;That said, who knows what contingency plans they have prepared behind closed doors (although the fact that they have leaked like a sieve throughout the crisis suggests we would have heard about them if they had \u2026) and on the day that all the ducks are lined up then that might be the day that support for Greece is withdrawn. However, comments from the German finance minister that &apos;membership in a monetary union is an opportunity, but also a heavy burden \u2026 the Greeks must decide whether they want to bear this burden&apos; might suggest that the endgame is nigh.&quot; Elsewhere, credit ratings agency Moody&apos;s is expected to announce within a month whether it plans to downgrade Italy&apos;s Aa2 rating, a move that could escalate the European debt crisis, although Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s already rates the country two notches lower at A+."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/19/kweku-adoboli-ubs-rogue-trader", "sentences": ["As it emerged the board of the Swiss bank was preparing to meet in Singapore, he urged staff to demonstrate to &quot;clients, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders&quot; that the bank would not be deflected from its long-term goals by the losses that the bank has said will drive it to a third quarter loss."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-20T01:19:00Z", "title": "Let's make good the $2.3bn loss, UBS investment banking chief tells his staff", "tags": ["Kweku Adoboli", "UBS", "Banking", "European banks", "Business"], "article": "The head of investment banking arm at UBS has defended the division in the wake of the $2.3bn (\u00a31.45bn) alleged rogue-trading scandal and urged staff to repair the &quot;financial damage&quot;.

This fact was brought home with news yesterday that a bottle of whisky has just been bought for \u00a3125,000, the highest price ever paid for a standard bottle of scotch. Of course with extravagant bonuses still sloshing around the banking world that kind of money is peanuts to some, but to spend it on one bottle? You could pick up a Porsche for that and still have change for a night out at Boujis. The key with all sales at this level is rarity. The whisky in question - a Dalmore &apos;62 which was sold at Singapore airport - was one of only 12, not all of which were released at the same time. Back in 2002 a bottle went for what then seemed an insane \u00a322,000 and in 2005 someone bought a bottle at a hotel bar for \u00a332,000 and drank almost all of it. But that was nothing - the lure of owning what no-one else can now buy - despite an immensely naff bottle which features a platinum stag&apos;s head - is seemingly worth over \u00a3100,000 more than it was 10 years ago. Such whiskies of course account for a minuscule fraction of the market but there are plenty of opportunities to dip a toe at a more affordable level. Distilleries these days are constantly releasing limited edition whiskies like Lagavulin&apos;s \u00a380 bottling for the Islay Jazz Festival this weekend which was matured at Caol Ila or The Macallan&apos;s Commemorative Royal Wedding Edition which sold for \u00a3150 on its release in April and now fetches roughly three times as much. There&apos;s a premium on any distillery which has closed, or single, unrepeatable casks of which there are a dwindling number. Industry giant Diageo for instance is releasing eight whiskies this year in its &quot;Special Releases&quot; series, five of which are from distilleries which have closed including the highly collectable Brora. Many fans devote themselves to collecting bottles from a single distillery. Joining a mailing list like Ardbeg&apos;s &quot;Committee&quot; will give you a chance to snap up new bottlings on release. When the first tranche of their new super-charred Alligator was made available in June it sold for a comparatively modest \u00a355. It&apos;s now selling for around \u00a3160, an easy profit for any committee member inclined to make a quick buck. The first commemorative bottling of Bruichladdich&apos;s new The Laddie 10, with an &quot;I was here&quot; sticker, sold out in three hours this weekend. As with all investments, whiskies can of course go down as well as up. Some bottlings, or &quot;expressions&quot; (as they&apos;re known among whisky anoraks) bomb but it seems that so long as you stick to big names like the Macallan, Bowmore and Ardbeg, genuinely limited editions (a couple of thousand bottles max) and are happy to drink the contents of anything that doesn&apos;t make your anticipated killing, you&apos;re unlikely to go far wrong in the current market. And whisky is much more forgiving than wine when it comes to storage. If you suddenly remember some disregarded bottle you never got round to drinking there are a number of whisky investment sites out there run by single malt nuts. Andy Simpson&apos;s whiskyhighland.co.uk and accompanying Facebook page is one, and there&apos;s also the relatively new scotchwhiskyauction.com set up by whisky fans Tam Gardiner and Bill Mackintosh. Established auctioneers such as Bonhams and McTears also hold regular whisky auctions. If you&apos;re lucky you might even pick up the odd bargain in what is now called &quot;travel retail&quot; (aka duty free) though probably not at Singapore airport. How much would you be prepared to pay for a bottle?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/sep/20/guardian-weekly-letters-23-september", "sentences": ["John Gee Singapore \u2022 Does not the startling statistic that 38% of Europe&apos;s population suffers a mental disorder each year (9 September) require a major collaborative response?"], "publicationDate": "2011-09-20T12:59:01Z", "title": "Guardian Weekly Letters, 23 September 2011", "tags": [], "article": "Crowd groupthink Your fine coverage of the recent British riots reminds us of the danger of applying crude and simplistic, value-laden, categories to the rioters in seeking to understand what makes them tick. As historian George Rud\u00e9 pointed out in the 1960s, our understanding of the crowd in popular disturbances throughout history has been hampered by a tendency to interpret it in terms of &quot;omnibus and prejudicial&quot; labels leaving us with an impression of such crowds as &quot;abstract phenomen[a] without face or identity&quot;. Disappointingly, this tendency is still evident in many of the public responses to the recent British riots. As an antidote to this your coverage has, in effect, asserted that the rioters last month were from a variety of backgrounds with differing motives all of which need to be identified and examined if these riots are to be understood. In particular, my hat off to Tim Adams for his article putting a human face to the rioters appearing in court against their wider \u2013 troubled \u2013 social context (Justice grinds on through the courts, 19 August). Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Time for rationality Regarding Jackie Ashley&apos;s good article (The danger of big-man politics, 9 September), the need for &quot;fact-based, deliberative&quot; decision making is best illustrated by George W Bush&apos;s presidency. As well, Canadians will see how Prime Minister Harper&apos;s &quot;big-man politics&quot; fares; he&apos;s done very well to silence most cabinet debate so far. I&apos;d like to add one other factor into the mix: it seems to me that where ideological thought prevails, nuanced, logical and practical decision-making succumbs to large egos particularly well. I heartily endorse Ashley&apos;s call to promote rational discussions of political issues, &quot;proper parliamentary debate and genuine cabinet involvement&quot;; these measures should also help limit partisan bickering and the infiltration of lobbyist-based policy making. Dave Scott Toronto, Canada Political tournaments Toby Manhire&apos;s article What the black jersey stands for (16 September) understates the connection between rugby and politics in New Zealand.\u00a0 The 1981 Springbok tour was divisive and led to mass protests. These incurred major policing costs. However, allowing it to proceed was a political calculation that paid off. It contributed to the Muldoon-led National government winning the election later that year \u2013 and thereafter a third term in office. For the Nationals, the loss of votes and seats in some urban areas was effectively offset by retention of many marginal electorates in the provinces where rugby was, and still is, very popular. The 2011 Rugby World Cup tournament is another example of a sporting event with political capital for an election year. The present National government will be hoping that six weeks of rugby translates into more support on election day in November. They will want to retain all the seats they won in 2008 and increase votes from rugby-loving constituencies such as the Pacific Island community in NZ. Ironically, interest in the political advantage to be gained from rugby isn&apos;t confined to the current government. Their Labour predecessors provided prime ministerial backing for the NZ Rugby Union&apos;s successful bid to host the current tournament. They also ensured continuing interest in the matter in cabinet by appointing a Minister for the Rugby World Cup. They initiated significant public spending, which continues today, on infrastructure critical to hosting the event. In New Zealand now, as 30 years ago, politics and rugby remain enmeshed, with governments prepared to calculate and spend accordingly to win office using the truly political football. Thomas F McGrath\u00a0\u00a0 Wellington, New Zealand Innocent flight In my early teens in the early 1980s, during which I, one who was (still am) nuts about commercial jetliners, would frequently take a public-transit to Vancouver International Airport (YVR) to observe and even mingle within all of the exciting travel-related activity. But that was during a time of &quot;innocence&quot; that, especially because of 9/11, is long gone and all but certain never to return. I&apos;d often test the limits of the seemingly almost YVR security by making my unauthorised way as far as the boarding gate. On one occasion I actually snuck so far that I could have stepped right through flimsy, swinging double doors to the cargo/luggage loading bays along with the docked jetliners; thus, I&apos;d be totally unobstructed in my path to touch, for example, the jet engine of a docked 747. And when a friend and I would decide to spend the entire night at YVR it was a virtual dead zone. If we happened to be confronted, we would have simply and successfully claimed that we&apos;d missed the last connector bus here-or-there that would have got us home to White Rock. Back then there was innocence. Frank G Sterle, Junior Vancouver, Canada Joining forces Leo Hickman&apos;s article persuasively outlines the immeasurable advantages of fusion (9 September). It also lists some of the reasons for an absence of international commitment and coordination in the drive for its advancement Among the missing factors are the capital and running costs of the research, the requirement to develop other energy sources for the transition years until fusion is marketable and the uncertainty of the outcome. Forecasting is impossible. Who in 1918 would have believed that in less than 30 years scientists would split the atom? China is investing heavily in fusion technology. Massive market opportunities are invoked by Professor Cowley: the global energy market runs at a modest $5-6 trillion.\u00a0\u00a0 It is strange to think that the oil moguls, with such huge vested interests, do not feature in the article&apos;s diagnosis of absent partners. Sadly, the cynical view is that the oil giants stand to make maximum profits by entering the arena in the last stages of the race. A game that plays for such high stakes, as the health of our planet and a future that is not disfigured by war, should not be allowed to fall into the hands of such players. Dr Mich\u00e8le Young Brighton, UK In memoriam At the 9/11 ceremonies at Ground Zero, nearly 3,000 names were read out, with moving simple dignity. The task took some four hours, including personal tributes. The time taken to read each actual name was about 3 seconds, so the unadorned name reading took two and half hours. To read out the 600,000 names of civilian dead in the Iraq war \u2013this is The Lancet&apos;s estimate, halfway between a low figure of 100,000 and a high one of 1,000,000 \u2013 it would take nearly three weeks. To read out the 2,000,000 names of the Vietnamese war dead (the high figure, Vietnam war casualties generally being defined as &quot;somewhere between one and two million&quot;), it would take the best part of two and a half months. Simon Pleasance Ribaute, France Stay light Though a strong correlation between sun exposure and skin cancer is pretty well documented (A happier shade of pale for me, 9 September), most sunbathers live under the delusion that they can neglect the risk because the frequency of skin melanoma, the most aggressive type, is only about 50 new cases per year per 100,000, in light-skinned populations. Moreover, UV rays from the sun cause another skin damage, much milder, but from which no one sunbather can eventually escape, whatever the type of skin protection he or she uses: the accelerated fragmentation of the subcutaneous elastic fibres, with the irreversible loss of skin elasticity, a typical characteristics of skin ageing. Sunbathe, be nicely tanned, but, within some years, be prepared to look much older prematurely, and do not expect that expensive anti-wrinkles creams will help. Jean-Marie Gillis, MD Belgium Briefly Tom Kington (9 September) writes of the proliferation of padlocks on Italian bridges since the appearance of Federico Moccia&apos;s novel featuring a couple who attach a padlock to Rome&apos;s Milvian bridge as a sign of eternal love. When I visited the Huangshan area of China about 10\u00a0years ago, I saw a few places high up on the mountain paths where visitors had attached hundreds of padlocks to railings until there was no space to attach another. John Gee Singapore \u2022 Does not the startling statistic that 38% of Europe&apos;s population suffers a mental disorder each year (9 September) require a major collaborative response?

Directors will also look at the future of Carsten Kengeter, head of UBS&apos;s investment banking operations, which lie at the heart of the scandal that has rocked the Swiss establishment. English boarding school-educated Kweku Adoboli, a 31-year-old derivatives trader, was charged with fraud and false accounting when he appeared before London magistrates on Friday. He faces allegations of misdemeanours that go back as far as 2008, and was remanded in custody. Adoboli worked in the bank&apos;s so-called delta-one trading section which invests in exchange traded funds, allowing speculators to bet on price rises in a range of commodities and stock market indices. The UBS board meeting, arranged prior to disclosure of the trading scandal, is being held in Singapore, home of the bank&apos;s biggest shareholder, GIC, a sovereign wealth fund that acquired a 6.4% stake three years ago. In a rare public statement, GIC expressed regret at the failure of the bank&apos;s risk management controls to detect the losses, and urged UBS &quot;to take firm action to restore confidence in the bank&quot;. UBS&apos;s top brass will also decide over the whether to accelerate plans that could lead to a contraction of UBS&apos;s investment bank, which employs several thousand staff in London. The fixed income desk, which is smaller than most of the bank&apos;s international rivals&apos;, is viewed as particularly vulnerable, but other activities, such as equities trading, could also be reined in following the scandal. Another option is for the bank to outlaw proprietary trading, where an institution makes financial bets by using its own money. The bank is anxious to protect the reputation of its core business: the wealth management division that looks after the financial interests of the global rich. Gr\u00fcbel was quoted by Swiss newspapers as saying he would &quot;bear the consequences&quot; of the scandal, although he didn&apos;t want to quit. During the financial crisis, it emerged UBS had lost billions by investing in sub-prime mortgages. At the same time it was the target of a lengthy US investigation into claims it helped American clients avoid taxes. Gr\u00fcbel, who had restored the fortunes of Credit Suisse, was recruited to do the same at UBS, founded in 1854. City sources said the magnitude of the rogue trading scandal had been concealed by elaborate hedging of the bank&apos;s exposure that led to delays in winding down huge positions in equity futures.

The FTSE 100 index in London plunged 266 points to 5022, a 5% drop. Other European markets also suffered heavy losses. In Asia, the Nikkei closed down 2.1%, Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng tumbled 4.9% and the Jakarta stock market lost nearly 9%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index fell 3% in early trading, down 346 points at 10,778. The sell-off came after the Fed unveiled a $400bn (\u00a3260bn) bond-buying plan on Wednesday to ward off a double-dip recession. Investors rushed to the safety of the US dollar, driving the pound down by one and a half cents to $1.5328, the lowest level since September 2010. The gold price also fell, losing almost $50 an ounce to $1,729. The City had been &quot;left reeling&quot; by the sharply negative tone adopted by the Fed on Wednesday night, when it warned that the US economic recovery was at risk, said Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index. &quot;The negative tone struck by the Fed in terms of the serious headwinds and downside risks facing the US economy sent a ripple through the markets,&quot; said Raymond. In Europe, the European Central Bank came under pressure to take action itself after a worsening in the services and manufacturing sectors sparked warnings that the economic recovery was definitely over. This was exacerbated by news that industrial orders in the eurozone slid for the second month in a row in July. Federal Reserve gloom The Fed&apos;s open markets committee said the economic outlook had deteriorated sharply, noting there were &quot;significant downside risks&quot; to its economic forecasts and indicating that a full recovery was years away. &quot;Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labour market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated,&quot; it said. This drove the Dow Jones down 2.5% on Wednesday, while the Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s 500 index lost 3%. The dollar hit a seven-month high on Thursday as investors scrambled for safety. Commodities tumbled on news that Chinese factory output had shrunk for a third month in September as flagging overseas demand put the brakes on new orders. Brent crude oil lost more than $2 to $107.50 a barrel, while US crude dropped $3 to $82.92 a barrel. Copper lost 3.3% on the London Metal Exchange, falling to a 10-month low of $8,028.75 a tonne. &quot;It is another blow after the Fed&apos;s language about downside risks on the economy really hurt sentiment,&quot; David Thurtell of Citigroup in Singapore told Reuters. The Fed&apos;s move came on same day that the Bank of England was also getting ready to pump more money into the British economy. Double twist &quot;Operation Twist&quot;, named after a similar measure launched in the 1960s under President Kennedy, will see the Fed buying $400bn (\u00a3258bn) of long-term Treasury bonds by June 2012 and selling shorter-term debts. The measure is aimed at driving down long-term interest rates across the economy, in an attempt to reduce the cost of borrowing for indebted homeowners and struggling firms. In another effort to help the ailing US housing market, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, said that as the mortgage-backed securities it owns matured, it would reinvest the proceeds in buying new mortgage bonds. Economists called the measures a &quot;double twist&quot;. Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income at Evolution Securities, said: &quot;Twist and doubt? You have to hand it to the Fed. They have gone all retro on us and persuaded the market to call their latest attempt at intervention &apos;Operation Twist&apos; rather than &apos;QE 3&apos;. The latter might imply that the first two attempts didn&apos;t quite work out as hoped so far better to change the name.&quot; He added: &quot;The basic idea is of course to stimulate economic growth by persuading investors into risk assets \u2026 the one thing that is clear is that Mr Bernanke is prepared to use all the weapons in his armoury in order to try and ensure that the US does not enter a long period of low growth, so Operation Twist may not be the last intervention unless it works. And of course the UK is about to follow suit.&quot; Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, was not convinced Operation Twist would do much good. &quot;The big question is whether this latest action will accomplish anything. We doubt it. Judging by the modest rally in 10-year treasury yields since the announcement, most of this was already priced in. &quot;More generally, the cost of borrowing simply isn&apos;t the problem. Businesses don&apos;t have the confidence to invest and half of all mortgage borrowers don&apos;t have the home equity needed to refinance at lower rates.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/22/kweku-adoboli-faces-fourth-charge", "sentences": ["The bank&apos;s board is meeting on Thursday and Friday in Singapore, where chief executive Oswald Gr\u00fcbel, parachuted in to UBS in 2009 when the Zurich-based bank was on the brink of collapse, is determined to secure his future.", "The board meetings are being held in Singapore to coincide with the Formula One grand prix, of which UBS is a major sponsor."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-22T17:02:00Z", "title": "Kweku Adoboli faces fourth charge", "tags": ["Kweku Adoboli", "UBS", "Banking", "European banks", "Business"], "article": "Kweku Adoboli, the 31-year-old charged with fraud and false accounting at UBS, was remanded in custody until 20 October on Thursday after learning he also faced a second fraud charge.

The head of UBS&apos;s investment banking arm, Carsten Kengeter, has urged staff to work hard to repair the &quot;financial damage&quot; caused by the alleged incident, which the bank has admitted will tip it will tip it to a loss in the third quarter. The traditional year-end bonuses for UBS staff are now in jeopardy unless ways can be found to bolster profitability again. The board meetings are being held in Singapore to coincide with the Formula One grand prix, of which UBS is a major sponsor. The board is expected to discuss the bank&apos;s strategy for its investment bank amid speculation that the fixed income division and the proprietary trading arm \u2013 where the bank uses its own money to bet on markets \u2013 will be scaled back. UBS had promised an update on its strategy on 17 November at a previously arranged investor meeting in New York, although any announcement may now be brought forward. Adoboli was a trader on the bank&apos;s &quot;delta one desk&quot; and, among other things, traded ETFs. Other banks are known to have reviewed the trading activities of their delta one desks since the allegations about Adoboli were made."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/22/britain-tax-deal-switzerland-eu", "sentences": ["It also loses a big opportunity: it could easily have brought the foreign branches of Swiss banks in Singapore and other places into its scope \u2013 but, inexplicably, it does not."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-22T18:42:16Z", "title": "Britain's sordid Swiss tax deal is doomed to failure | Nicholas Shaxson", "tags": ["Tax avoidance", "Politics", "Switzerland", "Banking", "UK news", "Germany", "Tax and spending", "Europe", "World news", "Business", "Crime", "Foreign policy"], "article": "The UK is about to sign an agreement with Switzerland under which Swiss banks levy taxes on secret Swiss accounts held by UK tax evaders, while keeping those accounts secret. The UK says the deals will raise billions. It is bad enough that these deals sabotage major European efforts to tax their citizens properly and to penetrate secret banking, and that wealthy criminals will get impunity. But\u00a0there&apos;s an even stronger objection to\u00a0these deals: they will fail, raising only a tiny fraction of what has been promised. After all, Swiss banks are supposed to deduct up to 34% from their clients&apos; capital assets, then impose taxes of up to 48% on the subsequent income. Given how massive a chunk this will take out of these assets and income, it is astonishing there&apos;s been hardly a murmur of protest from Swiss bankers or their clients. The bankers are even purring about how fair it is. The details are not yet published but we now have a good idea. This week Switzerland published the text of a parallel agreement with Germany, which the Swiss have said is essentially the same as the UK deal except for the tax rates. Taking them at their word, we can now see how both deals will fail. Banks are supposed to withhold taxes first on the initial capital, then on interest, capital gains and capital income owned by their UK taxpayer clients. Now, a Swiss bank would rarely hold John Smith&apos;s account in the name of &quot;John Smith&quot; but in the name of, say, ABC Liechtenstein foundation or XYZ discretionary trust. Swiss sources indicate that some private banks don&apos;t hold a single account in an individual&apos;s name. The German deal claims to tackle these structures by saying the tax will fall on the people that have the right to use these assets. But foundations and discretionary trusts are exceedingly slippery. Although someone is always ultimately behind them, from a legal point of view nobody has the rights to their assets. That is the whole point of these things! And if you can&apos;t identify who has legal rights to the assets, you can&apos;t say if the person ultimately behind it is British, German, Nigerian or Martian. So the bank can&apos;t apply the UK-Swiss deal to it and withhold the upfront capital tax. It may perhaps find out the identities when the structure finally makes a distribution, but this may be decades later and may be paid out as loans or fees, say, which fall outside the deal&apos;s scope. There&apos;s a much better way to go about all this. European countries already have a multilateral agreement to collect tax and share information about interest earned by each others&apos; citizens. The European savings tax directive covers EU countries plus Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Britain&apos;s crown dependencies (such as Jersey) and overseas territories (such as Cayman) and others. (The non-EU members have agreed to participate by adopting equivalent measures.) The directive is full of holes, partly because of the above loophole, and has raised a tiny fraction of the amounts originally expected: Jersey, with \u00a3165bn in bank deposits, paid out just \u00a34m last year under the scheme, a miniscule fraction of what you might expect. But major EU amendments coming soon will give the directive serious teeth, using concepts never before wielded in international tax. It will make the management of the structure, rather than the bank, responsible for collecting the tax. It will either identify the individual who initially contributed the assets, or apply the tax when the structure pays out. The German deal misses these clever tricks, which are essential for success. It also loses a big opportunity: it could easily have brought the foreign branches of Swiss banks in Singapore and other places into its scope \u2013 but, inexplicably, it does not. It has several other big loopholes, which help explain why Swiss bankers are so happy with the deals. The only upfront money the UK is sure to receive will be small payments from accounts in individuals&apos; own names. I&apos;d be surprised if this collects more than a 10th of the envisaged sums. In early 2010 Switzerland, under strong EU pressure, was at last showing signs of considering serious moves towards transparency. This deal, and the German one with Switzerland, sabotage political progress. Swiss shutters are down again. As a tax adviser put it: &quot;Britain and Germany will destroy so much \u2013 for tuppence.&quot; The German deal faces massive political resistance and looks likely to get shot down in the German parliament, leaving the UK out on a limb. Britain should scrap this bilateral deal and throw its weight behind EU measures, which would raise major tax revenues and seek widespread multilateral information exchange as the ultimate long-term goal. Nobody pretends this will be easy. But it is far better than the UK&apos;s sordid deal \u2013 which cannot work anyway. \u2022 For a more in-depth report on this issue, visit the Tax Justice Network"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/22/rivals-f1-title-sebastian-vettel", "sentences": ["Hamilton, who trails the champion elect by 126 points in fifth place, congratulated Vettel on the plane to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-22T21:00:03Z", "title": "Rivals concede F1 title to Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel", "tags": ["Formula One 2011", "Sebastian Vettel", "Lewis Hamilton", "Jenson Button", "Fernando Alonso", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button have anointed Sebastian Vettel Formula One world champion with six races to go and given effusive praise to Red Bull&apos;s German driver. Vettel can clinch the title here on Sunday to become, at 24, the youngest double world champion, beating the record of Fernando Alonso, who was 25 when he won it for the second time in 2006. But it is already over according to the McLaren drivers, whose team have been reluctant to concede the title with as many as 150 points still to be won. Hamilton, who trails the champion elect by 126 points in fifth place, congratulated Vettel on the plane to Singapore. He said: &quot;I saw Sebastian on the flight out here and said: &apos;Look at you \u2013 you are about to win the world championship.&apos; &quot;I just said one thing as I came out of the toilet. He is pretty much on his way to winning, realistically. He has finished first and second in almost every race, except for one where he finished fourth. So he has done fantastically well this year. His consistency and maturity, I think, have been impressive. I take my hat off to him.&quot; Hamilton said Vettel is not showing the pressure as he closes in on the title. &quot;He has no appearance of that. I asked him what he had done since the last race and he said; &apos;Nothing, I&apos;ve been at home.&apos; &quot;He has got a very, very relaxed life \u2013 not flying here and there. If I was in that position I think I would be very much at ease, especially if I had a 120-points gap to everyone else. I don&apos;t think there is an ounce of pressure on him.&quot; Third-placed Button, who on current form has almost matched Vettel with three podium positions in as many races, also heaped on the praise. The 2009 world champion said: &quot;The championship is over. You can&apos;t take it away from Seb. You can&apos;t say he hasn&apos;t come through the pack because he&apos;s been too quick for everyone else. It&apos;s not a weakness. &quot;I can only think of two races where I&apos;ve actually raced Seb this year, and both times I&apos;ve finished in front. That was Canada and Hungary. The other races I haven&apos;t seen him. That&apos;s basically because he&apos;s done so well in qualifying. He has done a phenomenal job on a Saturday. And the team have with the car.&quot; Even Alonso, Vettel&apos;s closest challenger, who is 112 points behind, joined in the celebration of Vettel&apos;s brilliant talent. He said: &quot;He&apos;s driving fantastically. I think this year he has made no mistakes or very few mistakes. &quot;Last year we had a bigger chance. I think the Red Bull was very dominant also last year but had some trouble in some races. This year they improved all those problems. The car is as quick as last year. He has finished all the races. I think he&apos;s the only driver who has finished all the races, plus he&apos;s driving very, very well. &quot;When you have a dominant car it&apos;s easy to get a pole position or win a race, but there have been some occasions this year when the conditions were very tricky, like Canada or Silverstone, and he managed to pull a perfect lap in qualifying and a perfect race from the start to the end. &quot;He has been the best driver, and the best team and the best package, so they deserve to be where they are.&quot; Alonso, when asked if he had given up any hope of winning the title this year, said: &quot;Yes.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/market-research-careers", "sentences": ["Jessica started her career in export marketing for a Scottish electronics manufacturer before specialising in consumer qualitative research at Research International in London and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-23T10:51:00Z", "title": "Live Q&A: Routes into market research", "tags": ["Guardian Careers", "Live Q&A", "Forums", "All sectors", "Graduate", "Jobs"], "article": "Whatever you made of the 2010 general election, I bet you remember those squiggly worms.

He has also signed a round robin letter telling the G20 to get its finger out and sort things out at the Cannes summit in (wait for it) November. So should it be &quot;well done, Dave&quot; or &quot;who do you think you are, matey \u2013 Gordon Brown?&quot;? A bit of both, but mainly the latter, I think \u2013 especially on a day when Peter (&quot;a better class of conspiracy theory&quot;) Oborne, the posh populist pundit, has run amok on Europe (again). French and German policymakers looking at Britain can hardly be over-impressed by what they see of our own economy and wider society. Like Margaret Thatcher before him, Gordon Brown used to dip into Brussels to lecture those pesky foreigners \u2013 with the speech heavily briefed in advance \u2013 on the &quot;British economic miracle&quot;. He would then dash home for some reassuring porridge rather than eat those disgusting croissants. At least Brown grasped that the banks had to be recapitalised in the post-Lehman crash of 2008 \u2013 this at a time when Dave&apos;n&apos;George were still against it \u2013 and at least he put some heft behind the rhetoric in organising London&apos;s G20 summit, in April 2009, which staved off another Great Depression (until now?). The coalition (&quot;we saved Britain from being another Greece&quot;) has usually seemed content to squabble at home about what to do next while lecturing others abroad from the sidelines. Thus the deflationary impulses that come naturally to any postwar government in Berlin (it&apos;s been in their potty training since it took Germans 2m marks to buy a sandwich) are shared by the Lib-Con coalition in London, whose Treasury is much more deeply in fiscal deficit, though not accumulated debt, than Germany&apos;s. Both countries have enough slack, and enough austerity credibility in the markets, to ease off a bit and help restore demand to the stricken north Atlantic economy. Who says so? Why, Christine Lagarde, the former French (Tory) finance minister, now the French IMF chief. But no, the pressure from the restless rightwing of the Conservative party is all in the opposite direction. Cut more deeply and, while you&apos;re about it, seize this moment of eurozone weakness to loosen your ties with Brussels as the price of co-operating to reform the zone, say some. Break the zone up by engineering Greek or (the other way around) German withdrawal, others blithely assert. On the party&apos;s wilder shores \u2013 Mark Pritchard MP wrote in the Telegraph that EU membership amounts to military occupation, the twerp \u2013 there is even talk of the biggest cut of all: cutting off EU membership. This is depressing stuff. We live in a fast-declining region of the world where the economy is flat to falling, in contrast to 8% growth and more across much of east Asia. Talk of faltering growth or a bursting property bubble in China is not good news, for them or for us. Europe&apos;s leaders must find a way to create a model for regional solidarity and co-operation that works \u2013 it&apos;s not working very well at present \u2013 and of persuading their voters at home that it is all worth the trouble. Whether we like it or not, we are part of Europe, part of the north Atlantic community. Even the new Times atlas, the one that shrank the Greenland ice cap, confirms that. Unlike those hedge fund managers in Mayfair, we can&apos;t just all move to Hong Kong or Singapore (which this week ticked off UBS for messing up its portfolio of bank investments again with that &quot;rogue&quot; trader). Put another way, if Greece goes bust in a disorderly way (a structured default of some kind seems inevitable), then a lot of French and German banks catch a serious bout of flu. If the contagion spreads to Spain or Ireland \u2013 it would \u2013 our battered banks take a fresh beating, too. No one wins \u2013 not even the Chinese, who depend on US and EU import markets to keep their own restless and repressed (economically as well as politically) voters sort of happy. Yet HMG, busy strutting the international stage as the saviours of Libya, with borrowed US bombs and fingers crossed, seems more content to play domestic politics with the European question for fear of Ukip, the Daily Express and other paper tigers that prey on elderly voters. William Hague had a bad attack of Euro-pandering before the election, but seemed to be settling into a more pragmatic mindset once he was safely, if sadly, installed as the foreign secretary. I hear the diplomats do not like him much, but that is not automatically a bad sign. Enter, stage right, Oborne and his co-author, Frances Weaver, who have penned a pamphlet for the Thatcherite but still not expired thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), called, without any sense of irony, Guilty Men \u2013 a tribute to the hugely successful and thoroughly dishonest pamphlet that Michael Foot (sic) wrote for his chum, Lord Beaverbrook (sic) in 1940. Foot&apos;s purpose was to make sure that the Chamberlain wing of the Tory party got the blame for the policy of appeasement towards Hitler, which had collapsed with the occupation of Prague in March 1939 and the invasion of Poland \u2013 courtesy of Stalin \u2013 six months later. No mention of Beaverbrook&apos;s role (&quot;there will be no war in Europe this year or next&quot;, his papers proclaimed on the masthead every day until the final hour), or of the Labour party&apos;s deluded belief in collective security until the end. Both redeemed their honour in the war that followed. That&apos;s how life works, but Guilty Men was a brazen bit of revisionism for which Beaverbrook once joked that he, not Footie, should have collected the royalties. Now to 2011. Oborne/Weaver&apos;s thesis \u2013 they are never less than grandiose where Oborne is concerned \u2013 is that Britain was systematically betrayed by its elites into selling a once-proud nation into subservience to Europe over a period of 60-odd years. You can buy the pamphlet here for a tenner, but I wouldn&apos;t bother. You can read a potted version by the authors in yesterday&apos;s Telegraph here \u2013 a newspaper, incidentally, where &quot;something went wrong&quot; (Oborne and Weaver&apos;s phrase about the FT) about seven years ago after it fell into the hands of the Barclay Brothers. Or there&apos;s a laudatory online review in the American National Review, with which these chaps have close links. Or you can read the ex-ambassador Peter Jay, in today&apos;s Times, with a tremendous rant that rests heavily on his recollection of hearing Jean Monnet voice French ambitions to restore the country&apos;s lost glory via the new EU. Jay, whose father, Douglas, was a famous Europhobe and Labour grandee too, was 15 at the time. Oborne&apos;s thesis (sorry, Frances Weaver, I&apos;m sure you worked hard \u2013 but it sounds like him, not you) is that the three most guilty institutions in the plot are the Financial Times, the CBI \u2013 headed, until this spring, by an ex-FT editor \u2013 and, of course, the BBC. He aired this view on Radio 4&apos;s Today programme this morning, taking a poke at Jim Naughtie as typical of the breed. Even John Humphrys (I suspect we all know his EU line) felt moved to defend the corporation. I have to concede that I see Oborne&apos;s point. There are days when the great and good sound as shifty and dishonest, as crudely partisan as he describes. As someone who voted Yes in the 1975 referendum (along with Thatcher and Jimmy Goldsmith) but would not have voted Yes to the single currency (unlike assorted Trots and lefties who were No voters in 1975), I routinely note in this spot the noisy silence of most champions of British membership of the euro just a few years back. Nick Clegg had a try on air this week, and wasn&apos;t very good. But making mistakes and keeping quiet about them is one thing, accusing others of a thumping great conspiracy is another. As Ian Traynor wrote this week, the Euro-federalists think their hour has come at last. As the euro staggers, they have a case in logic for greater fiscal and budgetary integration in which Britain will not take part if \u2013 if \u2013 it happens. But this is the result of a continent-sized cock-up, not a plot. As Denis MacShane MP, one of those lefties who swung from hard No in 1975 to fervent Yes today, reminded Oborne on the radio, the editor of Today at the time when all these pro-Europeans were allegedly forcing propaganda down out throats was Rod Liddle, now famous as an exhibitionist columnist wherever they will print his often shabby stuff. What turned me against Andrew Gilligan was not the lad&apos;s dodgy reporting of the dodgy Iraq war dossiers, but some conspiratorial rubbish he dug up about the EU much earlier \u2013 rubbish on which, if memory serves, Hot Rod led his programme. And wasn&apos;t Sir Geoffrey Howe \u2013 possibly Britain&apos;s greatest postwar chancellor, Oborne says in today&apos;s Telegraph column \u2013 eventually prepared to resign over Thatcher&apos;s hostility to Europe? I believe he was. Britain is in acute economic difficulty, facing hard choices about the balance between deficit-cutting and seeking to nurture growth. So is Europe, where Germany&apos;s beggar-my-neighbours approach will beggar Germany too, unless Angela Merkel uses her newly acquired breathing space from six damaging regional elections (none due until 2013) to show more creative leadership. As for the US, let&apos;s not go there today \u2013 but it is bad. That fact alone ought to induce a sense of wary humility in British Eurosceptic breasts. Yes, they got some things right about the EU, including the flawed, over-ambitious architecture of the euro. Thatcher was right to take us into the single market, too \u2013 well done her. But they got a lot wrong as well, not least their excessive faith in the unbridled free market model, whose excesses have done so much to damage the mighty US economy, and wider society, in recent years. The Chinese have been taking notes, as well as dollar notes, and are not impressed. So this is a time for cool heads and leadership, not conspiracy theories and pompous, bogus passion. The last thing we need is what MacShane wittily called, in memory of the great anti-Jewish smear, the Protocols of the Elders of Europe."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/23/ubs-board-meeting-grubel-adoboli", "sentences": ["The Swiss bank&apos;s chief executive, Oswald Gr\u00fcbel, who is under fire over alleged &quot;unauthorised trading&quot; by Kweku Adoboli in London, left the meeting at the bank&apos;s Singapore office without commenting on his future.", "UBS&apos;s largest shareholder, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, made a rare public intervention this week to call on the management to &quot;take firm action to restore confidence in the bank&quot;.", "The board meeting is taking place in Singapore to coincide with the country&apos;s Grand Prix on Sunday: the Swiss bank is a major sponsor of the event and a well- known banking name in Asia."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-23T17:26:14Z", "title": "No let-up in pressure on Gr\u00fcbel as UBS board meeting takes weekend off", "tags": ["UBS", "Kweku Adoboli", "Business"], "article": "  A crucial meeting of the board of embattled Swiss bank UBS is to resume in the coming days after pausing on Friday (23 September) after nine hours of discussion dominated by the $2.3bn alleged rogue trading incident.

An AFP reporter on the scene said he made no response when asked, &quot;Were you fired?&quot; and, &quot;Did you lose your job?&quot; The bank has admitted that it faces losing $2.3bn \u2013 an early estimate put it at $2bn \u2013 and will plunge to a third-quarter loss as a result of the unauthorised trading activities, which the Financial Services Authority and Swiss regulator Finma are now investigating. Accountants from KPMG \u2013 not Deloitte as originally thought \u2013 have now been appointed to run the investigation, which will be paid for UBS. The bank confirmed that the board meeting had not finished. &quot;The meeting has not ended,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;The board has only finished for today.&quot; The bank had already promised to present an overhaul of its business to investors in New York on 17 November, but the discovery of the trading loss has piled pressure on Gr\u00fcbel to accelerate the review. He was expected to advocate some scaling-back of the investment banking division even before the losses but is resisting calls from some Swiss politicians to break up the bank to safeguard its private banking division. Jobs in London, where the bank employs 6,000, are expected to be under threat as the loss almost wipes out the planned $1.5bn of cost savings that the bank hoped to make after announcing 3,500 job cuts across the group in August. Adoboli, who has been charged with two counts of fraud and two counts of false accounting, remains in custody after being arrested in the early hours of Thursday morning a week ago. The 31-year-old British-educated Ghanian has yet to enter a ple a to the charges, some of which date back to 2008. He will appear in court next month for a committal hearing.

Gr\u00fcbel has made it clear that he has no intention of resigning, and there is a concern that even if he did step aside the bank has no obvious successor. Others may be forced to resign ahead of him in what is eventually expected to be a sweeping change to the management team.

There are things that I could have done differently but what has happened has happened. I look forward and try to make sure they don&apos;t happen again.

Button had to abandon his car early on when his brakes locked at turn 14 and he was unable to get the car into reverse. He finished 10th and looked a dejected figure as he traipsed back to the pits. Hamilton, fastest in the first practice run, was beaten by Vettel and his old adversary Fernando Alonso in the second and had to settle for third place. There was also frustration for the third British driver, Paul Di Resta, who spent most of the session in the pits while mechanics worked on his Force India car. The first practice session was less than an hour long because of repair work to the track. Hamilton finished top, ahead of the Red Bull pair of Vettel and Mark Webber, with Alonso fourth and Button fifth.

With Kweku Adoboli, the 31-year-old alleged rogue trader facing four charges of fraud and false accounting still in custody, Oswald Gr\u00fcbel resigned to &quot;bear full responsibility for what occurs&quot; at the bank, which employs 6,000 people in the UK. Gr\u00fcbel, hauled out of retirement in 2009 when the bank was crippled by the credit crunch, issued a heartfelt farewell message to staff to explain his resignation, although only a week ago he insisted he did not feel the need to quit. &quot;That it was possible for one of our traders in London to inflict a multibillion loss on our bank through unauthorised trading shocked me, as it did everyone else, deeply,&quot; he said. Adoboli is yet to enter a plea to the charges \u2013 which date back to 2008 \u2013 that he faces and is next due in the City of London magistrates court on 20 October. A trader on the so-called &quot;delta one&quot; desk, he has not applied for bail. &quot;This incident has worldwide repercussions, including political ones. I did not take the step of resigning lightly,&quot; Gr\u00fcbel said. The bank was adamant that the 67-year-old German would leave with pay for the six months he has worked this year and no more, which amounts to around SFR 1.5m (\u00a31.1m). Gr\u00fcbel&apos;s acknowledgement of the worldwide repercussions comes amid calls for investment banks to split off from high street banking operations and the need for investment banks to become less like &quot;casinos&quot; and more focused on their clients. Politicians in the UK have already used the incident as a reason to implement the recommendations by the Independent Commission on Banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, to &quot;ringfence&quot; high street banks from investment banks. On Saturday, UBS pledged to adopt a more &quot;client-centric strategy&quot; and accelerate an ongoing review of its investment banking activities, which could create more jobs in the City. Some 3,500 cuts had been announced across the group even before the trading loss emerged. Other senior bankers are expected to follow Gr\u00fcbel out of the door once the internal investigation into the incident \u2013 which will drive the bank to a loss in the third quarter and caused anxiety among insiders about their bonuses \u2014 is completed in the next 10 days or so, Chairman Kaspar Villiger, who stressed his &quot;regret&quot; at the incident, acknowledged the need for change to adopt to the &quot;new paradigm&quot; in financial markets. The search is now on for a permanent successor at the bank which had just begun to restore some confidence among investors after $50bn of losses during the credit crunch and a row with the US tax authorities. Sergio Ermotti, already a director, is to take over for the time being. Careful not to predict the impact on jobs, UBS admitted that &quot;certain business areas&quot; needed to be reviewed . But the board of the bank, which had met in Singapore ahead of the Grand Prix of which UBS is a major sponsor, rejected calls for a full-scale break up and stressed the detail will be presented on 17 November at an investor meeting in New York. Villiger said: &quot;In the future, the investment bank will be less complex, carry less risk and use less capital to produce reliable returns and contribute more optimally to UBS&apos;s overall objectives.&quot; In a memo to staff, Villiger urged them to remain focused. &quot;Please do not allow yourselves to get involved in speculation,&quot; he wrote. He revealed that the board had tried to convince Gr\u00fcbel, a veteran and highly regarded banker, not to quit until the annual meeting next year but Villiger said Gr\u00fcbel would not stay. &quot;It is testimony to his uncompromising principles and integrity,&quot; he said of the former chief executive who has now returned to Zurich after the meeting in Singapore where he was mobbed by reporters asking him if he intended to quit when he left the nine-hour marathon session on Friday night."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/24/vettel-pole-singapore-grand-prix", "sentences": ["Sebastian Vettel may have moved a step closer to his second world title when he won pole position for the 11th time this season before today&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix, but Jenson Button and Mark Webber are well positioned to prompt the cancellation of Red Bull&apos;s celebration party."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-24T17:23:39Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel wins 11th pole of season for Singapore Grand Prix", "tags": ["Sebastian Vettel", "Mark Webber", "Jenson Button", "Lewis Hamilton", "Felipe Massa", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Sebastian Vettel may have moved a step closer to his second world title when he won pole position for the 11th time this season before today&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix, but Jenson Button and Mark Webber are well positioned to prompt the cancellation of Red Bull&apos;s celebration party. It looked good for McLaren when their British pair of Lewis Hamilton and Button went top of the timings in the final qualifying session but then Vettel went out again to go top by half a second for his 26th career pole, suggesting that he had been holding something back all the time. His only real challenge at the end came from his team-mate Webber, but he had to settle for second on today&apos;s grid, with Button third. Vettel said afterwards: &quot;I think the circuit ramped up at the end and I think it was possible to go faster but I&apos;m very happy. &quot;It&apos;s a very difficult track with such a long lap to get everything right. I think we learned from our mistakes that we made last year. Let&apos;s see tomorrow as it&apos;s a very long race,&quot; he added. After his best grid position here, Webber said: &quot;The championship may be boring but the racing this season has been awesome. I&apos;m happy. It&apos;s been a very testing venue for me in the past. Sebastian laid it down pretty hard and fast. Obviously he was very quick. I&apos;m satisfied given the curved ball teams can face at this track. Both cars are up there so it&apos;s a great result.&quot; If Vettel wins today he will take the title but only if neither Webber nor Button are second and Fernando Alonso is kept off the podium. Button said: &quot;Both my laps. If I had put them both together it would have been good but you struggle to get it all together round here through all three sectors. &quot;It&apos;s something I&apos;ve been fighting all day. I didn&apos;t get much running yesterday so I&apos;m pleased to be in the top three and it&apos;s a good position to be in for the race tomorrow. It&apos;s going to be a challenge,&quot; he added. But there was more anguish for Hamilton in a season brimful of frustrations. He got held up by Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa, who said: &quot;It was a little bit too much. Everyone was slow in front and he tried to pass me and we almost touch. He didn&apos;t use his mind, one more time.&quot; Hamilton said: &quot;I was trying to get past and he was blocking, blocking, blocking. Eventually I got past and my lap was pretty good but then I got held up by Fernando but my pace is good. &quot;It was quite an eventful one. It was still quite good. They had a fuelling problem, we were running out of time \u00a0and \u00a0we couldn&apos;t get enough fuel in the car. So we didn&apos;t have enough time for a second run. I&apos;m not in a bad position but I think we could have got on the front row.&quot; Meanwhile Button, who has always played down his rivalry with his team-mate, Lewis Hamilton, has finally admitted that his desire to beat him was one of the main reasons why he joined the Woking-based team. I wanted the challenge of driving at McLaren and driving alongside Lewis at a team that had built this driver up since he was a kid,&quot; he said. &quot;I took that challenge on, enjoyed myself and I think I have done alright, it&apos;s a place I want to enjoy my near future, however long that it is. &quot;I&apos;ve done all right considering everyone thought you were mad to come to Lewis&apos;s team. They did. I remember reading it. A lot of people said that \u2013 even Ross [Brawn, his old boss] said that to me. &quot;But if I win three races and don&apos;t finish in another three I will be much happier than finishing in front of my team-mate in the championship.

Singapore is Formula One&apos;s only night race but the temperature kept rising well after the chequered flag had fallen on Vettel&apos;s Red Bull, with Jenson Button second for his eighth podium place this season and his fourth in as many races. Button is now the only man who can stop Vettel winning the title. But once again it was his McLaren team-mate, Hamilton, who was the talking point following an angry exchange with Massa. Hamilton started the race fourth on the grid but was squeezed towards a wall by the slow-starting Mark Webber. Attempting to make up ground on the 12th lap, Hamilton crashed into the back of Massa, damaging his front wing and puncturing the Brazilian&apos;s Ferrari. Hamilton was given a drive-through penalty and after his involuntary five\u2011stop strategy finished fifth, after overtaking more cars than any other driver, often thrillingly. However, after the race Massa slapped Hamilton on the shoulder during a television interview and said, with bitter sarcasm: &quot;You&apos;ll win a lot of world championships driving like that. Good job huh. Very good job.&quot; In response, Hamilton shouted after a departing Massa: &quot;Don&apos;t touch me man. Don&apos;t touch me.&quot; In the post-race interview the Brazilian added: &quot;Yesterday he tried to be Superman in the qualifying and today he tried to do the same. He could have caused a big accident. I tried to talk to him but he doesn&apos;t listen. It&apos;s important that FIA is looking and penalising him all the time. He&apos;s paying for it because he had the drive through. But he can&apos;t listen, he can&apos;t understand, he doesn&apos;t learn anything. That&apos;s the problem.&quot; The pair have been fierce rivals since Hamilton beat Massa by a single point to win the 2008 title. Earlier this season, after another collision in Monaco for which Hamilton was punished, Massa called on the FIA to issue further penalties against the British driver. The Brazilian said: &quot;What can I say? How many races this year has he gone in the wrong direction? I tried to speak to him, but he didn&apos;t listen to me. I called him twice but he didn&apos;t listen, he passed through. He didn&apos;t even look at me. I went to him and went like that [thumbs up], and\u00a0said to him: &apos;Very good job, well done.&apos; That&apos;s it.&quot; Hamilton left the track without speaking. The McLaren team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, who might regret his call for the return of the &quot;old Hamilton&quot; after the previous race in Monza, said of Massa&apos;s comments: &quot;I think [Massa&apos;s] wrong. &quot; I think Lewis is a young guy. He&apos;s an aggressive and assertive driver He&apos;s learning and he&apos;ll learn from all these. I believe he&apos;ll win races and he&apos;ll win more\u00a0championships.&quot; Worryingly, however, Whitmarsh appeared in denial when asked about the avoidability of the accident. &quot;If you stay in the garage any accident is avoidable,&quot; he said. &quot;Any serious questions?&quot; This has been Hamilton&apos;s most harrowing season. As well as Monaco, he was also involved in collisions in Malaysia, Canada and Belgium and was given another drive-through penalty in Hungary. Last year Hamilton decided to split, professionally, from his father, Anthony, who had worked as his mentor and manager since childhood. And on Sunday night Hamilton Sr appeared to blame his son&apos;s new agents, XIX Entertainment, who also manage the affairs of David Beckham and Andy Murray. He said: &quot;You look up and down the pitlane and every driver, except for Lewis, has a driver-manager in his life, not people from a company. I am sure his management are very good \u2013 I don&apos;t know \u2013 but Formula One drivers need people personally involved in\u00a0the driver&apos;s life because it is a big pressure. They have got to be here and I don&apos;t think you can do the job by sending someone else. &quot;I don&apos;t know any other driver-manager who sends someone else to do the job. You sign up a Formula One driver, so come and do your job. No disrespect to anybody but that&apos;s how this business is.&quot; Simon Fuller, the head of XIX, has been seen at two races this season but his representatives have attended a number of others. Hamilton added: &quot;I have seen Lewis and he is fine. He will be back. It is hard right now but he will come back, there is no doubt about that.&quot; By the end of the long evening Vettel&apos;s 19th career victory had almost been forgotten. And so had the even more spectacular crash involving the seven times world champion Michael Schumacher, who went into the back of Sergio P\u00e9rez.

Still do, on the rare occasions I get down there but for a year back in the early 90s I shared a flat on Bloemfontein Road and would go along for evening games if my team wasn&apos;t playing. I&apos;ve not been back so often recently but was there last season, drinking Landlord in the Princess Louise and troughing down the enormous portions at the Greek restaurant on Uxbridge Road. This should be an interesting game, QPR 2011-12 v2.0 following the frantic transfer activity after Tony Fernandes&apos;s takeover taking on a very solid-looking Villa. Both have seven points, Villa are unbeaten in the league and Rangers have yet to score a home league goal, though came close against Newcastle.  The last top-flight meeting of the two was two days before Christmas 1995, Rangers winning 1-0 through Kevin Gallen&apos;s goal. All the names from the team-sheet are immediately familiar to someone as ancient as me. Here they are: QPR: Sommer; Bardsley, McDonald, Yates, Brevett; Impey, Wilkins, Barker, Sinclair; Hateley, Gallen. Villa: Bosnich, Charles, Ehiogu, Southgate, McGrath, Wright; Townsend, Draper, Taylor; Milosevic, Johnson. Rangers went down that season and Villa won the League Cup.  Meanwhile, to get you in the mood. Here&apos;s some Joey Barton love from another site. I&apos;ll be back with the teams asap.  Here are your teams:  QPR: Kenny; Young, Ferdinand, Hall, Traor\u00e9; Wright-Phillips, Barton, Derry, Faurl\u00edn; Taarabt, Bothroyd.Substitutes: Murphy, Orr, Campbell, Buzsaky, Connolly, Smith, Helguson. Aston Villa: Given; Hutton, Dunne, Collins, Warnock; Bannan, Petrov, Ireland, Delph, N&apos;Zogbia; Agbonlahor. Substitutes: Guzan, Albrighton, Delfouneso, Beye, Weimann, Lowry, Gardner.Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland)  Absent friends: Danny Gabbidon is missing for QPR and Darren Bent for Villa. Even a buffoon would suggest the latter is the biggest loss \u2013 with Bannan and N&apos;Zogbia lacking a target for their crosses. An interesting sideshow may be the battle between the ex Manchester City trainees Stephen Ireland for Villa and SWP and Joey Barton for QPR. I haven&apos;t seen enough of Ireland this season to tell me whether he&apos;s overcome his awful first season at Villa Park under G\u00e9rard Houllier. I&apos;ve seen enough of Stephen Warnock to suggest he&apos;s recovered from his similar fate in internal exile under the Frenchman and Gary McAllister.  Afternoon Mac Millings:  &quot;My memories of Loftus Rd aren&apos;t as pleasurable as yours, I&apos;m afraid. I went several times in the 80s, and the home fans could show a nasty streak, which included hurling coins at linesmen who gave decisions against their Super Hoops. I&apos;m sure they weren&apos;t the only ones, but still, the sight of a chunky, eighties 50p arcing towards an official&apos;s unsuspecting head is one that stays with me. There&apos;s a lot about Modern Football to dislike, but if that kind of thing has been eradicated, then there is an upside to sanitisation.&quot; There is indeed, Mac. One thing I forgot to mention was the last game of last season at Loftus Road, in the row in front of me was Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols. Six rows in front of him sat Mick Jones of the Clash. For all Lydon&apos;s love of Arsenal, QPR are truly the punk royalty club.  1 min:  David Cameron&apos;s in the stands, as is Fabio Capello. Cameron is a Villa fan and it&apos;s his side who kick off, Warnock tapping a long pass up the left that Rangers easily deal with. Young then puts his left foot through the ball up to Wright-Phillips but he fouls Hutton who was covering his run well.  3 min: Some nice work up the left with Warnock combining well with N&apos;Zogbia but when the ball&apos;s played across the box up pops Wright-Phillips moonlighting as a left-back who knocks it up to Bothroyd who tries to throw Hutton by shimmying left and right before shooting. It&apos;s deflected and the corner is cleared.  5 min: The pundit Gary Neville has spotted that QPR are targeting the Villa right-back Alan Hutton, trying to chip the ball over his head a couple of times, looking for the runs of Faurl\u00edn and Bothroyd. Then Taarabt shows his class, controlling a ball 30 yards from goal, losing Petrov who stands off him and larruping a shot that smacks off the post.  7 min: Ireland fouls Taror\u00e9 and QPR have a free kick on theedge of their own area and they go up the left again. After a couple of phases moving up the flank via a throw-in, Taror\u00e9 whips in a cross that Young clears for a corner. From the corner, which is knocked out of the box, Young is fouled by Petrov 25 yards from goal.  9 min: Taarabt tries to chip the free-kick over the wall but Villa do well and get the block in, heading it over the bar. When the corner breaks down, QPR again go up the left before Taarabt loses possession.  11 min: Villa are trying to squeeze up, the back four only a few yards apart from the central midfield three and QPR are trying to get round the back with passes through and over. Rangers are throwing men forward, which should give Villa a chance of catching them on the break. Not yet, though.  13 min: Dunne fouls Bothroyd in the Rangers half, which shows how far the back four are trying to push up. It&apos;s knocked long by QOR and Bothroyd wins the header in the box, back flicking it tamely, since the delivery lacked pace after coming such a long way, into Given&apos;s hands. Warnock then slips when the ball is played out from the keeper and QPR come in a wave at Villa, Wright-Phillips eventually forced slightly wide and closed down. he wins a corner.  16 min: Rangers win a second corner in succession after Collins heads the first out. It ping pongs around the box but Villa clear and Traor\u00e9 lets the ball bounce and almost pays for it with Agbonlahor behind him. He gets away with it and Bothroyd attacks up the left from the former Arsenal player&apos;s pass. He bamboozles Young then whacks a centre across the six-yard box but there&apos;s no one there to tap it in and Warnock rolls it out for the 67th corner.  18 min: Barton&apos;s corner finds Bothroyd who works himself a foot of space between a centre-half sandwich. He glances his header wide. Good chance, that.  20 min: Rangers have had about two-thirds of the possession and are looking rampant in terms of getting men forward beyond midfield. No runners yet getting into the box, though, when Bothroyd drifts wide.  22 min: Villa had a brief spell there shortly after McLeish had screamed at them to push up but Delph&apos;s chipped left-foot pass is overhit and skips behind for a goalkick. They can&apos;t build up any momentum, Villa, because they can&apos;t make any space with QPR pressing and packing midfield.  24 min: Bothroyd catches Collins with his arm and has to go off to stem his bleeding nose. It looked accidental but Dunne goes and whispers something in Bothroyd&apos;s ear. I imagine his warning would be delivered in the voice of Linda Blair in the Exorcist.  26 min: Cracking cross from Bothroyd on the right loops over to the far post where Barton meets it, though the angle is tight and his run is taking him out of play, but can&apos;t get the delicate connection it needs to score.  28 min: Barton has a hopeful shot that bends high and wide.  30 min: With such dominance QPR really should have scored in the first half hour. It shows no signs of abating, though, so there&apos;s still time. Bannan tracks Taror\u00e9&apos;s dangerous run and blocks the cross into the box which gives Rangers another corner. They take it short for the umpteenth time and Faurl\u00edn booms a shot over the bar.  32 min: This looks like rope-a-dope from Villa in the hope of making space to break and hit on the counter but they&apos;re taking too many punches at the moment and offering nothing in response.  35 min: Warnock does manage to get a cross in but hits it too hard and Barton&apos;s there to bash it clear. QPR are awarded a free kick when Dunne obstructs Bothroyd going for a header just inside the Villa half. Bothroyd lands awkwardly and looks winded.  37 min: Barton stands the free kick up to the left-side of the box where Bothroyd loops his header horizontally across the area. Barton then gets too much power on his next cross and Taarabt can&apos;t get enough on it to keep it in play.  39 min: Hutton hits a long ball up the right, over Barton&apos;s head and between Ferdinand and Taror\u00e9 but Bannan&apos;s sprint isn&apos;t quick enough to beat Ferdinand who dives to head it back to Kenny. Villa finally get a corner when N&apos;Zogbia makes progess up the other flank and Young tackles him. The corner is low to the near post, there&apos;s a shout for hand ball as it strikes Bothroyd but the ref waves play on.  41 min: Awful late tackle from Warnock on Barton earns him a yellow card. The free kick is beaten back by Villa who do look well organised at set-pieces.  44 min: Villa have a pair of corners, the first after Young&apos;s block, the second following Ferdinand&apos;s strong header. Young deals with the latter and Rangers clear their lines. &quot;I used to go to Loftus Road a good deal as a neutral, too,&quot; writes James Baker. &quot;Bbut on the odd occasion I went as an away fan in the 90s I was amazed to discover a hopefully unique architectural fail in the stand behind the goal: if you were sat down you couldn&apos;t see the goal-line ...&quot; That brings back memories, James. You&apos;re right. There were some away seats at Stamford Bridge, too, behind the dugouts and you couldn&apos;t see a third of the pitch if you had the good fortune to pay \u00a338 to get one. Bannan curls a free-kick with his left foot that Kenny dives to his left to reach and claws away.  Half time: QPR have forced Villa on to the back foot for the first 40 minutes, something the visitors&apos; formation hasn&apos;t helped them to counter. Yet there were signs in the last five minutes that Rangers were running out of puff, at least before the orange-sucking revives them. I&apos;ll be back in 10 minutes.  Half-time email:  &quot;Just saw the two teams&apos; jerseys for the season, and this is a truly Malaysian derby,&quot; writes Mario Rustan. &quot;While QPR&apos;s Malaysian Airlines is obvious, Aston Villa&apos;s Genting Casino is located in Malaysia and is a rival of Singapore&apos;s Marina Bay Sands, venue of tonight&apos;s Formula One GP. To add it up, the sponsor on the referee&apos;s shoulder, Tune, is a hotel chain operated by Tony Fernandes&apos; Air Asia group.&quot; It&apos;s big in Kuala Lumpur, this one Mario. I have to say I&apos;m impressed by Gary Neville as a co-commentator. I&apos;ve heard him in the studio before but he seems pretty sound in this role, especially astute in identifying weaknesses in tactics. Sky are obsessed with Tinie Tempah this season, n&apos;est ce pas? Couldn&apos;t have seen Richard Keys rocking down to It&apos;s Written in the Stars.  46 min:  Alex Chick reports his memories of W12: &quot;I was once mugged at knifepoint on South Africa Road, so I&apos;m not a huge fan of the place. Sorry to spoil the nostalgia.&quot; Oh dear, sorry to hear that Alex. Da Bush, home of Oil Drum Lane, Albert and Harold Steptoe, Hercules the horse and Hercules II, the greyhound, is not a place for nostalgic reverie at times. Ferdinand knocks a free kick into the Villa box and Collins heads it away. N&apos;Zogbia takes the ball down, plays it to Agbonlahor who finds the onrushing Delph whose shot from the left side of the area is blocked by Ferdinand.  48 min: Hutton is booked for scything down Wright-Phillips in full stride. Taarabt tries to slide in Barton but he can&apos;t control it and Villa break through N&apos;Zogbia up the left. he rolls it back to Warnock. He eventually loops a cross over to the other side where Huttoin picks it up and aims for the back stick. Young clears. Better from Villa.  50 min: Now Agbonlahor has a mazy run but goes up a cul de sac and QPR clear quickly up to Bothroyd who dawdles and loses possession when Wright-Phillips was well-placed in the middle.  52 min: Warnock knocks a 50-yard pass but overhits it and instead of finding N&apos;Zogbia&apos;s run into the box he gave Kenny the chance to come and gather.  54 min: Bannan&apos;s wayward shot is deflected deliberately by Agbonlahor but even he can&apos;t correct the aim sufficiently. Ireland did well in the build-up and Kenny is forced to dive in and save minutes later when Agbonlahor gets round the back of Taror\u00e9.  55 min: Fine pass from Bannan splits Ferdinand and Traor\u00e9, Delph runs into the gap and prods it past Kenny who came out to meet him, but the ball spins wide of the post.  Penalty to Villa Traor\u00e9 penalised for a shove on Agbonlahor who was trying to get on the end of a looping cross. It looked as though he barely made contact.  GOAL!! QPR 0-1 Aston Villa (Bannan, pen) Steers it into the right corner of the goal, or &quot;passed it into the side-netting a la Greavesie&quot; as someone older might say.  59 min: Neil Warnock&apos;s doing his nut with the fourth official over the penalty and at first look, it doesn&apos;t appear as though Taror\u00e9 touched Agbonlahor. It wasn&apos;t a harsh decision so much as a poor one on the evidence Sky showed us. Here&apos;s Ram Karthigasu: &quot;The game isnt as big in Kuala Lumpur as say Liverpool Wolves was last night, or even the Man U Stoke game. Dont think Malaysians feel a sense of ownership as of yet. Maybe when Tony Fernandes gets a few Malaysian players (a long shot) in the squad for trials, things will pick up.&quot;  61 min: QPR free kick five yards out of the area, given when Dunne fouls Taarabt, Faurl\u00edn ballons his shot over. &quot;Seeing Cameron there causes me to wonder if it&apos;s harder to manage a cabinet and a parliament, or a squad of footballers,&quot; says Paul Szabo. &quot;But the latter can&apos;t be too hard a task now, can it? It&apos;s just like parenting a bunch of adolescents, after all.&quot; Come, come, Paul. Everyone knows &quot;you need a degree in people&quot; to be a good manager. At least that&apos;s what we&apos;re told every few days.  64 min: Villa have improved beyond all recognition since this tactical rejig at half time. The full backs are getting forward, Delph and Bannan are making runs into the box and Ireland has linked Petrov and Agbonlahor well a couple of times.  66 min: QPR substitution. Bothroyd off. Dudley Campbell on. The crowd is getting understandably animated after the penalty and goes berserk when Campbell is given offside. Barton escaped a booking seconds earlier when he went into a sliding tackle that almost cut Delph in two. &quot;&apos;Diabolical view&apos; is printed on a ticket I have when Liverpool were the visitors at Loftus Road,&quot; writes Jonny Mac. &quot;You have to admire their honesty.&quot; Well, quite.  69 min: Wright-Phillips ends a six-pass move with a left-foot shot low to Given&apos;s left that the Irishman dives down and palms away with a strong wrist. Petrov slides in and catches Wright-Phillips with his trailing leg when the game resumes. The crowd demand a red card but the referee doesn&apos;t agree.  71 min: A penalty shout for QPR when a header from a dead-ball delivery strikes Hutton on the left arm by the six-yard line. It came five yards or so to hit him, so could have taken his arm away. It&apos;s getting feisty now.  74 min: QPR are straining to get back in, Faurl\u00edn&apos;s shot is blocked out for a corner. At last a replay of the penalty that was awarded, magnified, and Taror\u00e9 does pull Agbonlahor&apos;s shirt. So it was a pen, despite what Gary Neville is saying. He &quot;wouldn&apos;t have liked that given against me, that happens all the time&quot;. Eric Hyland didn&apos;t like the original pic at the top of the piece: &quot;Didn&apos;t think I would ever be pleased to see Cameron&apos;s face but it&apos;s a big improvement on Barton&apos;s.&quot;  77 min: Agbonlahor is booked for kicking Ferdiannd mid stride after Hall had pulled the striker&apos;s shirt to stop him breaking into the box.  79 min: QPR substitution: Helguson on for Derry. Niall Mullen is not a fan of Willie Miller&apos;s illustrious former partner: &quot;Good to see Big Eck bring his &apos;tactics&apos; across Birmingham. Hit late and hit hard. I like Villa as a club but would be glad to see the back of their manager.&quot; There have been some strong tackles, and some reckless fouls, but I don&apos;t think McLeish instructs his players to do it, Niall.  81 min: The sub Helguson makes himself some space at the far post and Barton finds him with a cross from the left. Villa block it out for a corner and then break with Albrighton (who came on for Bannan a few minutes ago) but QPR scurry back, Wright-Phillips making 80 yards to clear. &quot;Diabolical view?&quot; asks Gary Naylor &quot;Were you looking at Neil Warnock?&quot;  83 min: &quot;Just because a replay shows a tiny piece of contact in the box doesn&apos;t mean that a penalty should be awarded,&quot; writes Roy Allen. &quot;It was a simply ridiculous decision, and you claiming it was right is almost as bad.&quot; So, if you pull someone&apos;s shirt in the box you should never be afraid of the consequences. Some referees give them, most don&apos;t but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s wrong by the laws of the game. Just because something&apos;s more honoured in the breach than the observance doesn&apos;t mean you will never be punished for it.  86 min: Tommy Smith&apos;s coming on for Shaun Wright-Phillips. Rangers free kick taken quickly by Barton, sliding it down the line and the cross hits Hutton&apos;s hand from a yard away as the crowd shouts for a penalty that the referee doesn&apos;t give. Then Villa break and shoot across goal and it&apos;s blocked. Villa try to waste time by the flag but lsoe possession.  89 min: Helguson hits a wonderful cross to the far post from the right and Smith heads it back across goal but no one was there to knock it in. Traore takes Albrighton&apos;s legs away when he dives in to a 40-60 ball and gets a second yellow card.  90 min +1: There will be five minutes for 10-man Rangers. Chris Gigante gives them one last rallying call: &quot;I would have been down at the game today had it not been for the fact my mate Chris Jones chose to give his spare ticket to a girl (who has no interest in football) instead of me. I hope he has as much luck as QPR today - actually I don&apos;t mean that c&apos;mon you Rrrrrrsssssssss... both QPR &amp; Jonesey.&quot; Villa have a corner that they&apos;ll try and piddle about with but they mess up and Kenny has a goal kick.  GOAL!! QPR 1-1 Aston Villa (Dunne og) Good cross from Helguson who found space beyond Hutton to clip it back across the six-yard box and the clearance ricocheted off Dunne, hitting him on the chest, and into the goal.  90 min +4: &quot;If every tiny piece of contact is going to be penalised you turn the game into netball,&quot; writes Roy Allen. &quot;It was a ridiculous decision and it is bizarre that you are trying, inexplicably, to defend it.&quot; I&apos;m trying to explain it, Roy, not defend it. Saying, by the letter of the law, it was a penalty. It might have been a poor decision, but it was an explicable one is what I was trying to say.  Full time:  A draw, QPR fighting back late to seal a point. They deserved it, too, after a very good first-half performance. I won&apos;t try and waste anyone&apos;s time by &quot;defending&quot; the award of the controversial penalty that gave Villa the lead. Watch it for yourselves and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll deduce that it was harsh but the case that &quot;he never touched him&quot; as first seemed to be Gary Neville&apos;s argument was wrong. He did touch him albeit momentarily. Anyway it turned it into a frenetic and enjoyable finale. &quot;Thanks for the debate,&quot; writes Roy Allen. &quot;For the first time in my life, I&apos;m on Gary Neville&apos;s side. It&apos;s a little uncomfortable.&quot; Thanks Roy and to everyone else for keeping me company and for the emails.

Livingstone, who is seeking to win back the London mayoralty he lost to Johnson in 2008, accused Johnson of being more interested in abolishing the 50p rate of tax for the wealthiest than defending spending cuts. He claimed the capital was going in the &quot;wrong direction&quot; courtesy of Conservative policies delivered by the government and through City Hall. In a hard hitting attack, Livingstone, who just last month raised eyebrows by jokingly comparing Johnson to Hitler, sought to highlight the London mayor&apos;s privilege past as he challenged him to explain the &quot;moral difference&quot; between his actions as a member of the Oxford University dining club and the behaviour of the rioters this summer. &quot;London is an absolutely amazing city but it&apos;s going in the wrong direction. Only a few years ago London was leading the world,&quot; he said. &quot;But now the image of our city is of civil disorder and violence on the streets and unless we change City Hall, nothing will change on our streets.&quot; Livingstone told the gathering in Liverpool that when the 7/7 bombers struck in 2005, he was in Singapore for the result of the Olympics decision and &quot;all I wanted was to be back in London immediately, as soon as I could&quot;. He contrasted this with the fact that Johnson, who was on a family holiday in Canada during the summer lull at city hall, did not immediately return to the capital. &quot;But where was Boris Johnson when we had the riots this summer?&quot; Livingstone told the audience. &quot;He refused to come back. We had the amazing situation of Londoners demanding their mayor come back to deal with that crisis.&quot; In a swipe at the Conservatives&apos; response to the riots, Livingstone went on: &quot;What is the difference between the rioters, and a gang of over-privileged arrogant students vandalising restaurants, throwing chairs through windows in Oxford? Come on Boris, you explain the moral difference between your Bullingdon vandalism and the criminality of the rioters. Frankly, neither is an example I want for my kids.&quot; Livingstone accused Johnson of failing to &quot;speak up&quot; for the next generation facing high living cost and debt as a result of the cuts, and instead focusing on a policy from which he could personally benefit. Pointing to the fact that Johnson earns \u00a3250,000 a year for a weekly Daily Telegraph column on top of his mayoral salary of \u00a3144,000, Livingstone suggested that the Tory mayor had a personal interest in seeing the 50p rate of tax abolished. &quot;Unlike Boris Johnson I am in it for London, not myself,&quot; he said. Livingstone, who has spent the past three years limbering up for a rematch with Johnson, promised action to tackle rising transport costs so that &quot;in every year in every part of London, inner and outer, fares will be fairer under me than they would be under a second Boris Johnson term&quot;. He also promised a four-year freeze on the mayor&apos;s salary and the pay of top City Hall staff and pledged to reverse policing cuts. Shadow Olympics minister Tessa Jowell, billed to speak before Livingstone, used her speech to champion Livingstone&apos;s bid to win back the mayoralty for Labour in a contest which she said should not be a contest based on celebrity, but on who will be the most effective leader &quot;in these most difficult times&quot;. In a sideswipe against Johnson, who still cuts a popular figure with Londoners, Jowell said that it was &quot;competence not celebrity&quot; that would get people back to work, build them new homes and keep their tube fares down. &quot;They don&apos;t need a TV personality \u2013 but they do need a mayor that realises this is the largest job in public service outside No 10 Downing Street.&quot; But she warned that next May&apos;s mayoral race will be a &quot;real challenge&quot; with Johnson benefiting from the 2012 games. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t underestimate how the Olympics will give him a great advantage of incumbency. Turning this around will be a real challenge, she told delegates. &quot;And Ken knows that and he&apos;s up for that fight.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/sep/26/rugby-world-cup-2011-five-things", "sentences": ["Rugby needs to expand \u2013 and will in 2019 in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore \u2013 but there is still time to appreciate the internal growth of the sport in New Zealand."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-26T10:26:58Z", "title": "Rugby World Cup 2011: five things we learned from the weekend | Eddie Butler", "tags": ["Rugby World Cup 2011", "Dan Carter", "New Zealand rugby union team", "England rugby union team", "Rugby union", "Sport", "Rugby World Cup"], "article": "1 Dan Carter can play rugby Not all the points, I swear, will be so obvious. But wasn&apos;t he brilliant? The range of his passes was exceptional, with one exception to the exceptional, the one that went to Maxime Mermoz when the game was already tucked up in bed. His kicking, too, was varied and perfectly weighted. The only team ever to have made Carter crack are South Africa, once, in the Tri Nations, when they charged their biggest runners into him and blitzed him, four-on-one, in defence. Basically, they roughed him up. France, who reduced him to looking uncomfortable in the quarter-final of 2007, gave him the run of Eden Park, and Carter gave a sublime lesson in exploiting a flimsy defence. It has been noted by the French that to win the World Cup they will have to beat New Zealand \u2013 and just the once will do. The story of Carter and the French defence may not be over yet. 2 Drop goals count No drop kick was landed with greater relish on the weekend than Carter&apos;s against the French. There was no need for it, because the All Blacks were coasting, but this was a kick with a sting, all to do with that Cardiff quarter-final four years ago, when New Zealand failed to work their way into a good position for the simple three-pointer. There again, perhaps it&apos;s not so simple. Dan Parks landed one, a skimmer, against Argentina, but when it came to the second, the killer \u2026 well, was he not deep enough, did Mike Blair&apos;s pass put him on his left foot, or was it the Argentine rush that forced him to kick with his weaker foot? Were they offside? Not so simple at all, and you can bet that as we near the knock-out stages, all expert kickers and even the part-timers, will be putting in a little extra practice. The real thing, though, when it really matters, is different. As Jonny, on his wrong foot, will tell you. 3 New Zealand can&apos;t do crowds? It has reached the point where they tell you first how light the crowd is of a full house, and on Sunday at Eden Park it was only about 500 short of the audience for New Zealand-France. Now, Samoa-Fiji was priced differently, and Auckland is the biggest Polynesian city in the world, but, even so, to see the Park packed with 60,000 on consecutive days by two completely different sets of theatre-goers shows that NZ is flying as a World Cup host. Twenty-four years ago the World Cup was born here (with Australia as co-hosts) and played to half-empty houses in inadequate stadiums. Rugby needs to expand \u2013 and will in 2019 in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore \u2013 but there is still time to appreciate the internal growth of the sport in New Zealand. Their nurturing is not entirely selfless, for without cherry-picking the very best of the Pacific Islanders for themselves, a country this size would not be able to maintain their rugby pre-eminence, but more is done here in schools, clubs, provinces, coaching clinics and think-tanks to take the sport forward than anywhere else. And that includes watching it in numbers. 4 Send for the physio \u2013 there&apos;s a physio injured A directive has been issued that, in order to nip in the bud any inclination to feign injury and give the defending side a breather, play should carry on even when a man is down. &quot;Play on&quot; is always to be welcomed, but at the weekend this uninterrupted action always seemed to be heading in the direction of the injured player and the attending physio(s). In the case of Juan Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez Lobbe, who was about as keen to leave the field as a crow from the eyes of a dead sheep, it was clear that his knee was genuinely damaged and that he was not exactly in a position to hop out of the way when the traffic started coming his way. At one stage the medicos looked up in alarm, but presumably some sort of oath prevented them from abandoning their patient and they seemed willing to go down with Argentina&apos;s mighty but fallen No8 beneath the stampede of a Scottish pick-and-drive. A bit of common sense, surely ... 5 Will England&apos;s baggage prove too heavy? It&apos;s not easy being England. Their performance against Argentina has gone the way of most indifferent starts (South Africa, Australia) and been put behind them. But, goodness me, they cannot shake off this wretched Queenstown bouncer, nor what was captured \u2013 and may or may not be released \u2013 in bar B. The latest philosophical slant on the saga comes from the owner of that second bar, Cowboys. &quot;Our position is that if it&apos;s not a crime, then we won&apos;t release the footage.&quot; . England on the playing field look as if they are coming together. Whether this is as important as their other baggage and whatever else happens in the life and marriage of Mike Tindall in the House of Windsor, depends on your view of \u2026 well, probably quite a few things in life, really."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/26/red-bull-racing-formula-one-profits", "sentences": ["German driver Sebastian Vettel steered the Red Bull Racing team to the 2010 championship and is one point away from this year&apos;s title after winning Sunday&apos;s Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-26T17:28:51Z", "title": "Formula one success revs up Red Bull Racing's profits", "tags": ["Food & drink industry", "Business", "Red Bull", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Advertising", "Media"], "article": "  Energy drinks company Red Bull made a \u00a32.8m pre-tax profit last year from winning the Formula One championship and diversifying its racing operations, according to team boss Christian Horner. German driver Sebastian Vettel steered the Red Bull Racing team to the 2010 championship and is one point away from this year&apos;s title after winning Sunday&apos;s Singapore grand prix. His victory last year boosted the team&apos;s prize money to about \u00a356m and drove an increase in sponsorship income as Pepe Jeans, electronics firm LG and forex broker FXDD joined its roster. &quot;The biggest increases for us, on the revenue side, were a 20% increase [in prize money] from Formula One management and sponsorship,&quot; said Horner. He said that although costs increased to pay for winning bonuses to staff, total expenditure did not go up as much as the team expected due to F1 spending restrictions. &quot;Control of costs combined with the increase in external revenues meant that Red Bull Racing has become more successful at a lower cost to the group,&quot; Horner said. Red Bull is based in the Austrian town of Fuschl am See, near Salzburg. Since the company was founded in 1984 Red Bull has become the world&apos;s most popular energy drink, selling 4bn cans last year. It made record revenues of \u20ac3.8bn (\u00a33.3bn) in 2010, up 15.8% on the previous year. The company does not disclose its profit but it is estimated at about \u20ac1bn after tax. Red Bull&apos;s managing director, Dietrich Mateschitz, owns 49% of the firm, with the remaining stake in the hands of Thai businessman Chaleo Yoovidhya and his son. Red Bull&apos;s success has been driven by a marketing strategy associating the drink with extreme sports. It bought its F1 team from Ford in 2004 and poured in a lot of money. Red Bull Racing&apos;s accounts show that in 2009 it covered \u00a396.9m of the team&apos;s \u00a3132m costs but Horner said it now provides less than half. &quot;The cost of Formula One to Red Bull is below 50% [of our expenditure] and is continuing to reduce.&quot; In contrast, its returns are accelerating. According to recent research, Red Bull&apos;s advertising value equivalent from F1 \u2013 the price it would have to pay to buy a similar amount of on-screen exposure \u2013 came to an estimated \u00a3136.9m in 2009 and \u00a3219.9m in 2010, when it received almost a quarter of the total received by all the teams. Red Bull Racing is wholly-owned by the drinks company through its UK holding company Red Bull Technology. Horner said that the company made a \u00a32.8m pre-tax profit last year, with 75% of this down to F1 and other projects contributing the remainder. Until the end of 2009 Red Bull Technology was responsible for designing Red Bull Racing cars and those of its Italian sister team Toro Rosso. However, a change in F1 regulations forced Toro Rosso to design its own car in-house, which led Red Bull Technology to diversify."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/sep/26/estelle-evidence-interpret-ofsted-pisa-timms", "sentences": ["Then there is Michael Gove&apos;s use of Singapore&apos;s slimmed-down curriculum as evidence for his own curriculum review, but he&apos;s less likely to mention the national textbooks that accompany teaching in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-26T18:30:01Z", "title": "Labour could build trust by committing to evidence in education policies", "tags": ["Academies", "Education", "Schools", "Education policy", "Politics"], "article": "The government claims to be developing an evidence-based education policy, which has to be a good thing. But can we be sure they can be trusted to get it right? Ministers continually refer to national and international sources of evidence to justify their decisions. So much so that announcements from Pisa (the OECD&apos;s Programme for International Student Assessment), Timms (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) or the management consultants McKinsey now seem to exceed Ofsted in their importance for education. How can we know that Michael Gove is drawing the right conclusions from the available evidence? What is to stop him selecting the evidence that supports his political views and casting the rest aside? Take some of the government statements in support of its key policies. Charter schools in the US are used to justify the free schools policy. And when minsters talk about the success of charter schools such as the Harlem Success Academy in New York, they are not making it up. There are some truly outstanding charter schools that should inspire us all. Yet what about the research from Stanford University, which shows that over three quarters of charter schools deliver similar or worse results than traditional state schools? What should we really make of the evidence? The same can be seen with that other flagship policy \u2013 academies. The government is fond of quoting the success rates of chains of academies like the Harris schools in south London. Again, this is true. Based in challenging areas, Harris schools have produced some outstanding results and are a real example of what can be achieved. Yet so are the results of schools in Tower Hamlets, the poorest borough in the country, which now regularly outperforms the national average \u2013 and has no academies. What is this evidence telling us? Then there is Michael Gove&apos;s use of Singapore&apos;s slimmed-down curriculum as evidence for his own curriculum review, but he&apos;s less likely to mention the national textbooks that accompany teaching in Singapore. Is it also misleading to cite evidence from Pisa in support of autonomous schools but fail to add that the same organisation finds that competition between schools doesn&apos;t necessarily lead to better results? Contradictory evidence and the selective use of it is nothing new \u2013 I doubt there is an education minister who has not succumbed to the temptation. Neither is the practice peculiar to education. The problem exists elsewhere \u2013 but other government departments have been prepared to do something about it. The Department of Health has established the independent National Centre for Clinical Excellence (Nice) to make sure clinicians and the public have access to quality information and best-practice evidence. The Treasury has the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which provides an external challenge and scrutiny to government&apos;s financial assumptions and forecasts. Then there is the Institute for Fiscal Studies, to which commentators and the public can confidently look for a balanced interpretation of economic information. These organisations take the job of interpreting evidence out of the hands of ministers and so give the public greater confidence in its validity. No one will believe that the government is serious about being guided by evidence as long as ministers are free to select and interpret that evidence at will. It&apos;s not difficult to spot a successful school and use it to justify what you already believe. It&apos;s far more difficult to determine exactly what it is that makes that school successful and craft it into an evidence-based policy that can influence all schools. That&apos;s why quality evidence and the proper use of it are so crucial. Education is an increasingly evidence-rich policy area. How we use that evidence could determine our future success. It is not about taking politics out of education, but about re-drawing the boundaries between the two. As Labour continues the task in Liverpool this week of rethinking its approach to education, it could do worse than show that it understands the crisis in the relationship between education evidence and policy-making. A commitment to examine the way evidence is used in education would give it firm foundations for its policy review and build trust in the profession and with the public. We urgently need the education equivalent of Nice or the OBR so we can be confident that when ministers talk about evidence they aren&apos;t simply providing cover for their own prejudices."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/26/sir-alex-ferguson-premier-league-television", "sentences": ["The global reach afforded to the club by TV has been claimed as a major driver behind the plan to float a minority stake in Manchester United on the Singapore stock exchange."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-26T19:29:31Z", "title": "Sir Alex Ferguson claims football has sold soul to TV 'devil'", "tags": ["Sir Alex Ferguson", "Manchester United", "Football", "Sports rights", "Sport", "Television industry", "Media"], "article": "Sir Alex Ferguson has accused football of selling its soul to television and claimed that broadcasters do not pay enough money given the amount of control they exert over the game.

You ask any manager if they would pick that themselves and there&apos;d be absolutely no chance.&quot; Ferguson also said that broadcasters should pay more for the rights to live football, given the Premier League sold its product to more than 200 countries. &quot;When you think of that I don&apos;t think we get enough money,&quot; he said. The Premier League secured around \u00a33.5bn from its most recent round of television deals, which run until the end of next season. About \u00a32.1bn was generated from domestic rights sales, including about \u00a31.8bn for live rights from BSkyB and ESPN, and \u00a31.4bn from overseas broadcasters. BSkyB refused to comment on Ferguson&apos;s observations but sports broadcasting insiders pointed out that Ferguson&apos;s views did not reflect the fact that each club must be shown live a minimum of 10 times and a maximum of 26, nor that other factors affected the scheduling of matches. They include policing issues and the ongoing tussle over the fixture calendar between domestic football bodies, Uefa and Fifa. &quot;Sir Alex&apos;s comments always have to be taken seriously \u2013 he is a very wise and experienced football man,&quot; Brian Barwick, a former FA chief executive and controller of sport at ITV, told the BBC. &quot;But on this one, I do think Manchester United have almost had a lion&apos;s share of TV revenue over a period of time and it has helped build a fantastic stadium in Old Trafford and helped build Sir Alex&apos;s teams with star players.&quot; Others pointed to the explosion in broadcasting income over the past two decades and the degree to which it drives Manchester United&apos;s commercial strategy, which relies on international TV exposure to drive its global sponsorship strategy. Under the Premier League&apos;s distribution formula, which includes an equal share plus a merit payment and facility fees depending on the number of times each club is shown, Manchester United earned \u00a360.4m from domestic TV last season. The club&apos;s most recent financial results, to the year ending June 2011, showed that media income amounted to the club&apos;s biggest revenue stream, bringing in \u00a3119.4m. Commercial income, increasingly driven by overseas exposure on TV, rose to \u00a3103.4m from \u00a381.4m the previous year. The global reach afforded to the club by TV has been claimed as a major driver behind the plan to float a minority stake in Manchester United on the Singapore stock exchange. The Football Supporters&apos; Federation backed Ferguson&apos;s stance, albeit for different reasons. &quot;The contract with Sky and ESPN ought to leave more control with the Premier League over the fixture calendar,&quot; said its chairman, Malcolm Clarke. &quot;They should try and minimise the disruption to the number of matches being played on Saturday at 3pm. And they should be trying to minimise the number of long journeys for supporters on a Monday night. &quot;If you gave the Premier League more control, it might reduce the value of the rights in the marketplace but that should be a price football is prepared to pay.&quot; Despite Ferguson&apos;s comments, there is no suggestion that the Glazers are planning to try to break away from the Premier League&apos;s collective selling model in order to maximise revenues. In contrast to Spain, where the big two clubs do their own deals with television companies, the Premier League&apos;s income is shared out on a more equitable basis. Real Madrid recorded \u00a3129.9m in media revenues and Barcelona \u00a3145.8m, according to the 2011 Deloitte Money League. United were the Premier League&apos;s highest earners last year, with \u00a360.4m and Blackpool the lowest with \u00a339.1m. The Glazers are believed to be convinced of the merits of the collective model but are determined to better exploit the limited rights that clubs have within their control by signing deals with international telecom and media companies. In remarks that are likely to come as little surprise to those who have been on the receiving end of the Scot&apos;s famously fiery temper, David Beckham and Paul Ince included, Ferguson also admitted in the same interview: &quot;I&apos;m a confrontational character. I don&apos;t like people arguing back with me. I maybe have a short fuse.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/26/mclaren-defend-lewis-hamilton-button", "sentences": ["McLaren have stunned Formula One by welcoming back &quot;the old Lewis Hamilton&quot; after the accident-prone driver&apos;s latest mishap, which ended his chances of winning the Singapore Grand Prix and was followed by an angry confrontation with his victim, Felipe Massa."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-26T21:00:02Z", "title": "McLaren say they will not put brake on Lewis Hamilton's F1 aggression", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2011", "Jenson Button", "Formula One"], "article": "McLaren have stunned Formula One by welcoming back &quot;the old Lewis Hamilton&quot; after the accident-prone driver&apos;s latest mishap, which ended his chances of winning the Singapore Grand Prix and was followed by an angry confrontation with his victim, Felipe Massa. The McLaren team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, sounding rather like a too tolerant parent, dismissed the latest accident as &quot;a racing incident&quot; even though Hamilton was clearly at fault, adding: &quot;I am likely to be very partisan.&quot; And in a comment that will perplex the many wise judges \u2013 such as Sir Jackie Stewart \u2013 who think that Hamilton should mend his ways, Whitmarsh said: &quot;Lewis went through the last race [at Monza] desperately wanting to stay out of trouble, and he did. And, if we are honest, we were all then going to get on his case, saying where is the old Lewis. To an extent, I did. I said to him: &apos;Great discipline but let&apos;s get back&apos;. &quot;We are at a point where there are now five races to go. We would like to get out there and attack those races. I don&apos;t think Lewis is here to make friends. Go back over the last 20 years \u2013 any of these attacking, brave drivers do get under the skin of other drivers. If you look back on Ayrton [Senna], certainly as a young man, Ayrton never had an accident that was his fault. &quot;It was always someone else&apos;s fault. He had massive self-belief and he got under the skin of many drivers. Michael [Schumacher] still is. Michael has never caused an accident. They are not here to make friends. I don&apos;t think Lewis is here seeking to make enemies but a car in front of him is a car he has to get around and you don&apos;t overtake a car without some risk. &quot;The car in front of him at that moment \u2013 it doesn&apos;t matter who it is \u2013 is the enemy of the moment. Lewis will be upset but he is a resilient individual. He chose to walk away from a skirmish that could have been.&quot; With Whitmarsh smiling and saying boys will be boys, Hamilton&apos;s agent absent from most races and his father professionally estranged, many people will want to know just who is looking after the 2008 champion. The three-times champion Stewart said: &quot;If Lewis is going to be a great driver he cannot have serial accidents. And none of the great drivers ever drove in that fashion. He has all the skills but somehow or other, he jumps out of gear, mentally.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s team-mate, Jenson Button, is now second in the world championship and, arithmetically, is the only driver capable of stopping Sebastian Vettel. Is his form rattling Hamilton? &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Button. &quot;I am definitely driving well at the moment. I am happy with the way I am driving and I am happy with the way that the car feels underneath me. I really do feel part of it, which gives you a lot more confidence. &quot;When I talk to Lewis, I don&apos;t think he has changed the way he drives or anything. We are just closer on the grid. I got a good start and he got a bad one. The bad start put him back into the pack and on a street circuit you are going to take some risks.&quot; Did Button plan to give Hamilton a call to cheer him up? &quot;To be fair, I wasn&apos;t planning on it. We never talk away from the circuit. We have got each other&apos;s numbers but we don&apos;t really talk. It is not something I would expect him to do. When we finish our race we go away and spend time with people who really know us as a person and not just as a racing driver. &quot;When he gets back home I am sure he will have people around him who will pick him up. Even though he had the problem with the front-wing and the drive-through [penalty] he still did really well, was quick and got back to fifth.&quot; The trouble with Hamilton is that he does not have as many people around him as Button. And he also knows, having arrived at McLaren as a much-feted 13-year-old prodigy, that he is now the second most popular driver in the team. Button is also likely to become the first team-mate to beat Hamilton in the world championship. With five races to go he leads Hamilton by 17 points and, on current form, is the superior driver."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/sep/26/mark-cavendish-london-2012-olympics", "sentences": ["A couple of incidents this season, provoked by Hamilton&apos;s waywardness, fanned the embers of their mutual disregard and following Sunday&apos;s race in Singapore, push came to shove off as well as on the track."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-26T22:00:03Z", "title": "The little things make all the difference for Mark Cavendish | Richard Williams", "tags": ["Mark Cavendish", "Olympics 2012: cycling", "Cycling", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "It is a detail you could be forgiven for missing in the excitement of the race but the black helmet in which Mark Cavendish won the world championship on Sunday was carefully customised, its ventilation holes covered with thin plastic. Result: better aerodynamics, saving a handful of the watts in which cyclists measure their power. He was wearing a one-piece skinsuit, too. So were the other seven members of the Great Britain team, including one veteran who had to be coaxed into the unfamiliar garment after a career in jerseys and shorts. Result: once again, a reduction in the effort required for eight men to cut through the air while travelling in line astern at 55kph. And maybe you didn&apos;t spot the boards held out to the riders at three points around the circuit, providing information to David Millar, the team&apos;s road captain, in the absence of radio earpieces, which are banned at the world championships. They are forbidden at the Olympics, too, making this a useful trial run for 2012. Three years after their triumphs in the Beijing velodrome introduced the phrase &quot;aggregation of marginal gains&quot; to the sporting lexicon, Britain&apos;s cyclists are still looking for anything that will give them a legitimate advantage. No one else was wearing a skinsuit in Copenhagen on Sunday. No one, as far as one could see, had attempted to improve the performance of his helmet. No team was using such a thorough signalling system. When British teams win big, like England&apos;s rugby men in 2003 or the cricketers two years later, they tend to grow complacent. The cyclists, by contrast, take each success as a cue to reset their sights, and whatever one thinks of Sky&apos;s millions being pumped into British cycling, the relationship enabled Dave Brailsford to move on from the Olympics by unveiling new ambitions. To start a road team was to court humiliation, particularly when Brailsford promised to produce a British winner of the Tour de France within five years. There was ridicule when Bradley Wiggins, touted as potentially Britain&apos;s first winner, struggled to 24th place in 2010. But look at the results in this, their second season: stage wins in the Tour Down Under, the Tour of Oman, the Tour of California, the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and the Tour de France, a podium place in Paris-Nice, overall victories in the Bayern-Rundfahrt and the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, and second and third in the Vuelta. Firm foundations are being laid. Cavendish&apos;s switch to Team Sky for next season now seems to depend only on the fine print and a possible conflict between his interests and those of Wiggins will be easily solved, at least for a year. His target for 2012 will be the Olympic road race, which is scheduled for 28 July, the first Saturday of the Games, only six days after the end of the Tour de France. With the added significance of offering Britain an early gold, it will be a tough test for a pure sprinter and to give himself the best chance of a win he will have to sacrifice most or perhaps all of the Tour, meaning that there will be no fourth consecutive glory dash up the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Wiggins will concentrate on leading Team Sky in a third assault on the Tour, followed by either the Olympic time trial or the team pursuit \u2013 probably the latter, since Tony Martin of Germany finished more than a minute ahead of him last week in a time trial of comparable length. That will make him unavailable to help tow Cavendish up nine ascents of Box Hill, while Millar&apos;s participation depends on the consequences of the US Olympic Committee&apos;s forthcoming appeal against the ban on the runner LaShawn Merritt, who like Millar has served a doping ban. Olympic s also mean that Cavendish will have only four team-mates in London, as opposed to seven in Denmark. But after Sunday, who would bet against him? As in Bordeaux and Paris a year ago, he showed that although the team structure is vital to what he does, he is also fully capable of responding to an emergency by seizing the initiative. Once again, with the stakes at their highest, a British cyclist had found a way to win. Tinkerman&apos;s tactics bring instant success for Inter It may have been the most straightforward piece of tinkering Claudio Ranieri has ever undertaken. Called in to become Massimo Moratti&apos;s fourth head coach at Internazionale since the departure of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to Real Madrid two years ago, and to end a run of four defeats and one draw since the start of the season, Ranieri did the obvious by replacing his predecessor&apos;s disastrous three-man defence with a standard back four. Immediate result? Saturday&apos;s 3-1 win at Bologna. We are living through a time in which, thanks to such commentators as Jonathan Wilson and the Zonal Marking website, tactics and formations exist in unusual variety and are widely and endlessly discussed. So when Fabio Capello stumbles upon a functioning 4-2-3-1 for England against Bulgaria but then switches back to a sterile 4-4-2 against Wales, everyone notices. In recent weeks a handful of teams, among them Antonio Conte&apos;s Juventus, have been using the sort of authentic 4-2-4 not witnessed since the Brazilians of 1958. The Tinkerman Ranieri&apos;s intervention showed that however much we revere the individual genius of the Messis, the Rooneys and the Silvas, such considerations are, for good or ill, the basis of modern football. Push comes to shove off It is possible that the discord between Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa has its origin in the last race of the 2008 season, when the Brazilian spent half a minute believing that he had become world champion in front of his home crowd in S\u00e3o Paulo, only for the Englishman to dash the cup from his lips. The sight of a Ferrari mechanic headbutting the garage wall captured an anguish that Massa must have felt many times over. A couple of incidents this season, provoked by Hamilton&apos;s waywardness, fanned the embers of their mutual disregard and following Sunday&apos;s race in Singapore, push came to shove off as well as on the track. Such behaviour is only possible when the drivers are no longer conscious of risking their own and each other&apos;s lives. They both need to get a grip. richard.williams@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/sep/26/qatar-manchester-united-buyout-rumours", "sentences": ["The Glazer family&apos;s deferral last week of the proposed flotation of Manchester United on the Singapore stock exchange led to the resurgence of rumours that none other than Qatar&apos;s emir himself was in London to negotiate a \u00a31.6bn purchase of the club."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-26T22:32:00Z", "title": "David Frost puts end to rumours of Qatar buying out Manchester United", "tags": ["Manchester United", "The Glazer family", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "The Glazer family&apos;s deferral last week of the proposed flotation of Manchester United on the Singapore stock exchange led to the resurgence of rumours that none other than Qatar&apos;s emir himself was in London to negotiate a \u00a31.6bn purchase of the club. Now may be time to put those rumours to bed. Digger can point to the existence of an interview on Saturday with Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, denying that United are a target of the Qatar Investment Authority. (He is expansive on the Palestinian and Syrian situations but, if you are only interested in United, spool forward to 18 mins 24 secs.)Sheikh Hamad is the QIA&apos;s executive chairman and so can be presumed to have been involved in any strategic investment in the Premier League champions. He also speaks with the weight of being a Qatari royal and the prime minister of the desert nation, and his denial of any link with United is pretty categorical. &quot;That&apos;s not true,&quot; said Sheikh Hamad in an interview on the Qatar-owned Al Jazeera channel and conducted by Sir David Frost. &quot;We announced a few weeks ago that we did not negotiate that. A lot of people talk about &apos;Qatar now will buy this, they will pay that.&apos; This also makes the price good for anything that will be sold.&quot; So he is hinting more at the Glazers putting up a shop window than Qatari interest. Still, that did not deter Frost, an Arsenal fan, who at one point interjected to beseech Qatar to buy the Gunners instead. Again Sheikh Hamad chose a dismissive response. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not specialised in the clubs. I&apos;m not fond of football.&quot; Sion look to abolish Uefa As leading clubs begin to manoeuvre for a bigger say in how football is run, a Swiss side heads to court on Tuesday pushing ultimately for the dissolution of Uefa itself. Sion were expelled from the Europa League by the Uefa-appointed disciplinary body after using six ineligible players in their defeat of Celtic last month. An independent panel rejected Sion&apos;s appeal. But last week Sion were awarded an interim judgment for their reinstatement from a court in the Swiss canton of Vaud. It approved Sion&apos;s claim on right-to-work grounds for its players. The match involving Celtic and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid went ahead anyway and another hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. Sion&apos;s president, Christian Constantin, said: &quot;The judge can pass an order not to validate the results. If the court confirms the prior judgment I&apos;ll demand the dissolution of Uefa for having violated the ruling of a court.&quot; That is surely a long way off and Uefa, indeed, seems pretty relaxed since, had Michel Platini intervened, he would have breached its statutes over the independence of disciplinary processes. Still, if the courts again carry Constantin&apos;s right-to-employment argument, then football&apos;s transfer system could face major upheaval. Ridsdale&apos;s ticket charge Peter Ridsdale is due in court on Tuesday to fight fraud charges from Cardiff Council&apos;s trading-standards department over the alleged mis-sale of a season-ticket promotion the club ran while he was chief executive. Conviction would disqualify him from holding any position as an owner or director of a football club but Ridsdale always denied any wrongdoing. Already, though, he is vindicated: after reviewing the evidence the council has withdrawn the case against him. Whelan eyes the beach Dave Whelan is known to be looking for a buyer for Wigan Athletic who can take the club on and, when he says &quot;I&apos;m pushing 75&quot;, it is clear he has an eye on his retirement plans. Some plans he has, too, it seems. Whelan&apos;s family are owners of the four-star St Brelade&apos;s Bay Hotel in Jersey, which has undergone a \u00a310m refurbishment that has recently been completed. (And after all the money he has put into the Latics, who could blame him if that is where the spare \u00a34m odd from Charles N&apos;Zogbia&apos;s sale has gone?) So when he says &quot;I might not be around much longer,&quot; it is surely not as maudlin as it sounds. It is not the pearly gates that await Whelan but a nice comfy terrace overlooking a beach. matt.scott@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/27/dads-army-david-croft-dies", "sentences": ["Croft, who graduated from Sandhurst, rose through the army ranks to major, and served in North Africa, India and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-27T13:51:59Z", "title": "Dad's Army co-creator David Croft dies", "tags": ["David Croft", "Television industry", "BBC", "Media", "Comedy", "Culture", "Television", "Comedy", "UK news"], "article": "David Croft, the TV comedy writer and producer responsible for BBC sitcoms including Dad&apos;s Army, It Ain&apos;t Half Hot Mum, Hi-de-Hi, &apos;Allo &apos;Allo and Are You Being Served?, has died aged 89.

Originally aired between 1968 and 1977, it remains one of BBC2&apos;s most popular shows even today. The duo also wrote It Ain&apos;t Half Hot Mum \u2013 which they considered the funniest of all their collaborations \u2013 Hi-de-Hi! and You Rang M&apos;Lord. Croft also wrote Are You Being Served? and &apos;Allo &apos;Allo with Jeremy Lloyd, and later teamed up with Richard Spendlove to write Oh Doctor Beeching! Croft, who graduated from Sandhurst, rose through the army ranks to major, and served in North Africa, India and Singapore. His experiences in the armed forces provided much of the material for Dad&apos;s Army and It Ain&apos;t Half Hot Mum. Croft was born into showbusiness. His parents were both actors and he appeared in a cinema advert as a child, before landing a small part in a 1939 film of Goodbye, Mr Chips. He wrote scripts for pantomimes before working in television as a producer, director and writer.

Citi said:  The recent 20% fall in the Fresnillo price has resulted in the group falling below our target price and today we upgrade from sell to hold primarily on the basis of that share price move.  We see the immediate future of Fresnillo as bright because it has a healthy string of greenfield and brownfield expansions in the years ahead. It also looks to be the UK precious metal producer with the most potential in the time frame of 10-30 years ahead, because of the quality and nature of its reserves.

Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:  Little by little investors are becoming more optimistic that discussions to resolve the European debt crisis will turn into actions that will actually prevent the contagion of the debt crisis. The bullish move higher shows that there&apos;s a real feeling within the market that even if Greece does fail to pay back its debts a domino effect of defaults amongst peripheral states can be averted.  But Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, warned:  There are likely to be two phases of the rally we are seeing in equity markets this week.  The first phase, which we are in right now, is based on optimism and relief that Europe&apos;s leaders finally recognise the danger that is engulfing stock markets and economy&apos;s in the region and is prepared to implement strong and co-ordinated actions to contain contagion of debt and beef up bank liquidity within the region.  The second phase will come when the market actually see&apos;s what actions are being planned and assesses whether they are both credible and realistic. Considering that today we have seen a firm quashing of earlier speculation that the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) will be increased to \u20ac2trn what we may actually see in terms of a rescue plan remains particularly clouded.  International Personal Finance, the emerging markets lender, led the FTSE 250 higher, up 28.8p to 225.3p after JP Morgan Cazenove moved its recommendation from underweight to neutral in the wake of its 27% decline since August:  The fall in IPF&apos;s share price has pushed the valuation to a level which we believe is too low. After substantial underperformance against both the market and Provident Financial in recent weeks, we move our recommendation back to neutral from underweight.  Imagination Technologies added 27p to 450p after Goldman Sachs issued a buy note on the chip designer, suggesting that it should benefit from forthcoming launches from Apple and Google&apos;s Android operating system. Lower down the market life sciences company ValiRx rose nearly 3% to 0.59p after Singapore&apos;s Volition announced plans for a listing on America&apos;s OTC Bulletin Board, with ValiRx holding $1.1m worth of its shares.

RBS said:  This underlines the ongoing consolidation activity in the fragmented UK engineering consultant space. WSP is an obvious possible takeover target for an international engineering consultant seeking to gain strong market positions in various European economies such as Sweden and the UK, with strong niche positions in Australia, US, South Africa and the Middle East.

But how else to explain the results of the research I carried out in Ethiopia and Kenya last year? Despite the vast historical differences between the two countries, leaders in both were remarkably eager to imitate other nations they saw as successful. Moreover, both groups looked to one region in particular: east Asia. &quot;In my head, I&apos;ve got practically everything mapped out \u2013 if you give me 10 years, I will give you South Korea,&quot; proclaimed one Kenyan technocrat. &quot;We are 20 years behind China,&quot; said an Ethiopian bureaucrat, &quot;and we&apos;re trying to do what they did to get where they are.&quot; These feelings are not just held privately, but make their way into policy and practice. Both Kenya&apos;s ambitious vision 2030 long-term development plan and Ethiopia&apos;s growth and transformation plan (pdf) draw heavily on similar concepts in Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere in the region. All four foreign advisers on Kenya&apos;s key national planning body originate from east Asia, and pamphlets used to train cadres in Ethiopia&apos;s ruling party, the Ethiopian People&apos;s Revolutionary Democratic Front, use Taiwan, South Korea and China as examples of agricultural development and state intervention. Most senior decision makers I spoke to had visited the region several times on dedicated study trips, and such visits grow in number every year. Asia (and especially China&apos;s) new and much-heralded economic ties with Africa may certainly have something to do with this, but not as much as one might expect. If economic dependency were all that mattered, the EU - still the biggest trading partner of, and donor to, Ethiopia and Kenya - would surely rank first as the model to follow. Instead, many Africans view east Asia&apos;s development experiences as more replicable, in the medium term, than those of the west, which seem slow, remote and academic by comparison. Policymakers have seen, in their own lifetimes, how countries such as China and Singapore were able to &quot;come of age&quot; in a hostile international environment. So why shouldn&apos;t they, too, be able to turn things around? The lessons these governments draw from such models vary, but many hark back to principles that have become decidedly unpopular among mainstream western civil society and donors. Kenya and Ethiopia look at east Asia, and see the need for a strong and unifying national leadership that can transform and unite traditional communities into a new nation of &quot;modern&quot; citizens. This leadership is responsible for using the country&apos;s resources to build large and ambitious infrastructure projects, such as Ethiopia&apos;s controversial Gibe III dam. It oversees but does not control the economy, intervening directly where necessary to create globally competitive industries and sectors. It relies on advanced technology and double-digit economic growth to solve most of the country&apos;s problems. So important is this economic growth, in fact, that democracy is hardly possible without it; countries develop in stages, they point out, and cannot be expected to become democratic overnight. All of these lessons are a far cry from both the market-led approach of the Washington consensus, and from the participatory, flexible and community-led route advocated by its critics. Of course, Ethiopian and Kenyan leaders do not claim to use east Asia as an exact blueprint for development. There is much talk of adapting foreign models to local social, historical and cultural realities. Nor do the two countries draw identical lessons: Kenya&apos;s history of capitalism means that it looks to economically liberal countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, while Ethiopia&apos;s communist past makes it more comfortable with countries that have a history of strong state intervention, such as China and South Korea. Many other factors will continue to influence development in Africa \u2013 not least how successfully these lessons are actually adapted and applied. However, the fact that the east Asian model is so attractive to many African countries is bound to have profound implications for development practitioners. Western aid is not the only game in town anymore, and the global development agenda is no more immune from the influence of a rising Asia than the global economic system has turned out to be. Developing countries can now choose between an ever-growing variety of donors, trading partners, investors and development strategies. Whether or not we agree with the models they pick - or even with the idea of a development &quot;model&quot; at all - we would do well to listen to and engage with these views. There&apos;ll be no point in trying only to reform and improve western aid if the real debate is happening somewhere else. \u2022 Elsje Fourie is a doctoral candidate at the school of international studies, University of Trento, Italy.

An FTT has long been championed by campaigners and this is regarded by them as a breakthrough. It is vehemently opposed by the Conservative government. What is a financial transactions tax? An FTT is, as the name suggests, a tax levied by governments on a variety of financial transactions, in the way that stamp duty is levied on housing transactions in Britain. It already exists in relation to certain financial transactions in Britain such as transactions in the stock market, where the stamp duty reserve tax is levied at a rate of 0.5% on all transactions. Why are campaigners in favour of it? There are two key arguments in favour of FTTs. The first is that, with governments struggling with high levels of both public sector debt and deficits throughout, it is only right that the financial sector makes some contribution in the form of new revenues. The second argument is broader, arguing that the financial sector is the primary cause of the current crisis. Therefore, while raising tax revenues from the financial sector, it is possible that the tax will have a deterrent effect on financial transactions in total. This could reduce the amount of speculative trading in particular. Why is the British government so opposed to it? The FTT would bring into the tax net entirely new types of transactions, such as foreign exchange trading and bond market transactions. London is the world&apos;s leading centre for foreign exchange trading and the leading European centre for international government trade, as well as other assets. The government argues that the trade will migrate to other centres, such as Switzerland, New York or elsewhere. It argues instead that any FTT must be imposed multilaterally, with at least all the current major trading centres signing up simultaneously. Otherwise, it argues, total transactions will not decline but simply move to overseas centres, with the consequent loss of jobs and taxes from the British economy. Will it work? It&apos;s much easier to impose taxes on assets such as shares because they are listed on a stock exchange. The exchange can refuse to register a transfer of ownership unless the tax is paid. By contrast, bonds and particularly foreign exchange are not registered anywhere. A German bank in Singapore can sell Japanese yen to a US hedge fund via its office in Bermuda. Set against that, there are two reasons to believe that the FTT would have an impact. The first is that it isn&apos;t banks or securities firms who pay these costs at all, but their customers. Customers, like a company that needs to buy foreign exchange to fund building a factory, will still need the foreign exchange irrespective of a small transaction tax. But it might curb the operations of the hedge fund, which operates with very small margins of profit and does huge volumes of transactions. The second is that the banks and securities firms have huge investments residing in all the centres. Switching personnel away from the EU would entail an enormous cost. But if customers pay the tax, not the banks, does the tax miss the target?  Not entirely. Companies will face a new tax but speculative activity may be reduced. Is there a better alternative? Yes. If the objective is to achieve greater tax revenues from the financial sector and change its behaviour, governments have enormous levers at their disposal. A straightforward tax on bank profits would work. Banks can&apos;t relocate because the profits would be levied on their EU activities wherever they were headquartered. And they can&apos;t pull out of Europe entirely because rivals would have a field day with the huge profits from all types of banking in Europe. Similarly, governments could change behaviour by imposing differential capital requirements, with, say, a 35% capital cushion required for proprietary trading in derivatives and a 3% cushion required for productive lending in housing, infrastructure and large-scale transport projects. This would &quot;nudge&quot; banks towards productive lending and away from speculation. Radically, given the bailouts, deposit guarantees and even bank licences, governments have the levers to force banks to increase their lending to the productive sectors of the economy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/sep/29/nigel-slaters-simple-cooking-preview", "sentences": ["Posterity has developed a greater fondness for this strange and\u00a0audacious work, from its weird introductory fanfare to its uproarious climax: this performance, recorded in Singapore&apos;s Esplanade Concert Hall in 2010, was part of a well-received complete cycle of Mahler&apos;s symphonies by Sir Simon."], "publicationDate": "2011-09-29T21:00:05Z", "title": "TV highlights 30/09/2011: The Culture Show |  Nigel Slater's Simple Cooking | Mahler's 1st Symphony | Strictly Come Dancing | Songwriters' Night | Al Murray Live \u2013 Barrel Of Fun", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "Strictly Come Dancing", "Comedy", "Al Murray"], "article": "The Culture Show7pm, BBC2 Every episode of The Culture Show is such a disparate jumble of personalities and projects that it&apos;s a challenge to any viewer to remain uninterested.

It was a year of tumultuous events \u2013 earthquakes in New Zealand, protests and uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the return of the ash cloud, debt problems in Greece and other parts of Europe, and rioting at home. Any predictions about travel trends at the beginning of the year \u2013 the growing appetite for travel in the Middle East, for example, with the launch of new flights into the region \u2013 appeared to be on shaky ground just a few months in. On a brighter note, the trend for booking holidays with small, specialist companies continued to grow.

And though allegiance to some destinations and tour operators may have shifted, readers seem as keen as ever to travel. Here&apos;s our full list of winners. Ethical travel award     Sunrise Festival in Somerset.  Photograph: Mark Falmouth    Winner: Sunrise Festival This small British festival, held in Somerset, really impressed us with its commitment to sustainability, but not at the expense of fun. Festivals have never been more popular, and are typically a huge litter-generating, electricity-consuming exercise in wasteful excess. Yet Sunrise has shown that they don&apos;t have to be this way, proving that you can host a wild, hedonistic party, with loud music, light shows and a raucous crowd, without impacting on the environment. The festival policy is based on wanting to &quot;live in harmony with the earth&quot; and making changes at grassroots level in the hope they will inspire others.

Best travel Website Winner: Airbnb     Rent a New York loft with Airbnb    Very few websites can claim to be game-changing \u2013 but Airbnb has been exactly that. It banked on the idea that people would be happy to open their homes to strangers, for a fee. They were right... in a very big way. It&apos;s seen an 800% grown in service in the last year, and been valued at more than $1bn. According to a TechCrunch post last year, &quot;on any given night in New York there are more people staying in homes via Airbnb than there are rooms in the biggest hotel in Manhattan&quot;. Not bad for an idea dreamt up by three post-grads in a San Francisco living room in 2007. Favourite UK city     Photograph: Murdo Macleod    For the 12th consecutive year, Edinburgh has held on to its title as the UK&apos;s favourite city. Neither the historic charms of Durham and Bath nor the vibrant arts scene and nightlife in Newcastle and Liverpool are a match for the cultural dynamism and austere beauty of this Scottish city. 1 Edinburgh 2 Durham 3 Bath 4 Newcastle 5 Liverpool Favourite overseas city Tokyo proved that its meteoric rise to the top of the city charts was no fluke by hanging on to the title for the second year running. Now the dynamic city is facing one of its biggest challenges yet, trying to persuade tourists to return in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami that hit the north-east of the country in March. Though Tokyo is 200km from the site of the disaster, visitor numbers have taken a big hit. This prompted hoteliers to cut hotel rates by as much as 50%, with the result that this notoriously expensive city is affordable for many visitors for the first time. 1 Tokyo 2 Sydney 3 Cape Town 4 San Francisco 5 New York Favourite European country     Chateau de Chillon, Lake Geneva, Switzerland.

But on 11 March, disaster struck: a devastating earthquake and tsunami in the north-east of the country. Though much of the country&apos;s infrastructure has returned to normal, it is feared the damage to Japan&apos;s tourism industry will take longer to repair, despite enticing discounts being offered by hoteliers and tour operators to encourage visitors to return. 1 Japan 2 Maldives 3 Peru 4 New Zealand 5 Vietnam Best travel agent A previous winner in this category and last year&apos;s runner-up, Journeys \u00e0 la Carte, has reclaimed its crown this year.

But while the president welcomed the death of the &quot;YouTube Bin Laden&quot;, the US authorities were in no hurry to overtly claim credit for the assassination as they managed the potential fallout of the killing in Yemen and across the Middle East. Speaking a few hours after the drone strike that killed Awlaki, Obama made only a few brief remarks on the subject, describing his death as &quot;another significant milestone&quot; in America&apos;s fight against al-Qaida. The US regarded Awlaki as one of al-Qaida&apos;s most dangerous operatives because of his potential appeal to western radicals. &quot;This is further proof that al-Qaida and its affiliates will have no safe haven anywhere in the world,&quot; Obama said. But Obama&apos;s low key speech stood in marked contrast to the assassination of Osama bin Laden, which was rapidly followed by media briefings and photographs of the president and his team observing the operation. &quot;I can&apos;t talk about the operational details,&quot; Obama said in a radio interview on Friday when asked if he had ordered the killing. &quot;This is something that we have been working with the Yemeni government for quite some time.&quot; In large part the reticence reflects US sensitivities about Yemen, a country in violent turmoil and where US involvement has provided a propaganda coup for Muslim radicals. Secret US diplomatic cables released last year by WikiLeaks and the Guardian reveal the secrecy that surrounded an offer by Yemen&apos;s president to Washington of &quot;unfettered access&quot; to carry out unilateral strikes against top al-Qaida targets on his soil. The cable narrates how president Ali Abdullah Saleh effectively &quot;outsourced&quot; Yemen&apos;s own counter-terrorism efforts to the United States. In line with the covert US approach revealed in the cables, details of the Awlaki operation remain scant. The Yemeni government announced that Awlaki was &quot;targeted and killed&quot; around 9.55am outside the town of Khasaf in a desert stretch of Jawf province, 87 miles (140km) east of the capital Sana&apos;a.  Saba, Yemen&apos;s official news agency, reported that the attack also killed Samir Khan, an American citizen who was an editor of Inspire, an al-Qaida-affiliated English-language internet magazine. Last year Khan wrote a piece for Inspire titled: &quot;I am proud to be a traitor to America.&quot; Several bodyguards are also believed to have been killed, but no details have been given. A senior tribal chief who helped bury the bodies in a cemetery in Jawf told the Associated Press that seven people were killed in the strike, their bodies completely charred. The chief said the brother of one of the dead, who had given the group shelter in his home, had witnessed the strike. According to the chief, the witness said Awlaki was travelling in a pick-up with six other people on their way to neighbouring Marib province. They stopped for breakfast in the desert and were sitting on the ground to eat when they spotted drones, so they rushed to their truck. A Hellfire missile fired from a drone struck the truck, leaving it a charred husk and killing all of those inside. The chief spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be connected to the group, and he did not identify the witness. US officials were unwilling to go into detail about America&apos;s role in Awlaki&apos;s killing. But it is likely that the hunt for Awlaki would have been overseen by the CIA, in large part to enable it to be classified as &quot;covert action&quot; that not only gives the American pursuers a freer hand in how they operate, but means they are not obliged to seek the approval of the Yemeni government. The CIA launched a failed drone attack to kill Awlaki in May after Obama gave the unusual authorisation for the killing of an American citizen. It was revealed in June that the CIA is building a secret base in an unnamed Middle Eastern country to launch drone attacks within Yemen \u2013 without the necessity of informing President Ali Abdullah Saleh&apos;s US-friendly but beleaguered administration, which has an uncertain future. But the CIA has not been alone. Much of the pursuit of al-Qaida targets in Yemen has been carried out by the &quot;hunter-killer teams&quot; from the highly secretive Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), a military operation that has its own drones and can call on air strikes. It was members of the Navy&apos;s special operations forces under the command of JSOC who killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May. According to a recent book, Top Secret America, by Washington Post reporters Dana Priest and William Arkin, JSOC has launched intelligence operations and lethal raids, not only in countries where the US is fighting openly \u2013 Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 but in Pakistan, Somalia, the Philippines, Nigeria and Syria. And in Yemen.  However, JSOC is not legally permitted to carry out covert operations \u2013 in which the US role is not acknowledged \u2013 of the kind pursued by the CIA. Technically JSOC&apos;s operations are defined as &quot;traditional military activities&quot; requiring disclosure.  But Priest and Arkin write that is a fine distinction in practice. &quot;Many national security officials, however, say JSOC&apos;s operations are so similar to the CIA&apos;s that they amount to covert action. The unit takes its orders directly from the president or the secretary of defence and is managed and overseen by a military-only chain of command,&quot; they write. The administration&apos;s unwillingness to detail US involvement also reflects the fact that this was a much more controversial operation than the assassination of Bin Laden.  Awlaki was a US citizen, had not been indicted for any crime, and the strike took place in a country where US forces are not officially waging war. Whatever the legalities, Awlaki&apos;s death has sparked a debate over how significant his demise will prove to be. Professor Rohan Gunaratna, head of the the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore, said Awlaki&apos;s killing was a significant blow to al-Qaida. &quot;Anwar al-Awlaki was not only the a ideological leader, he was an operational leader. He was a Bin Laden in the making but he would have posed an even greater threat because he understood the western world, especially the Musilims living in the west,&quot; he said. &quot;Awlaki was the go-to cleric for English-speaking Muslims who sought to engage in violent jihad. He was the most influential radical tourism recruiter for Islamic revolutionary groups, and he was savvy about using new media, and old,&quot; said Charles Kurzman, author of The Missing Martyrs: Why There are so Few Muslim Terrorists. But Kurzman said Awlaki&apos;s influence had ultimately proved minimal. &quot;He saw revolutionary violence as an individual duty that was required of every Muslim. Fortunately virtually all Muslims disagreed.&quot; Kurzman said: &quot;Given that Awlaki&apos;s messages is sitting on the internet, easily accessible to millions of English-speaking Muslims, it&apos;s very interesting how few have taken him up on his demand that Muslims join the revolutionary movement.&quot; Security officials on both sides of the Atlantic believe that Awlaki&apos;s death is further evidence that the strategy of targeting al-Qaida&apos;s leaders is working.Crucially, say American officials, it is not just the top tier that has been removed. &quot;The attrition reaches right into the organisation,&apos; said one US diplomatic source. &quot;You are now talking about the of people who the public have never heard of. The strength in depth that was so important a few years ago simply isn&apos;t there any longer. Once it was the &apos;number three&apos; who was always taken out because he was exposed. &quot;Now it&apos;s numbers four to forty who are being hit, too.&quot; There is also quiet satisfaction elsewhere. In Saudi Arabia, senior interior ministry officials say that al-Qaida, once a major security problem in the country, is now &quot;dying if not dead&quot;. Many of the top Saudi militants left their native land to take refuge in the Yemen which appears now to be less of a safe haven than they may have thought."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/02/f1-2011-xbox-ps3-review", "sentences": ["Which is where the game is at its best, immersive (even throwing in the option of the safety car) and engaging \u2013 concentrate too hard on threading the needle at Singapore&apos;s left-right-left turn 10 chicane and turn 11 will bite you \u2013 putting the player in the cockpit to a grippingly real extent."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-01T23:05:36Z", "title": "F1 2011 \u2013 review", "tags": ["Racing games", "Sports games", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Xbox", "PS3", "Games", "Technology", "Sport", "Culture"], "article": "As impressive and formidable as its real-life counterpart, last year&apos;s Codemasters&apos; F1 game was a fine piece of simulation and terrific fun but marred by elements of buggy incongruity that stood out in a sport where detail is paramount. Little has changed on track this year, which gives F1 2011 the welcome chance to iron out these foibles and show a spot of race pace. Technically, the nuts and bolts \u2013 how the car performs \u2013 remain solid and have even improved, especially in combination with a steering wheel and race seat. With basic assists on, the weight and sense of delicate control is perfectly conveyed and will be more than enough of a handful for beginners (the lack of a basic tutorial seems an oversight), but upon taking full control the modelling is occasionally a little haphazard in rear downforce on quick corners and turning in on slow ones. But these are niggles at the high end of performance simulation; in general gameplay, the car is the star. Meanwhile, the introduction of DRS and KERS is frankly revelatory. There have been complaints from drivers about the amount of button-pressing required in-cockpit, and it appears they have a point. Managing both systems in practice and qualifying is a huge task, and, during a race, paying attention to being within one second of drivers (allowing activation of DRS or trying to fend off a DRS-enabled pursuer) is a nerve-racking distraction from the business of staying on the island, yet hugely satisfying when successful. Of the improvements, Codemasters has dealt with the major issues. Cars are no longer held needlessly in pit boxes; AI qualifying laps are grounded in reality and their level of aggression and lap times more consistent, making planning through a race strategically definitely achievable. Which is a good fit with new features such as more realistic tyre degradation and fuel mixture options \u2013 both plotted accurately \u2013 so, as has happened this season, the Pirellis will drop off the cliff with overuse. Some minor grievances do remain, however, and penalties are still applied a little randomly (even when not driving as Lewis Hamilton) and there&apos;s some indecision in overtaking by the AI , but they don&apos;t spoil the all-round experience.

In 1968, a year that saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, a man turned up on the doorstep at the Log Cabin, the ramshackle, open-all-hours-to-all-comers crash pad in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, that Zappa and numerous other weird people called home. &quot;My name is Raven. I brought you a present,&quot; this stranger announced, handing to Zappa a transparent bag, apparently filled with blood, before pointing a revolver at his chest. Calmly, Zappa cajoled and manipulated Raven into walking with him, and numerous spectators, including Zappa&apos;s 24-year-old English secretary, to a nearby lake. He then persuaded everyone present to start throwing things into the water, including Raven, who threw in his gun. The secretary, Pauline Butcher, threw in a twig, which &quot;floated on the algae&quot; causing her to look round &quot;apologetically&quot;. After that, Zappa, shoved the bag of blood back into Raven&apos;s hand, saying: &quot;You must leave now.&quot; Raven did. Immediately exhorted by the many witnesses to call the police, Zappa refused. Why? &quot;Because if I call the police, the police will arrest him and he&apos;ll go to jail and no one deserves to go to jail.&quot; For Butcher, who worked for Zappa at the Log Cabin, and lived there too, this was just another gesture of outrageous and frustrating anti- authoritarianism from a man who was full of such gestures, a man who, nevertheless, she admired to the point of worship. Now, 40 years on from her time as Zappa&apos;s live-in assistant, Butcher has written a book, Freak Out! My Life With Frank Zappa, offering a detailed account of what she now understands to have been the two most remarkable \u2013 and marketable \u2013 years of her existence. Looking at Butcher now, at this the casually but carefully dressed woman in her 60s, as she nervously sips sparkling water in the Royal Garden Hotel, in west London, the experiences she describes in her memoir seem hard to believe, very far from the life that she lives now, as Mrs Bird, with her husband, a banker with Rothschild&apos;s, in Singapore. But that life is not so far away, not today, anyway. It was in this hotel that Butcher, at 23, first encountered Zappa, when she was sent by her stenographic agency to transcribe and type up some lyrics for him. Here she sits, fretting about what the survivors among those who lived or hung out at the Log Cabin during those two years might think of what she has written about them. Not very long after her first few meetings with Zappa, Butcher moved to the US and became his full-time secretary, despite the lack of convention with which the role was first suggested to her: &quot;Do you think if we fucked, you could still work for me as my secretary?&quot; Zappa asked. Butcher declined intercourse, although at that point she was certainly nurturing romantic thoughts about him. She was upset when she turned up in the US \u2013 pretty much on the strength of this most slender of invitations \u2013 and discovered that Zappa had a wife and a baby son. All the way through their strange relationship, Butcher declined to have sex with &quot;Frank&quot;, even though Mrs Zappa \u2013 Gail \u2013 did not believe this. Gail eventually confronted Butcher with her suspicions while &quot;researching&quot; a book about her husband&apos;s many groupies, of whom she had been one herself. That book, never written, had been Zappa&apos;s idea. He was obsessed with groupies without musing too much on the inequality inherent in the relationships. So what the hell did this young woman think she was doing, immersing herself in this life so different from her own, and in some respects, so repulsive to her? Butcher still doesn&apos;t know. For her, it was all about &quot;Frank&quot; and still is. What Butcher is still pondering is this: &quot;What was his motivation in asking me to go there?&quot; Butcher admits that her life in London was &quot;pretty dull&quot;. She wore minis, and drove a Mini, but actually spent little time doing anything other than working hard as a typist and as an instructor at the modelling school she&apos;d attended, teaching credulous, hopeful girls like herself, girls without quite enough beauty to make it in modelling, whatever instruction they purchased. Certainly Butcher hoped that she would get &quot;a break&quot; from her association with someone who was famous. She nurtured her own ambitions to be a writer even then, ambitions that Zappa encouraged. But she was also intensely devoted to Zappa. &quot;I was besotted with him. I was aware that he was something unusual. I don&apos;t think I was in love with him. I agree with his ideas about romantic love, that it was overplayed.&quot; Butcher also believes that Zappa wasn&apos;t really &quot;like&quot; the life that he lived. &quot;Underneath it he was a very conventional character. I couldn&apos;t have done it with the others around at that time \u2013 Rod Stewart, Jeff Beck, those crazy people, who took drugs.&quot; Drug-taking, notably, was something that Zappa could not tolerate. In the world of rock biography, fandom is exploited heavily. Pretty much anyone who can lay claim to some level of articulacy, and who has a modicum of provenance to offer, can find a publisher for their musings. When Butcher sent out her proposal, she received 12 expressions of enthusiastic interest right away. But Butcher&apos;s book is of wider interest. Sure, it describes a formative time in the life of an innovative musical artist, which Zappa most certainly was. But it also captures a particularly intense experience of a very brief, yet enormously influential, period in the evolution of western womanhood. Butcher worked for Zappa during the interstitial time between &quot;sexual liberation&quot; and &quot;women&apos;s liberation&quot;. Zappa was a sexual libertarian and enthusiastic celebrant of &quot;groupie culture&quot;, while his straight, conservative secretary was shocked and appalled by the sexual incontinence all around her, and the tensions in their relationship are instructive. Butcher herself, rather charmingly, is almost entirely lacking in the desire to subject her observations to interpretive analysis, although she writes in huge detail, drawing on the numerous long letters she sent back home to England. &quot;I was so ga-ga, at first, so shocked \u2026 I just observed it all and I loved writing home to my family, telling them every detail of it all.&quot; But gradually she began to experience moments of clarity. When Butcher heard one of the &quot;Mothers&quot; \u2013 the members of Zappa&apos;s backing band, the Mothers of Invention \u2013 say he felt sorry for one groupie because she had been with three different musicians on consecutive nights, she became irritated, since the men who behaved that way were congratulated for &quot;scoring&quot;. Or as she says, with understatement: &quot;I began to notice the double-standard.&quot; Butcher was upset when Zappa did not see her point of view. Something clicked in her mind when she saw feminist campaigners in the news. &quot;I saw a banner that said: &apos;Love me less, respect me more.&apos; And I just thought: &apos;Yes. That&apos;s it.&apos;&quot; Butcher read Kate Millett&apos;s Sexual Politics, which came as a revelation to her, as it did to many women at that time. Excitedly, she told Zappa what she had realised. &quot;I thought he&apos;d be sympathetic, but he wasn&apos;t, completely the opposite.&quot; From there on in, developments conspired to fragment the group that had lived in the Log Cabin. Butcher herself says: &quot;I didn&apos;t want to spend my life devoted to him. I found that people were only interested in my connection with Frank, and not in me. Once I left Frank, I never mentioned him again for years.&quot; Butcher returned to England, went to Cambridge and did a psychology degree, married a fellow student, and began teaching. But when her husband moved from teaching to banking, and they had a son, she gave up her career for a second time. Bereft when her son left home and went to university, she decided to pick up her youthful ambition again, and write. She soon worked out that even after all those years, it was Zappa whom people were interested in. Butcher sees the irony: &quot;The only story I could write that no one else could write was this one, about living and working with Frank Zappa.&quot; She spent four decades trying, but Pauline Butcher couldn&apos;t quite shake her belief in Zappa, and his power to add glamour and interest to her life. In that respect, it&apos;s a sad story, this story, of the one who didn&apos;t, in the end, get away. But in other respects, the ending is happy. Pauline Butcher, the hopeful young woman who wanted to achieve something special and unique, finally did get her wish."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/03/burma-letting-the-waters-flow", "sentences": ["It was going to cause an environmental disaster, sucking the life out of Burma&apos;s most important river and devastating the downstream rice paddy communities; it would have flooded an area the size of Singapore, displacing 10,000 people; 90% of the electricity generated from its turbines would have gone north to China, which is only one-10th as energy-efficient as Japan; the project has exacerbated ethnic tensions with the Kachins in the north of the country."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-03T19:26:12Z", "title": "Burma: letting the waters flow", "tags": ["World news", "Hydrogen power", "Energy", "Environment", "Aung San Suu Kyi", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "There are many good reasons why construction on a huge Chinese-funded dam on the Irrawaddy river in Burma should never be completed.

But none of these would have been\u00a0cited as valid reasons by a Burmese leader. Until now. Quite why President Thein Sein ordered the suspension of the project remains a mystery. He informed parliament that it was against the will of the people, but that has never been much of an obstacle in the past for a nation ruled by military fiat. The dam has certainly been the source of major domestic controversy, amplified by the arrival of a civilian government in March. The decision could be a sign that, after nearly two decades of international isolation, reformists are gaining the upper hand. There are others. A reporter from the BBC&apos;s Burmese language service was allowed into the country \u2013 a rare enough event \u2013 to interview the de facto opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. She has been cautious in her criticisms of the government since her release from house arrest last year, but wrote an open letter calling for the project to be scrapped. She thought she was starting to see the beginnings of change. There are rumours of a mass release of political prisoners. Some websites have been unblocked, and there have been a number of meetings between the new government and Aung San Suu Kyi, although she herself will judge the new government by the results: &quot;I think I&apos;d like to see a few more turns before I believe the wheels are turning.&quot; The halt to the $3.6bn Myitsone dam, the largest single Chinese investment in Burma, will seriously annoy Beijing. There are six other dams in the same cascade which represent a $20bn investment by China. For the same reason that Thein Sein&apos;s decision went down well in Burma, it will be interpreted by China as a move to break free of its orbit. Burma was pushed into China&apos;s arms by the sanctions imposed on it by the EU, US, Canada and Japan. That process\u00a0could now be about to be reversed. China saw in Burma a ready source of energy and raw materials. It had eager clients in the\u00a0crony generals who ran Burma.

Even now traders must wear a jacket and tie with their top buttons done up, while crimes such as chewing gum on the trading floor are punishable by a small fine, as one trader has just discovered. &quot;It turned out he&apos;d bought the gum in the canteen,&quot; says one insider. &quot;So the LME got its money twice.&quot; That seems to be the definition of the perfect trade, and is perhaps the reason the exchange has survived and prospered for more than 130 years. Yet suddenly its gentlemanly way of life, which includes the last open outcry trading pit in Europe, appears under threat as a bidding war has broken out for the member-owned exchange. The suggested value of the LME ranges from \u00a3160m to \u00a31bn, a huge spread, which reflects a couple of points of view. On the upside the LME is a highly liquid market and in 2010 achieved business volumes of 120.3m lots \u2013 equivalent to $11.6 trillion annually and $46bn on an average day. On the downside the LME is not run to make a profit. It is owned by the banks and trading houses that use it, and it charges fees at around a 75% discount to other trading platforms. Its modest profit, therefore, could easily be increased, which is why the LME has more than 10 potential suitors \u2013 with likely bidders thought to include Chicago&apos;s CME Group, Singapore&apos;s SGX and the US online based IntercontinentalExchange. It has also emerged that one of its 94 members, Goldman Sachs, has been quietly doing some preparatory work, having quadrupled its LME stake over the past two years \u2013 although the investment bank declines to comment. So is the LME about to be bought? Any potential deal is unlikely to be concluded quickly, chief executive Martin Abbott insisted on Monday. &quot;If and when the board is satisfied that there is something serious that the shareholders should see \u2026 I can&apos;t imagine that is going to happen before the end of the first quarter, possibly the beginning of Q2,&quot; he said. Still, there remains concern among members about how a different ownership structure might affect London&apos;s historic commodity trading hub, which dates back to the reign of Elizabeth I. Alex Heath, global head of LME sales and trading at INTL FCStone, said: &quot;The LME has survived the tin crisis [of the mid 1980s] and the collapses of Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990, Enron in 2001 and Refco in 2005 \u2013 all of which had exchange membership. It has gone from strength to strength adapting to the ever-changing investment climate and the huge shift into the electronic trading era while balancing the needs of all its members and users. Where changes to the exchange have been introduced they have been through practitioner debate and experience. Looking at other exchanges that have been acquired by interested parties, you will find that often the model is changed to fit the model of the aquisitor, which is more often driven by shareholder interest rather than practitioner or client. The members and the clients of the LME are very proud of their heritage and will debate at some length [the potential sale].&quot; That heritage began in 1571 with the creation of the world&apos;s first commodities market in the City&apos;s Royal Exchange. But by the early 19th century, the venue had become so crowded that metal merchants began gathering at the Jerusalem coffee house on Cornhill, where the LME&apos;s tradition of ring-and-kerb trading began. A merchant with metal to sell would draw a circle in the sawdust on the floor and call out &quot;change&quot;, at which point all those wishing to trade would assemble around the ring and make their bids. After hours, dealings would take place outside, or on the kerb. By 1877 the LME had been created through the establishment of the London Metal Market and Exchange Company, which was based above a hat shop in Lombard Court, but those early traditions remained and continue to this day, despite the surge of\u00a0electronic trading. While trades are now conducted via computer and telephone, much of the business is still done by open outcry in the ring \u2013 where each of the nine metal contracts (aluminium, copper, zinc, lead, tin, nickel, cobalt, steel and molybdenum) are traded in two blocks with a five-minute session for each contract (lasting from 11.40 until 13.10 and from 14.55 until 16.15). Those two sessions are followed by two blocks of 85\u00a0and 45 minutes of &quot;kerb&quot; trading. Only 12 of the LME&apos;s member firms can trade on the floor \u2013 including Amalgamated Metal Trading, Metdist and Barclays \u2013 and the old ways retain supporters. Prices are derived from the most liquid periods and are considered the most representative of industry supply and demand. Such is the LME&apos;s liquidity, its prices are recognised throughout the industry. Of that liquidity, just 1% of trading is for physical product, with the remainder futures. If that seems as though the exchange is tipping its hat at modern derivatives, it is anything but. The opening of the Suez Canal, in 1868, reduced the delivery time of tin from Malaysia and Singapore to match the three months delivery for copper from Chile \u2013 all of which gave rise to LME&apos;s system of daily trading dates for up to three months forward. Modern practices have, in some ways, made the place more conservative, despite the demise of the top hat. Round-the-clock trading and the arrival of US firms are credited with killing off the traditional long lunch, which has put a stop to tales such as that of an inebriated dealer riding on to the trading floor on a unicycle one afternoon. He circled the ring, throwing sweets at the other dealers, who were prevented from trading if they left their seats. What became of him?

The European court of justice ruled that the FA Premier League cannot stop individuals from seeking better deals for TV sports subscriptions than that offered by BSkyB \u2013 which paid more than \u00a31bn for the UK broadcast rights for Premier League matches \u2013 from foreign broadcasters. The ECJ said attempting to prohibit the &quot;import, sale or use of foreign decoder cards is contrary to the freedom to provide services and cannot be justified either in light of the objective of protecting intellectual property rights or by the objective of encouraging the public to attend football stadiums&quot;. However, the court ruled against the bid by Karen Murphy, the landlady of the Red, White and Blue pub in Portsmouth, to be allowed to use a Greek decoder card to show live Premier League matches to pubgoers at much cheaper rates than BSkyB charges commercial premises in the UK on copyright grounds. The ECJ said the transmission in a pub is a &quot;communication to the public&quot;, which means that without the permission of the Premier League Murphy is in breach of the copyright directive. This directive would not stop individuals buying foreign decoder cards for domestic use. However, the ECJ said live match coverage itself was not covered by copyright protection, although the Premier League could claim ownership of FAPL-branded opening video sequences, theme music, on-screen graphics and highlights of previous matches. This means that as long as the FAPL and BSkyB ensure that match coverage includes enough copyright elements pubs will not be allowed to show foreign broadcasts. The Premier League, which sells TV rights exclusively to broadcasters across Europe on a territory-by-territory basis, has been clamping down on British pubs buying in live coverage from foreign broadcasters. The ECJ ruling could potentially have a huge impact on the way BSkyB and other UK and European broadcasters buy rights to sport, films and foreign TV shows. Sky&apos;s share price was down by just over 3% to 635.50p at about 9.20am on Tuesday, as the City reacted to the European ruling. BSkyB makes about \u00a3200m a year in revenue from selling subscriptions to pubs and other commercial premises. The broadcaster has about 44,000 pub, club and office subscribers. It is thought that pub owners like Murphy pay about \u00a31,000 a month for a BSkyB subscription. Murphy slashed these costs by buying a Greek decoder card and a subscription to Nova reportedly at a cost of about \u00a3800 a year. &quot;This is a clear statement from Europe that intellectual property rights cannot be relied upon to fragment the market and charge different prices in different EU countries for the same content,&quot; said Toby Headdon, an intellectual property lawyer at Berwin Leighton Paisner. &quot;The decision looks set to change the licensing landscape in Europe, not just for football broadcasts but potentially for other content such as films and music.&quot; The ECJ also opened the door for the dismantling of the FAPL&apos;s country-specific sports rights regime, stating that such a system of selling matches to broadcasters is &quot;irreconcilable&quot; with the aim of EU law to create one internal market. &quot;Payment by the television stations of a premium in order to ensure themselves absolute territorial exclusivity goes beyond what is necessary to ensure the right holders appropriate remuneration,&quot; the ECJ said in its ruling. &quot;Such a practice may result in artificial price differences between the partitioned national markets. Such partitioning and such an artificial price difference are irreconcilable with the fundamental aim of the treaty, which is completion of the internal market.&quot; The ruling could force the FAPL to look to sell its broadcast rights as a pan-European TV deal, most probably to Sky, although it could look to limit sales to some European markets. The Premier League will make more than \u00a31.6bn in the UK from its current three-year deal with BSkyB and has a separate deal in this country for live match coverage with ESPN, along with a highlights deal with the BBC for Match of the Day. The Premier League is believed to have made well in excess of \u00a31bn in TV deals outside the UK for rights covering 2010 to 2013, almost double the \u00a3625m made under the previous deal period, with the popularity of the top English division booming in territories including the Middle East, north Africa, Hong Kong and Singapore. No figures are given for Europe, but it is understood that France, Scandinavia and Germany are the most lucrative markets for Premier League rights. The Premier League said in a statement: &quot;The areas of law involved are complicated and necessarily we will take our time to digest and understand the full meaning of the judgment and how it might influence the future sale of Premier League audio-visual rights in the European Economic Area. &quot;We are pleased that the judgment makes it clear that the screening in a pub of football-match broadcasts containing protected works requires the Premier League&apos;s authorisation. Currently only Sky and ESPN are authorised by the Premier League to make such broadcasts. &quot;The Premier League will continue to sell its audio-visual rights in a way that best meets the needs of our fans across Europe and the broadcast markets that serve them but is also compatible with European Law.&quot; A BSkyB spokesman said: &quot;This is a case about the licensing arrangements of bodies like the Premier League. It will have implications for how rights are sold across Europe in future, which we are considering. As a broadcaster, it will remain our aim to secure high-quality content for our customers based on the rights available to us.&quot; The UK high court of justice will now make the final decision applying this ruling to the actual case of Karen Murphy, but the ECJ&apos;s decision is final and cannot be appealed against. Europe&apos;s commissioner for the digital agenda, Neelie Kroes, vowed to sort out confusion surrounding cross-border access to film, music and pay-per-view football games.

CWW is conducting an annual review of the book value of its acquisitions, the largest of which are Energis, sold to the company by its current chief executive, John Pluthero, for \u00a3670m in 2005, and Thus, acquired for \u00a3330m in 2008. They are currently valued at \u00a3800m, and Mark James, analyst at broker Liberum Capital, predicts the company will decide that they are worth between 20% and 30% less. For accounting purposes, a write-down of as much as \u00a3240m could force CWW to report a loss for the year, because pre-tax profits in 2010 were \u00a3143m and are unlikely to have risen this year. James said: &quot;This will be a reflection of the fact that management acknowledge the corporate-facing telecoms market remains tough. Earnings are falling and will continue to fall. I think we will see further downgrades for the full year.&quot; Since being demerged from its sister company Cable and Wireless Communications in March 2010, CWW has already issued three profit warnings. Liberum predicts a further warning, with results due on 15 November. At the last profit warning in June, Pluthero said that full-year earnings would be 5% to 10% below market expectations. The analyst consensus is that earnings will fall to \u00a3406m (on an Ebitda basis) for the full year to March 2012, nearly \u00a340m less than in the previous year. James pointed out that CWW&apos;s pension fund is in deficit, which means it cannot take advantage of \u00a3100m of its \u00a3300m unused debt facility. &quot;With the pensions review set to conclude next month it&apos;s a strong possibility the company may choose to fund the deficit in an effort to remove itself from these restrictions,&quot; he predicted. The company declined to comment. Pluthero stepped down from his role as chairman to replace Jim Marsh as chief executive this summer. The share price halved under Marsh&apos;s leadership, and CWW is now worth 70% less than at demerger. In 2006, prior to its demerger, Cable &amp; Wireless controversially introduced a private equity-style rewards scheme for senior executives, which paid out tens of millions over five years. The scheme has not been renewed this year, but in 2010 Pluthero collected a total package of \u00a32.8m, according to the annual report. He received \u00a3780,000 in salary, benefits in kind and cash in lieu of pension contributions, almost \u00a31.9m under the now wound-up long-term incentive plan, and was granted 218,000 shares at 83.32p each. Shares in CWW briefly rallied last month, on reports that the company could be a takeover target for SingTel of Singapore. They have dropped back since, closing 0.25% lower at 27.67p.

Speaking ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka and after comments by his father saying the driver&apos;s management team &quot;need to do more&quot;, Hamilton believes he is more than capable of coping alone without the help of a driver-manager in attendance. No members of his management team, Simon Fuller&apos;s XIX Entertainment, were present at the last race in Singapore where Hamilton tagged Felipe Massa, causing a puncture for which he received a drive-through penalty. Massa reacted angrily afterwards criticising Hamilton&apos;s driving and specifically the number of incidents in which he was involved after which Anthony Hamilton, who had been his son&apos;s manager until March this year, suggested he needed more personal management during race weekends. Hamilton, however, immediately dismissed the suggestion he would benefit from having someone to talk to when off the track. &quot;Rubbish. Never. I&apos;ve never needed someone to speak to in the evenings,&quot; he said. &quot;If I wanted to speak to anyone I would give my missus a call and speak to her. &quot;I just deal with it myself. If I have a bad day the last thing I want to do is come home and explain myself. I think I&apos;ve earned the right by where I am now to not have to explain myself to anyone.&quot; The driver did also reveal that it did not imply a lack of reflection on his own part. &quot;Of course you think about what happened. That&apos;s all you think about. It&apos;s all you ever think about. What if, what happened, if I&apos;d had done this at that turn there, all the situations, you think about it for days and days and days.&quot; An element of self-analysis the driver will be familiar with after a season peppered with visits to the marshals, penalties and race incidents. Despite Hamilton Sr&apos;s comments he remains a constant in the driver&apos;s career. &quot;At the end of the day I&apos;ve got people like my father I can pick up the phone and speak to if I want to speak to someone, he&apos;s there all the time, through the weekend, if I really want to [speak to him] he&apos;ll be there,&quot; he said. The management issue may not go away. Last week reports had suggested some drivers were intending to question the number of incidents involving Hamilton at the drivers&apos; briefing ahead of this weekend&apos;s race. Although Massa said in Suzuka that he will not be raising the matter and the Grand Prix Drivers&apos; Association chairman, Rubens Barrichello, has said he does not expect it to be discussed, it is potentially the kind of issue where a driver may find track-side support invaluable. Hamilton remains convinced that at the momentthe best call remains his call: &quot;It&apos;s my decision at race weekends. I don&apos;t actually want people at the races. A driver doesn&apos;t need to have people at the race. Sometimes it&apos;s good to have people there, sometimes it&apos;s not. At the moment I prefer to be alone.&quot; Asked if the tide would turn, Hamilton said: &quot;I don&apos;t have an answer for it. I don&apos;t see anybody else having the problems I&apos;m having, but then I don&apos;t see many people who have achieved what I&apos;ve achieved. Up until the end of 2008 I&apos;d won a championship every second year of my career since I was eight years old. &quot;I&apos;ve done pretty well up until now, but I&apos;ve had a couple of tough years, with this year the most trying, testing year of my career so far.

Suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have killed the most Afghan civilians according to the UN, with 1,141 losing their life as a result. In what the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan name the most &apos;alarming trend&apos; is the 462 civilians that were assassinated by anti-government elements - up a huge 105% from 2009.

Passersby peer into the windows of one shop and wonder at the gleaming surfaces, the flat screens, the drinks cabinet. Among the betting shops, money lenders and a Perfect Fried Chicken, the new Foxtons certainly cuts a dash. The latest branch of London&apos;s biggest, brashest estate agent threw open its doors last weekend with the aim of drumming up business just a stone&apos;s throw from the Olympic stadium. And it is not the only one: at least two other lettings agencies are setting up shop in the centre of this rapidly changing part of the capital. With less than 10 months before the Games start, and nearly one month after the opening of Westfield, the third largest shopping mall in the country, a part of east London that has been overlooked and underrated for decades is suddenly the place to be. &quot;It&apos;s all about Stratford,&quot; explained Kamran Younis of Century21 Cameron Adams. &quot;It&apos;s an international focal point. I can only predict good things about it, and being here, amidst all this activity, it&apos;s very exciting.&quot; Alex Leigh, sales manager of the new Foxtons, agrees. The Olympics, he said, had &quot;put the eye of the world&quot; on Stratford. &quot;It&apos;s brought attention to an area that perhaps wouldn&apos;t have had the same attention otherwise.&quot; Since London won the bid in 2005, talk of east London&apos;s Olympic property boom has proved both myth and reality. Even amid the worst recession since the 1930s, it was assumed that at least one corner of the country would be impregnable to house price doom. For some, this is true: parts of Hackney have recorded average rises of up to 56% between July 2005 and May 2011. But for other, less gentrified areas, it has been a different story; in Stratford the increase was 13%. Hopeful that the boom is just around the corner for the E15 postcode, Leigh and his estate agent colleagues see this as a golden opportunity to market the area aggressively as a &quot;value-for-money&quot; location and attract new \u2013 preferably young, professional \u2013 residents. &quot;Prices around here haven&apos;t taken off as they have in some areas,&quot; said Leigh. &quot;But we&apos;re yet to see what the Olympic legacy will leave behind; we&apos;re yet to see what effect Westfield will have.&quot; Younis was more direct: &quot;I think Stratford, the way it&apos;s poised, is only going to go up and up.&quot; With these kinds of predictions ringing in their ears, most Stratford property owners with no pressing need to move are standing firm, hopeful that their homes will rocket in value. Shop owner Aklakur Rahman, who has already watched his three-bedroom terraced house go up in value steadily over the past 16 years, wants to wait and see. &quot;I don&apos;t think this boom is going to be short-term,&quot; he said. Developers are erecting huge new blocks of flats and touting &quot;luxury living&quot; in a part of London better known more for poverty than penthouses. Some of these operate shared ownership schemes to make some flats more affordable, but even these are out of the reach of many locals. Among those for conventional sale, it is not uncommon for a two-bedroom flat to be valued at up to \u00a3350,000 \u2013 prices which one estate agent, who wanted to remain anonymous, said were &quot;quite extortionate&quot;. Investors, aware of the sky-high rents possible for the Olympics, are buying them anyway. The kind of people able to afford to live in the sleek new apartments are, increasingly, the young professionals on whose arrival Foxtons is counting. Carlos Aristizabal, a PhD student who moved into an apartment at the Lett Road development this week with his French sommelier wife, said they loved the area. &quot;There&apos;s a lot going on in Stratford because of the Olympics, because of the new mall they built, Westfield. [It&apos;s] a very, very good place to live,&quot; said the 30-year-old. Lett Road, said Mohsin Kothia of Filton&apos;s estate agents, is unusual among the new developments in that a hefty proportion of those living there own their flats. &quot;Where there&apos;s a high concentration of social housing in a block, actual owner-occupiers are a little bit reluctant,&quot; he said. &quot;People pay a premium to be able to live with people of a similar kind of financial status.&quot; Amid all this change, there are losers \u2013 people for whom the Olympics, the transport hub, even the bright lights of Westfield are cause for concern. As the search begins for what one estate agent described as &quot;a better brand of people&quot;, those already in E15 are fearful that soon there will be no place for them. Riyadh Chowdhury, who came to the UK from Bangladesh four years ago, has already had his rent increased by \u00a3100 to \u00a3800 per month, then, last year, to \u00a3900. The hikes have placed such a strain on his income that he had to invite his brother to stay with him, his wife and their two-year-old daughter in his two-bedroom flat. If his landlord does the same again next year, Chowdhury, a Morrison&apos;s employee, said: &quot;I&apos;m sure my salary will not increase by that much over the next two or three years.&quot; Suchin Yooyai, whose Pie Crust cafe is one of the last vestiges of the old Stratford, feels as if his community has been torn apart. Next door, a former newsagents is being turned into flats; all around him are apartment blocks. &quot;In the beginning I was very happy when they won the [Olympic] bid in Singapore. I was watching the television and ... my tears were coming down. But since they start building next door to me, then I realised. I wish the Olympics never come! I don&apos;t like to come home.&quot; Yooyai, who arrived in Stratford in 1984 and endeared himself to workers with his fry-ups and, later, curries, said his regular customers had gone, replaced by office workers. He was approached by developers, he said, but rejected their offer, believing they had undervalued the property. So, for the moment, he is staying \u2013 albeit reluctantly. &quot;In those days, you never thought Stratford would be like this. Then there were so many factories, garages. Now it&apos;s all gone, all gone.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/07/cut-wolfgang-puck-london-review", "sentences": ["Cut is Puck&apos;s fourth restaurant of that name, the others being in Las Vegas, Beverly Hills and Singapore, which gives you some idea: these places are targeted at the international rich."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-07T21:59:17Z", "title": "Restaurant: Cut, London W1 \u2013 review", "tags": ["London holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Travel", "Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "England holidays"], "article": "The Austrian-born Wolfgang Puck is probably the most famous chef in America. He was already a megastar the first time I\u00a0visited one of his restaurants, Chinois in Santa Monica, in 1993. At\u00a0that point, Puck was best known for having invented the postmodern pizza at his restaurant Spago; since advanced pizzas seem silly to me, I\u00a0was expecting Chinois to be silly, too. It wasn&apos;t: the tart&apos;s boudoir decor was hilariously OTT, but the food was a brilliant early example of fusion cooking. I remember a\u00a0grilled caramelised pineapple with foie gras (back in the days when I\u00a0still ate foie gras) that sounded daft but turned out to be revelatory. Now Puck has opened Cut, his first UK restaurant, part of an empire that has expanded to 20 &quot;fine dining&quot; restaurants and dozens of budget outlets. It&apos;s in a new hotel called 45 Park Lane, owned by the Dorchester group. The place might be going great guns already: it was hard to tell because I went during London fashion week and the place was heaving with unlovely men and elongated women, all air-kissing and calling each other dollink. Many were carrying goodie bags. Not for the first time, I\u00a0was left with the feeling that the richer parts of London are an entirely different country. Cut is Puck&apos;s fourth restaurant of that name, the others being in Las Vegas, Beverly Hills and Singapore, which gives you some idea: these places are targeted at the international rich. It is a steakhouse \u2013 in theory, an updated, modernised take on the genre, but in practice a fairly straight version, except with a less clubby, men-only feel to\u00a0the decor. That&apos;s a decent idea, except something&apos;s gone wrong in the execution and the narrow room gives you an overwhelmingly strong feeling of being in a corridor, or maybe an airport departure lounge \u2013 somewhere on the way to somewhere else. It adds to a slightly frantic atmosphere, as does the service \u2013 so super-eager that it interrupted our conversation 10 times before I stopped counting. The Man himself was in the restaurant, which may have made the team more hyper. The loud, very unchilled pop music didn&apos;t help. The menu is what you&apos;d expect: starters, salads, side dishes and sauces clustering around Cut&apos;s main focus, steak. We had two successful starters. A salad of veal tongue with white beans, artichokes and salsa verde was a light, balanced, unshowy dish, in contrast to the other starter, which was rich, risky and flashy, but also worked: a &quot;flan&quot; of bone marrow with mushroom marmalade and parsley salad. This was only just in balance, with the mushroom&apos;s savoury depth rescuing the marrow from oversweetness just in time. The marrow was served in its bones, so don&apos;t ask me why it was a &quot;flan&quot;. As for the steak, we tried a &quot;tasting&quot; plate of three little pieces of sirloin \u2013 American, British and Australian \u2013 at the Park Lane price of \u00a348. They were classic US steakhouse steaks: beautifully cooked, perfectly seasoned, ideally charred, unimprovable in texture. There&apos;s a word missing there. Do you spot it? Flavour. The meat had a little, but not nearly enough. The steakaholic friend with me expressed sombre disappointment and felt no need to finish them \u2013 quite a strong statement at that price. Slow-cooked Wagyu beef short ribs with pur\u00e9ed cauliflower and curry spicing, meanwhile, was sweet, satisfying, spoon-tender and so apocalyptically rich, I felt peculiar all night. (Maybe Wagyu beef, famous for its fatty marbling, is\u00a0wrong for also-fatty short ribs.) Pudding was a so-so fried doughnut. The wine list, like much else here, reminds you why Park Lane is so expensive in Monopoly. OK, it&apos;s a restaurant for rich people, but does there really have to be so insultingly small a range of choices below an already steep \u00a340? I suppose that&apos;s the whole point of Planet Rich: it&apos;s refreshingly free of people who fuss about what things cost. I overheard the restaurant manager tell one potential customer that you could have dinner &quot;from \u00a365 to \u00a370, but we&apos;re finding that the average spend is \u00a3120 a head&quot;. Look at it the way Mr Micawber would: by not going to\u00a0Cut, two of you can save \u00a3240."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/08/liam-fox-politics-sri-lanka", "sentences": ["During a chance meeting in Singapore in 2007, Fox \u2013 by then shadow secretary of state for defence \u2013 fell in with one of Rajapaksa&apos;s lieutenants, the foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-08T12:38:32Z", "title": "Liam Fox's role in the politics of Sri Lanka", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Sri Lanka", "Politics", "UK news", "World news", "War crimes", "Lobbying", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Liam Fox is a well-known figure in the corridors of power in Sri Lanka. For decades, a vicious civil war between the two main ethnic groups \u2013 Tamils and the Sinhalese majority \u2013 had meant daily life in the small island nation was punctuated by spasms of destruction. The fight was about territory: pitting the north and east against the south. It was also religious: Hindu Tamils against Buddhist Sinhalese. And by the time the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were routed in 2009, it had claimed almost 100,000 lives. Fox had first arrived in 1995, landing at the palm-fringed airport as a junior Foreign Office minister. A little more than a year later, such was his influence with the Sinhalese elite, who essentially run the country, that he had persuaded the rival parties not to attempt to outflank each other while negotiating peace or ceasefires with the brutal rebel separatists of the LTTE. The &quot;Fox agreement&quot; was a landmark, the first time an outsider had managed to broker such a consensus in a notoriously violent political setup. Fast forward more than a decade. The old Sinhalese powerbrokers had been ousted in favour of a more militaristic clique, led by the president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and his brothers Gotabhaya, the defence secretary, and Basil, a political fixer. During a chance meeting in Singapore in 2007, Fox \u2013 by then shadow secretary of state for defence \u2013 fell in with one of Rajapaksa&apos;s lieutenants, the foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama. He was back in the game. The Labour government, along with the United States, had viewed the new president as a dangerous populist whose military buildup and wooing of China needed to be restrained. Concerned that the Sri Lankan army was indiscriminately bombing and killing Tamil civilians, the west ratcheted up pressure on the regime. Fox, a neocon in outlook, took a rather different view. And his new friends turned to him for help. In the last few months of the war Fox, who was seen in the capital Colombo as a possible future Tory leader, became an influential messenger boy \u2013 carrying back rebuttals to western capitals from Sri Lanka. At the beginning of 2009, the then prime minister, Gordon Brown, attempted to send a special envoy to the island and the US offered to evacuate the 100,000 civilians trapped in the last 20 square miles of territory under LTTE control. The foreign minister told Fox, who happened to be on a visit to Colombo at the time, that the government was declining &quot;offers of assistance&quot; until it had &quot;cleared the north from the clutches of the terrorists&quot;. However, since the LTTE was crushed, the clamour for a war-crimes investigation has grown. While Rajapaksa remains apparently invincible at home, the net is tightening abroad. Channel 4&apos;s documentary Sri Lanka&apos;s Killing Fields appeared to show the shelling of areas where civilians sheltered, executions of captured LTTE combatants, and dead female Tamil fighters being loaded on to a truck. A United Nations panel found &quot;credible allegations&quot; that the government had committed war crimes and offences against humanity. There were calls for an independent international inquiry, and reports that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of civilians had lost their lives and that most casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling. The UK supplied arms to Sri Lanka throughout its bitter civil war \u2013 comfort for arms manufacturers but none for Sri Lankan taxpayers. Colombo has increased the defence budget by 6%."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/08/formula-one-sebastian-vettel-suzuka", "sentences": ["Dominant victories, such as in Turkey and Singapore are one thing, but he was pushed to the end in an unusually exciting Spanish Grand Prix by Hamilton."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-08T13:58:06Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel drives himself to new highs on road to F1 title", "tags": ["Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Sebastian Vettel did exactly what was required of him in qualifying here, claiming pole for the 12th time this season and in doing so has put himself in the best possible position to secure the single point he requires to become the youngest double world champion. By this morning he will likely have claimed the title with four races to go, a peerless performance that says much about how far he has come since taking his first championship at last year&apos;s final race in Abu Dhabi. The lap on Saturday, which pushed Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton into second and third respectively, is immediately instructive of why the Vettel of this year has been so much more dominant than last. Suzuka is a high-speed and technically difficult track that is hugely rewarding when driven to perfection but intolerant of error. Vettel went to the edge of every line. Hitting the exit of Spoon corner, he took the right-rear to the lip of the grass: any further and the grip would have disappeared. But it was held and carried the extra speed, hurtling up the hill into 130R. This was technical perfection, combined with confidence, touch and, of course, a great car. Not that simply ascribing his complete dominance to the Red Bull, as often happens, is strictly fair. He had a very good car under him last year as well, yet there was no string of poles or podium finishes and, but for Ferrari&apos;s tactical error in that final race, he might not have been world champion at all. The competition was stronger, certainly, with McLaren quicker out of the box and Ferrari coming good in the second half of the season. The German suffered from bad luck \u2013 a puncture at Silverstone and an engine-failure in Korea (to which his upbeat response to the team is also instructive). But then there was the Vettel who clashed with Mark Webber in Turkey, who fell too far behind the safety car in Hungary and was given a drive-through. The same driver who badly mistimed his braking at the Bus Stop at Spa and put Button, then the world champion, out of the race and earned himself another drive-through. This year the story has been different however, as Button acknowledged on Saturday: &quot;He&apos;s really proven himself this year,&quot; the McLaren driver said. &quot;Last year he had some great drives but he was, I would say, pretty inconsistent and had more incidents than I expected him to have, considering he won the world championship.&quot; The car was a factor, said Button, but he is also prepared to admit it was not the whole story: &quot;This year he&apos;s been exceptional; he&apos;s done a great job. He&apos;s obviously driving a great car, you don&apos;t win a championship without a great car, but he&apos;s doing what&apos;s asked of him from the team.&quot; The British world champion, who has competed in 205 Formula 1 races, is well-placed to identify what has made Vettel a different proposition this season. &quot;He seems a lot calmer,&quot; he said. &quot;My memory goes back to Spa last year where we had our little incident but since then he&apos;s been driving very well. To finish every race on the podium except for one is very impressive.&quot; Inconsistent to exceptional seems to accurately define the shift Vettel has made. Again, that he has rarely been challenged from his position at the front of the grid and race is too simplistic a dismissal. Dominant victories, such as in Turkey and Singapore are one thing, but he was pushed to the end in an unusually exciting Spanish Grand Prix by Hamilton. While a red flag robbed fans of a great finish to Monaco, his win was fully deserved, having made the best of being fitted with the wrong tyres. There have been errors \u2013 a spin in Germany \u2013 and issues \u2013 he could match neither Button nor Hamilton in the wet at Hungary \u2013 but outside these he has barely put a foot wrong. Then there is Canada, the chink, the weak point and one of the moments of the season. Finally put under pressure by Button he buckled, went wide on the final lap and handed the win to the British driver. It showed a potential weakness the German must eliminate if he is to become as dominant as his hero, Michael Schumacher. Yet it was but a single incident and if criticism is to be levelled, it must be balanced with one of the other moments of the season. Vettel, with a huge lead in points, put two wheels on the grass to skin Fernado Alonso round the outside of the Curva Grande at Monza. No DRS, no need to try the move, no fear and now no real reason to keep asking questions about his ability to overtake. That racing fans want to see him tested in the white heat of wheel-to-wheel racing is obvious and it has to be hoped next season his competitors bring that challenge to the track. Vettel once said in a documentary: &quot;When I was a little boy I tried out lots of things, football, tennis, beach volleyball. But I wasn&apos;t the best, so I stopped.&quot; This season, almost certainly his second as world champion, has proved that for now he is the best. Far more so than the first."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/oct/08/jon-huntsman-candidate-china", "sentences": ["He has lived and worked in Asia several times; first as a missionary in Taiwan, as ambassador to Singapore, and most recently, as America&apos;s ambassador to China."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-08T22:11:01Z", "title": "Jon Huntsman, the candidate who knows how to talk to China | Yang Jianli", "tags": ["Jon Huntsman", "US elections 2012", "Republican presidential nomination 2012", "Republicans", "China", "Human rights", "US economy", "United Nations", "North Korea", "US politics", "US foreign policy", "US national security", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "I wouldn&apos;t be exaggerating if I said that the most important issue in the 2012 presidential election is not in America but half a world away \u2013 in China. American voters would be remiss if they don&apos;t look to the far east when thinking about whom they will support in the upcoming presidential campaign. That is why I&apos;m supporting Governor Jon Huntsman for president. For those concerned about the economy, China is one of the America&apos;s largest trading partners and also owns a large portion of its national debt. With every passing year, the Chinese use more and more of the world&apos;s limited supply of energy, which in turn drives prices up here at home. For those concerned about national security, China holds the key to disassembling the North Korean nuclear program and imposing further sanction on Iran for its attempts to build the bomb. It shares a border with Afghanistan, where US armed forces continue to fight. The Chinese also have one of five seats on the United Nations security council; so important for any multilateral action. For those concerned about the prospects of climate change, China is one of the largest and fastest growing emitters of carbon dioxide \u2013 among many other harmful chemicals \u2013 into the air. Any comprehensive solution to this problem here in America will also require full cooperation from their government and industry. And for those concerned about the basic issue of increasing global freedom and human rights, China is one of the worst offenders. China&apos;s massive state-run oil company is, in many ways, responsible for the horrifying human rights violations in Sudan and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 as well as the UN&apos;s sluggish response. The communist regime has more prisoners of conscience than any other nation. Despite the Chinese constitution&apos;s guarantee of religious freedom, Catholic bishops, people who start churches in their homes, and monks in Tibet are incarcerated with nothing more than show trials. Despite having a fundamental right to some due process before their property is expropriated, farmers are told to give up their homes or go to prison. Despite claims of a free press from the state-run media, journalists and bloggers who aren&apos;t afraid to write and publish stories unfavorable to the government end up &quot;re-educated&quot; by force. And despite basic rights to free speech and to petition the government, academics who use the &quot;D word&quot; \u2013 democracy \u2013 are maimed, tortured and sometimes even killed. I should know. I grew up in China, attended a top university there, and came to the US to pursue degrees at some of America&apos;s best universities. I witnessed \u2013 some say, survived \u2013 the massacre in Tiananmen Square. When I visited in 2002 to help the growing labor movement in northern China, I was arrested and sentenced to time in prison for &quot;spying&quot;. I served five years \u2013 and I owe my release to the outpouring of public support and the strong and tireless efforts of American officials who believed that the freedoms we take for granted here are both fundamental and universal. The next president will have to manage America&apos;s relationship with China through a period of global tumult. And the success \u2013 or failure \u2013 of this country relies on managing that relationship as effectively as possible. In the presidential field, there is only one candidate who has demonstrated the kind of leadership experience we need in the White House: Governor Jon Huntsman.  He has lived and worked in Asia several times; first as a missionary in Taiwan, as ambassador to Singapore, and most recently, as America&apos;s ambassador to China. He has sat across the negotiating table from Chinese counterparts: as a deputy trade representative, as an executive at Huntsman Chemical, and as a hard-charging governor determined to push job-creating trade deals for Utah. He has long been a student of Chinese language, society, culture and politics; speaking pitch-perfect Mandarin and Hokkien. All of these factors give him an expertise that is sorely lacking at the US government&apos;s highest levels. While others would start from scratch, Jon Huntsman already commands the respect of the Chinese authorities and the adoration of the Chinese people. Recently, I had the chance to join a call between Governor Huntsman and members of the Asian American community. He has a depth of knowledge and an understanding of the issues \u2013 both large and small \u2013 that I have never seen in any of the many politicians I have met. For the many Americans who see economic stagnation as untenable, the on-again, off-again negotiations with North Korea as unreliable at best, the problem of global emissions as unsustainable, and the lack of basic human rights in many parts of the world as unacceptable; there is a candidate for you. Jon Huntsman is a man who knows how to solve problems and knows how to engage China. The best indicator of a candidate&apos;s ability to get results is their record of results in the past. If there&apos;s anyone who has that record of accomplishment and can get results on these issues of great importance to US national security, it&apos;s Governor Jon Huntsman."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/08/emails-video-footage-liam-fox", "sentences": ["The Observer understands that Fox is also under scrutiny over other official visits abroad, including the annual trip to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-08T22:46:00Z", "title": "Emails and video footage pile pressure on beleaguered Liam Fox", "tags": ["Liam Fox", "Ministry of Defence", "Politics", "UK news", "Sri Lanka", "Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Lobbying", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "     Defence secretary Liam Fox&apos;s future hangs in the balance as the Observer reveals film and email evidence that appears to contradict prior claims about his friend Adam Werritty&apos;s involvement in meetings with overseas dignitaries and businessmen. The film shows that Fox&apos;s former flatmate, who was also best man at his wedding, met the president of Sri Lanka with Fox for a meeting in a London hotel last year, despite having no role in government. The defence secretary has strenuously denied that 34-year-old Werritty had been present at any official meetings with foreign dignitaries overseas and his department refused to comment on Saturday when questioned about this meeting. However, the video and photographs obtained by this newspaper appear to show Werritty shaking hands with President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Fox&apos;s troubles deepened further on Saturday when the defence secretary said that a meeting in Dubai in June this year with a businessman, also attended by Werritty, only happened as a result of a chance meeting there in a restaurant. Emails between Werritty and the businessman, Harvey Boulter, obtained by the Guardian in August, appear to contradict Fox&apos;s account. They appear to indicate that Fox&apos;s friend had been trying to fix up such a meeting since April. Boulter said: &quot;The fact that a meeting was going to happen was prearranged in April. A meeting with the Ministry of Defence doesn&apos;t happen by chance.&quot; The two sets of revelations came as Downing Street stepped into a row that was threatening to spiral out of control. No 10 ordered the initial findings of an MoD inquiry into Werritty&apos;s role as a self-styled adviser to Fox to be presented to David Cameron on Monday. The inquiry had been due to last another two weeks. Amid signs that support for Fox was ebbing away, No 10&apos;s line was that it was still supportive of him. But the fact that it effectively ordered the inquiry to be speeded up shows its desperation to draw a line under the episode. One source at the heart of government said: &quot;The prime minister is remaining supportive of Liam while the facts are established but we will see what happens on Monday.&quot; Sri Lankan TV news footage and press photographs appear to show that Werritty was part of Fox&apos;s delegation at the meeting with Rajapaksa, who has been accused of war crimes during the country&apos;s civil war. The footage apparently shows Werritty shaking hands and bowing to Rajapaksa. Werritty is present as Fox discusses investment in the country, and plans to integrate Tamil political parties willing to participate within the government, according to Sri Lankan TV footage. The footage was handed to the Observer by Italian blogger Nomfup. Three separate sources have seen the footage and confirmed that they believe Werritty appears in the footage. News of the meeting at the Dorchester hotel in early December will raise fresh concerns about whether Fox has misled MPs and the public about Werritty&apos;s role at the heart of government. The storm engulfing Fox has grown since the Guardian first revealed in August the extent of Werritty&apos;s closeness to Fox, and that he had described himself as an adviser to the secretary of state on business cards, although he is not a government employee. Fox will come under intense pressure when he appears at defence questions in the Commons on Monday. On Saturday night the shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, demanded that Fox make a statement to the House. &quot;This is a self-inflicted political crisis and it seems to run and run with fresh allegations every day,&quot; Murphy said. Sources have also told this newspaper that the government investigation into Werritty&apos;s role will examine every overseas trip Fox has taken, both as secretary of state and before as the shadow minister, to discover if he was accompanied by Werritty and if he met foreign leaders. The MoD said the Sri Lanka meeting was a &quot;private engagement&quot;. The Observer understands that Fox is also under scrutiny over other official visits abroad, including the annual trip to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Singapore. He gave a speech at the IISS in early June, and it is believed he met Werritty during the short stay. Whitehall sources said that the MoD appears to be &quot;99% sure&quot; it has never paid for any of Werritty&apos;s flights or accommodation, but officials are trying to establish if there was any potential blurring of the lines that may have compromised Fox&apos;s position. Fox&apos;s friendship with Werritty is also likely to trigger questions over his involvement in a company called UK Health Group. Records reveal that in 2007 Fox owned shares in the company, as did Werritty. But there is no mention of this shareholding in Fox&apos;s register of members&apos; interests, an apparent breach of parliament&apos;s strict rules. The Guardian has revealed Werritty: \u2022 Involved Fox in discussions with Boulter that have left Fox facing the prospect of being called to give evidence in a &quot;blackmail&quot; trial in the US. \u2022 Was present at a discussion about the possibility of providing British security-sensitive technology to Libyan rebels. \u2022 Has visited Fox at the MoD&apos;s Whitehall offices 14 times in a little over a year and hands out business cards that say he is &quot;an adviser to the Rt Hon Dr Fox MP&quot;. \u2022 Ran a controversial charity from inside Fox&apos;s office in the houses of parliament. \u2022 Collected \u00a390,000 in salary from the Atlantic Bridge charity, which is linked to major US business lobby groups. \u2022 Has previously been present when Fox met Rajapaksa and other senior Sri Lanka ministers. \u2022 Was an investor in the same health consultancy company as Fox. The December meeting at the Dorchester hotel took place when Fox had been defence secretary for six months. After the Guardian revealed that Werritty brokered a crucial legal meeting in Dubai, a spokesman for Fox said: &quot;Mr Werritty is not an employee and has, therefore, not travelled with me on any official overseas visits.&quot; The MoD refused to comment on the meeting. Werritty did not respond to requests for comment. Speaking about the Dubai meeting during a visit to Libya on Saturday which has been overshadowed by the controversy over his links to Werritty, Fox said he had been on his &quot;way home&quot; from Afghanistan and made the stopover to switch to a civilian aircraft."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/09/new-zealand-oil-spill-rena", "sentences": ["Australia&apos;s ABC network said a team of 200 people including specialists from Australia, the UK, the Netherlands and Singapore had been despatched, and that 300 defence personnel were on standby in case the slick reached the North Island coastline."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-09T06:09:00Z", "title": "New Zealand oil spill: grounded ship threatens environmental disaster", "tags": ["Oil spills", "New Zealand", "World news", "Environment", "Birds", "Oil", "Pollution", "Marine life", "Wildlife", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "A container ship is grounded and leaking oil into New Zealand&apos;s pristine Bay of Plenty, with international crews scrambling to limit the environmental damage and refloat the vessel before it breaks up.

It would take place, many thought, after the previous race in Singapore. It seemed as predictable as the intensity of the humidity which held Marina Bay in its clammy grip, making speedy strategists of everyone as they flitted from one air\u2011conditioned unit to another to avoid the outside, shirt-drenching world. But it was held over for another race. For some, the comfort of Vettel&apos;s triumph \u2013 fully expected since May \u2013 has detracted from another season of compelling racing. But good drama is not necessarily ruined by a familiarity with its plotlines, as producers of Shakespeare would happily confirm. Vettel&apos;s second success should be applauded, no less for its inevitability. He won this time because he stopped making mistakes. A disciple of Jackie Stewart&apos;s dictum \u2013 &quot;if you want to finish in the points you must finish&quot; \u2013 Vettel is the only driver to complete all 15 races this season. Last season he was a sometimes callow 23-year-old; this year he has appeared a 24-year-old veteran. Not that there has been much skirmishing. If the one question mark persists about Vettel \u2013 can he carve his way through the field? \u2013 he can hardly be blamed for that. Like an early-rising commuter, he has set off early to avoid the traffic. He has been a Saturday sensation, taking 12 pole positions, and winning from the front is always the best way to go. Red Bull, meanwhile, like their star employee, have cut out the unforced errors and have been the most polished team in the paddock. Vettel is the youngest double champion, beating Fernando Alonso (2005 and 2006) by a year. He is the 15th driver to have won two championships or more and the ninth to have won back-to-back titles; the dominance has been such that now other records look sharp on the horizon \u2013 Juan-Manuel Fangio&apos;s five, Michael Schumacher&apos;s seven. He won five of the opening six races (he was second in the other) to take a stranglehold on the season before the other teams had even started to narrow the gap, and though Red Bull&apos;s advantage was reduced subsequently, that did not stop the German from winning. He started his sequence of nine chequered flags this season in the first race in Australia, which was a stroll in Albert Park as he won by 22 seconds from Lewis Hamilton. &quot;We have to keep our feet on the\u00a0floor,&quot; he said afterwards. &quot;I don&apos;t like\u00a0the word dominate. There is a long way\u00a0to go. It will be very close with McLaren and Mercedes.&quot; Who did he think he was kidding? Two weeks later, in a much more eventful race, he was champion of Malaysia, making it two wins out of two, or five out of six, dating back to the previous season. He had pipped Hamilton by just a 10th of a second in qualifying the previous day. The British driver hobbled home in eighth place after a collision with Alonso and a 20-second penalty. It was a rough summation of how the season would go for both drivers. In China there was a first failure, if second place can be counted as such. Hamilton romped to a false-dawn victory and Vettel, not put off by the fact that Jenson Button trespassed on his Red Bull pit place at one stage, took 18 points. But for once Red Bull had been outwitted by McLaren in a tactically frenetic race. Vettel reasserted his dominance when they moved on to Istanbul. He looked so strong, in fact, that his team principal, Christian Horner, was asked if he had any weakness at all. &quot;Yes,&quot; came the reply. &quot;When he turned up this weekend he had quite a dodgy haircut.&quot; Vettel&apos;s only disappointment in Turkey was that because local laws prohibited drinking under the age of 24 he was unable to guzzle any of the podium champagne. He had not only won the race but had done so with a swagger that must have unsettled every other driver in the paddock. At Barcelona, Vettel showed us something else. He won again but this time it was not from pole and he also had to resist a thrilling and committed challenge from Hamilton, who reduced the German&apos;s lead to half a second in the closing laps. Vettel was required to show something more than pure speed to win the race. By the time he stretched his lead to 58 points with another victory in Monaco, he already looked unbeatable in the championship, though he had some good fortune, after the deployment of the safety car ruined what was building up to be a thrilling race. Canada is best remembered for Button&apos;s brilliant drive, when the McLaren driver proved Vettel was not impervious to pressure. Halfway through the final lap, with his rear-view full of Button, Vettel spun his car and had to be content with second. Any thought that Button&apos;s victory might reinvigorate the championship race, however, disappeared at Valencia, where Vettel was first in qualifying and then enjoyed a coasting victory the day after, with both Alonso and Hamilton appearing to concede defeat in the championship with Vettel 77 points ahead by the end of June. At Silverstone he was\u00a0second, pushed for once by his team\u2011mate Mark Webber, though it was Alonso who triumphed.

Asked whether he had been suffering from tyre problems, the McLaren driver answered: &quot;No, just not fast enough.&quot; Nor, he admitted, was it a question of his focus or concentration. &quot;I don&apos;t think I need to do any refocusing,&quot; he said. &quot;I drove as hard as I could. It wasn&apos;t because I wasn&apos;t thinking during the race. I don&apos;t know what the answer is. I just wasn&apos;t quick enough. I was quick in qualifying. I just wasn&apos;t quick in the race.&quot; Massa and Hamilton had already been involved in accidents this season at Monaco and Singapore and they came together again at the entrance to the chicane here, with Massa later accusing the British driver of moving into him. &quot;They have penalised people for much less this year and this time they didn&apos;t do it,&quot; he said. &quot;The FIA needs to take care of that. They are the only ones who can take care of that.&quot; In fairness to Hamilton, Massa was attempting to pass around the outside on the entrance to the chicane, an unusual overtaking spot at best, and the British driver was on his racing line. As Massa turned in to try to make the corner, his sidepod struck Hamilton&apos;s left rear tyre. Hamilton said afterwards that he did not know the Brazilian was next to him: &quot;I can&apos;t see anything out of my mirrors and they vibrate down the straight so much that I had no idea he was there,&quot; he explained. The stewards assessed that Hamilton had kept to his line and classified it as a racing incident at the time and Hamilton has since stressed it was not deliberate: &quot;I honestly didn&apos;t see him on the outside,&quot; he said. &quot;So it was unintentional but very close.&quot; While attention has focused on the manoeuvre simply because it involved Hamilton and Massa, the British driver can dismiss it as a racing incident and move on. What will be of more concern to him, however, is that he finds himself battling Massa, who has had a poor season, rather than his real rivals \u2013 Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso and the newly crowned world champion Sebastian Vettel, at the head of the field. His team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, believes the driver will still come back strongly in Korea next week. &quot;You look at any top international athlete. Their confidence and form ebbs and flows a little bit, and you have to say that, at the moment, some of it is luck,&quot; he said. &quot;He is in a situation where he will, and can, recover very, very quickly from that.&quot; Taking his third win this season in Japan, meanwhile, a buoyant Button is confident that he and his team-mate finally have the car under them to challenge for more wins, this year and next: &quot;There&apos;s still more that we can achieve this year,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d love to go out and fight to win the next few races, and I think we have the car and the team to go and do that. We&apos;ll keep pushing and hope to get some more wins this year, but we&apos;re also in a very good place right now \u2013 and I think that&apos;s key to success in 2012.&quot; Vettel confirmed that the team were satisfied with him taking third place during the race. &quot;I got a radio call that the priority was to finish the race,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;Obviously, it was a fantastic day for us. When we crossed the line it was certainly a big relief.&quot; A day finished off, rightly, with some celebrations \u2013 Vettel spent Sunday night at an Irish bar singing karaoke with his team-mates. &quot;We had a little bit of a celebration last night,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But not too much because this week we go to Korea.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/10/spot-fixing-agent-pakistan-matches-years", "sentences": ["The journalist explained that one of his fellow consortium members was a &quot;guy from Singapore&quot; who had &quot;no interest&quot; in cricket but wanted &quot;two or three [players] up for the other side, the betting side&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-10T14:43:29Z", "title": "'Spot-fixing' agent had been working on Pakistan matches for years", "tags": ["Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal", "Pakistan cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Mazhar Majeed, the player agent at the centre of the cricket &quot;spot-fixing&quot; trial, claimed in undercover recordings played to the court on Monday that he had been arranging fixed events at Pakistan&apos;s cricket matches for years. &quot;These guys wouldn&apos;t deal with anyone,&quot; said Majeed. &quot;The only reason they deal with me is because they know my background. I&apos;ve been dealing with them, the Pakistan team, for about two and a half years and we&apos;ve made massive amounts of money. I deal with an Indian party and they pay me.&quot; Majeed, who has been charged with cheating at gambling and accepting corrupt payments, is not currently in the dock, but his conversations with an undercover journalist are being used in evidence in the trial of Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif. The pair have been charged with the same offences, and deny any wrongdoing. The journalist Mazhar Mahmood, then of the News of the World, was posing as an Indian businessman working for a private equity firm that intended to set up a cricket tournament in the Middle East involving Pakistan players. The journalist explained that one of his fellow consortium members was a &quot;guy from Singapore&quot; who had &quot;no interest&quot; in cricket but wanted &quot;two or three [players] up for the other side, the betting side&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s more than two or three,&quot; said Majeed. &quot;It&apos;s already set, it&apos;s already there.&quot; Majeed claimed that fixing was a &quot;centuries&quot; old practice and raised the names of Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram as two who had previously been involved. Majeed explained the &quot;brackets&quot; system, whereby for betting purposes a match is divided into sections in which events can be analysed and bet upon. He said that Asif would signal the opening of a prearranged segment by bowling a dead ball. &quot;Asif will indicate by bowling a dead ball in that over and then we know the market opens at 10 overs,&quot; Majeed said. &quot;Let&apos;s say it&apos;s 33 runs [that the market anticipates will be scored during the 10-over &apos;bracket&apos;]. At the sixth over, when he does a dead ball, they know that the eighth, ninth and 10th overs are going to go for more runs. Because they&apos;ve kept the score down at the start but in the last three overs they let it all go and you make a killing. That&apos;s brackets.&quot; However, Majeed said that this manipulation of events did not at that time extend to fixing results. &quot;For brackets we charge anything from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000,&quot; said Majeed. &quot;For results, Twenty20 is about \u00a3400,000. A Test match, depending on the duration, is \u00a31m. We won&apos;t be doing any results for a few games because we want Butt to be captain long term. No\u2011balls are not a problem because you can&apos;t make much money from that.&quot; The alleged conversation took place at a meeting at Bombay Brasserie in London on 18\u00a0August last year where Majeed had been pleading his players&apos; poverty. &quot;How much Pakistan players are being paid is a joke,&quot; he said, stressing that their attendance at the proposed tournament could be bought &quot;very cheaply; as long as they have the opportunity to make money \u2013 match-winnings as well&quot;. &quot;You&apos;ll get them,&quot; he said. &quot;\u00a350,000 they get paid the whole season, \u00a360,000, \u00a3100,000 sometimes. They&apos;re broke. All the players, they are very, very loyal with us.&quot; Majeed also claimed he had previously worked for Arsenal. &quot;My background is football,&quot; Majeed claimed. &quot;I have set up academies all around the world. I&apos;ve worked for Arsenal Football Club. I&apos;ve done this sort of thing all the time. I&apos;ve done it for Arsenal.&quot; This was one of a series of boasts from Majeed, in which he claimed to have close relationships with celebrities and former sportsmen including Brad Pitt, Phil Tufnell and Geoffrey Boycott.

When her cancer was diagnosed in 2009, she was equal opportunities co-ordinator at University College London. Fiona was the first holder of this new post, to which she brought dynamism and dedication, raising the profile of diversity issues over eight years. She regarded the establishment of a network of equal opportunities liaison officers as her greatest professional achievement. Her mantra to colleagues was: &quot;It&apos;s our job to change things, not to make ourselves popular.&quot; An only child of Scottish descent, she inherited from her father, Duncan, the courage to take on a just fight and from her mother, Ermina, an amateur painter, an artistic eye. Born into an army family, Fiona spent her early years in south-east Asia, went to school in Singapore and later was a boarder at Talbot Heath school in Bournemouth. A degree in philosophy and English at Edinburgh University was followed by photography at Napier College (now Edinburgh Napier University). Her friend Marion remembers &quot;this blonde bombshell in a sheepskin jerkin and low-slung camera turning up at an Edinburgh Women&apos;s Aid wanting to photograph battered women&quot;. Advised that this was not how refuges operated, Fiona became a volunteer, then joined the staff (1977-80). Coming to London in 1980, she moved into the St Agnes Place squat in Kennington. Living in otherwise wasted accommodation impassioned her work in the empty properties unit at the Greater London council. Later, she was a team manager in the women&apos;s committee support unit at the height of media frenzy about &quot;Red Ken&quot; Livingstone. After the abolition of the GLC in 1986, she worked at the London strategic policy unit, and other councils in the capital, developing and managing equality and diversity strategies. She was restless by nature, and travelling gave meaning and shape to her life. She ventured widely and fearlessly, often on her own, to wild and remote places, with local guides or a single companion, in luxury or camping in the desert. Shortly before her death she compiled Travelogues, a bound collection of her photographs and texts, which she distributed to friends. Fiona loved bluebell woods, gardened passionately, collected beautiful and extraordinary artefacts from foreign lands, galleries and boot fairs, and supported young artists.

The 33-year-old has not been seen or spoken publicly since the story erupted, steering clear of the spotlight as his best friend has taken all the flak. Yet Werritty&apos;s business dealings are now at the core of this affair \u2013 put centre-stage by Fox himself in his statement on Sunday, in which he accepted that Werritty has &quot;defence-related business interests&quot;, but insisted that neither he or the Ministry of Defence had ever &quot;assisted with his commercial work&quot;. During his statement to the House of Commons, Fox emphasised that Werritty had a &quot;very wide range of international relations and political links&quot; that were quite separate from and not reliant upon the MoD. In answer to a question, Fox embellished the point with peculiar language: &quot;I am confident that [Werritty] was not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income.&quot; But if Werritty hasn&apos;t profited from his friendship with Fox, which has included 40 meetings in the UK and abroad in the last 16 months, how has he made his living? Labour believes that has become a legitimate question, particularly as Werritty has led a globetrotting existence over the last two years. It has become the new focus of attack for the party, with shadow ministers demanding transparency about Werritty&apos;s arrangements as the only way of proving what Fox has claimed as fact. &quot;This was a man who was provided with regular access to Fox both in the UK and abroad, yet we have no idea whether they met alone, or with other people. We need to know the nature of these meetings,&quot; said one Labour source. Certainly, the fragments that have come out about Werritty&apos;s life over the past few days suggest someone who would need a healthy income, or at least connections to those who have one. In the most startling revelation of Monday&apos;s statement, Fox admitted he had met Werritty abroad on 18 occasions since May last year. This included conferences where they were both delegates, ministerial visits where they met as friends, and family holidays including a ski trip. In the past 12 months, it is known Werritty flew to Sri Lanka and Dubai (twice). At least one of those flights was first class. He has also travelled to Singapore and Bahrain, where he is understood to have joined the defence secretary, who was on official business. None of the flights were paid for by the Ministry of Defence, which is also &quot;99% sure&quot; taxpayers have never paid for his hotel rooms or living expenses. In Sri Lanka, Werritty has stayed at the smart Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo; Iran was another destination for him in the months before the general election. Without knowing details of who paid for these trips, or if Werritty and Fox met others during the time they spent together, Ursula Brennan, the MoD civil servant jointly overseeing the investigation, will find it hard to rule conclusively whether the defence secretary has breached the ministerial code or support his contention that there has been no &quot;wrongdoing&quot;. In her interim report, she said she had commissioned a &quot;trawl for the email and electronic evidence&quot; at the MoD on all 18 trips, &quot;including details of who else was present \u2026 and who attended which formal and informal events&quot;. Werritty lives in a flat in Pimlico, is understood to be a member of the Carlton Club (annual fees of up to more than \u00a31,000), and has been a regular in the Royal Oak pub near the Commons, where he and Fox have become familiar faces over the years. He does not come from a wealthy family; his father is a lecturer, who lives in St Andrews, Fife, where Werritty grew up. Having graduated from Edinburgh University with a second class honours degree in social policy, he moved to London, where he relied on Fox to get a foothold in the capital. Fox has admitted allowing him to stay in the spare room at his flat near London Bridge in 2002, and has stated that he neither requested or received any rent. The Daily Telegraph revealed on Monday that Werritty became Fox&apos;s parliamentary researcher in 2004, and Fox confirmed he was paid \u00a35,800 for his work. Thereafter, Werritty appears to have been involved in a series of ventures, none of which look likely to have made him a fortune. But it is striking how his career has dovetailed with Fox&apos;s. During his early years in London, Werritty was involved in three different health companies. He joined UK Health as a consultant \u2013 at the time, Fox was shadow health secretary. Two years later, he became director of UK Health Group Ltd, in which he and Fox were shareholders. Then he became a director of UK Health Supply Services, which has been dissolved. Another company which ran into the sand was Security Futures, a firm set up in 2005, the year Fox became shadow defence secretary. It boasted that it promoted &quot;a better understanding of asymmetric &apos;security&apos; risks that the UK faces&quot;. Not well enough, it appears, to prevent it from being dissolved. Werritty did earn a salary from Atlantic Bridge, the charity set up by Fox in 1997. Werritty became its executive director and official records show he was paid a total of \u00a390,000 between 2007 and 2010. While in London, Werritty ran the charity from room 341 in the MPs&apos; block at Portcullis House, which was provided to Fox at taxpayers&apos; expense while he was in opposition. Werritty worked for Atlantic Bridge until last year when the regulator demanded that its &quot;current activities must cease immediately&quot; because &quot;the activities of the charity have not furthered any of its other charitable purposes in any way&quot;. The charity was finally dissolved earlier this month after its remaining trustees \u2013 Fox had quit when he went into government last year \u2013 decided to close it downrather than address the Charity Commission&apos;s concerns. Werritty&apos;s name has cropped up at Companies House with two other firms; Danscotia Consulting and Todhia Ltd. But it is unclear what either of them do. Yesterday, it emerged that the businessman Harvey Boulter was paying the London lobbying firm Tetra Strategy thousands of pounds a month for help to secure contacts in defence. But it did not pay Werritty, who set up the meeting between Fox and Boulter in Dubai that has been the focus of the crisis engulfing the defence secretary. Brennan said she will now &quot;in the next phase of the investigation ... seek to confirm the dates and times of the known visits and whether there were any other visits where others were present apart from Dr Fox and Mr Werritty.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/10/liam-fox-met-adam-werritty-around-world", "sentences": ["There had been speculation about meetings in Singapore too.", "Foreign meetings The 33-year-old was in Singapore in June last year when Fox was giving a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-10T20:43:35Z", "title": "Not just Dubai: Liam Fox met Adam Werritty 18 times around the world", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "Adam Werritty", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "article": "Before Monday, Liam Fox had only admitted to meeting Adam Werritty on trips to Sri Lanka and Dubai earlier this year, and then only after much media scrutiny. There had been speculation about meetings in Singapore too. But in the Commons, the defence secretary told MPs that he and Werritty had met abroad on 18 occasions in the last 16 months, and promised that the details would be published after he had finished his statement. The full list emerged after 7pm and gave remarkable details about how Werritty has tracked Fox across the globe as Fox has conducted official business. Foreign meetings The 33-year-old was in Singapore in June last year when Fox was giving a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He met him in Abu Dhabi and Dubai days later. The following month they met at the US Central Command base in Tampa, Florida, for an &quot;informal dinner&quot; at a steakhouse with General John Allen, who replaced General David Petraeus as head of Nato forces in Afghanistan earlier this summer. Further meetings followed in Bahrain in December last year, in Hong Kong in January this year, and in Israel in February. Fox and Werritty went on a skiing trip together that month in Switzerland. In March, they met in Dubai, and in April he was on holiday with Fox and his wife in Abu Dhabi. In May, they were in Washington together, and shared a flight home to the UK on a private jet, listed as a trip &quot;on party donor&apos;s aircraft to attend the President Obama state visit&quot;. Later that month they met in Washington and Hong Kong, and they were back in Washington again in July. The list shows that Werritty also accompanied Fox and his family during a two-week holiday in Spain in August. Fox asserts that the meetings with Werritty were all private, social functions, and had nothing to do with the business he was undertaking as secretary of state. And he insists Werritty has not financially benefited from these meetings, or his friendship, either. Nonetheless, the MoD list acknowledges that Werritty was present in both a personal and business capacity at a meeting between the UAE government and British military in Dubai last December. Fox did not go into these details in his statement to MPs, saying only that &quot;as a matter of transparency I would like to inform the house I have met Mr Werritty in a social capacity in the margins of 18 trips overseas, including my annual leave&quot;. In the interim report from the MoD&apos;s chief civil servant, Ursula Brennan, she says, with some understatement, that &quot;the defence secretary&apos;s overseas visits are complex, often involving brief stopovers en route from one location to another&quot;. She says that &quot;maintaining a proper degree of separation (between downtime and official engagements) is necessary for reasons of propriety&quot;. Brennan seems to indicate she is not happy with the way Fox may have blurred the lines, even if accidentally. &quot;The department needs to ensure that a clear distinction is made between party political, personal and government business to avoid the occurrence of actual or perceived conflicts of interest,&quot; she says. She also notes the &quot;potentially grey area&quot; where personal meetings can stray into government business \u2013 which should not happen without a civil servant present. As part of her ongoing review she has commissioned a trawl for &quot;email and electronic evidence&quot; at the MoD on all of Fox&apos;s trips abroad, including his holidays, when Werritty is known to have been there. She is trying to establish &quot;who else was on these trips and who attended which formal and informal events&quot;. MoD meetings In response to a Freedom of Information request, the Guardian discovered last week that Fox had met Werritty at the MoD on 14 occasions in the last 16 months. This provoked the furore about the access he had been given, and the potential for breaches of national security. But it emerged that there were even more visits than those declared under FoI, though no explanation was given about why the initial figures were inaccurate. In her report, Brennan sets out that Werritty &quot;was present on 22 rather than 14 occasions&quot;, and that she cannot yet exclude the possibility that there may have been more visits. And though Brennan says she feels confident that most of the visits to the MoD were &quot;largely personal conversations \u2026 and that the department did not provide Mr Werritty with classified papers or briefings&quot;, the sheer number of visits caused surprise across Westminster. Fox has conceded that at least one of the 22 visits, many of which took place in the Pillared Hall coffee bar in defence headquarters, was inappropriate. This involved Fox and Werritty meeting the forthcoming British ambassador to Israel. Brennan says that, &quot;Dr Fox acknowledges that it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended such a meeting at the MoD.&quot; In all, she has found - so far - there were only four occasions out of the 22 when Fox met Werritty with others in attendance. In Fox&apos;s statement to the Commons, he said that three of these related to Sri Lanka and one was with someone &quot;known socially to both of us&quot; - presumably, the British diplomat. Fox characterised Werritty&apos;s visits as &quot;short social meetings&quot;. Despite having a large staff to support him, and all the security protocols that come with running one of the biggest and most sensitive departments in Whitehall, Brennan hints at the chaotic nature of Fox&apos;s engagement diary \u2013 saying that she has still to confirm the times and dates of all the times Werritty entered the building. She has asked for &quot;security control logs&quot; to give her a definitive number. When the list of all the meetings they had together was published last night, it emerged that Werritty&apos;s first meeting with Fox at the MoD occurred on 20 May \u2013 just after the general election. He met him again on 21 May. Business cards It was during one of their MoD meetings in June that Fox told his friend to stop using business cards with the portcullis emblem saying he was one of Fox&apos;s advisers, he said. Fox told the Commons he first learned Werritty was using them earlier that month, and at their next meeting, &quot;told him to stop using his business card stating he was my adviser&quot;. Brennan explains that she raised the issue with Fox on 23 August at a routine meeting, the day she returned to the MoD after her summer break. She had read about the cards in a story published in the Guardian on 19 August. &quot;Dr Fox confirmed that he had already dealt with the problem and that it was wrong for Mr Werritty to have used such a card,&quot; she states. Brennan says she checked Fox&apos;s claim that he had asked Werritty to stop using the cards two months earlier with one of his special advisers. &quot;He recalls that immediately after this the defence secretary and the special advisers held a meeting with Mr Werritty at which Dr Fox told [him] that this was unacceptable and he must stop issuing the business cards.&quot; Answering questions in the Commons, Fox was asked if it was true that the former chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, had warned him about his closeness to Werritty. Fox said he did not recall having that conversation. Dubai meeting  Fox did not add anything new to his account of his controversial June meeting with Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter, maintaining it was organised after Werritty bumped into Boulter in a restaurant. He insisted that he had never discussed the issue of 3M boss George Buckley&apos;s knighthood with Boulter and suggested Boulter was unreliable because he had initially implied that the knighthood was discussed but he later insisted it was not. Ursula Brennan made it clear that Fox&apos;s officials had been unaware of the meeting and that she was unhappy about that. In her interim report she said: &quot;If there is a risk that a personal meeting may stray into government business, the private secretary should ensure that an official be present.&quot; Fox&apos;s insistence that the Boulter meeting was arranged after a chance encounter is undermined by correspondence seen by the Guardian which suggests talks had taken place between Werritty and Boulter about setting up a meeting with Fox as early as March. The June meeting was the second time the defence secretary had met the Dubai businessman. The two men met in Dubai in early April when, by coincidence, Fox was in town and was able to shake the private equity boss&apos;s hand. Security  Fox says he did not discuss either commercial or defence matters during private meetings with Werritty. &quot;He had no access to classified material nor was he briefed on classified matters.&quot; The defence secretary does acknowledge that at the Dubai meeting on 17 June there was a general discussion about a communications encryption technology called Cellcrypt and how it might work for the MoD. Beyond that, there was &quot;no discussion of \u2026 any classified information&quot;. Brennan says senior MoD civil servants believe that Werritty&apos;s 22-plus visits to the department were largely personal. But since others were present at only four of them she has only Fox&apos;s word for it. She says civil servants are confident they did not provide Werritty with classified papers or briefings. Boulter says that the call encryption technology he discussed with Fox in Dubai was sensitive and that he would not have done so if he had known Werritty did not have security clearance. In particular he says he discussed the possibility of providing it for UK troops in Afghanistan which would have been highly sensitive information. Fox&apos;s diary Brennan says that during the course of her review she learned that Fox or his office had provided some diary details to Werritty, in connection with visits where Werritty was to be present. She said: &quot;Dr Fox has accepted that it is not appropriate to ask officials to provide ministerial diary information to a third party.&quot; Questioned about providing diary details to a friend Fox was unapologetic. He claimed it was reasonable for ministers to let friends and family know of their movements in order to make arrangements to meet up socially. He does promise to stop meeting Werritty socially when abroad on official\u00a0business."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/10/liam-fox-battles-to-save-career", "sentences": ["Venues where they met include Bahrain, Washington, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Tampa in Florida for a Centcom meeting with General John R Allen, the commander-designate of the Isaf mission in Afghanistan."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-11T00:49:00Z", "title": "Liam Fox battles to save career as PM gives only conditional support", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Politics", "Liam Fox", "Ministry of Defence", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "article": "     The defence secretary, Liam Fox, was still battling to save his ministerial career as the country&apos;s top civil servant, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, launched a full inquiry into Fox&apos;s intricate links with his friend Adam Werritty, including whether he was profiting from the privileged access Fox gave him to his thinking and his ministerial diary. Number 10 sources privately acknowledged that it would be serious for Fox if the inquiry finds he knew Werritty was making money from his access, especially because Fox has not declared this relationship to the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence. In a fraught day Fox gave a Commons statement in which he repeatedly apologised to MPs for the serious mistakes he had made. He received full-throated support from the Tory backbenches. An interim report into his conduct by MoD permanent secretary Ursula Brennan found that since becoming defence secretary 18 months ago, Fox had met Werritty 22 times in the main MoD building and accompanied him or met him on 18 of his 48 visits abroad, including ministerial conferences and family holidays. Venues where they met include Bahrain, Washington, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Tampa in Florida for a Centcom meeting with General John R Allen, the commander-designate of the Isaf mission in Afghanistan. Werritty was also present socially during a four-day meeting in Washington in August when Fox met officials at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. David Cameron continued to give Fox strong, if conditional, support on Monday by describing him as an excellent defence secretary. But in an ominous development O&apos;Donnell, the cabinet secretary, took overall charge of the second stage of the Brennan inquiry. Downing Street had not known that Fox was going to set up the first inquiry and now wants to take charge of the investigation. It is expected to be completed within seven days. In a statement accompanying the interim report No 10 said: &quot;It is clear, as Liam Fox himself said , that serious mistakes were made in allowing the distinction between professional responsibilities and personal loyalties to be blurred \u2013 and this has clearly raised concerns about impropriety and potential conflicts of interest.&quot; Cameron will be aware that the whole of the Conservative party, including the former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind and the former Foreign Office minister David Davis, are expecting Cameron to protect Fox. The shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, said Fox had &quot;driven a coach and horses through the rules&quot; and added: &quot;He [Fox] cannot think a partial apology could give him a free pass around the breaches of the ministerial code.&quot; MoD officials said the initial Brennan investigation had not interviewed Werritty. Furthermore, Fox had not yet been asked if he knew whether Werritty had made money either from setting up meetings between Fox and defence contractors or from providing a confidante&apos;s knowledge to defence firms of Fox&apos;s thinking. Defence officials were clear that Fox personally received no payment from Werritty or from his clients. They also said Werritty had directly arranged only one meeting between the defence secretary and a defence contractor. It was acknowledged that this meeting, in Dubai on 17 June, had been inappropriate and should have included civil servants. Defence officials also insisted there was no evidence of Fox having divulged classified material to his friend, but the MoD accepted the two men had discussed defence issues. Pressed on whether Werritty gained commercially from his longstanding friendship with Fox, defence officials said: &quot;There is not any occasion when any payment has been made or passed. There is no defence relationship or commercial relationship that he [Werritty] has which he has gained from by being a friend of the secretary of state.&quot; Asked whether Werritty had a financial relationship with defence companies, Fox&apos;s aides said &quot;you need to ask Mr Werritty that&quot;, before adding: &quot;He works in international relations, attends security conferences and has private clients.&quot; Repeatedly pressed to say in the Commons if Werritty had received cash from clients due to his access to Fox, the normally plain-speaking defence secretary said: &quot;When it comes to the pecuniary interests of Mr Werritty in those conferences, I am absolutely confident that he was not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income.&quot; He said &quot;he has a very wide range of long standing business, international relations and political links of his own&quot; adding &quot;he has not been involved in any defence procurement issues&quot;. Brennan&apos;s interim report \u2013 published as Fox defended his conduct in the Commons \u2013 shows : \u2022 Fox allowed Werritty to organise a meeting between him and a defence contractor in Dubai without informing civil servants. \u2022 Werritty had regular access to Fox&apos;s diary, something Fox agreed was inappropriate, and used knowledge of Fox&apos;s movements to arrange meetings for defence contractors. \u2022 Werritty was present at a meeting between Fox and the British ambassador designate to Israel, something Fox admitted was wrong. \u2022 Fox&apos;s diary failed to keep a proper distinction between personal, political and government business, especially on overseas trips. \u2022 &quot;Confusion existed about who is or is not a member of the ministerial party&quot; on these trips. \u2022 Fox knew that Werritty was distributing a business card describing himself as adviser to the defence secretary in June, and told him to stop, but allowed him to produce a second card still describing himself as an adviser. He did not inform Brennan of the episode until she raised the issue after seeing a Guardian report two months later. Fox and his family then went on holiday with Werritty two months later in Spain, suggesting the use of the business card was forgiven. Strikingly the prime minister declined to refer the issue to Sir Philip Mawer, the independent adviser on ministerial standards. Mawer can only investigate potential breaches if they are passed to him by the prime minister. Nick Boles, one of the Tory backbenchers defending Fox, said: &quot;We should not elevate the ministerial code into status of laws handed down by Moses&quot;. Fox repeatedly recognised the seriousness of his errors and was, for the most part, not tempted by the support for him on his own benches to try to attack his detractors. But as he neared the close of his hour long statement, he said &quot;When confronted with these situations, we sometimes find unexpected resilience&quot;.  &quot;What&apos;s unacceptable is constant sniping and innuendo,&quot; he added.  Unanswered questions Has Adam Werritty benefited financially from his links with Liam Fox? Answering questions in the House of Commons Fox used a curious form of words, saying he was &quot;confident that Werritty was not dependent on any transactional behaviour&quot;. Asked later how Fox knew that Werritty had not benefited, officials said his friend had assured him of the fact. Why did Werritty travel to Dubai twice and arrange a meeting between Fox and a businessman? Fox said Werritty did not benefit financially from his role setting up the meeting with Dubai-based businessman Harvey Boulter. Boulter and lobbying firm Tetra Strategy also say they didn&apos;t pay him. So why did Werritty go to all the trouble? And who paid for his flights? Why did Fox spend three days in Dubai at the taxpayer&apos;s expense in June when he only had two engagements there \u2013 one of which his officials were unaware of? The MoD has confirmed that it paid the bill at the exclusive Address hotel. But Fox is understood to have had just one official engagement at a military facility, and the meeting with Boulter that his civil servants were not aware of. When did Fox become aware Werritty was describing himself as his adviser and what did he do about it? Fox said he learned in June his friend was distributing business cards describing himself as the defence secretary&apos;s adviser and immediately told him to stop. But did he previously sanction Werritty representing himself as an adviser or envoy? What exactly was Werritty&apos;s role in Sri Lanka? Fox suggested that Werritty had taken over his work with the Sri Lankan Development Trust, a fund established to promote development following the conflict on the island. Was Werritty being paid for this work, and was he acting as Fox&apos;s envoy to Sri Lanka despite foreign office concern about Fox&apos;s connections with the Colombo government?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/11/liam-fox-adam-werritty-income", "sentences": ["Places in which they met included Bahrain, Washington, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Tampa, in Florida, for a Centcom meeting with General John R Allen, the commander-designate of the Isaf mission in Afghanistan."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-11T08:26:00Z", "title": "Liam Fox row: Adam Werritty to be quizzed over sources of income", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "UK news", "Defence policy", "Lobbying"], "article": "Liam Fox&apos;s close friend Adam Werritty is to be asked by the inquiry investigating his links with the defence secretary to set out his sources of income and a full list of his clients. Downing Street said the inquiry &quot;will ask all the questions that people want answered, and find out the full facts&quot;. Werritty is likely to be interviewed at the Cabinet Offfice, and the interview could take place later on Tuesday, according to Whitehall sources. Government sources have admitted Fox will be in renewed political difficulties if it emerges that Werritty was benefiting financially from his privileged access to the defence secretary, and that Fox was aware of this. Fox said Werritty has accompanied him on 18 of his 40 overseas trips and has met him more than 20 times at the Ministry of Defence. It is not known how many times they have met elsewhere in Britain outside the Ministry of Defence. On Monday, defence sources said they did not know the names of Werritty&apos;s clients, and the inquiry, conducted by the MoD&apos;s permanent secretary, Ursula Brennan, had not asked him. The sources said he had a range of international clients, but have accepted that he printed a business card asserting that he was an adviser to the defence secretary. When Fox was the shadow health secretary, he presented himself as a health policy consultant. Werritty is not paid by the Conservative party and is not a paid special adviser. No 10 sources have privately acknowledged that it would be serious for Fox if the inquiry found he knew Werritty was making money from his access, especially because Fox has not declared this relationship to the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence. On a fraught Monday, Fox gave a Commons statement in which he repeatedly apologised to MPs for the serious mistakes he had made. He received strong support from the Tory backbenches. An interim report into his conduct by Brennan found that, since becoming defence secretary 18 months ago, Fox had met Werritty 22 times in the main MoD building and had accompanied him or met him on 18 of his 48 visits abroad, including ministerial conferences and family holidays. Places in which they met included Bahrain, Washington, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Tampa, in Florida, for a Centcom meeting with General John R Allen, the commander-designate of the Isaf mission in Afghanistan. Werritty was also present socially during a four-day meeting in Washington in August when Fox met officials at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. David Cameron continued to give Fox strong, if conditional, support on Monday, describing him as an excellent defence secretary. But in an ominous development, the cabinet secretary, Gus O&apos;Donnell, took overall charge of the second stage of the Brennan inquiry. Downing Street had not known that Fox was going to set up the first inquiry, and now wants to take charge of the investigation. It is expected to be completed within seven days. In a statement accompanying the interim report, No 10 said: &quot;It is clear, as Liam Fox himself said, that serious mistakes were made in allowing the distinction between professional responsibilities and personal loyalties to be blurred, and this has clearly raised concerns about impropriety and potential conflicts of interest.&quot; The prime minister will be aware that the whole of the Conservative party, including the former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind and the former Foreign Office minister David Davis, are expecting him to protect Fox.

Even a pot of tea comes in at over \u00a35 and an expense account would seem essential to all but the richest business traveller. But this is where Adam Werritty checked in on at least one trip to Dubai this year when travelling, in the words of the Ministry of Defence, &quot;in a private capacity&quot;. And travelling in a private capacity is what the MoD says the close friend and best man of the defence secretary, Liam Fox, has been doing when he has shown up again and again, all around the world, at the side of the defence secretary over the past 18 months. Werritty&apos;s movements have led to a growing sense of mystery about where he has been getting the money to travel the world, often to the same places as Fox and in comfortable style. Since Fox took office Werritty has been to Florida, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Washington, Singapore, Israel and Spain, each time meeting the secretary of state for defence \u2013 19 trips in total in which he saw Fox. Details about where his money comes from are scant. Over a four-year period he appears to have been paid \u00a390,000 in salary for his role as executive director of Fox&apos;s charity Atlantic Bridge. But that is now defunct, closed down following a Charity Commission investigation. Accounts filed at the Charity Commission show that in 2008 and 2009 alone the organisation spent more than \u00a315,000 on travel, although that would not necessarily relate to Werritty alone. Certainly, hotel records at the Shangri-La in Dubai seen by the Guardian name the charity as the &quot;company&quot; under which he booked in, but hotel staff could not confirm if the charity had paid. Either way the record showed Werritty certainly spared no expense, selecting one of the more expensive suites in an already expensive hotel. He took a &quot;Horizon deluxe&quot; room on the 40th floor of the hotel in downtown Dubai, one level below the business lounge where Fox met defence industry businessman Harvey Boulter on 18 June in a meeting brokered by Werritty to discuss a possible defence contract and a legal battle involving the MoD. The room currently costs \u00a3320 per night, which means Werritty was spending the same for his room as the records showed Fox did in his rather more elevated capacity as defence secretary when he stayed in the hotel in April. The 41st floor Horizon business lounge is a good place to conduct business. Screened booths fitted with leather sofas are accessed via a manned reception desk and staff take their duty to keep the area exclusive seriously, repeatedly demanding your room number if you wander in for a look. It also emerged yesterday that a pro-Israeli lobbying organisation, Bicom, paid for Werritty&apos;s flight and hotel bill to attend a conference in Israel in 2009 where he was asked to join a panel and talk about Iran. The Herzliya conference was one of the events listed by the Ministry of Defence at which he met Fox. Amid questions as to whether Werritty has been earning money off the back of his access to and relationship with Fox, the defence secretary has said Werritty &quot;has a very wide range of long-standing business, international relations and political links of his own&quot;. Werritty&apos;s name appears at Companies House with two firms, Danscotia Consulting and Todhia Ltd, but it is unclear what either of them do. It is likely that the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, who interviewed Werritty on Tuesday, will have wanted to know what his business and political relations are. Werritty has so far not made any public statements. Pressed to say in the Commons on Monday if Werritty had received cash from clients due to his access to Fox, the defence secretary said: &quot;When it comes to the pecuniary interests of Mr Werritty in those conferences, I am absolutely confident he was not dependent on any transactional behaviour to maintain his income.&quot; It seems Werritty also chose to eat in one of Dubai&apos;s more expensive restaurants. Boulter said he bumped into him in June, the night before he met Fox for the meeting in the Horizon business lounge that sparked the whole Werritty/ Fox scandal. Werritty was dining at Ruth&apos;s Chris American steakhouse. It is the kind of eaterie that attracts people who prize flavour over economy; fillet steaks sell for \u00a350 each and Maine Lobster goes for even more. To uncork the most expensive wine, a 1996 Chateau Cheval Blanc from Bordeaux, you need at least \u00a33,000, though there is no suggestion Werritty placed an order. Air fares Adam Werritty is known to have made 18 trips abroad over 14 months where Liam Fox was present but the question of how he paid for most of them remains a mystery. Travelling business class, those flights would have cost the 33-year-old more than \u00a338,000, according to Guardian estimates. Assuming Werritty paid for his own accommodation in five-star hotels the estimated 83 nights away could have cost up to another \u00a316,000. Even if he had just stayed one night at each destination, then the total cost of the trips would have reached \u00a340,132.

A study by the Department for Education suggests an English pupil who achieved eight Cs at GCSE would have to score 3As and 5Bs to match the attainment of their peers in Shanghai. The analysis indicates that English pupils are also at least a year behind the reading standard of their counterparts in South Korea and Finland. Fifteen-year-olds in England are also at least six months behind those in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and New Zealand. Commenting on the findings, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, said: &quot;The gulf between our 15-year-olds&apos; reading abilities and those from other countries is stark \u2013 a gap that starts to open in the very first few years of a child&apos;s education. The government&apos;s focus on raising standards of reading in the early years of primary school is key to closing that gap.&quot; From next summer, six-year-olds in England will be given a new reading test, checking their ability to read using phonics, a technique based on sounding out letters and groups of letters. There will also be a new spelling and punctuation test for 11-year-olds, to be introduced in 2013. From next September, pupils taking English language GCSEs will lose marks for poor grammar and spelling. An endowment fund set up by the government will on Wednesday announce a \u00a350,000 grant to run five summer camps for about 1,000 pupils from disadvantaged homes. The camps will offer classes in literacy and maths as well as music and sport. The government&apos;s findings are drawn from an analysis of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development&apos;s research. The OECD&apos;s Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) involved numeracy, literacy and science tests of about 470,000 15-year-olds around the world in 2009. The latest Pisa study found that the UK performed around the average among OECD countries for reading and maths, and above average for science. The highest performing region across all the tests was Shanghai, with a mean score of 556. The second highest scoring was Korea with 539, and Finland was third, with 536. The OECD, a thinktank, says the Chinese education system is focused on passing exams. Students work long days and at weekends to carry out additional exam preparation, while private tutorials are considered a household necessity. The OECD says: &quot;There is a general belief that [the] emphasis on examinations jeopardises the genuine development of young people and is detrimental ... but few effective solutions have emerged to reduce or minimise examination pressures.&quot; In contrast, children in Finland receive fewer hours of instruction than students in any other OECD country. The Finnish system is based on recruiting talented graduates as teachers and then giving them freedom to decide how they will teach. There is also a political consensus governing education: Finland has an entirely comprehensive system with no private schools and no selection below the age of 16. Finnish classrooms take a child-centred approach. The OECD says: &quot;Students [in Finland] are expected to take an active role in designing their own learning activities. &quot;Students are expected to work collaboratively in teams on projects, and there is a substantial focus on projects that cut across traditional subject or disciplinary lines. By the time students enrol in upper secondary school, they are expected to be able to take sufficient charge of their own learning to be able to design their own individual programme. &quot;Upper secondary schools are now mostly based on individual study plans.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/11/hotel-records-cast-doubt-liam-fox", "sentences": ["According to a list of meetings released by the Ministry of Defence on Monday, the pair met during the minister&apos;s visits to Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Florida, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Israel, Washington and Sri Lanka."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-12T00:45:00Z", "title": "Liam Fox claims thrown into doubt by Dubai hotel records", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "UK news", "Politics", "Liam Fox", "Adam Werritty", "Conservatives", "Conservative and Liberal Democrat cabinet", "Lobbying"], "article": "Liam Fox&apos;s claim that Adam Werritty was operating in &quot;a private capacity&quot; when the men met twice in Dubai this year has been thrown into fresh doubt by hotel records seen by the Guardian. They reveal that Werritty booked into the five-star Shangri-La hotel earlier this year describing his position as &quot;office of Dr Liam Fox&quot; and naming his company as &quot;Atlantic Bridge&quot;, the defence secretary&apos;s controversial rightwing charity which had close links to a group of powerful American business lobbyists. Hotel staff said it was normal, but not guaranteed, for the named company to pay all or part of the bill. Werritty also gave a contact address at the houses of parliament. The official explanation of Werritty&apos;s role in Fox&apos;s life is being increasingly called into doubt by evidence from countries where the pair travelled. Politicians in Colombo, the Sri Lankan commercial capital, revealed that they too assumed that Werritty was an official adviser when he travelled there before and after Fox joined the cabinet. Ravi Karunanayake, an opposition MP in Colombo, confirmed meeting Fox in 2009. &quot;I simply thought he [Werritty] was an assistant or an official or something similar,&quot; he told the Guardian. Channel 4 claimed Werritty was being asked by the Sri Lankan government to help them lobby for arms and aviation supplies, although its sources have not been confirmed. Lord Bell, whose PR firm Bell Pottinger worked for the Sri Lankan government up until the end of last year, said that Werritty had attended some meetings that his firm had held with the Sri Lankan government but he could not say in what capacity or why he was present. After a big show of support for Fox in the Commons on Monday, there were some private signs that Tories were still disturbed by what they had heard, and were withholding judgment. Werritty was interviewed by a senior Cabinet Office civil servant over claims that he may have profited from his close personal relationship with the defence secretary. It is understood Werritty has claimed that the funding for his trips did not come from defence contractors, but a variety of international Atlanticist philanthropists. He was interviewed at a location away from Westminster by Sue Grey, the long-standing Cabinet Office civil servant responsible for propriety and ethics. There was no requirement for him to meet with civil servants since he is not a government or Conservative party employee. But Werritty&apos;s willingness to co-operate is essential if Fox is to survive in cabinet as Downing Street has privately made it clear the defence secretary will be in serious difficulties if it could be shown that some of Werritty&apos;s income is derived directly or indirectly from his knowledge of Fox&apos;s thinking on defence issues, or worse, from his privileged access to Fox&apos;s diary. Last night it also emerged that the prime minister&apos;s press secretary, Gabby Bertin, was paid \u00a325,000 by a major US drug company to work as a researcher for Fox&apos;s charity while he was shadow health secretary. Bertin, who is now David Cameron&apos;s press secretary, was\u00a0paid by the pharmaceutical firm Pfizer to\u00a0work for Fox&apos;s Atlantic Bridge charity. Bertin was a close colleague of Adam Werritty, Fox&apos;s best man and self-styled adviser. The Guardian also understands that Werritty, 33, will be recalled to give further evidence if Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, the cabinet secretary, and Ursula Brennan, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, believe they have not had proper disclosure of his business interests, which will be crucial to establish whether he was able to profit from his friendship with Fox \u2013 something the defence secretary has denied. It is understood that the Cabinet Office is asking Werritty to give written details of his income, including some bank statements. The inquiry is being overseen by O&apos;Donnell. No 10 is aware it cannot afford to be seen to be conducting a whitewash inquiry as David Cameron has courted controversy by refusing to refer the issue to Sir Philip Mawer, the government&apos;s independent adviser of ministerial interests. Mawer is kept on a \u00a330,000 retainer, but cannot initiate an inquiry into a potential breach of the ministerial code unless the prime minister, in consultation with the cabinet secretary, refers the issue to him. Downing Street tried to stonewall any details about the terms of reference of the inquiry, saying simply that all the facts would be established and all the questions being asked will be put to Werritty. In the Commons, the shadow deputy leader, Harriet Harman, pressed Nick Clegg to refer the issue to Mawer, saying it went to the heart of trust in government. She said: &quot;The deputy prime minister has always lectured us on high standards in public office, but while the defence secretary, by his own admission, has fallen short of those standards, the government have failed to refer him to \u2026 Mawer. &quot;Does that not show that they are prepared to sacrifice high standards in public office to protect the secretary of state?&quot; Clegg replied by implying that the cabinet secretary will decide if Fox has broken the code. He said: &quot;I am very clear, of course, that everybody in this government should abide by the very highest available standards and by the ministerial code, both the spirit and the letter, and that is exactly what the cabinet secretary has been asked to look into and to adjudicate on in his report.&quot; Cameron has said Fox made &quot;serious mistakes&quot; in his ties to his former best man, but appears willing to keep him if there is no evidence Fox knew Werritty was gaining from his numerous contacts with Fox. According to a list of meetings released by the Ministry of Defence on Monday, the pair met during the minister&apos;s visits to Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Florida, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Israel, Washington and Sri Lanka. The meetings included one with a senior US general. Fox said they did not discuss &quot;commercial or defence matters, he [Werritty] had no access to classified documents, nor was he briefed on classified matters&quot;. The hotel records in Dubai seen by the Guardian show that Fox took a room in the same hotel on 3 April, when Werritty was also understood to be staying there. It was during that stay that Werritty first introduced Fox to the British defence industry businessman Harvey Boulter in the lobby cafe of the hotel. According to the booking records, Werritty took a room in the 40th-floor executive area which provides exclusive access to the business lounge where he and Fox met Boulter on 18 June in a meeting to discuss a possible defence contract and a legal battle involving the MoD. It is not certain the booking relates to that occasion. The details relate to 2011 but do not specify the dates he was there, and it is possible Fox was unaware of how Werritty was describing himself. But even if the record does not relate to either of the two meetings Fox had with Werritty in Dubai in April or June, the fact Werritty travelled under the auspices of Fox and gave the Fox-founded charity, Atlantic Bridge, as his company will fuel concern about the proximity of their working relationship.

In fact, it&apos;s almost as if the Swiss want to keep the recipe secret, tucked away in a subterranean vault, as establishing anything concrete about this Alpine favourite, from the type of potatoes used to the cooking method, is a feat akin to scaling the north face of the Eiger. (In fact, it&apos;s even harder, because no one, as far as I can tell, has come up with anything even vaguely resembling a definitive r\u00f6sti recipe.) The only thing I do work out during my initial research is that I&apos;ve been pronouncing it wrongly all these years: apparently it&apos;s reursch-ti rather than row-sti. But frankly, that&apos;s the least of my troubles. While many Swiss consider it their national dish, the world has taken a shine to it too, and it&apos;s not as if I haven&apos;t eaten a few in my time (most memorably one in the Himalayas that came with a teaspoon embedded in the centre). That said, I was startled to read on one food blog that despite a year-round average humidity of 84% &quot;most restaurants ... in Singapore serve r\u00f6sti as a side&quot;. A taste for fried potato, it seems, is universal. All too often, however, these globalised r\u00f6stis have an unpleasantly starchy flavour and greasy, raw interior, which makes them a prospect even less appealing than burger bar hash browns as far as I&apos;m concerned. Then, this summer, I spent a long weekend walking in the Alps, and I realised that, while the Swiss are apparently incapable of producing even a glass of water for less than a tenner, they do make the world&apos;s best r\u00f6sti. Crisp on the outside, soft and meltingly, well, potato-ey within, it was so good it needed no other adornment \u2013 although, of course, with mountains to climb, I added liberal amounts of smoked ham and local cheese. But, when I tried to find a recipe to recreate it at home, I came up against a wall of silence: and with no definitive way to cook a r\u00f6sti, the only thing to do was experiment. In the raw This, if you will, is the r\u00f6sti equivalent of the cream-first v jam-first scone war \u2013 some people parboil the potatoes before grating, and others don&apos;t bother. No-one online really seems too concerned about this divide \u2013 they acknowledge it, without going into the pros and cons of each approach. It irks me though; which is more traditional? And, more importantly, which is better? The Oxford Companion to Food is uncharacteristically silent on the matter, but, after a frustrating half hour trawling the endless regurgitation of the internet, I finally discover that, according to a reliable sounding book called the Culinary Arts &amp; Traditions of Switzerland, raw potato is typical only in the Zurich area \u2013 the rest of the country insists upon parboiling them first. Should I, as a non-partisan foreigner, back the bankers, or side with the cowbell swingers? Only one way to find out. Using the Leiths Cookery Bible recipe as my template (which, in its original form, calls for boiled potato), I make two different r\u00f6stis. For the first, I grate two large potatoes, wring them out then press them into a flat cake in a hot, well-buttered frying pan and cook for 10 minutes on each side. For the other, I parboil two potatoes until just tender; once they&apos;re cool enough to handle, they&apos;re grated and cooked in exactly the same way.      A r\u00f6sti cooked from raw potatoes. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    The raw potato r\u00f6sti looks far more like my image of the dish \u2013 the strands of potato are still distinct and it&apos;s ragged and strawlike around the edges, but, although cooked through, it has a starchy flavour, and oddly raw texture that I recognise with dislike. The other reminds me more of a bubble and squeak potato cake made with leftover mash; more to my taste, admittedly, but I suspect it wouldn&apos;t pass the Swiss test. I also try a trick suggested online by chef Patrick Williams; salting the grated raw potatoes to &quot;draw out&quot; the excess water, a technique familiar to me from coleslaw recipes, which makes the r\u00f6sti crisper on the outside, but does nothing for the starchy flavour or crunchy interior. Pre-chilled?     Chilled pre-boiled, peeled potato r\u00f6sti. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    For some Swiss, it&apos;s not enough to parboil the potatoes \u2013 they must be done a day in advance and chilled before grating. It certainly makes them easier to grate, and they hold together better in the pan too, although I think a couple of hours in the fridge would do the trick. Peeled or nay? I&apos;m pleased to see many recipes call for potatoes boiled in their skins \u2013 peeling is a small effort, admittedly, but every little helps. Conscience dictates, however, that I try one with a naked potato too; but I&apos;m astonished at how much flavour the skin gives the r\u00f6sti; peeling, thank goodness, is much more trouble than it&apos;s worth.  Playing a binder     Valentine Warner recipe r\u00f6sti. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    Some r\u00f6sti chefs, daunted by the prospect of marshalling hundreds of pieces of grated potato into a coherent cake, add extra ingredients to their r\u00f6sti to bind the pieces of potato together. Valentine Warner, for example, pops in a hefty amount of clarified butter and a tablespoon of flour in the recipe in his new book, The Good Table.  This r\u00f6sti is very easy to flip, needing less prodding and agitation than others, but I&apos;m not convinced by the finished texture, which is slightly grainy, or the rich, buttery flavour, which seems to deny me the prospect of any other toppings. (I love the idea of his distinctly un-Swiss accompaniments though: salmon roe, sour cream, chopped onion and dill. Nearly as good as smoked ham and Swiss cheese.) Floury versus waxy     Floury potato r\u00f6sti. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    I&apos;m astounded to discover there&apos;s no clear consensus as to whether a floury or a waxy potato is preferable for this dish. Mark Hix and Jane Clarke specify floury, Val Warner and Leiths go with waxy.  The floury versions are deliciously fluffy and well browned, but, when parboiled, more like a mashed potato cake than a r\u00f6sti. The individual strands of waxy potato, meanwhile, retain their shape better once made into a cake, and the finished r\u00f6stis have a crunchier texture, even when made from parboiled potatoes, which sets them apart from ordinary potato cakes. Goose fat v butter Nick Nairn fries his r\u00f6sti in goose fat, which makes sense: if it can give roast potatoes that glorious crisp finish, then perhaps it will work the same magic on my r\u00f6stis. Although I prefer the flavour of butter with the potato, I&apos;m forced to admit that his are distinctly crunchier, so I decide to use a mixture of both in my final recipe.  Perfect potato r\u00f6sti     Felicity's perfect r\u00f6sti. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    They&apos;re glorious plain, but a r\u00f6sti can be made into a complete meal with the addition of onion, bacon and nutty Alpine cheese. (Some areas even add coffee; those crazy Swiss, eh?). All you really need for a good r\u00f6sti, however, is some firm potatoes, parboiled to give a soft, melting interior, and fried in plenty of hot butter and goose fat until crisp, and a few mountains to climb to work up an appetite. Serves 4 as a side dish, 2 as a main course 2 medium-sized waxy potatoes1 tbsp butter1 tbsp goose fat 1. Parboil the potatoes in salted water until just tender, but not soft. Allow to cool, and chill for at least a couple of hours.  2. Coarsely grate the potatoes and season. Heat half the fat in a small, heavy-based frying pan until sizzling, and then add the grated potato, allow to cook for a couple of minutes and then shape it into a flat cake, pressing down as lightly as possible. Allow to cook for a couple of minutes, then gently shake the pan to loosen the potato.  3. Continue to cook for about 10 minutes until golden and crisp, then place a plate on top of the pan and invert it so the cake sits, cooked-side up, on the plate.  4. Add the rest of the butter and goose fat to the pan and, when hot, slide the potato cake back into the pan the other way up. Cook for another 10 minutes, then serve. Is a r\u00f6sti nothing more than a hash brown with Alpine airs and graces, or a distinctive national dish Switzerland should be proud of? What are your top tips, and what other foods do you favour to keep off the mountain chill?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/oct/13/john-w-henry-liverpool-boston", "sentences": ["Fenway had been forced to increase their price to \u00a3200m, due to the higher bid from the Singapore businessman Peter Lim."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-13T16:46:59Z", "title": "John W Henry turns from Red Sox to red shirts for the global gains | David Conn", "tags": ["Liverpool", "John W Henry", "Kenny Dalglish", "Andy Carroll", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "In his apartment on the 11th floor of Boston&apos;s five-star Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Liverpool&apos;s principal owner, John W Henry, and chairman, Tom Werner, watched on Fox Soccer Network what could be Liverpool&apos;s most significant match of the season, last month&apos;s 4-0 demolition by Tottenham Hotspur. For Henry, Werner and their 17 partners in the Boston-based Fenway Sports Group, their takeover of Liverpool, a year ago this Saturday when the team face Manchester United at Anfield, has been marked mostly by progress and feel-good optimism. The club&apos;s \u00a3200m bank debt was paid off as Fenway&apos;s price of buying the club, Damien Comolli was appointed director of football, the Kop&apos;s king, Kenny Dalglish, made manager, \u00a3110.5m has been spent on new players. Above all, Henry and Werner are basking in their overwhelming quality, of not being Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Henry, naturally optimistic as a spectator \u2013 constantly believing his Boston Red Sox baseball team would turn games round throughout their record-breaking September collapse \u2013 anticipated a win, to launch Liverpool towards the cherished, lucrative, Premier League fourth place. What happened, however, was not in the prospectus: Liverpool froze, Luka Modric scored after five minutes, Charlie Adam was sent off for two bookings, Martin Skrtel followed him, Spurs were comprehensively superior. Henry watched the Red Sox&apos;s 8-5 defeat to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays later that day with quiet but vocal despair and Werner would struggle to contain his angst. But theygreeted the football hammering mostly in affronted silence. When Skrtel crashed into Gareth Bale for his second yellow card, with Bale on the halfway line facing his own goal posing no threat, there was no eruption of fury from Liverpool&apos;s owners at so needless a dismissal. Henry, joking, said: &quot;Well, we played a little better for a while with 10 men, maybe we&apos;ll play better with nine.&quot; Watching Liverpool crumple and the new, expensively-bought midfield of Adam, Jordan Henderson and Stewart Downing outplayed, Henry and his party, all fans of baseball, a game charted by numbers, seemed to need some statistical handle on it. &quot;How many yellow cards we got?&quot; somebody asked. (Answer: at least four too many.) At the Red Sox games, I had been similar; appreciating the skill and speed, recognising great athleticism and obvious bungles, but still grappling with the rules, so a lifetime short of understanding the sport&apos;s pattern and rhythm. With Liverpool 3-0 down, Henry mused admiringly: &quot;Boy, did you see how far [Andy Carroll] headed that ball?&quot; He seemed to have a touch of Dalglish&apos;s propensity to query refereeing decisions, struggling to see why Adam&apos;s downward lunge on Scott Parker merited a second yellow. I began to offer an appreciation of the officials&apos; skill, pointing out how an assistant referee was exactly in line with the last defender, to judge the Spurs forward&apos;s position precisely when the ball was played \u2013 then I suddenly thought: I am watching a match with the owners of Liverpool Football Club, and I am coming perilously close to explaining the offside rule. Told relentlessly about the Premier League&apos;s huge following internationally, and that soccer is breaking through in America, you can believe it \u2013 until you actually go there. In Boston, football barely breaks into consciousness. Widely played by schoolchildren, as a spectacle it is drowned out by the giants of American sport: baseball, American football and basketball. Henry believes Americans want regular decisive action, so struggle with a game that can deliver 0-0 draws. Manchester United&apos;s 3-1 defeat of Chelsea later that day was the most watched Premier League match ever in the US \u2013 886,000 people tuned in live, 0.3% among a population of 307m. Henry acknowledged that, a lifelong American sports fan aged 60, he knew &quot;virtually nothing&quot; of Liverpool or the Premier League before buying the club. That drilled home how extraordinary it is that American businessmen, from the singular huge country with its own sports, still largely oblivious to football, have bought five of English football&apos;s greatest clubs, Manchester United, Liverpool (twice), Arsenal, Aston Villa and Sunderland. These owners&apos; collective contribution at the big three has not been positive: \u00a3473m drained out of United in interest, fees and bank charges by the Glazers&apos; leveraged United takeover; Hicks and Gillett almost costing Liverpool its solvency; Stan Kroenke paying more than \u00a3300m to Arsenal&apos;s English shareholders but promising, as an article of faith, no investment in the club. His interest sparked by an email from a Liverpool-supporting Fenway employee last August, Henry fixed a meeting to hear about the club with Philip Hall, of Inner Circle Sports, New York-based merchant bankers. Inner Circle previously acted for Hicks and Gillett when they bought Liverpool and became Fenway&apos;s financial advisers on their Liverpool acquisition. During that meeting, Werner did not pay too much attention, believing he and his quintessential American partners would not venture into English football. But Henry, as he listened to the club&apos;s prospects, found it revelatory. &quot;A number of parallels emerged with the situation that existed in Boston when we arrived,&quot; he explained. The Red Sox and Liverpool were both historically successful clubs which had lost their dominance, and both had beloved old grounds not up to modern money-making standards. Henry began to feel Fenway could apply the same strategies at Anfield as they had to winning effect in Boston, and also make an ambitious move into international sport. There was more to it than just wanting to win. Central to Henry&apos;s and Fenway&apos;s fascination was English football&apos;s, and Liverpool&apos;s, huge worldwide support, compared to the US-restricted following for American sports. Several Fenway executives recounted, with awe, that the Super Bowl, American sport&apos;s most prestigious event, is watched by around 20m viewers outside the US, whereas Liverpool&apos;s 3-1 defeat of Manchester United last season attracted an estimated 500m global audience. Hall outlined how United, under the Glazers, have made money via international sponsorships, explaining that Liverpool have room similarly to profit. They found it very attractive that, as Hall explained, in the Premier League, individual clubs keep the money they make from such worldwide sponsorship. In baseball, the teams are franchises, their income is taxed by MLB and shared, to maintain reasonable competition between big city teams such as the Red Sox, and smaller teams. Thus the underdog Rays were well-equipped enough this season to dramatically deny the Red Sox a place in the play-offs. Werner told the Guardian he resents the amount of money the Red Sox have to share with smaller teams. Understanding how compelling Fenway found these individual financial arrangements, it is no surprise that Ian Ayre, whom Fenway appointed Liverpool&apos;s managing director, said this week they want to break out of the collective overseas TV deal, the only income football shares. Henry, asked if the American owners will ultimately want their clubs to do their own TV deals, as Real Madrid and Barcelona do, replied: &quot;These people [the American owners] understand media and the long-term global implications. They&apos;re going to want to reach their fans in the new media landscape. The Premier League was created in response to changing media. Audiences will drive leagues rather than the other way round.&quot; Hall&apos;s presentation included a comparison demonstrating that Liverpool, a big &quot;EPL&quot; club with a worldwide following, could be bought for better value than US sports teams, with their &quot;limited global potential&quot;. Ed Weiss, Fenway&apos;s general counsel (in-house lawyer) who would help mastermind the bloody legal fight that Liverpool&apos;s three-man board won, selling the club to Fenway against Hicks&apos; furious opposition, explained Liverpool&apos;s appeal: &quot;So much internet clutter competes for mindshare now. Big sports clubs are one of the few things which can cut through and capture mindshare. We have one of the great baseball teams, but its ability is geographically limited. The Liverpool numbers blew us away. We believe there is a significant amount of monetisation we can do, on a worldwide basis, which is not occurring now.&quot; Henry was extremely taken. Just six weeks later, after rapid due diligence and that bitter court battle, he emerged blinking in the media&apos;s spotlights outside his London lawyers&apos; offices, having bought Liverpool. Fenway had been forced to increase their price to \u00a3200m, due to the higher bid from the Singapore businessman Peter Lim. Weiss said before that they had been planning to leave some debt in. The takeover undoubtedly put Liverpool immediately in a dramatically better position\u00a0\u2013\u00a0undoing the previous US takeover&apos;s damage, so putting the club almost back to where it had been in February 2007, before any takeover at all. Fenway, like the Glazers and Kroenke, do not intend to spend their own money freely on Liverpool. Henry is firmly attached to Uefa&apos;s financial fair play rules, which require clubs to move towards breaking even, rather than make huge losses bankrolled by indulgent owners such as Chelsea&apos;s Roman Abramovich or Manchester City&apos;s Sheikh Mansour. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t have moved forward on Liverpool except for the passage of FFP,&quot; he said. He is worried Uefa will not enforce the rules strictly, so that clubs with investing owners will remain wealthier. Henry and David Ginsberg, the enthusiastic Fenway partner who spends most time in Liverpool \u2013 a week a month \u2013 say they have put some partnership money into Liverpool, &quot;to help with cash flow&quot;, although they would not say how much. Certainly, they clarified, it had not come from the 19 Fenway partners putting more money in, but from the group&apos;s existing reserves. Fenway&apos;s significant first move was to appoint Comolli, the former director of football at Tottenham, into a similar position at Anfield, working with Roy Hodgson, the manager, who Fenway would replace with Dalglish in January. Henry confirmed there had been no wider recruitment process for this most plum of jobs; Comolli was appointed following the recommendation of Billy Beane, the former general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, with whom Comolli had struck up a friendship. &quot;Billy became passionate about the Premier League and he became my initial adviser about the football side of Liverpool,&quot; Henry recalled. &quot;Billy was adamant \u2013 &apos;There is one person who you have to hire \u2013 Damien Comolli. He has the same philosophy Theo [Epstein, the Red Sox general manager], you and I share.&apos;&quot; This was not, as some have simplified it, Comolli&apos;s use of player performance statistics, although Henry says Comolli is famous for that; all clubs use such data now, mostly the Prozone analysis. &quot;What Billy meant is we are all dedicated to finding and using every advantage no matter how small,&quot; Henry said. &quot;We don&apos;t rest. We&apos;ll look at stats no one else will look at, employ scouting in a way that has a compelling organisational context, question everything and everyone and ensure we have the best player development curriculum and protocols.&quot; Dalglish, as Ayre enthused this week, was the key appointment that instantly lifted the Anfield mood, embodying for Liverpool fans the &quot;spirit of Shankly&quot; they felt Hicks&apos;s and Gillett&apos;s misrule drained out. &quot;I wasn&apos;t convinced when we arrived that Kenny should be back managing,&quot; Henry reflected. &quot;Kenny and Damien were calculated gambles. They both have the advantage of being passionate about their work and are both very clever. We didn&apos;t feel we had a lot of time to wait, and we hope things turned around.&quot; They did, dramatically, even before the January transfer window in which Liverpool sold Fernando Torres to Chelsea for \u00a350m, signed Luis Su\u00e1rez for \u00a322m \u2013 a high-quality arrival for which Dalglish has credited Comolli \u2013 then Carroll, for that \u00a335m Dalglish still finds himself defending, quite impatiently, after every match. In the summer Liverpool spent again, \u00a320m each for Downing and Henderson, \u00a37.5m to Blackpool for Adam, \u00a36m for left-back Jos\u00e9 Enrique, which many believe to be the best deal. Because of Comolli&apos;s presence, many have inferred there must be some statistical shrewdness to these signings, but Henry said it is not so simple. &quot;Everyone is fixated on Moneyball or sabermetrics [an approach to using baseball statistics, which the book documents]. But football is too dynamic to focus on that. Ultimately you have to rely on your scouting.&quot; Many in football remain staggered that Liverpool, with new owners famed in the US for analytical rigour, paid Newcastle so much for Carroll who had at the time played 18 Premier League matches. Some believe that huge fee sent a signal that Liverpool were now flush, and raised the prices for Henderson and Downing, while Adam, a fine playmaker in Blackpool&apos;s energetic 4-3-3 last season, faces a challenge adapting in Liverpool&apos;s four-man midfield. Asked if Liverpool did overpay for Carroll and the other players, Henry suggested the new owners did, to reassure fans: &quot;There was a lot of criticism in Boston that we weren&apos;t going to spend money on the Red Sox after we did the Liverpool transaction,&quot; Henry explained. &quot;Then there was the fear we wouldn&apos;t spend in Liverpool. Hopefully the fans of both clubs will eventually see what we see clearly \u2013 that there is nothing to fear from the existence of the other club.&quot; Asked about Carl Crawford, the expensive Red Sox signing who attracted most criticism for poor performances this season, Henry said Crawford had only &quot;had a bad year&quot;. But he then acknowledged: &quot;Choosing players in any sport is an imperfect science. We certainly have been guilty of overspending on some players and that can be tied to an analytical approach that hasn&apos;t worked well enough.&quot; At White Hart Lane, the new signings were outclassed principally by Parker, who cost Spurs \u00a35.5m. Liverpool recovered with a 2-1 victory over Wolves in which the central midfield again did not dominate, against Karl Henry and Jamie O&apos;Hara. Then against 10-man Everton in the Merseyside derby \u2013 Jack Rodwell, who was effectively cancelling out Adam, having been incorrectly sent off \u2013 it was still only after Adam and Downing went off , andwere replaced by Steven Gerrard and Craig Bellamy that Liverpool finally made their breakthrough, Carroll scoring his first goal of the season. A thorough assessment of the players signed, Dalglish&apos;s return to management and his partnership with Comolli, which Henry said works &quot;remarkably well,&quot; has a long way to go. The same can be said of solving the Anfield stadium conundrum, the reason why the former majority shareholder, David Moores, and then chief executive, Rick Parry, said they needed to sell Liverpool in the first place. They disastrously opted for Hicks and Gillett, who made no progress, but whose \u00a3174m purchase made Moores \u00a390m personally for his shares. A year on since their takeover, Fenway are not a great deal closer than any Liverpool hierarchy has been in the near 15 years since Moores and Parry decided a new stadium on Stanley Park was the only option. They were terrified of United, slapping extra tiers up at Old Trafford, whose 76,000 capacity Ayre referred to this week. Fenway arrived, though, saying they wanted to stay at Anfield, believing they could do at Liverpool&apos;s home what they did with Fenway Park, a stunningly high quality and shrewdly lucrative refurbishment. Henry is clear that building a new stadium, for perhaps 15,000 more seats than Anfield, at a price currently estimated at \u00a3300m, is an expense to be avoided if possible: &quot;If you build a 70,000-seat stadium it will cost much more than double to build than a 35,000-seater. The higher the seat the more expensive it is to construct.&quot; They have, though, been confounded, as their Anfield predecessors were, by the neighbourhood facts: Anfield is hemmed in by houses. Weiss, and Ginsberg, have now understood that expanding would mean Anfield requiring a larger footprint, which would mean acquiring dozens of houses and knocking them down. Not all residents, defiantly maintaining family life in a desperately run-down neighbourhood pockmarked by boarded-up terraces \u2013 some, historically, bought by Liverpool and left empty \u2013 will want to sell. There is also &quot;right to light&quot;, preventing a bigger stadium shutting out its neighbours&apos; light. Fenway and Liverpool have spent a year &quot;mapping&quot; both alternatives, and are finding the uncertainties, of potentially being stalled at Anfield, great. They seem somehow surprised that English planning laws protect neighbouring residents so firmly; in America, Weiss believes &quot;eminent domain&quot; laws would be more favourable to a top-level sports team, which local authorities are usually desperate to satisfy. &quot;Approvals are needed, and it is much more complicated,&quot; said Weiss. &quot;If all the problems of redeveloping Anfield could be made to go away, we could have a different discussion. But we started out thinking we could refurbish, now we think maybe it will have to be done the other way. But at the moment we don&apos;t have a path to Stanley Park.&quot; Fenway&apos;s multimillionaire partners do not intend to spend their own money building a stadium; they will borrow cash and ticket prices will inevitably rise to pay for it. Hence the search, so far unfulfilled, for a naming rights partner, whose sponsorship they hope would pay a substantial chunk of the building costs. &quot;I&apos;d like to tell you how it will play out,&quot; said Weiss, &quot;but I can&apos;t.&quot; It was, therefore, baffling that Werner last week stated publicly they would not consider a shared stadium, an obvious potential solution, because, he said, fans would not stand for it. With Everton, a mile across the park, also wanting a new ground, the income from two clubs&apos; matches and events, and any contribution Everton might make to the construction, could make the difference. Fenway have conducted no poll of fans, nor boldly set out any arguments for a shared stadium, but based this dismissal mostly on already-fixed opinions on fans websites. The new American owners, who saved a great club from the last American owners, have unquestionably lifted Liverpool&apos;s mood, spent partnership money to ballast the club, appointed Dalglish and sanctioned huge spending on players. But a year on it remains difficult to see quite how Liverpool are better off than in February 2007, before any takeover. Then the club had little debt and was heading to another final of the Champions League, which it won in 2005, but faced the same conundrum: how to finance a stadium. Henry, a disarming money man, softly-spoken, viewing the world through thick spectacles and a lifelong love of baseball, still &quot;rarely&quot; visits Liverpool, given his commitment to the Red Sox. Fenway bridge the Atlantic, he said, by delegating, to Ayre, Dalglish and Comolli, the running of Liverpool, and Fenway do not &quot;override football decisions&quot;. Henry knew &quot;virtually nothing&quot; about the world&apos;s most popular game before buying one of its greatest names, and he always said it would be a learning curve. He and his partners, dealing with the wreckage of a calamitous September collapse for the Red Sox, must hope buying Liverpool does not turn out to be a curveball.  \u2022\u00a0Read part one of David Conn&apos;s exclusive interview with John W Henry online"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/13/liam-fox-fresh-questions-over-sri-lanka", "sentences": ["In June 2010, he met the Sri Lankan foreign minister in Singapore, along with Werritty and MoD officials."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-13T20:13:27Z", "title": "Liam Fox faces fresh questions on Sri Lanka links", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "Sri Lanka", "Foreign policy", "Defence policy", "Ministry of Defence", "UK news", "World news", "Lobbying", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "     Liam Fox faced fresh accusations of running a shadow foreign policy after it emerged he was involved in setting up a private investment firm to operate in Sri Lanka in apparent contravention of UK government policy, with his controversial friend Adam Werritty as its key contact. The defence secretary was intimately involved in negotiations with the Sri Lankan regime as recently as last summer, according to Lord Bell, his friend of 30 years, agreeing a deal that allows the Sri Lankan Development Trust to operate in the country in the same period in which he now says he withdrew his involvement. The trust was a venture designed to rebuild the country&apos;s infrastructure using private finance with a sideline in charitable projects for Tamil communities. Labour urged the government to come clean on Fox&apos;s work in Sri Lanka and whether it might have contravened the government&apos;s official policy, while a senior Whitehall source said the minister had been operating a &quot;maverick foreign policy&quot; and it is this that will ultimately decide his political fate. The government has adopted an arm&apos;s-length policy on Sri Lanka, calling for an independent inquiry into alleged war crimes. Since 2006 it has also had a policy to limit development work to urgent humanitarian assistance and &quot;de-mining&quot; areas affected by the civil war. Fox told the Commons on Monday he had worked with &quot;a number&quot; of business, banking and political contacts to establish the trust in Sri Lanka. He named only Werritty, his close friend who is at the heart of the scandal over his unofficial role as Fox&apos;s adviser. &quot;Neither myself, Mr Werritty nor others sought to receive any share of the profits for assisting the trust,&quot; he said. In June 2010, he met the Sri Lankan foreign minister in Singapore, along with Werritty and MoD officials. &quot;The purpose of the meeting was to make it clear that although I would no longer be able to participate in the project, the others involved would continue to do so,&quot; he said on Monday. But Bell told the Guardian on Thursday that discussions took place last summer in which Fox agreed with the governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka that the trust would invest in roadbuilding and other infrastructure projects using private investment. Bell, whose PR firm Bell Pottinger was employed by the Sri Lankan government until last year to improve the country&apos;s reputation abroad, said the deal had been struck between Fox and the head of the Sri Lankan bank: &quot;In order for these funds to operate they would need an agreement with the country. The financial interests of Sri Lanka come under the governor of the Central Bank. My understanding is that the infrastructure development fund would be set up and have an agreement with the Sri Lankan government to invest in Tamil communities in Sri Lanka. It&apos;s a fine idea with a good sense of purpose.&quot; He added that &quot;of course&quot; part of the strategy was to improve the regime&apos;s reputation abroad. Kevan Jones, shadow defence minister, said: &quot;Liam Fox told the house about the trust on Monday. It&apos;s clearly not a full explanation. If he was still striking deals with the Sri Lankans last summer, how does that fit with official UK foreign policy? He has to explain these negotiations. You can&apos;t have a situation where a government minister is appearing to run a completely separate foreign policy from that of the government.&quot; Fox&apos;s parliamentary and private offices both said last night that Fox ceased to have any involvement with the trust on entering government. The only activity the Sri Lanka Development Trust appears to have engaged in has been the payment of up to \u00a37,500 of Fox&apos;s travel expenses, incurred on three trips to the country in 2009 and 2010. The trust was originally registered to an address close to the Houses of Parliament in London, 40 George Street, which is also the offices of 3G, the &quot;Good Governance Group&quot;, which is chaired by Chester Crocker, a former US politician. He also sits on the board of Bell Pottinger LLC, the US wing of Bell&apos;s publicity firm. Bell denied that there was any connection between his firm or its US subsidiary and Fox&apos;s Sri Lankan operation. The trust has since transferred to the Lothian Road in Edinburgh, giving its address as No 50, a substantial granite and glass-fronted office block where a number of firms including the HQ of the Scottish oil exploration firm Cairn Energy and corporate offices for Clydesdale Bank are based. When the Guardian visited the building there was no sign of any physical presence of the organisation. Two legal firms also based in the building are not believed to be connected. As a legal trust, it does not have to register either with the Charities Commission or on the register of businesses at Companies House. It does not have to publish the names of its trustees, it purpose or its beneficiaries. Bell said that the trust consisted of two bodies, the Sri Lanka Infrastructure Development Fund, which was intended to raise money abroad from investors who would then share in the profit of ventures on the country, and the Sri Lanka Charitable Fund which would undertake charitable projects in Tamil areas in the north and east. Inquiries in Colombo could not establish any activity the trust or its subsidiaries have so far carried out. Aid experts, senior politicians and officials in Sri Lanka said they had no knowledge of the trust. Nether the trust nor its subsidiaries are registered by the National Secretariat for Non-Governmental Organisations, a prerequisite for any such project. On a trip in March 2009, shortly before the end of the bloody but successful government offensive, Fox called for the creation of &quot;a special fund with the help of international partners ... to help the Sri Lankan government in handling the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the war ravaged areas in the north and east [of the country].&quot; Fox told local journalists he was suggesting &quot;a new, independent, Sri Lanka construction fund&quot;. One aim of the fund, he said, would be to divert cash that had been flowing from ethnic Tamils overseas to the LTTE into reconstruction. No activity on the ground appears to have occurred. &quot;I have my ear pretty close to the ground and I doubt a major new reconstruction project in the north [of Sri Lanka] could get going without my knowledge and I have never heard of this trust,&quot; said one senior aid official in Colombo, the commercial capital. The source of the trust&apos;s money for the transport to Sri Lanka for Fox is unknown. Contributions to the cost of the trips were also received from the Sri Lankan government via its London embassy. Human rights groups have been critical of Fox&apos;s outspoken support for the government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is now in his second term of office and has been accused by campaigners of repressing the press and opposition. WikiLeaks cables revealed American diplomats&apos; concerns at alleged government complicity in human rights abuses committed by troops and paramilitaries during the latter stages of the civil war. The United Nations has repeatedly pressed Sri Lanka for greater accountability and transparency.

It gives cause for reflection, and perhaps some optimism, as the only public tribute to thousands of men, women and children who survived captivity in Japanese prisoner of war camps with their notoriously callous regimes.  More than 37,500 military captives and over 2000 civilians returned to Britain, at least 20,000 of them seeing their friends and families for the first time at Pier Head during eight weeks when transport ships arrived between October and December in 1945. Many had taken their last step from the UK at the famous river frontage on the Mersey up to five years earlier. A score of them and their families, including several great-grandchildren, are expected to join local people on Saturday, 15 October, to celebrate the unveiling of the granite memorial which has been paid for by public subscription. The honour goes to Maurice Naylor CBE, 91, an ex-PoW from the 135th Field Regiment. The great-grandchildren of his former commanding officer, Lt Col Philip Toosey. Zach and Eliza Parsons who are nine and seven, will lay a wreath before a bugler sounds the Last Post. Naylor says:  It is 66 years since we arrived back in this great port of Liverpool to the sound of ships sirens and the cheers of multitudes of onlookers and well-wishers. There are not many of us left now and soon there will be none.  It is a memorial, too, to the girlfriends, spouses, parents and grandparents who had to put up with us and our idiosyncrasies. And we must remember those many thousands of our fellow prisoners who, sadly, died during their captivity in atrocious conditions. Their families continue to suffer too and their sacrifice should never be forgotten.  The ordeal of prisoners in the Far East was initially obscured by a focus on Europe and the horrors of the Holocaust. It has since been made famous by survivors who went on to success in spite of their treatment, including the writers J.G.Ballard and Laurens van der Post and the artist Ronald Searle. But others were too scarred to speak about the experience for years, and in many cases for ever. Research has been a gentle and patient affair which continues, including a long-term medical study by Liverpool&apos;s School of Tropical Medicine.     Ronald Searle survived; and so, famously, did his sense of humour.    More than 50,000 British Forces were captured between the fall of Hong Kong in December 1941, followed by Singapore in February 1942 and the Dutch East Indies a month later. A quarter died from brutal treatment or neglect including diseases left untreated. Victims included the celebrated Olympic runner Eric Liddell. Other figures from sport survived, among them the cricket commentator E W Swanton and1948 Olympics medal-winner &apos;Jumping&apos; Jim Halliday who weighed 38kg (six stone) when he returned to Pier Head. He and Swanton worked with Searle as slave labourers on the notorious Burma railway. Hermance van den Wall Bake, the mother of the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, is another survivor, interned in Indonesia where she was born. The plaque was the idea of the Researching Far East Prisoner of War History Group whose chair Meg Parkes, daughter of a prisoner held in Java and later Japan, says:   This memorial is significant because it pays tribute to the survivors of war, not to the war dead. For many of these men the struggle to survive simply continued once they were back home. For some that struggle proved too much, for others it continued for years - even for the rest of their lives. Their scars - mental, physical and emotional - stopped many of them talking about what they had been through - even with their own families. This silence cast a shadow over many homes. There was also a growing sense among ex-Far East prisoners of war that no one was interested or cared about the years of neglect and isolation they had suffered. The memorial also highlights the pivotal role of Liverpool and will, we hope, remind generations to come that survival from captivity does not always mean liberation; it lead to another war that has to be fought, and hopefully won.

After finishing a degree in philosophy at York, and an MPhil in criminology at Cambridge, she published Murder By Numbers, a true crime book, and next thing I knew \u2013 these surprises sneak up on one \u2013 she announced she&apos;d been hired as a tabloid reporter. She did it for five hard years, and published hundreds of pieces. She spent weeks covering the trial of the polymurderous Dr Shipman, the murders of those two poor schoolgirls Holly and Jessica in Cambridgeshire, and the case of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, abducted and killed by a local paedophile. It was a horrific beat, and she was good at it. So good, that her newspaper asked her if she would ghost a book with Sara Payne, Sarah&apos;s mother. She was given four months leave, and met an editor at Hodder to discuss the details. &quot;Could you do 100,000 words in four months?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; The editor got out her diary. &quot;That would make it due October 8th, is that right?&quot; Anna got out hers. &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s right. Do you want it in the morning or the afternoon?&quot; The editor looked at her incredulously. &quot;You can do that?&quot; &quot;Look,&quot; said Anna dismissively, &quot;I&apos;m not a writer, I&apos;m a journalist. I&apos;ll put it down for 9am.&quot; She delivered it on time, and it was remarkably well written, totally convincing, rather moving really. It sold very well. When she told me the story, I asked what she meant by saying she was not a writer? She&apos;d written one book already, published tons of articles, and would certainly be writing others. &quot;It&apos;s just a job of work,&quot; she said. &quot;There&apos;s no art in it, no imagination or creativity, and no fuss. Writers always make a fuss.&quot; This was modest of her, and fair, and made a useful distinction. But it led me to wonder what a writer is, and under what conditions someone might rightly be described as &quot;a writer&quot;. (It won&apos;t help to consult your dictionary, which will only reflect the range of misuse, of the term). You will sense something personal coming. It first hit me a few years ago, after I published Tolkien&apos;s Gown, which was my fourth book, though only my second written in &quot;my own voice&quot;. It got some attention. I went to a few literary festivals, talked on the radio, and forgot for a time that I made my living as a rare book dealer, until my bank manager informed me that I was in danger of ceasing to do so. I promptly got back to (real) work, but also started another book, and fiddled with it intermittently for the next couple of years (it eventually came out as Outside of a Dog). During this period I travelled a lot, as Belinda and I had built a house in New Zealand. We went there at least once a year, stopping off on the way home at various enticing spots (Samoa, the Cook Islands, Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong) in which I frequently had to fill out one of those immigration forms that asks your occupation. I normally put &quot;Book Dealer&quot;, but one day I found myself, rather bashfully, putting down &quot;Writer.&quot; I didn&apos;t tell Belinda. The immigration officer didn&apos;t even look at it, to my slight regret (I was ready to tell him what sort of books I write) but it looked great to me. I never did it again, though I still get tempted. Because, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me, I am not at all sure that I am a writer. I have published five books, have two unpublished manuscripts of novels, and am contracted to write two more books over the next three years. When do I get to be a writer? And if all of that doesn&apos;t qualify, what does? Curiously, having a vocation or profession seems to disqualify you, even if you write a lot of books. A well-known lepidopterist, professor of medieval history, or philosopher of science may have a bibliography as long as your arm, but none of them gets called a writer, though they may write very well. So, to be called a writer do you have to be a sort of amateur, not a specialist on something or other? To be without a default topic? That won&apos;t do it though. If it is necessary it certainly isn&apos;t sufficient. You will all know the sort of local person, earnest and both well-meaning and well-intentioned, who goes to evening classes and then paints a lot and produces canvases that fill the garden shed? Or their neighbour, who fills notebooks with verse? When asked, such person will often say, proudly, that they are &quot;a painter&quot;, or &quot;a poet&quot;. And they most obviously are not. Why not? It can&apos;t be a matter of exhibiting and publishing, because (a) sometimes they do, and (b) real poets and painters sometimes don&apos;t. Think of Hopkins, or Van Gogh. There is something honorific in the appellation, then? You get rightly called a poet or painter in recognition of genuine quality? But this doesn&apos;t quite work either. There are bad writers and bad painters (Jeffrey Archer, Jack Vettriano) who still deserve the classification. Nor can it be a matter of simply being dedicated, and spending most of your time in creative activity. You can be a writer, indeed a great writer, while doing a full-time job which takes more time than you spend on literary composition. Think of Trollope, Matthew Arnold, Wallace Stevens, TS Eliot. Part-time writers, if that doesn&apos;t sound dismissive. I&apos;d like to think of myself like that. Uncertain, though, I took my editor aside at a party, and whispered to him conspiratorially. &quot;My dear, I am rather confused.&quot; He looked interested, having suspected this for some time. &quot;I no longer know how to describe myself. Am I a writer?&quot; He was shocked. &quot;Certainly not,&quot; he said. &quot;You are a rare book dealer who also writes books sometimes.&quot; &quot;Yeah, but you just think writers are creative writers.&quot; Bloody novelists. &quot;Not at all,&quot; he said, &quot;surely Alain de Botton is a writer, isn&apos;t he?&quot; Bloody Alain de Botton. &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;why do I get invited to lots of writers&apos; festivals then?&quot; &quot;Can I be frank?&quot; he asked. &quot;Because they want you to tell all your stories about meeting Graham Greene, and getting sued by JD Salinger, and being rude to Harold Pinter\u2026 and when you start talking about Wittgenstein and DH Lawrence and the formative effects of reading, they keep hoping for another anecdote to pop up\u2026&quot; This had all the dreadful virtues of truth. Why does this matter so much to me? The answer is simple. Being a writer seems to me a better thing than being a book dealer. After Philip Larkin died, Monica Jones had a simple headstone carved, which gave his name and dates, underneath which it simply says &quot;Writer&quot;. That seems to me elegant, and moving, and a perfect summing up of an important career, even if I&apos;m still not certain, quite, what &quot;a writer&quot; is."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/oct/14/3", "sentences": ["Mystery Bird photographed in the Republic of Singapore, a southeast Asian city-state off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-14T15:30:00Z", "title": "Today's mystery bird for you to identify | @GrrlScientist | Punctuated Equilibrium", "tags": ["Science", "Zoology", "Birds", "Wildlife", "Animals"], "article": "Mystery Bird photographed in the Republic of Singapore, a southeast Asian city-state off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula.

Wait to identify the bird until 24 to 36 hours after it&apos;s been published.2. If you know the bird&apos;s identity, provide subtle hints to let others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful as small clues to less experienced players. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones.4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game: 1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too).2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all.4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? What might be the function of those funny-looking &quot;horns&quot; on this bird&apos;s head? Response: This is a Malay eagle-owl, Bubo sumatranus, a resident of moist lowland forests throughout the south Pacific: Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and the Cocos Islands.  This large owl is placed in the taxonomic family, Strigidae. Originally, only owls with ear-tufts or &quot;horns&quot; were included in the genus, Bubo, but that is no longer the case. Interestingly, Bubo species are found in North and South America (&quot;horned&quot; owls) and in the Old World (&quot;eagle-owls&quot;). However, mtDNA sequence data shows that the snowy owl another eagle-owl species that has adapted to Arctic conditions, so it now considered to be a &quot;hornless&quot; Bubo.  mtDNA data also show that the four fish-owls (Ketupa) should also be placed in Bubo, too. But if that is done, then Bubo become a bit of a mess -- a mess that is resolved by removing the Scotopelia fishing owls into Bubo, too. Well, at that point, you&apos;ve got dozens of owls species crammed into Bubo -- is this really proper? Further, if you&apos;ve been paying attention to the topology of the phylogenetic trees, then you&apos;ll know that the new and expanded Bubo looks like it has two distinct clades in it -- based on the species we&apos;ve looked at! Of course, there are some eagle-owls that no one has looked at yet, so adding them to the analyses could really change things.  Anyway, all that said, I did ask you what those &quot;horns&quot; on owls&apos; heads are all about and really, no one seems to know the answer to this question. We do know they are not ears, nor are they horns: they&apos;re actually feather tufts, more properly known as plumicorns. But what is their function? To break up the birds&apos; outlines? Mate selection? To frighten enemies? To channel sound waves to their real ears (down lower)? Considering that this character is preserved in many owl Bubo species, there must be a good reason for it and that reason must be consistent with owl lifestyles.

Our destination was a sliver of white sand with a topknot of pines. Beaching the kayaks, we found four outriggers and some lads sitting round a campfire. They showed off their catch of red emperor and coral trout. It was a feast fit for a queen, appropriate as it was the Queen&apos;s birthday, a public holiday in this remote corner of the former British Empire, Papua New Guinea&apos;s New Ireland province. Today, its only tourists are a few adventurous surfers, divers and fishermen. But 100 years or more ago, it was a destination for missionaries, who decided to share their beliefs with the easygoing locals, who obligingly incorporated Christianity into their Malagan culture, with its carved masks and elaborate funerals. I was there with my husband and three teenage daughters exploring a group of coral atolls off the main island of New Ireland. Our 25-mile kayaking trip was a new offering from Australian-owned No Roads Expeditions. Working with the local tourist board, PNG Tourism, No Roads provided each village on the itinerary with a new water tank, and pays them for food and entertainment. Three local trainee guides, Gabriel, Allan and Lapin, had come along to learn the ropes. We flew to Port Moresby, PNG&apos;s capital, and on to Kavieng, a crumbling copra port on New Ireland. But this just made Nusa Island Retreat, a pretty eco resort five minutes away by boat, with beach bungalows and a bar on the sand, all the more perfect. Next day we paddled across water in more shades of blue than Eskimos have words for snow to Enuk, five miles to the south. Under a palm-frond shelter the village women presented a lunch of parrotfish, fried plantains and rice. The menfolk watched from the shade, machetes at their sides. A few more miles of paddling took us to Kabotteron. While the crew set up our tents my oldest daughter Alice and I swapped our plastic kayaks for a dugout, carved from a tree trunk. We soon tipped into the water, to a chorus of giggles. There was no running water, so we doused ourselves with buckets; a freshly dug pit toilet was beautifully screened with pandana leaves. This set the pattern for the trip: we&apos;d paddle morning and afternoon with stops for snorkelling around reefs. On Kulinos our sleeping quarters were on the veranda of the minister&apos;s house. It was Sunday and a large wooden drum called everyone to the mint-green, dirt-floored Seventh Day Adventist church. The minister, Sion Sionakis, welcomed us in English as honoured guests: &quot;For some people it is the first time they have seen white people, and we are very glad.&quot; That evening, young men with white-painted torsos performed a traditional sing-sing to drums and guitars and children chanted stories about fishing. Next morning, we attempted our own hastily practised farewell song, a paltry but heartfelt tribute to their hospitality. Lapin was dying to show us his home, Nusakelo. &quot;I love my island \u2013 the beach, the orchard and vegetable garden, the reef,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;Can you believe an American found Nusakelo on Google Maps and tried to buy it for $70,000? We said no, because we want to keep it the way it is.&quot; On Laminlagit, we held outrigger races with village teenagers then feasted on watermelon, damper and mud crabs. Our daughter Julia found a guitar and sang to adoring children as fireflies pricked the darkness. At our final destination, Tsoilik, at the tip of the island chain, a pretty guest house offered real beds, a solar shower and flushing toilets. These were unexpected treats, but nothing to the thrill of racing hermit crab with the local kids as dusk fell and spear fishermen on outriggers were silhouetted against a flaming sky. \u2022 Qantas (qantas.com.au) flies from Heathrow to Singapore from \u00a3568 return.

However, these species have a behaviour that sets them apart. What is that behaviour? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is an adult Pacific swallow, Hirundo tahitica. This passerine is placed into the taxonomic family, Hirundinidae, the swallows and martins. These birds are adapted to catching insects in flight, making them similar to another group of aerial insectivores, the swifts. However, unlike swifts, swallows often perch and wait for individual insects to pursue and capture instead of flying around with their mouths wide open. Further, swallows feed very low in the air column, often engage in aerial acrobatics, and they also can perch -- all behaviours that the swifts lack. Interestingly, even though Pacific swallows hunt alongside barn swallows, H. rustica, but they don&apos;t associate with them otherwise. These two species can be distinguished by the barn swallow&apos;s blue breast band and by its much longer outer tail &quot;streamers&quot;, which the Pacific swallow lacks. The Pacific swallow is even more similar to the welcome swallow, H. neoxena, which is found in Australia. These two species are sometimes considered to be conspecific (or sister species). These two taxa are distinguished by the Pacific swallow&apos;s white underparts and by its longer outer tail &quot;streamers&quot; which the welcome swallow lacks. (For more information regarding how to distinguish these three species, refer to Collins Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand, Hawaii, Central and West Pacific by Ber van Perlo [Amazon UK; Amazon US]).  Unlike their migratory relatives, Pacific swallows are resident.

The Education Endowment Foundation has set itself the clear goal of addressing that question. Its first conference was attended by around 300 teachers and educationists wanting to join in. You could describe the Education Endowment Foundation as running a huge scientific experiment. Projects will be tested by independent academic researchers for whether they work, their cost and whether they can be replicated in other schools. At the heart of these trials are the 165,000 children eligible for free school meals at the 1,600 English schools which fall below government floor standards in national tests and exams. Most of these are urban primaries and one of the first speakers, Ian Walsh of management consultants, the Boston Consulting Group, shared the findings of a project to identify other characteristics of &quot;the poorest children in the most challenging schools.&quot; Many teachers will recognise the factors on the list. They include: area deprivation, material poverty, disruptive homes, low parental education, aspiration and engagement, a failure to attract good teachers, poor leadership and teaching practices. Amongst the pupils there is low literacy, a high level of special needs and little pupil engagement and aspiration. So what might move these children towards higher achievement and greater success? The Foundation is interested in innovation, but EEF Chairman, Sir Peter Lampl also emphasised the focus on results, &quot;An idea doesn&apos;t have to be &apos;bold&apos;; it can appear mundane. What counts is could it work?&quot; The Department for Education has given the Foundation \u00a3125 million. With investment returns and fundraising it hopes to award at least \u00a3200 million over the next fifteen years. Four projects have already been picked. The largest grant, \u00a3760,000, goes to a maths scheme where teachers use pupils aged 10 or 11 to tutor younger pupils aged eight and nine. Research by the project leaders, Durham University, has already suggested peer tutoring can boost attainment. This pilot will run in 80 schools where teachers will be trained in the method. Another approach to teaching maths, &quot;Mathematics Mastery&quot; from Singapore is receiving \u00a3600,000 over the next four years. That will be run by the Academies sponsor, Ark Schools, in at least 50 disadvantaged primary and secondary schools. In Manchester, university students and recent graduates will provide tutoring to help pupils approaching their Maths and English GCSEs. A new charity, the Tutor Trust, will receive \u00a3600,000 towards delivering the programme in schools in poor areas. If successful, the scheme will be rolled out to other university towns and cities. A fourth grant will go to a UK organisation to partner a US charity, Building Educated Leaders for Life. BELL runs summer camps in deprived districts in the States. Its classes in literacy, maths, music and sport aim to boost the results of poorer pupils. In particular, research suggests it can prevent learning loss which might occur over the summer break. While these projects give a flavour for what has caught the Foundation&apos;s attention so far, there is scope for pitching different ideas in future. For example, what school would not want to develop effective ways of encouraging parental education, engagement and aspiration? What ideas might there be for addressing the high levels of special needs amongst these pupils? How can poor teaching and weak leadership be improved? Is there a role for projects involving approaches outside of education \u2013 experts in physical and mental health, mentoring or providing role models, for example? The EEF intends to award grants three times a year. In time, as projects are evaluated they will be presented to schools in the form of a &quot;toolkit to improve learning&quot;. Steve Higgins, Professor of Education at Durham University has already compiled one toolkit to help schools spend the pupil premium wisely and which summarises some of the existing evidence on raising standards. Click here to read it. Many of its conclusions are fascinating and counter intuitive, for example, it suggests school uniform, classroom assistants and ability grouping tend to have a very low impact on raising pupil attainment. Giving effective feedback comes top of the list as delivering a very high impact for low cost. But one message was repeated throughout this conference and encapsulated in this paraphrase of H L Mencken&apos;s quotation, &quot;For every complex problem there is a solution that is simple, neat... and wrong.&quot; And as Sir Peter Lampl concluded, &quot;We don&apos;t know enough about what works; we do know there are no silver bullets.&quot; Perhaps, though for teachers with bright ideas the EEF might present some golden opportunities.

Successful schools are key to forging a fairer, more equal society. As Ed Miliband&apos;s new shadow education secretary, I will shift the debate to what happens in the classroom \u2013 this is what parents care about. But the discussion this week about Labour&apos;s view on free schools reflects a media obsession with &quot;U-turns&quot;. So a comment I made that Labour would not oppose every single free school, suddenly became a wholesale endorsement of the government&apos;s policy. Let me set out our position clearly. If Labour were in government, we would not have chosen this path. Our academies programme was focused on raising attainment in some of the toughest neighbourhoods in Britain. Our ethos was that excellence should not be the preserve of the elite. By contrast, there are major problems with this government&apos;s free-schools policy. Funding comes from the existing schools budget, so new free schools are built with money taken directly from the other 99% \u2013 at a time when capital spending is being cut by 60%. There is no account of how free schools will respond to local demand, or join up with existing schools. And the policy risks distracting from the hard work of improving the vast majority of schools, which should be at the top of Michael Gove&apos;s priorities. That is why we oppose the policy and why we say it isn&apos;t the answer to our education system&apos;s needs. Labour showed in government that we welcome innovation and greater involvement from outside organisations. They were at the heart of Labour&apos;s academies programme to turn around underperforming schools. We wouldn&apos;t now be involving them through the free-schools programme, but we would be seeking to involve them. But let me say equally clearly: where a free school is closing the attainment gap between children from rich and poor backgrounds, extending opportunities, and is based on a fair admissions policy and local demand, it should be able to carry on. Unlike Gove, we will not allow the opening of 24 new free schools to distract us from the 24,000 other schools in England. As shadow education secretary I will engage in a thorough policy review. I welcome Neal Lawson and Ken Spour&apos;s contribution to this important debate, which appeared on these pages on Monday. Parents know that the real difference to their child getting ahead is not what is painted on the sign outside the school, but what happens inside the classroom. That is why Labour will focus on the &quot;teacher effect&quot;. The truth is, outstanding teachers are found in all sorts of different schools. So instead of Gove&apos;s outdated obsession with structures, Labour will put the classroom at the heart of our approach. Over the coming months, we will develop creative ideas to raise the status of teaching as a profession, so it is valued in the way it is in Finland, Japan or Singapore. We also need to focus on existing teachers as well as new entrants, with better support for professional development, peer review and continual assessment. Finally, we must link our educational challenge to our jobs crisis. Labour will ensure we equip those who want to take vocational subjects with the kind of skills that modern manufacturing and engineering businesses need. But succeeding in a competitive job market is not just about passing exams but also about having self-confidence and being articulate. We want to support teachers, so they can give young people the confidence to succeed. Above all, we need a sense of mission in education; a relentless focus on teaching quality so that all our schools inspire the confidence of young people and parents.

The new rules limit the number of dependents students can bring with them, curb their work entitlements during study, reduce their ability to stay on after they graduate and require them to demonstrate a proficiency in English on arrival. They also impose stringent new conditions upon organisations seeking to gain &quot;highly trusted&quot; sponsor status. Despite the fact that the international student market is estimated to be worth \u00a340bn to the UK economy, these measures are aiming to reduce the numbers of foreign students coming into the country each year by up to 80,000 (or 25%). The madness of this policy in a time of austerity has been highlighted by Nick Jordan among others, and protests from within the sector have been vociferous. But for private colleges, at least, there has been little consolation. Up to a third of them look likely to cease recruitment, with others predicted to close. Universities, on the other had, have counted themselves more fortunate. Their students will continue to be allowed to work during their studies and to bring their families. And although the Post Study Work Visa (PSW) has been abolished for everyone, those who gain an offer of a skilled job from a sponsoring employer will be eligible to switch to a Tier 2 visa. Yet the impact the changes will have on university recruitment is not yet known. Those international students who began classes this month applied before the July changes were announced, and recruitment for next academic year is only now under way. However, accounts from academics who have just returned from visiting recruiting agents in India suggest that universities should not be complacent. They report that interest among Indian students in UK degrees has fallen by anywhere between 25 to 40%. Though the figures vary, the reason students give for the change in their preference is clear: the disappearance of the Post Study Work Visa. Without it they feel they are unable to get the foreign experience that is important for career advancement and unable to earn money in a currency that will enable them to pay back the loans that supported their studies in the first place. It is not just the knock-on effects of the closure of private colleges that should worry British universities. Based on these reports, their own recruitment also looks likely to be affected. When applications from international students dropped off in the wake of Australia&apos;s tightening of its student visa procedures, its government was sufficiently worried to commission a review into the whole student visa system. Acknowledging that the decline in student numbers was &quot;causing serious problems for the viability of the sector&quot;, the review recommended a significant relaxation of the application process and the introduction of post-study work permits. With these recommendations recently adopted by the Australian government, its approach to international students is set to move in the opposite direction to Britain&apos;s. It is perhaps not surprising then, to learn that it is in Australia \u2013 along with Canada, New Zealand and Singapore \u2013 that the recruiting agents say Indian students are now expressing the strongest interest.

Here are some of our favourites \u2026 bartonmb on Foreign Affairs   Tom Waits&apos;s fifth LP, 1977&apos;s Foreign Affairs, may just be the most criminally underrated of his career. As sharp and striking as a film noir, and as gripping as a crime novel, it&apos;s arguably the best place to hear the tales of the late-night world Waits inhabited and wrote about in the &apos;70s. It finds him at the peak of his Beat-inspired era; common wisdom is that this album&apos;s predecessor Small Change (1976) is the finest example of Waits&apos; beatnik boho wino persona, but Foreign Affairs has a unique atmosphere all its own and one that is ultimately more alluring.&quot;Muriel&quot; and &quot;Burma Shave&quot; are superb noir ballads, while &quot;Potter&apos;s Field&quot; is the creme de la creme of the Tom Waits Beat phase. There are engaging pop melodies (&quot;A Sight for Sore Eyes&quot;) and successful forays into lounge-jazz (&quot;I Never Talk to Strangers&quot;) amid the funky, spare R&amp;B infusions (&quot;Jack &amp; Neal,&quot; &quot;Barber Shop&quot;) and romantic travelogues (&quot;Foreign Affair.&quot;) It never feels like Waits is playing at his persona here; it all feels real and alive somehow. Conceived as the musical equivalent of a &quot;black-and-white movie,&quot; Foreign Affairs more than delivers on its promise and, more than any other Tom Waits record, demands (re)-investigation.  StephanoBentos on Rain Dogs   I love this album for three reasons. Firstly the songs. Whomever was singing them it would be churlish to argue with the quality of song writing on Rain Dogs. These are anthems for the ages.Secondly there&apos;s the sounds. From the voices Tom spews the songs out in to the bizarre percussion and filthy sounding guitars. There are jam jars where there should be cymbals and muddy fuzz where there should be chords.Thirdly there&apos;s what this record did for me personally. I discovered Tom&apos;s music in the last year of my 20&apos;s. A life long music fan at this point I&apos;d lost my way. I hadn&apos;t loved a new sound for some years. I took a punt on a 3 CD&apos;s for \u00a310 bargain bin. Tom&apos;s Used Songs compilation had piqued my interest a few months earlier but nothing prepared me for Singapore. &quot;From now on boys, this iron boat&apos;s your home&quot;, The music was something I couldn&apos;t categorize. The lyrics were genius and the voice... That voice.  Lozcoll on Rain Dogs   The rum soaked tales which make up Rain Dogs&apos; drunken ditties take the listener on a voyage over the high seas and into the seedy underbelly of downtown New York. Off beat rhymes and out of key rhythms serve for an uncomfortable delight. Waits offers an astounding record for musicians and poets alike, to discuss and revel in for years to come.The diversity and kaleidoscopic nature of Waits&apos; musical back catalogue make him the unsung hero of experimental jazz. Rain Dogs, for me, exists as one of the most brilliantly bizarre snippets of music to emerge from the last thirty years. As subtle as it is brash, it will remain a firm favourite in my musical collection, for ever more. Beautifully crafted and eerily atmospheric, the characterisation provides a poetic quality, matched by no other artist. Who knew such a diamond could come from the rough?  paddymc123 on the Black Rider   I have loved saws since I first heard &apos;The Black Rider&apos;. Saws have never been used to better effect on any album and although &apos;Bone Machine&apos; was the one the harnessed the mad percussion, there is nothing as insane as that moment in &apos;Just the Right Bullets&apos; where it sounds like empty skulls are lined up like a xylophone and hit with lightening nimble speed while a guitar knocks out the best spaghetti western line since Morricone.Bells toll. Accordions are played. So too are pianos. I don&apos;t think they have ever been used to the same eerie effect on any of his albums before or since. Banjos and cellos compete for attention in the same musical space. It&apos;s the sound. The stomping boots and violias on &apos;Russian Dance&apos; which sounds one hundred years old and completely vibrant. Crows caw as they fly through the Interludes and you can feel their damp shiny wings brush your cheek as they perch on your shoulder. All you can see are grey skies \u2013 a death shroud thrown across the sun.Is it bleak? I don&apos;t think so. It&apos;s a woodland tale lost in a mist. It&apos;s the stories of characters adrift in a different realm. Some people sum this album up as the story of a young lad who sells his soul for a good aim which is fine and dandy but it&apos;s what&apos;s going around him is where the real beauty of this record lies.  Honess10 on Nighthawks at the Diner   Lyrically, Nighthawks is one of the best albums. It encapsulates everything that makes Waits Waits. Storyteller. Drawler. Bopper. Tour guide. Joker. Observer of the unobserved. The 1975 album takes us on a colourful sunset-to-sunrise trip through the Los Angeles streets. Streets that people never see through their blurry eyes &amp; smoked-glass windows.Waits set up a nightclub in the studio, invited an audience and cut out a 70-minute, two-LP set of newly penned tracks. And the result is a live album that bucks the trend. You&apos;re not left &apos;wishing&apos; you were there, but thinking you are. His lines, rich and expertly crafted, show a vivid detail you&apos;d usually associate with a stand-up comedian, not a down and out beat jazz musician.It&apos;s an album that strips Waits down, focusing on him as a person. Most tracks are essentially poetry recitations with a jazz backing. Together, you&apos;re transported to an entirely different world.

Anti-capitalist campaigners from the Occupy movement are camped out at St Paul&apos;s in the heart of Bear&apos;s parish \u2013 copying similar demonstrations in New York, Melbourne and Hong Kong. Given the state of the economy and ongoing euro crisis, haven&apos;t the protestors got a point? Bear says: &quot;On one level, yes. I think we have probably failed to communicate what the City actually does. The City isn&apos;t only about banks, we have 16,000 small and medium sized businesses; the City deals with maritime, insurance and professional services; so you see it&apos;s not just a collection of very large, amorphous banks.&quot; Bear says the City is doing to its bit to reverse Britain&apos;s economic fortunes. &quot;We have one priority: going forward, and that means growth and jobs. So while we are being sniped at all around, we have to move ahead. I have taken 23 delegations around the world to 40 cities, generating new export business \u2013 because that&apos;s the way out of here. &quot;Take the Indians; they need to raise a trillion dollars to develop their infrastructure. So we are looking at how to help them raise cash via a rupee bond, traded through London, because we are the leaders in that kind of thing. &quot;We have connected British engineers, designers and architects with decision makers in Delhi.&quot; Bear hates the idea he is viewed as cheerleader for the banking industry and champion of the wealthy elite. Retrenchment &quot;My job is to protect the competitiveness of the City of London, we are 10% of GDP, we pay \u00a354bn to the exchequer in tax; people don&apos;t realise that what we export covers half our balance of trade. &quot;We are selling man hours as well as financial products. London is at the epicentre of the financial services industry; it&apos;s not all about banking, we provide a range of services that include accountancy, insurance, legal advice, management consultancy, design and engineering.&quot; But would Bear agree capitalism is almost inevitably going to be viewed as more unfair at a time of retrenchment and high unemployment? Does he understand the anger? &quot;I think there is anger because there aren&apos;t enough jobs to go round. Jobs come from growth, to get growth we need trade and we need finance.&quot; As for the protesters, in some ways, they baffle him. &quot;If there was a banner at St Paul&apos;s calling for jobs, that would be different, when it&apos;s &apos;anti-this, anti-that,&apos; it&apos;s more difficult to get a handle on how to respond. Because in a market economy, which is what we are, you need to have banks, the economy is an engine that needs oil, and the oil is finance, well-regulated finance, but it has to be connected to the real economy, and I think people don&apos;t understand the connection and we haven&apos;t explained it very well.&quot; Asked whether abandoning the higher rate 50% tax rate introduced by Labour which he and many Tory politicians want scrappedwould send out the wrong signal during an era of austerity, he replies: &quot;It&apos;s big leap from 40% to 50%. And we have to ask what is the purpose? Is it to punish (the wealthy) or to raise money? &quot;I haven&apos;t seem compelling evidence that it will raise the sort of money that people thought it would raise. But I have heard a lot of people saying that at 50% it is worth moving somewhere else \u2013 Switzerland of Singapore, for example. &quot;What we need is people to pay tax. If fewer people work here, there will be less business activity \u2026 so the higher tax rate may have unintended consequences. So far, I haven&apos;t heard an argument that it will do anything other than punish.&quot; Performance Bear was born in Nairobi, Kenya in 1953 where his father was working for Britain&apos;s colonial service. He was educated at Clifton public school in Bristol and studied civil engineering at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa. Before he became lord mayor, nearly a year ago, he was regeneration director at Hammerson, the property company. As head of the Spitalfields Development Group, he oversaw the regeneration of Spitalfields and the development of the Bishops Square complex. He has a wide range of interests outside work which include trekking, scuba diving and supporting Arsenal football club. Bear can understand why people get exercised over bumper pay awards to bankers. &quot;I admit the numbers look big, but bonuses have been refocused on long-term wealth creation, its not about short-termism any more \u2013 that&apos;s what went wrong in the run up to the financial crisis. The emphasis now is on long-term performance, so we have learnt some lessons. Banking is an industry that has historically paid low salaries and high bonuses, but we have reversed that trend.&quot; Does Bear agree banks need to be safer and more boring to re-establish public trust? &quot;Yes we have to re-establish trust, ethics, probity; there was a lack of trust in what the City does. And how it operates, which I think is misguided in a lot of ways, I am looking at an initiative on that \u2026 anyone working across a wide range of industries should have accreditation in business ethics, its&apos; a reminder of what is important, my word is my bond, and all of that. So I am agreeing with you there is a lack of trust, we have to reestablish that.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/22/eu-bailout-funds-asia-gulf", "sentences": ["The idea, according to sources, would be to attract further money from official and private investors, with the sovereign wealth funds of countries such as China, Singapore or Qatar a prime target."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-22T12:23:40Z", "title": "EU could source bailout funds from Asia and the Gulf", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "European Union", "Euro", "Currencies", "European banks", "Economics", "Business", "Euro", "Greece", "Italy", "France", "Germany", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "Angela Merkel", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "The EU could tap sovereign wealth funds from Asia and the Gulf in order to boost the financial clout of its main vehicle to bailout eurozone countries suffering debt distress and prevent contagion spreading, it is understood.

The idea, according to sources, would be to attract further money from official and private investors, with the sovereign wealth funds of countries such as China, Singapore or Qatar a prime target. Some of these already invest in European banks such as Barclays and UBS. The only other option now being discussed is to turn the EFSF into an insurer that would offer to insure the first, perhaps 20%, of losses on new government debt held by private creditors such as banks. These creditors are now locked in negotiations with senior eurozone officials over the scale of the losses they will have to suffer because of Greece&apos;s deteriorating debts.

Ahead of a Commons vote on Monday that is likely to see the biggest revolt of Cameron&apos;s premiership so far, with up to 60 MPs defying the whip, Downing Street struck a defiant note, insisting that the prime minister would not give an inch to the rebels. &quot;We have to have a fight on these issues some time and there is no time like the present,&quot; said a senior official. &quot;People have to sober up. Having a referendum on membership is not our policy.&quot; In a high-risk move that could inflame sentiment in the party even further, the prime minister will stick by his insistence on a three-line whip, effectively ordering MPs to reject the referendum motion. Downing Street said the prime minister would take a &quot;dim view&quot; of those who defied him, and indicated they could say goodbye to chances of promotion. As Tory MPs voiced their disgust at the stance, former Tory leadership contender and ex-minister for Europe David Davis suggested the government was fighting shy of a referendum because it fears the British public would vote to leave the EU or drastically change the terms of membership. In a message to Cameron and his ministers, Davis said: &quot;Do not refuse the people their right to answer the question just because you&apos;re afraid of what the answer could be.&quot; Another senior MP, the Tory chairman of the public administration committee, Bernard Jenkin, said that if Cameron did not lift the three-line whip, the Conservative party would become &quot;irrelevant in the eyes of voters&quot;, many of whom were deeply concerned about the EU and wanted a say. In a further development that will fuel the Eurosceptic fire, one of the most vocal proponents of the European single currency, Lord Turner, admits he was incorrect to propose that the UK should have joined the euro at the start of the last decade. &quot;I got it wrong,&quot; Turner tells the Observer in an interview. Turner, who is now chairman of the Financial Services Authority, led a vociferous campaign for the UK to join the euro while he led the employers&apos; body, the CBI, during the late 1990s \u2013 and in 2002, when at City firm Merrill Lynch, he co-authored a seminal paper on &quot;Why Britain should join the euro&quot;. Downing Street said the prime minister was very sympathetic to the wider Eurosceptic cause and would fight for powers to be repatriated if and when a new treaty was negotiated. But, with the eurozone in crisis, the UK had to play its part now in sorting out the mess, rather than being distracted by a referendum. Nick Clegg, who has been demanding that EU leaders concentrate on long-term growth and competitiveness, said talk of a referendum was a &quot;dangerous form of displacement activity&quot;. Clegg said: &quot;I think we have to deal with the emergency on our doorstep, rather than tilting at windmills.&quot; As the chancellor, George Osborne, joined fellow finance ministers in Brussels, it emerged that the EU could tap sovereign wealth funds from Asia and the Gulf in order to boost its financial firepower to bail out countries suffering debt distress in an attempt to prevent the contagion spreading. Finance ministers from the 17 eurozone countries are discussing the option of creating a &quot;special purpose vehicle&quot; for the European financial stability facility (EFSF) to boost its current \u20ac440bn (\u00a3383bn) lending capacity. This emerged as finance ministers from all 27 EU countries approved in principle plans to recapitalise some of Europe&apos;s most important banks with around \u20ac90bn, so that they can withstand contagion from potential debt problems in other eurozone countries. Banks are also being told they face losses, or &quot;haircuts&quot;, of at least 40% on their exposure to Greek debt, according to ministers. Osborne said that &quot;real progress&quot; had been made during 10 hours of talks. &quot;We have come up with important decisions to strengthen European banks,&quot; the chancellor added. &quot;Britain will keep up pressure in the next few days to a comprehensive package to resolve the European crisis and to make sure that we get jobs and growth.&quot; Senior EU officials have been dispatched to speed up negotiations with holders of sovereign bonds. But one source cautioned: &quot;Nothing has been agreed until everything has been agreed.&quot; Desperate EU leaders are trying to stitch together a &quot;comprehensive and ambitious&quot; deal to solve the sovereign debt crisis over the next few days, starting with an EU summit, at which David Cameron will be present, and then a eurozone summit. A deal is due to be sealed at a second eurozone summit on Wednesday, but rumours have swept Brussels that yet another summit, possibly extended to non-euro countries such as Britain, could also be called. The idea of creating a special purpose vehicle for the EFSF, according to sources, would be to attract further money from both official and private investors, with the sovereign wealth funds of countries such as China, Singapore or Qatar a prime target. Some of these already invest in European banks such as Barclays and UBS. Qatar has already invested in distressed Greek banks and is thought to be looking at other devalued European assets. Its premier, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, said of EU efforts to solve the crisis: &quot;If there is nothing positive then we will find a very difficult situation, not only in Europe but in the world, that would take a decade to fix.&quot; Downing Street officials said Cameron, who will attend a meeting of EU heads of government in Brussels on Sunday, might cut short a visit this week to New Zealand and Australia, where he is due to attend the Commonwealth heads of government conference, if a further, full EU summit of all 27 nations is called."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/22/bill-beaumont-international-rugby-board", "sentences": ["Bill Beaumont, the former England captain, will resume his battle to wrest the chairmanship of the International Rugby Board from Bernard Lapasset in Singapore in December, after the vote was deferred in an acrimonious meeting that may prompt a change to the way the sport is run."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-22T21:00:01Z", "title": "Bill Beaumont on ropes as IRB vote descends into Fifa-style farce", "tags": ["Rugby union", "Sport"], "article": "Bill Beaumont, the former England captain, will resume his battle to wrest the chairmanship of the International Rugby Board from Bernard Lapasset in Singapore in December, after the vote was deferred in an acrimonious meeting that may prompt a change to the way the sport is run. One delegate described Wednesday&apos;s meeting as the most depressing he had ever attended and compared delegates&apos; &quot;disgusting&quot; behaviour with their football counterparts \u2013 he asked: &quot;Have we learned nothing from Fifa?&quot; As the respective camps lobbied for votes and made promises and threats, insults were hurled from one side to the other. One of the Welsh Rugby Union&apos;s representatives, Gerald Davies, one of the greatest players in the history of the game and someone who is not versed in the dark arts of the committee room, got to his feet and implored: &quot;Gentlemen, take a look at yourselves. This is not the way to behave.&quot; The meeting did not split on the usual north-south hemisphere lines. While the four home unions were lined up behind Beaumont, France and Italy supported Lapasset, who was also backed by South Africa, Australia and Argentina. New Zealand endorsed Beaumont, a member of the Rugby Football Union&apos;s board of directors, because he had offered the vice-chairmanship to the former All Blacks captain Graham Mourie. The meeting turned ugly when it became clear that the associations representing the smaller unions, such as Asia, Africa, North America and Europe, held the balance of power. They were wooed with offers, but some delegates were warned about the consequences of voting for the other side, threatened with the loss of financial support and an end to development tours. The debate deteriorated to such an extent that Australia called for a vote to defer the election for a couple of months to allow everyone in the room to calm down. That prompted another row, with the four home unions vehemently opposing the move. But when it was eventually put to the meeting in a secret ballot, the result was a 13-13 deadlock. Lapasset used his casting vote to postpone the meeting until 4 December and it was agreed it would be held on neutral territory, in a country that would be one flight away for the delegates. The vote was interpreted as how a ballot would have reflected support for the chairmanship, but there would have been no casting vote in that instance. Delegates would have kept on voting until one candidate had a majority. Lapasset&apos;s camp was angry that a delegate from one of the associations had defied a mandate and voted for Beaumont. He will be replaced at the next meeting by someone who will vote as ordered, leaving Beaumont, who has offered to fly to the Four Nations countries who do not support him to put his case to their boards, with ground to make up. Beaumont was asked by one delegate why he was standing and whether his motivation was that it was his turn, having been Lapasset&apos;s deputy for four years. Lapasset was criticised for not being firm enough as chairman and not making moves to replace the chief executive, Mike Miller, who has enraged the major southern hemisphere unions at the World Cup. His position now looks untenable whoever becomes chairman. &quot;I have been to a number of IRB meetings, but I have never left one feeling so depressed and appalled,&quot; a delegate said. &quot;It was not just that it was bitter and heated, but you just sat back and asked yourself if this is how the game is being run at such a financially challenging time, what hope do we have? What are we all in it for? It should have proved to everyone once and for all that we need to fundamentally change the way the board is run. &quot;The voting system needs to be altered. It is ridiculous that the eight foundation unions get two votes each and associations that represent 40 or 50 countries get only one. The game has to be run on a global basis and on robust, commercial lines, and not continue to be organised as it was in the amateur era. If we carry on as we are, I fear the consequences. The horse trading and threats on Wednesday were disgusting.&quot; An upshot of the deferred vote was that the IRB executive meeting to discuss the 2015 World Cup, including the timing of the event, how tournament will be divided up and how commercial restrictions on the sponsors could be relaxed, has been put back until February, when Dublin will be the venue. That is bad news for the hosts, England, who are anxious to book football stadiums as venues, but cannot do so until they know if the tournament will kick off in September or October."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/22/manchester-united-manchester-city-fans", "sentences": ["How could they possibly sing &quot;You&apos;re the pride of Singapore&quot; to us ever again?"], "publicationDate": "2011-10-22T23:13:00Z", "title": "Fans' view: Will Manchester City ever be as big as Manchester United?", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Manchester City", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Pete Boyle: Can they become as big as United? No, of course not. City will find out, just as Peter Kenyon found out, that you don&apos;t simply gain tens of thousands of fans who will stay around indefinitely by spending a lot of money in the hope of instant success. Clubs such as United, Liverpool and Arsenal have a standing in the game because of football traditions going back a long time, not just from throwing money at the team in the Premier League era. Anyway, surely City don&apos;t want to be this evil global image of what is wrong with football. How could they possibly sing &quot;You&apos;re the pride of Singapore&quot; to us ever again? Or have City actually wanted to be Manchester United all along? Lloyd Scragg: United fans revel in their rich history, shoving it down opponents&apos; throats at every opportunity. But City have a fantastic history too \u2013 a strong foundation to build on. The only thing missing from our recent past is success. The Sheikhs are building a dynasty in east Manchester \u2013 developing the infrastructure from within, keeping the fans at the heart of the club and providing Manchester with state-of-the-art facilities. That attention to detail stands City in perfect stead to compete for years to come. United have had their day. Now it&apos;s our turn. PB: Fair enough, I can&apos;t argue with your point about City&apos;s history. It annoys me when Liverpool fans and Alan Green judge history on years of trophies and ongoing success, which is nonsense: complete snobbery. Leicester reached four FA Cup finals and had Gordon Banks and Peter Shilton as goalkeepers but won little silverware. If their new rich backers take them up, will Green and co claim they have little history? Chelsea and City both had proud histories long before they won the so-called lottery. But time will tell if City can knock us off our perch, as we did to Liverpool. LS: Agreed \u2013 whether City can be as big as United will be defined by the future, not our history. With the wealth of talent available to Roberto Mancini now we&apos;re more than capable of achieving our domestic goal for this season, which is beating United to the title. But making similar headway in the Champions League will be much harder, especially considering the quality of opposition in our group. PB: But remember that being a big club isn&apos;t just about cash and results. Are you hoping silverware and prolonged success will attract new fans who have shown no interest in City before? Many of them will be tourists and not from the greater Manchester region. Isn&apos;t that what hardcore Blues have always detested about United? There are pretty clear signs City can&apos;t develop a bigger local fanbase. While we could get 62,000 to Old Trafford during the fuel crisis paying full price, City have constantly struggled to get much more than a half-full ground for cup games at vastly reduced prices. LS: We&apos;re a working-class team whose fans have been starved of success and have had to live in the shadows of their neighbours for years. But despite that City&apos;s fans have stayed loyal \u2013 attendances were still high when we were playing teams like Chesterfield and Walsall every week. The foundation is there. With City&apos;s rapid growth, which club is now the most disliked by outsiders? PB: Both Manchester teams have strong working-class support but like football fans generally in the UK that has steadily been watered down during the past 20 years to a much more middle-class, less militant bunch. LS: It&apos;s still United, definitely, because of their arrogance \u2013 the song &quot;We&apos;re Man United and we&apos;ll do what we want&quot; shows what little humility they have. Until recently, City were everyone&apos;s second team because you could always rely on them to mess up \u2013 &quot;Typical City&quot;. But we&apos;ve managed to move away from being a calamity club and we&apos;ve not looked back. If some other fans are green with envy then fantastic! Let them be jealous. PB: I think you&apos;re probably right about us being more disliked, and most match-going Reds wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. There was a brief period when Chelsea started edging it because of their cash and I thought it was amusing but I still prefer to be hated. The signs that people are turning on City are there \u2013 you often see them compared with Mikey Carroll winning the lottery \u2013 but we&apos;re still ahead of them, partly because United have the highest average crowds for virtually all of the past 50 years, and that upsets people. Liverpool really hate us because, despite their on-pitch dominance for two decades, we&apos;re still the biggest club in the land. That&apos;s not an opinion, that&apos;s a fact. Perhaps we are arrogant after all. What about today? Based on the season so far, which side is better? LS: We&apos;ve made an excellent, ruthless start. Last season&apos;s squad was great, but adding the sensational Sergio Ag\u00fcero has taken us to another level. And he&apos;s been helped by the continued development of David Silva. Words can&apos;t describe how skilful that little man is. Man for man, we&apos;re the stronger outfit. PB: City are clearly contenders. On paper most neutrals would say their midfield is stronger \u2013 Silva does look classy. In past years Darren Fletcher has relished that sort of challenge but who knows today? We always try and win at home, though, so I except us to be properly up for it \u2013 just not necessarily &quot;gung ho&quot;. LS: We&apos;ve got a real chance. This game used to be about pride. Not now. No longer are we relying on Bernardo Corradi to score our goals \u2026 we&apos;re a different animal. Mario Balotelli will have a brilliant opportunity to prove the doubters wrong: he&apos;s in great form and is channelling his brilliance into frustrating opposing fans, not his own. But maybe the inclusion of Ga\u00ebl Clichy will be key. Pablo Zabaleta was used against Nani last season but had little success. If Clichy suceeds where Zabaleta failed, and if Silva shakes off Fletcher, it&apos;s our game. 2-1 to City.

Walsh, who has run Diageo for 11 years, told a Sunday newspaper he was no longer creating senior jobs in Britain because of the top rate of tax, which affects those earning over \u00a3150,000 a year. &quot;I believe the 50% tax rate will lead to the long-term damage to this nation&apos;s competitive edge.

International development spending continues not to go to those who need it the most. But an experiment in Afghanistan is showing that aid money spent locally is a highly effective way to create jobs. As the Guardian has reported, tied aid remains a stubbornly persistent component of international assistance. According to the European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad), a network of 54 NGOs from 19 countries, at least 20% of all bilateral aid remains formally tied. But that number masks the larger amount of aid that is informally tied. Even when development agencies are free to spend their money wherever they want, they rarely spend it in the country that is being assisted. It is not spent in Liberia or Timor-Leste, but rather in international logistics hubs like Brindisi and Singapore. In Afghanistan, donors have disbursed more than $36bn in aid over the last 10 years. But recent economic research, conducted by the Peace Dividend Trust on behalf of the British government, revealed that even when the aid was technically untied, only 37% of it entered the local economy. Most of the aid spending went elsewhere: to fly in foreign experts, or provide bottled water and building materials. The money might have been spent on Afghanistan, but it was not spent in Afghanistan. Not surprisingly, the development technocrats and mandarins, whose salaries are paid out of these international aid budgets, have accepted this as merely a curious paradox of aid. Namely, those who give the money tend to benefit from it more than those whom it is supposed to help. However, untied aid is now starting to reach the ground because of a new &quot;Afghan First&quot; policy implemented by donors in Kabul. They believe that Afghans who are in work are less likely to join the Taliban, and have decreed that aid procurement should use local labour and local goods to rebuild Afghanistan, whenever possible. The idea heralds a conscious effort by the international community to &quot;spend the development dollar twice&quot;. By channelling aid money through Afghan entrepreneurs, donors can double their impact: if $1m is spent on building a school, an additional $1m in profits and taxes can be left behind by using a local construction company. Most important, though, this approach moves jobs from Dubai to Kabul and Kandahar. A job can be transformative, especially during a war. A single salary will feed a family, send a girl to school, and provide a mother with medical care. It will generate taxes, pay police wages, and build hope. The World Bank estimates the unemployment rate in Afghanistan is 8%, but this does not account for the high levels of underemployment. For the most part, jobs in Afghanistan are seasonal, sporadic and unskilled. Creating jobs is difficult, and expensive. For example, the $3bn Aynak Valley copper mine (the biggest foreign investment in the country&apos;s history) is only expected to directly employ 4,500 Afghans. It will be a small drop in the sea of underemployed. By contrast, the &quot;Afghan First&quot; approach to truly untie aid has supported far more jobs with far less money. In a job creation survey conducted by Peace Dividend Trust, $441m in aid contracts, ranging in size from $1,000 to $5m, created or sustained more than 118,000 new jobs. Untied aid spending, using local entrepreneurs, created jobs at a rate 170 greater than the money invested in the copper mine. The jobs being created through donor procurement are the jobs that Afghans want and that Afghanistan needs. These are skilled jobs in a wide range of sectors, including manufacturing, solar panels, bottled water, fruit exporting, logistics and construction. At the same time, since a business must be registered before it can bid on an international tender, these contracts are generating millions in badly needed local taxes. Donor contracts typically lead to businesses expanding their employee base by more than 300%, the majority of those jobs being skilled. For a typical aid contract spent locally, one month of employment is created or sustained for every $600 spent. Furthermore, the majority of businesses invest profits in both physical capital and training staff. The concept of genuinely untying aid \u2013 to allow it to be spent locally and to create jobs \u2013 has spread to other development missions, most notably to Port au Prince. There, local officials are now talking about a &quot;Haiti First&quot; policy, and are pressuring aid agencies to spend their money in Haiti, not just on Haiti. The impact can be seen on the ground already, as local entrepreneurs are allowed to compete for international contracts, to create employment, to pay taxes, and to build a peaceful future. \u2022 Scott Gilmore is the founder and CEO of Peace Dividend Trust, a social enterprise that champions entrepreneurs and builds markets in post-conflict economies "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/24/deforestation-deportation-indonesia", "sentences": ["I was stopped while queuing at immigration to leave the country, interviewed for an hour and then rushed at the last moment onto a plane to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-24T14:05:04Z", "title": "Deforestation campaigning led to my deportation from Indonesia | Andy Tait", "tags": ["Deforestation", "Activism", "Conservation", "Trees and forests", "Greenpeace", "Environment", "World news", "Protest", "Indonesia", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Last week, I was in Indonesia. I&apos;d travelled there to work with colleagues in Jakarta and Sumatra on our continuing campaign to end the devastation of the country&apos;s magnificent rainforests. But after an extremely intense few days, I left the country prematurely on Wednesday evening. I had been due to stay longer and had a business visa to allow me to do so, but we were receiving advice that if I stayed it was likely to bring more risk to my colleagues working there. I feel very sad about leaving, not least because the last parting gesture from a group of officials at the airport was to place a large red deportation stamp in my passport. I was not even informed I was being deported. I was stopped while queuing at immigration to leave the country, interviewed for an hour and then rushed at the last moment onto a plane to Singapore. My passport, with its prominent new stamp, was handed to me as I entered the plane. I don&apos;t yet know when \u2013 or if \u2013 I will be allowed back into a country that I have enjoyed visiting so much for nearly a decade. So, why was I deported? Currently, I work on the campaign to reform the practices of Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), an Indonesian company which, as our growing dossier of evidence shows, is still destroying huge tracts of rainforest. I work with our international team across a range of countries to find ways to encourage APP to change and to expose its extraordinary greenwash. I am also in regular contact with some of the major international businesses that have recently suspended contracts with APP. Before this I had been working with my Indonesian colleagues who negotiated with Golden Agri Resources (GAR), which \u2013 like APP \u2013 is part of the Sinar Mas group. Earlier this year, GAR introduced a new forest conservation policy and this new approach is regarded as the most progressive in the palm oil industry. If fully implemented, it could have hugely positive impacts across the whole sector. Our work against APP has focused upon asking it to follow GAR&apos;s lead on sustainability, something that it is resisting ever more strongly. The weekend before last, as part of this work, I was due to take part in a trip to visit the forests of South Sumatra, to see the forest clearance for myself. And then things became a little surreal. I was tailed from my hotel in Jakarta that morning by two men, all the way to the airport. There I was stopped and shown a letter, apparently authorising my deportation. The only problem was it wasn&apos;t for me \u2013 the wrong middle name, wrong date of birth, wrong passport number and no photograph. After much back and forth with my colleagues, the men left. I was allowed to depart for the trip and while a number of &quot;administrative hurdles&quot; were placed in our way en route, we were able to see some of the areas of deforestation caused by APP suppliers. These are areas the company claims are degraded and therefore suitable for clearing and replacing with plantations. But as soon as you see it for yourself, it&apos;s obvious it&apos;s not degraded. Our experience is that they are continuing to clear huge swaths of natural forest, much of it on areas of deep peat, and much of it in areas mapped as habitat for the endangered Sumatran tiger. The more attention the issue gets, the more efforts the company throws at countering it. In Indonesia, this centres on trying to discredit the investigations of organisations like Greenpeace. Now some authorities are stepping in to try and stop those investigations from being conducted. Perhaps it is just a coincidence that, a few short hours after the airport incident, it was reported in the Indonesian media that I was travelling on false documents in the country. Perhaps it&apos;s just a coincidence that my boss John Sauven, who had been due to accompany me on the same trip, hadn&apos;t even been allowed into the country despite having a valid visa. I&apos;m not a great believer in coincidence. Around the world, the campaign is more obvious. It comes through a co-ordinated multimillion dollar global PR campaign including a series of TV adverts that have been on heavy rotation on outlets like CNN and Sky. There is also a newspaper advert that states that, in order to see APP&apos;s commitment to conservation, you just need to follow their tracks. Well, last weekend my Indonesian colleagues and I did just that. The tracks that we saw the company leaving are those left by the miles and miles of canals which have been cut through the vast peatlands in order to drain them. Those canals are followed by the tracks of caterpillar diggers bulldozing their way through hectare after hectare of natural forest, clearing and stacking the timber before it&apos;s transported to APP mills. The tracks left by APP are the tracks of the destruction on an industrial scale of Sumatra&apos;s rainforests. This house of cards the company has built has already started to fall down. Mattel was the latest in a long line of major international brands to suspend contracts with APP. Others will surely follow. And eventually APP will have to reform. The question for now is how long will it take, and what will be left of the few remaining large areas of rainforest in Sumatra when they do? I hope to be allowed back to Indonesia again to support the fantastic work that my colleagues there are doing on this campaign. They are on the go 24-7, under extraordinary pressure and stress. Their work supports the commitments of Indonesia&apos;s president who has pledged to stop the deforestation. It&apos;s clear that if that commitment is to turn into reality, the campaign against APP must succeed, and soon. \u2022 Andy Tait is a senior campaigns adviser at Greenpeace"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/24/mugabes-enemy-is-his-health", "sentences": ["The octogenarian president makes mysterious trips to Singapore for medical treatment, has been photographed falling asleep at meetings and, according to a US cable released by WikiLeaks, is suffering prostate cancer that could spread and kill him by 2013."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-24T19:00:00Z", "title": "Letter from Harare: why Mugabe is unlikely to share Gaddafi's grisly fate | David Smith", "tags": ["Robert Mugabe", "Africa", "World news", "Zimbabwe"], "article": "The jacaranda trees are blooming in Harare, draping its broad avenues with canopies of purple and green. The shops are bustling, hotels and restaurants are often full, children are at school, young couples are walking in the park. No sign of a revolution here. Coming to Zimbabwe after two spells in Libya this year, I felt like they were not merely the length of a continent apart, but on different planets. While north Africa has been convulsed by revolution, life in Zimbabwe in 2011 has continued to flow in a comparatively gentle, uneventful way. President Robert Mugabe, immovable for three decades, has little cause to be kept awake at night by last week&apos;s chilling images of a bloody, battered and bewildered Muammar Gaddafi pleading for his life. Could it happen here? Not likely. I wondered why not. After all, Zimbabweans (led by Mugabe among others) rose up a generation ago to overthrow Rhodesia&apos;s white minority regime. &quot;Fear,&quot; explained one former minister in Mugabe&apos;s government. Past public marches have been brutally crushed. Earlier this year 46 activists here were arrested and charged with treason for merely watching a video of the uprising in Egypt. Okay Machisa, director of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association, told me: &quot;The Arab spring did not go down well with the Mugabe regime. Jailing those activists was a way of saying we don&apos;t want people to go on the streets and demonstrate.&quot; But there was plenty of fear in Gaddafi&apos;s Libya too. What&apos;s different is that Zimbabwe offers the illusion, at least, of freedom of speech and democracy. On street corners vendors sell independent newspapers with virulently anti-Mugabe headlines and editorials. (TV and radio remain a different story. Some newspapers too. One ruefully exclaimed: &quot;If only British politicians were as brave and selfless as Robert Gabriel Mugabe!&quot;) Whereas Libyans had no hope of removing Gaddafi except by desperate force, Zimbabweans can channel their efforts into a political party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The MDC possibly acts as a sponge, soaking up revolutionary fervour that would otherwise find expression on the streets. I visited the MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who has survived beatings and electoral fraud to become prime minister in a fraught power-sharing agreement with Mugabe&apos;s Zanu-PF party. He lives in a relatively modest three-bedroom house with a big, English-style garden surrounded by a high wall with razor wire. The sound of birds and crickets fills the air. We sat in a back office where an old campaign poster adorned the wall and Bill Clinton&apos;s autobiography was among books on the shelves. Does Tsvangirai envy the Arab spring? &quot;No. It&apos;s their situation and circumstances and conditions that dictated behaviour. One of the fundamental things that I can say is that you cannot suppress people for ever. One thing to learn from that is people will always cry for freedom. It is universal. &quot;We are in a different situation, we have different circumstances and we have got our own way of dealing with our situation. That is why the MDC has pursued change without bloodshed and I think we are correct.&quot; Elections are expected in the next year or so, and with them the fear of a return to violence and chaos. For Mugabe seems unwilling to ever let go\u00a0of power, not least, some claim, because he fears prosecution for past crimes under international law. At 87, Mugabe is the oldest member of Africa&apos;s ageing dictators club. Three of the 10 longest serving leaders have fallen this year \u2013 Ben Ali of Tunisia ruled for 23 years, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt for 30 and the longest, Gaddafi, for nearly 42. But all were in the Arab north. South of the Sahara, in &quot;black Africa&quot;, the winds of change are mere zephyrs. Still going strong are Teodoro Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea (32 years), Jose Santos of Angola (32), Mugabe (31), Paul Biya of Cameroon (29), Yoweri Museveni of Uganda (25), King Mswati III of Swaziland (24) and Blaise Campaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso (24). There has been some mild turbulence for some of them this year but nothing to frighten the presidents&apos; horses. Far from Gaddafi&apos;s grisly demise, Mugabe seems destined to go quietly into that good night. His greatest enemy is not the gun-toting revolutionary with a mobile video camera, but time. The octogenarian president makes mysterious trips to Singapore for medical treatment, has been photographed falling asleep at meetings and, according to a US cable released by WikiLeaks, is suffering prostate cancer that could spread and kill him by 2013. Gossip about his ailing health now grips Harare&apos;s bars, diplomatic circles and international newsrooms already transfixed by 93-year-old Nelson Mandela&apos;s pulse. I asked one analyst if all this speculation is paralysing politics in Zimbabwe. He replied: &quot;Mugabe&apos;s health is politics in Zimbabwe.&quot; Tsvangirai gave this view: &quot;President Mugabe&apos;s health is a national question, a national concern. Why? Because when you have a partner whose state of health is unpredictable, and that partner holds the key to the unity of the opponent, what is likely to be the outcome should he die is instability in the party, which leads to instability in the country.&quot; It was a question that arose with Saddam Hussein in Iraq and now again with Gaddafi in Libya. Once the linchpin of dictatorship is yanked out, must infighting and anarchy follow? Some believe that Mugabe, whose reign is as old as independent Zimbabwe itself, is the toxic glue that holds his party and country together. But others point to neighbouring Zambia, where recent elections saw the president accept defeat and a democratic transition of power. Rupiah Banda is little known around the world and his unbloody, unspectacular fall gained only a fraction of the coverage of Gaddafi. But it may have been just as revolutionary in its way \u2013 and just as unnerving to that cabal of ageing dictators."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/25/thailand-floods-hard-drive-shortage", "sentences": ["&quot;From the Asia context, of course the impact will be on the Taiwanese PC manufacturers - companies like Acer and Asustek Computer,&quot; said Satish Lele, vice president, consulting, Asia Pacific at Frost &amp; Sullivan in Singapore.", "&quot;With such a tight supply chain, it&apos;s very unlikely that people have a lot of stock to cover themselves,&quot; said Lillian Tay, analyst at Gartner in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-25T05:41:41Z", "title": "Thailand's devastating floods are hitting PC hard drive supplies, warn analysts", "tags": ["Computing", "Technology", "Thailand", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The floods in Thailand which have caused widespread chaos in the country, leading to the deaths of more than 350 people after months of unusually heavy rainfall, will also have effects further afield, in a sign of the connectedness of the world economy.  One effect will be that the world output of magnetic hard drives could fall as much as 30% in the final three months of 2011 \u2013 and manufacturers who need them are now scrambling to snap up existing inventories, market research firm IHS iSuppli says. For Asia&apos;s PC makers, already grappling with the prospect of subdued year-end holiday season consumer demand, that could mean a further slowdown in the lunar new year sales season, and lead to weak sales in the first quarter of 2012, hurting the one regional growth area of an industry already facing a challenge from smartphones and tablets, and from slowing corporate spending on technology hardware. Alternatively, it might briefly push up prices on those which are available. &quot;From the Asia context, of course the impact will be on the Taiwanese PC manufacturers - companies like Acer and Asustek Computer,&quot; said Satish Lele, vice president, consulting, Asia Pacific at Frost &amp; Sullivan in Singapore. Thailand is the world&apos;s second largest maker of hard disk drives (HDD) after China, and makes about half of global output taking place there. The damage caused by flooding could keep factories closed or hobbled for months, analysts and executives reckon. Analysts have highlighted Japan&apos;s Nidec Corp, which controls about 80% of the world&apos;s output of a key HDD component - the motor - as the major potential bottleneck for supplies of drives, used to store data in computers. Nidec has closed some plants in Thailand, as has disk parts maker Minebea. The total demand for HDDs is presently around 660m units annually, with Western Digital and Seagate having just over 30% share. Hitachi makes about 16% of world supply, followed by Toshiba (11%) and Samsung (10%). Lele said PC makers will have four to six weeks on average of inventory, but will feel the effects after that is gone. &quot;From that context, the issue will start hitting these companies sometimes towards end of November and December, which for them are also key months because of the holiday season.&quot; Acer declined to comment and Lenovo Group, the Chinese company that is the world&apos;s No.2 PC maker in the third quarter, had no immediate comment. Pegatron, the Taiwanese company that is the main contract manufacturer for Asustek Computer , doesn&apos;t see a problem for six to eight weeks as makers have inventory, but after that it would depend on how fast things return to normal in Thailand. Pegatron Chief Financial Officer Charles Lin said there was one big difference between the Thailand situation and the aftermath of Japan&apos;s earthquake in March, which also disrupted supplies of components across a number of technology industries, including smartphones. &quot;The concentration of some component manufacturing [in Japan] was very high, but Thailand only makes up about a quarter of global hard disk production, so if plants elsewhere can ramp up, the effect this time may be less than that after the Japan quake,&quot; he said. Nick Wu, head of investor relations at Asustek, said the company&apos;s inventory and supply chain was enough to last until the end of the fourth quarter. But after that if the situation continued then there could be an impact. Asked about the effects on Apple, chief executive Tim Cook said in the company&apos;s recent earnings call that &quot;we source many components from Thailand, from many factories. The recovery timeline for these factories isn&apos;t known. The weather really hasn&apos;t allowed an assessment... It is something that I&apos;m concerned about.&quot; He added that &quot;our hearts go out to all the people in Thailand who have experienced these devastating losses of life and property as a result of the monsoons and the flooding.&quot; Apple sold its largest-ever number of PCs in the third quarter, but future sales could be affected by the slowdown in supplies. Western Digital and Seagate both have factories in Thailand. Western Digital&apos;s factories are closed, and Seagate warned it could face parts shortages even though its plants are running. &quot;With such a tight supply chain, it&apos;s very unlikely that people have a lot of stock to cover themselves,&quot; said Lillian Tay, analyst at Gartner in Singapore. &quot;But from what we see, the major impact will come in Q1 because it&apos;s a 50-50 (situation). Some of them may not get what they want in Q4 [2011], but I think Q1 [of 2012] is really going to be the quarter that the most impact will be felt.&quot; Nanya Technology, Taiwan&apos;s second-biggest DRAM memory chip maker, expects some impact from a shortage of hard disks. &quot;Because notebooks all need hard disks, there will be an impact on the whole IT industry in November, December and into January, and this is a negative factor for DRAMs,&quot; Nanya Vice President Pei Lin Pai told reporters when the firm reported earnings last week. Taiwan&apos;s Quanta Computer Inc , the world&apos;s top contract laptop PC maker, and the next biggest, Compal Electronics, said hard disks are &quot;confined components&quot;, meaning clients and not the contract makers procure them themselves. Both said they had not received any updates from clients. South Korea&apos;s Hynix Semiconductor Inc, the world&apos;s second largest computer memory chip maker, said the flood had not had a major impact on it, given the current inventory levels at HDD makers and PC vendors. Other products have already been affected by the flooding, with Sony delaying the launches of several new cameras, lens kits and headphones after production was halted. Frost &amp; Sullivan&apos;s Lele said PC makers will also take a hit as they will have to bear the costs of the shortage. &quot;It will be more for the PC makers to absorb the costs, because it is highly unlikely that they can pass it on to the customer. They will be under tremendous pressure to absorb the additional costs.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/oct/25/super-league-set-six-four-nations", "sentences": ["Meanwhile the first team will move into their new stadium at the start of next season in an enviable financial position thanks to the long-serving chairman, Eamonn McManus, and Mike Coleman, a more recent addition to the board and another local boy made good in south-east Asia, in his case running hedge funds in Singapore whereas McManus was based in Hong Kong as the head of corporate finance for HSBC."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-25T10:02:25Z", "title": "Set of Six: Four Nations focus | Andy Wilson", "tags": ["Four Nations", "England rugby league team", "Australia rugby league", "New Zealand rugby league", "Wales rugby league team", "Rugby league", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "article": "1) Down to the Wire The main impression conveyed by Monday&apos;s launch of the Gillette Four Nations series at Elland Road was that the Aussies mean business. Darren Lockyer and Tim Sheens, their outstanding captain and distinguished coach, were as polite and professional as ever, but there seemed a steelier edge to them than on some recent tours. &quot;We still have the Four Nations final from 2010 on our minds,&quot; said Sheens, referring to New Zealand&apos;s shock 16-12 win at Brisbane&apos;s Suncorp Stadium. That means the Kiwis hold international league&apos;s two major honours, having ended Australia&apos;s domination of the World Cup in Brisbane two years earlier, and two convincing victories over New Zealand already this season will mean nothing to the Kangaroos unless Lockyer lifts the trophy in Leeds on 19 November. That should add a real edge to Friday&apos;s first game of the series, as the trans-Tasman rivalry is transported to Cheshire. Warrington&apos;s intimate Halliwell Jones Stadium will provide a rare chance for British rugby fans of either code to get up close and personal to such greats of the southern hemisphere as Lockyer and the Kiwi captain, Benji Marshall, and the physical collisions between such players as Keith Galloway and Fui Fui Moi Moi will not be for the fainthearted. New Zealand also have a point to prove, having flopped on their past two trips to the northern hemisphere, failing to reach the final of the Four Nations in 2009 and enduring a 3-0 whitewash by Great Britain two years before that. Fears about a lack of experience in key positions seemed to be reinforced by the heavy defeat they suffered against Australia in Newcastle two weeks ago, but they can only be strengthened by the introduction of Kevin Locke at full-back and Kieran Foran at stand-off, and unsung mainstays of previous successes such as Simon Mannering and Jeremy Smith are all around to lay a platform for the brilliant Marshall \u2013 complete with his new beard. However one glaring weakness in the Kiwis&apos; ability to adjust to English conditions emerged at Elland Road. It took Marshall, his coach, Stephen Kearney, and the long-serving media man Richard Becht five attempts to manoeuvre their four-wheel drive out of the car park, as the Rugby Football League&apos;s chairman Richard Lewis looked on with growing amusement. They may remember that if they return for the final three weeks on Saturday \u2013 provided they survived the return trip to their Liverpool base along the M62. 2) Chase the ace? Stick or twist? So what are England&apos;s chances of beating either Australia at Wembley on Saturday week, or the Kiwis in Hull seven days later, which they will have to do to have any chance of preventing a repeat of last year&apos;s final? Logically you&apos;d say less than 50%, mainly because of the quality of the opposition and the stuttering warm-up win against France in Avignon last Friday didn&apos;t provide any reliable evidence to change those odds. As some have already been discussing since the weekend, there were some good bits \u2013 the first two minutes, the last 10 in the first half, and a couple more cracking tries after the break. But the majority of the performance was unconvincing and arguably left the coach, Steve McNamara, with more questions than answers, particularly surrounding the crucial half-back positions. Rangi Chase, the Maori who has been converted in Castleford, did some brilliant things, and his combination with Sam Tomkins offered particular promise. But then Chase clocked off horribly in the last quarter, making the man of the match award that had been determined after 60 minutes pretty embarrassing \u2013 not least to Chase himself \u2013 when it was announced shortly before the final hooter. McNamara&apos;s other new recruits, Jack Reed and Chris Heighington, had less fluctuating, more solid debuts. But their presence in the England setup, alongside Gareth Ellis and Gareth Widdop \u2013 two Yorkshiremen who have excelled in the National Rugby League this season \u2013 does seem to have secured greater respect from both Australia and New Zealand. England have the perfect chance to hone their combinations before Wembley as they face Wales in their first Four Nations game at Leigh on Saturday. It will be fascinating to see whether McNamara makes any changes. 3) A cheer in Provence It is equally intriguing to speculate on the likely result should the Wales team sent out by Iestyn Harris on Saturday face the France side coached by his former Great Britain half-back partner Bobbie Goulding that pushed England so hard in Avignon. It was Wales&apos;s unexpected, and by all accounts thoroughly deserved, victory in Albi in last autumn&apos;s European Cup that earned this debut in the Four Nations at the expense of a France team who have been underachieving at international level for years. The home team&apos;s performance in Provence merely confirmed that, but at least it gives Goulding the chance to go out on a high, assuming he and the French federation choose to move on at the end of his three-year contract after games against Scotland and Ireland in the next two weeks. The progress made by the Catalan Dragons over the past 12 months since the arrival of Trent Robinson has offered huge encouragement to the French ahead of the 2013 World Cup, in which they have been drawn in an attractive group with New Zealand, Samoa and Papua New Guinea \u2013 and will surely now play at least one match in Avignon, after the success of Friday&apos;s fixture. 4) From the streets of Philadelphia \u2026 Now that the kick and clap has finished in New Zealand \u2013 only joking, union folk, from this distance it&apos;s been a hugely impressive event, just a shame about the rugby \u2013 it&apos;s quite exciting to think that the next rugby World Cup will be the league version in 2013. The prospect seems even more real, and appealing, following confirmation that the United States have qualified for the first time, with Italy shaping as favourites to join them as debutants if they beat Lebanon in Belgrade next weekend. Both offer huge opportunities for the game, effectively articulated by the Americans&apos; former Bradford Bulls coach Matthew Elliott in a preview of their last qualifier against Jamaica in the Philadelphia Inquirer. But there is not much time to capitalise before 2013. It is a major challenge for the International Federation, and the clubs of the Super League and especially the NRL. Do they have the vision and ambition to respond to a unique opportunity? 5) Vegas, Dubai \u2013 or Headingley? The evidence of the World Club Challenge would suggest probably not. Every year there are suggestions that the game may be played in Australia. Russell Crowe also came up with an imaginative scheme to stage a World Club Championship in Las Vegas. Now Manly, having been either unable or unwilling to follow through on initial suggestions that the Super League champions (Leeds) may finally be invited to Australia, have revived the idea of using Dubai as a lucrative halfway house. But still, nothing has actually been done, meaning that the game now looks likely to be played at Headingley, which should be a cracking occasion but is a damning indictment of limited ambition. 6) Saints in good shape That is in stark contrast to the good folk of St Helens, who don&apos;t like blowing their own trumpet but have an impressive record of getting on with the job. They have again sent their best young players on a tour of Australia and maintained their 100% record with an impressive win against Cronulla last week, with the former stand-off Tommy Martyn clearly refusing to allow his new role as a coach to cramp his style off the field. Thatto Heath, one of the town&apos;s strongest amateur clubs, will also be flying the flag overseas this weekend as they represent the National Conference League against the cream of France&apos;s amateurs in a curtain-raiser before the France-Scotland international in Perpignan. Meanwhile the first team will move into their new stadium at the start of next season in an enviable financial position thanks to the long-serving chairman, Eamonn McManus, and Mike Coleman, a more recent addition to the board and another local boy made good in south-east Asia, in his case running hedge funds in Singapore whereas McManus was based in Hong Kong as the head of corporate finance for HSBC. Perhaps St Helens may be one of the few northern towns with a not wholly negative view of bankers.

But beyond a vague notion of &quot;eating Indian&quot; most people outside the subcontinent are unfamiliar with common Diwali foods. So what is eaten during the five-day festival? The immediate answer is sweets \u2013 and plenty of them. Indian sweetmeats, known as &quot;mithai&quot; are a cross between snack, dessert and confectionery. If there&apos;s one thing that captures the Indian culinary psyche, it&apos;s mithai. Little morsels are nibbled throughout the day, on their own, with masala chai or as part of a meal alongside savoury items.Chickpea flour, rice flour, semolina, various beans, lentils and grains, squashes, carrots, thickened condensed milk or yoghurt are normally used as base ingredients; to which cashewnuts, almonds, pistachios, chirongi nuts or raisins are added. Fragrant with sweet spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves or nutmeg, they&apos;re further blinged up with saffron, rose or kewra (pandan leaf) water, and silver or gold leaf. While &quot;laddoos&quot;, &quot;barfis&quot; and &quot;halwas&quot; like my pumpkin version here are universally popular, some of other items like &quot;mawa kachori&quot;, &quot;moti pak&quot; and &quot;sohan papdi&quot; are more regional specialities requiring elaborate preparation. It&apos;s customary to exchange extravagantly decorated boxes of mithai, dried fruit, nuts or silver serving dishes with family and friends. Around a month before the festival starts, women, especially of my mother and grandmother&apos;s generations, get together in each other&apos;s kitchens in turn to make the all-important Diwali snacks. Snack-making is very much a social activity, with older women turning out a dozen or more items and young people keeping the tradition alive by making at least a few. Diwali snacks, made from chickpeas, rice, lentil and several other varieties of flours, are seasoned with different combination of spices, sesame seeds, fresh fenugreek leaves or coconut, pummelled into assorted shapes and usually deep-fried \u2013 though nowadays both mithai and snacks are available in low-fat, low-sugar and baked versions. It&apos;s common for family and friends to drop around to each other&apos;s houses with boxes of homemade snacks. Festive specialities include Bombay-mix like &quot;chivda&quot;, with countless variations (each with a different name \u2013 I spotted &quot;London mix&quot; in a supermarket the other day), diamond-shaped &quot;shakkarpara&quot;, noodle-like &quot;sev&quot;, sweet, layered deep-fried discs &quot;chirote&quot;, and a range of sweet and savoury &quot;puris&quot; from puffed ones that look like UFOs, to ones dented with the back of a thin rolling pin that resemble the surface of the moon. My favourite snacks are nutty lentil flour discs called &quot;mathiya&quot;, pretty spirals of &quot;chakri&quot;, and crescent moon shaped pasties known as &quot;ghughra&quot; or &quot;karanji&quot;. You can buy both mithai and Diwali snacks from Ambala, Royal and other Indian sweet shops around the country. If you&apos;ve never tried them before, don&apos;t be afraid to give them a go. Ask for small tasters before you buy; most shops will be happy to oblige. Different speciality meals are traditionally cooked on different days of the festival, and these vary further depending on region. Generally speaking puris, traditionally deep-fried in expensive ghee and therefore rich in every sense, replace flatbreads; and are accompanied by a different dal, vegetable curry, fried titbits such as pakoras, collectively known as &quot;namkeen&quot; or &quot;farsan&quot;, and a pudding on each day of the festival. Many, though not all, Indians continue to eat vegetarian at this time of year. On the first day (October 24), associated with wealth, large-grain cracked wheat saut\u00e9ed with ghee and sugar known as &quot;lapsi&quot; is very popular, and may be accompanied by a curry of yard-long beans which, due to their length, symbolise longevity. On the second day (October 25), associated with the elimination of evil spirits, specialities include anarasa, a rice-and-jaggery dish that can take up to seven days to prepare. Light, fluffy urad lentil pakoras are eaten alongside the milky rice pudding, kheer. Some festive dishes from around the subcontinent on Diwali day (October 26) include curry of courgette-like squash &quot;galaka&quot;, &quot;ukkarai&quot;, a steamed dish of split chickpea and moong bean batter; &quot;sheera&quot;, a fudgy sweet of semolina saut\u00e9ed with raisins, cashewnuts, cardamom and saffron like my banana version here, steamed fine-grain cracked wheat porridge dolloped with ghee and sugar known as &quot;kansar&quot;, crumbly doughnuts &quot;balushahi&quot;, and sweet flatbreads stuffed with mashed pigeon peas, saffron and cardamom called &quot;poli&quot;. On New Year&apos;s Day (October 27), &quot;puris&quot; may be partnered with &quot;shrikhand&quot;, a chilled pudding made from home-made yoghurt cheese; and mixed vegetable curries made with as many varieties of vegetables as possible, as this symbolises year-round culinary riches. The day after the New Year (October 28) is a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters. Women spend the entire day in the kitchen, making their brothers&apos; favourite dishes and sweets, and are presented with lavish gifts in return. Diwali is a vibrant, colourful, joyous celebration expressed through the medium of food. Cooks find their creative spark with a side helping of therapeutic &quot;me time&quot; in the kitchen, jaded palates perk up and family and friends come together to eat.

With Apple and Google&apos;s Android now dominating the smartphone market, the world&apos;s largest phone maker is pinning its hopes of a business turnaround on the success of two models unveiled by chief executive Stephen Elop at the annual Nokia World event in London. The first Nokia handsets to run on Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone interface, the Lumia 800, priced \u20ac420 (\u00a3365), and the Lumia 710, at \u20ac270, are aimed squarely at the mid-market, which is dominated by the Android operating system. The phones were produced in a frantic eight-month period after Elop decided to abandon the &quot;burning platform&quot; of Nokia&apos;s own operating software in favour of Windows Phone. The Lumia phones run on its latest iteration, 7.5 Mango, which has had a limited distribution so far on handsets by HTC, LG and Samsung. In competition with Google&apos;s free Android software, Microsoft has struggled to get Windows Phone onto a wide range of handsets, with just 2% market share in mid-2011, according to analyst IDC. Microsoft will be hoping that Lumia, which Elop described provocatively as &quot;the first real Windows phone made by anyone&quot;, will deliver its software to a much wider audience. With sales of PCs declining in favour of mobile connected devices, Microsoft&apos;s influence over consumer technology will fade unless it can make its presence felt on smartphones and tablets. The US behemoth is understood to be lavishly bankrolling the Lumia launch, paying unspecified billions to Nokia as a thank-you for using its software, and the new advertising campaign will have a budget three times higher than for any previous Nokia range. The Lumia 800 will be released in November in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, with customers able to pre-order immediately from nokia.com, and 31 networks and independent retailers committed to marketing the product. Its case is a slimmer version of the colourful N9 released by Nokia earlier this year. Hong Kong, India, Russia, Singapore and Taiwan will get the handset before the end of the year, with further markets early in 2012. The United States is not on the list, because Nokia has no Lumia models yet that will work on 4G superfast mobile internet, which is already in use in across the Atlantic. The cheaper Lumia 710, which echoes the iPhone with its curved edges and white or black casing, will be available first in Russia and the far east, before heading west in 2012. Proclaiming a &quot;new dawn&quot; for Nokia, Elop said: &quot;Eight months ago, we shared our new strategy and today we are demonstrating clear progress of this strategy in action.&quot; He added: &quot;We&apos;re driving innovation throughout our entire portfolio.&quot; Elop is keeping one eye firmly on developing markets, unveiling four &quot;Asha&quot; handsets named after the Hindi word for hope, aimed at the &quot;next 1 billion&quot; users in those parts of the world where most people&apos;s first experience of the internet will be via a mobile phone. Having decided not to adopt Android as an operating system, Nokia has seemed frozen in the headlights of its progress. Since the beginning of 2010, the Finnish firm&apos;s market capitalisation has halved from $52bn to $25bn, and over the same period its share of the smartphone market has declined from 39% to 16%. Revenues have slumped, and operating profits of over \u20ac1bn for its phones division were as low as \u20ac132m in September. A former Nokia executive, Anssi Vanjoki, once said that by adopting Android, rivals like HTC were just like Finnish boys who &quot;pee in their pants&quot; in winter for temporary warmth. That decision allowed rivals HTC and Samsung to race ahead, but some experts believe that Windows Phone Mango is distinctive enough to have been worth waiting for. Its interface has been welcomed as an improvement on the design of Apple and Android. Benedict Evans at Enders Analysis said: &quot;Next year, Nokia and Apple will be the only people selling smartphones that aren&apos;t generic slabs of black plastic.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/oct/27/united-arab-emirates-film-industry", "sentences": ["Garin is glowing about the partnership with Hyde Park Entertainment, run by the Indian-American mogul (and former professional tennis player) Ashok Amritraj, with whom they are setting up offices in India and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-27T14:02:23Z", "title": "UAE's film industry \u2013 all talk no action?", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "United Arab Emirates", "World news"], "article": "Cinema in the United Arab Emirates moved one step closer to Go in March when Tobe Hooper, director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, arrived in the country to take charge of Djinn, a supernatural horror film. Funded by Image Nation, Abu Dhabi&apos;s nascent film studio, it was eagerly anticipated as one of the company&apos;s long-promised local productions. But things went off-script. There were reports of strife between the Emirati and foreign crews, and &quot;cultural consultant&quot; Nayla al-Khaja, a feted local talent, left the production. &quot;Djinn is not Emirati,&quot; she later told Time Out Dubai, &quot;The script? Written by an American. The producer? German-American. The director is American. Not even the sound recorder [is Emirati], not even the makeup artist, not even the wardrobe. Don&apos;t we have anyone here who can design clothing?&quot; Grassroots passion and international aspirations: Djinn is a perfect example of the tensions that have dogged the UAE&apos;s early attempts to build a cinema industry. Image Nation was born three years ago in a blaze of publicity, on the back of a mammoth $1bn deal with Warner Brothers to make movies, videogames and a theme park. But it has produced disappointingly little since \u2013 let alone raised the fortunes of the fledgling Emirati industry. Michael Garin, who took over as CEO in February, is fighting to manage expectations. &quot;If we were pretending we&apos;d be the Arabic Bollywood,&quot; he says. &quot;People would ask us what we&apos;d been smoking.&quot; Self-deprecation isn&apos;t part of the normal Emirati way of doing business: that usually errs on the side of divine intervention, like bringing the Louvre to Abu Dhabi, or turning the English Premier League on its head with Manchester City&apos;s petrodollars. But Image Nation does actually seem to be quietly getting on with film-making. It has just split, amoeba-fashion, into two parts \u2013 Image Nation International and Image Nation Abu Dhabi \u2013 which cover the studio&apos;s twin functions: to finance global hits like Contagion (which opened in the UK last week) and to produce local films, such as the coming-of-age drama Sea Shadow, which premiered there this month. The hope is that Sea Shadow, as well as Djinn, will gee up Emirati audiences to the idea of seeing homegrown films (even if no one agrees on what makes them homegrown). Buzz-commanding international titles such as Contagion and The Help \u2013 for which Image Nation put up 50/50 financing with US studio Participant Media \u2013 are clear progress on Robert Rodriguez&apos;s Shorts, the sole piece of cinema to come out of the Warner deal. Garin, though, points out that &quot;the movies we finance in our partnerships would&apos;ve got made anyway&quot;. The company&apos;s real purpose, he says, is to nurture a film-making culture within the UAE, by creating opportunities for promising local candidates to tap into the globalised network of mainstream film. &quot;That&apos;s very hard to do when you&apos;re living in London or Los Angeles. It&apos;s almost impossible in Abu Dhabi. In London or LA, people get jobs as taxi drivers or waiters when they&apos;re waiting for their first break.&quot; Image Nation is aiming to place its people on training schemes on its international productions; opportunities they wouldn&apos;t get in other, more self-contained Arab film hubs such as Beirut and Cairo. Nayla al-Khaja remains cautious: &quot;There&apos;s been too much talk, but no results in the past. I just hope Image Nation stick to their promises. They need to find a balance between international productions and supporting local culture.&quot; It&apos;s true that fathoming the company&apos;s intentions isn&apos;t straightforward. The original Warner deal was motivated, as with so many things in this part of the world, as much by real estate as film-making (the theme park on Yas Island is still going ahead, says Garin). Image Nation&apos;s chairman, Mohammed al-Mubarak (brother of Khaldoon, the Manchester City chairman) is also the chief commercial officer at Aldar, Abu Dhabi&apos;s largest real-estate company (which runs the Yas Island development); this is typical of the prevailing culture, with members of the power-broking Emirati families often holding multiple board posts. If this sub-plot in the Image Nation soap opera remains unresolved, the big-picture story arc is obvious to see. With China and India on the rise, Abu Dhabi is neatly situated between east and west, and pursuing film-making relationships with both. Garin is glowing about the partnership with Hyde Park Entertainment, run by the Indian-American mogul (and former professional tennis player) Ashok Amritraj, with whom they are setting up offices in India and Singapore. But ask him about Image Nation&apos;s prospects on the tricky Chinese turf, and Garin moves quickly back into downplaying mode: &quot;We&apos;re not going to have the same problems as other companies in China. It&apos;s not because we&apos;re smarter than they are. It&apos;s because our financial approach to film-making is completely different. The studios are so big, that&apos;s if a film&apos;s not a giant success, it doesn&apos;t really have any impact on their financial performance. The problem is that when you have giant successes, you have giant failures. Most recently, I guess, you had Cowboys and Aliens. That&apos;s the studio game, but it&apos;s not our game.&quot; The notes of realism are refreshing. Whether they&apos;re smokescreen, bluff, U-turn or clarion call is yet to emerge. Image Nation are due to announce future plans in a few weeks&apos; time, and one group of people \u2013 the UAE&apos;s thirsty young film-makers \u2013 will be the first to know for sure."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/27/india-grand-prix-formula-one", "sentences": ["This circuit is a bit more like Suzuka and Spa than Korea or Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-27T19:55:00Z", "title": "State of unease hangs over impressive circuit as India joins F1 party", "tags": ["Formula One 2011", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Anyone arriving at the Buddh International Circuit on Thursday was given the distinct impression that he was underdressed if he was not accompanied by a JCB \u2013 or at the very least wielding a dustpan and brush. Whatever the assurances of the officials, it was difficult to dispel the notion that India&apos;s inaugural grand prix on Sunday should really have been sponsored by lastminute.com. Certainly all the hype of recent weeks began to feel a little premature. It did not help that everyone came to the track bearing lurid tales of their adventures the previous evening, mostly involving traffic mayhem, sights of appalling poverty or the stench from open drains; India, at its worst, is best illustrated by Hieronymus Bosch. At the circuit itself, however, beneath the layers of work-dust, behind the final and slipshod painting and landscaping, it was clear that something truly impressive had been achieved. The drivers, though they had mostly only walked the track, were impressed by its quality, the appeal of its elevations and by the facilities provided \u2013 and these, remember, are spoiled creatures from the most glamorous and show-offy of all\u00a0sports. Some of their rooms had an unfinished look while the constant power cuts and the bats flying around fed into an incipient sense of unease as the teams poured in during the morning. A surreal stairway led, for no good reason, to the roof of the main\u00a0stand. As the day went on, however, most people were registering a hesitant satisfaction. Yes, there were teething problems, fewer on the track itself and more in the team garages, with concerns over the power supply that needed to be resolved as the teams were finally due to get on to the track in their cars in first practice on Friday morning. But on the circuit, at least, there was nothing that seemed more serious than crude finishing touches &quot;The track is fantastic,&quot; said Ross Brawn, the Mercedes team principal. &quot;You don&apos;t really know until cars start running around what the track [surface] is like. But the [look of the] track is fantastic. It has got an exciting combination of corners and straights. It has a very long straight and some very important corners, some combinations that will be quite tricky. &quot;The facilities are good. Clearly it has just been finished but we understand that and we are not criticising. We know that next year there will be another step forward with the facilities because it has been a massive challenge for everybody to get it finished, so we are very tolerant and understanding of the situation.&quot; Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One&apos;s commercial rights holder, was also effusive in praise. &quot;It&apos;s super. They have done everything we wanted them to do, within two or three years of us reaching an agreement. It took Silverstone 25 years, so I think they have done well.&quot; The view from the drivers was generally enthusiastic, although a number did raise concerns about the dust on the track which can potentially hamper visibility, hide track markers and also affect the grip. Most were hoping that it could be resolved before the race. Jarno Trulli, from Lotus, said: &quot;The circuit itself seems pretty good. They should be happy to have such a circuit in India, especially for the future of this country in motor sport. &quot;The question mark is about dust. I have been around cycling and it was very dusty. I hope they can clean today and tomorrow morning and see how the circuit develops over the weekend.&quot; Jenson Button is one of the few drivers to have driven the track \u2013 even though that was only when his two engineers went for a drive in a tuk-tuk on Thursday. &quot;Driving the circuit, it&apos;s very hilly. This circuit is a bit more like Suzuka and Spa than Korea or Singapore. It&apos;s exciting. Driving in the simulator, my initial thoughts were: &apos;Hang on a sec, it feels like a hilly car park&apos;, because all I could see were asphalt run-off areas. &quot;But here it&apos;s so different to what we had in the sim. Because they&apos;ve painted the run-off areas it doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re at a big car park at all. I think we&apos;re going to really enjoy driving around here.&quot; Rubens Barrichello, the most experienced driver on the grid, was less concerned about the dust than some of his peers. &quot;I have also felt that the track is quite good. They have done a super job in a short period of time. We are going to go out tomorrow but like any new circuit there should be some dirt on it and some dust. That&apos;s fairly normal. I am enjoying what I have seen so far.&quot; Force India&apos;s Adrian Sutil said: &quot;I went around the circuit this morning and it all looked finished. It looks very interesting layout wise. It was still very dusty, I have to\u00a0say, quite dirty, so we will have to see how\u00a0it is for tomorrow morning. But\u00a0hopefully it is going to be a great\u00a0event.&quot; Away from the track and off the record, though, there were those who still had to be convinced about the viability of the\u00a0facilities to run a grand prix. &quot;Listen,\u00a0mate,&quot; said one engineer, who did not want to be named, &quot;the place is chaos. The\u00a0electricity doesn&apos;t work [continuously], the gas doesn&apos;t work and\u00a0there are problems with the plumbing.&quot; And as he spoke a technician, combining urgency and vagueness, shuffled past, looking a little like Ethelred the Unready.

Nick Clegg will set out his own agenda for a rebalancing of the relationship but will argue that closer eurozone integration should not need an EU-wide treaty change that would in turn trigger a UK referendum or a major repatriation of powers to London. He will highlight the need for a new EU approach to crime and the energy and financial services markets. In the Commons Tory Eurosceptics argued that the gathering prospect of a two-speed Europe strengthened their case for a repatriation of UK powers or an in/out referendum. Sceptics such as John Baron argued that plans for twice-yearly summits at head-of-government level meant the 17 euro members were heading in a different direction from the 10 EU members outside the single currency. He said: &quot;There comes a point where if there are other members of the eurozone who want to proceed with fiscal union and closer political integration let them do that. But there should be a quid pro quo for that. We should as a country have the kind of relationship we want which would involve a free trade area.&quot; The sceptics also demanded assurances that Britain would not contribute to the EU bailout fund. The chancellor, walking a tightrope between his backbenchers and the Liberal Democrats, welcomed the plans for a closer eurozone but suggested this might require only minor treaty changes. He vetoed a direct UK contribution to the bail-out, but did not rule out extra resources being given to the IMF fund that might in turn go to an ailing EU member state. The coalition has agreed a referendum should only be held in this parliament if there is a transfer of powers or competences from Westminster to Brussels, and Downing Street argued that closer integration within the eurozone need not involve a loss of UK sovereignty and therefore trigger a referendum. Ministers fear that the prospect of substantial treaty change, being pushed by Germany, would lead to referendums across Europe and stasis at a time when the EU needs quick decisions. Without giving a timetable Osborne said: &quot;I think there now will be a discussion about what Europe looks like in the coming years. It is clear the eurozone needs to co-ordinate more closely \u2013 it&apos;s in Britain&apos;s interests that they do because, when they don&apos;t, our economy suffers. &quot;But it is an opportunity for Britain to rebalance its relationship with Europe \u2013 that&apos;s in the coalition agreement of this government, and Conservative members of it are also very clear it is an opportunity to bring back significant powers to Britain from Brussels.&quot; The chancellor tried to build a coalition consensus around the concept of &quot;a rebalancing of responsibilities&quot; between the EU and the UK. He said &quot;There is certainly strong agreement on the Conservative benches that we want to rebalance the responsibilities and repatriate some powers. The Liberal Democrats and the Liberal Democrat leader have talked about rebalancing responsibilities.&quot; Clegg tried to refocus the issue, saying people cared more about jobs and growth than &quot;arcane debates&quot; around treaty change that &quot;may or may not occur&quot;. The EU communique on Wednesday set out a 10-point programme for an inner EU institution with its own president. An interim report will be presented in December with a final report in March next year. Osborne said the inner euro group might &quot;bounce&quot; the 27 EU members. He also urged the eurozone to press ahead with detailed plans about how to fund the Greek bailout and the construction of a trillion-dollar firewall to protect the eurozone from further attacks.He expressed some scepticism about the proposals for a special purpose vehicle into which surplus countires such as China might contribute. He said &quot;I fear that we are looking at a sophisticated financial instrument here. However, it is clear that Germany and the Bundestag were not prepared to provide further resources. The European Central Bank was not prepared to provide those resources either, for all sorts of reasons to do with its history and those of other central banks in Europe. They have therefore turned to those options to try to leverage up the money they have already committed. That is the sensible choice for them, given those other constraints. They are trying to get other private investors from around the world, potentially including the involvement of sovereign wealth funds, to leverage up the fund&quot;. Osborne also ruled UK support for a financial transaction tax at an EU27 level, proposed by Germany and France, saying the UK would not support such a measure unless it was implemented around the world. He said &quot;We are not opposed to financial transaction taxes in principle\u2014after all, we have stamp duty on shares in this country\u2014but we will not have a financial transaction tax at a European Union level while countries such as America, China, Singapore and others do not have one.

Johnson has written to the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, to warn that introducing a financial transactions tax across member states would drive business to financial centres outside the EU and damage its economy. He has urged Barroso to drop the proposals at the &quot;earliest opportunity&quot;. Both Johnson and the Conservatives in government are opposed to a levy unless it has been agreed globally. Johnson said the tax would hamper competition with rival financial centres such as New York and Singapore, which would not have such a levy. In his letter he argues that financial services are a key London industry and a significant employer, accounting for about 330,000 jobs \u2013 or 8% of London&apos;s workforce. &quot;At a time when many EU member economies are struggling, some on their knees, it would be madness to weigh them down with this new millstone. Apart from weakening its financial sectors and London&apos;s in particular, it will hamper the ability of businesses across Europe to compete in the global market and have serious implications for EU jobs. &quot;These proposals should be dropped immediately and energy directed towards designing sensible reforms which also support and promote the EU&apos;s financial services sectors and the growth of member states&apos; economies.&quot; He added: &quot;I would only consider an FTT if it were adopted globally by all our major competitors given the global market in which London&apos;s financial services operate. As I believe this to be currently an unfeasible proposition, not least given the opposition of the United States, much further groundwork would be needed before meaningful proposals could be put forward for adoption.&quot; The proposal in Europe for a levy widely known as the Tobin tax \u2013 after the US economist who proposed it in the 1970s, James Tobin \u2014 would need the approval of the EU&apos;s 27 member states. The chancellor, George Osborne, reiterated the government&apos;s position in the Commons on Thursday after updating MPs on the eurozone rescue deal thrashed out in Brussels this week. He said Britain would not accept a financial transaction tax at an EU level &quot;while other places in the world don&apos;t have one&quot;. Labour is seeking to apply pressure ahead of the G20 summit in Cannes next week. Chris Leslie, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, accused the chancellor of a &quot;weak and defeatist attitude&quot;. He said &quot;concerted efforts&quot; were needed to broker a deal which would see the proposed levy apply in all of the world&apos;s big financial centres. &quot;The European Commission&apos;s proposals in September for an EU financial transaction tax fall short of the mark, not least because money raised would be used to simply top up the EU budget,&quot; Leslie wrote on the Labourlist.org website. &quot;Whilst there are real barriers to winning this debate on the international stage there is also a real window of opportunity right now to do so. But by suggesting he thinks unanimous agreement at the G20 is not &apos;terribly likely&apos;, George Osborne seems willing to let the matter rest there, giving the impression there is no point even arguing for it.&quot; He added: &quot;Waiting for unanimity before even engaging with the issue means giving a veto to those who have vested interests in killing off the idea, or letting those with very different goals for the idea than the many millions of campaigners around the world set the terms of debate and potentially make it harder for Britain ever to join a scheme. &quot;The time has come for Britain to step up and show the leadership needed to broker a better deal, by being open to the idea that it is possible to win the argument for a different approach.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/30/sebastian-vettel-indian-grand-prix", "sentences": ["Instead the main topic was what appears to be a strange enmity between the two drivers from McLaren and Ferrari, who had their difficulties as early as Monaco in May, before other happenings at Silverstone, Singapore (twice), Japan and here."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-30T11:24:17Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel cruises to victory in inaugural Indian Grand Prix", "tags": ["Formula One 2011", "Lewis Hamilton", "Sebastian Vettel", "McLaren", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "It was left to that remarkable facial contortionist Rowan Atkinson, a guest of the McLaren team, to convey the true sense of the frustration experienced by Lewis Hamilton and his employers after yet another collision with Felipe Massa here\u00a0on Sunday. Atkinson watched Sebastian Vettel lead from start to finish in the inaugural Indian Grand Prix for his 11th win of the season, and the 21st of his career, rounding it off with the fastest lap of the year at the end. But Atkinson reserved one of Mr\u00a0Bean&apos;s most anguished expressions as Hamilton&apos;s awful season continued and his meaningful interest in the race was ended before it was half-finished. When it was all over, the mind drifted back to the intense rivalry between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost a generation ago and, more recently, that between Michael Schumacher and pretty well any other driver out there, although Damon Hill and Kimi Raikkonen come most readily to mind. But while Senna, Prost and Schumacher were usually at the sharp end of their races, Hamilton&apos;s and Massa&apos;s bitter competition is being played out among the also-rans on the grid, albeit two of the best also-rans in a season that has ben witheringly dominated by Vettel. The talk should have been about Vettel or perhaps another assured performance from Jenson Button, which confirmed his status as the second best driver in Formula One this year. After all, Button made his move early on the first lap to get ahead of Mark Webber and then produced some excellent driving to keep ahead of the Australian, who had the advantage of DRS on a track that encouraged overtaking. Webber then lost third to Fernando Alonso at the last stops but the talk was not about that either, or the circuit, which might have been rough and unready but at least provided a great track. Nor was the chatter about another strong drive from Schumacher, who finished fifth, ahead of his team-mate Nico Rosberg. Overlooked, too, was Force India&apos;s battle between Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta (Sutil won it) with new contracts in the offing. Narain Karthikeyan&apos;s performance was not talked about much either, even though he was India&apos;s solitary driver in the race and came 17th. Instead the main topic was what appears to be a strange enmity between the two drivers from McLaren and Ferrari, who had their difficulties as early as Monaco in May, before other happenings at Silverstone, Singapore (twice), Japan and here. They were pitted against each other, of course, at the climax of the 2008 season, when Hamilton won his title at the last gasp of the season, depriving Massa of what was surely his only chance of becoming world champion. Even before the race the two drivers came together as the world of motor sport observed a minute&apos;s silence following the recent deaths of Dan Wheldon and Marco Simoncelli. Then, allegedly, Hamilton put his arm round Massa but the offer of camaraderie was only partly recognised. Massa has clashed with Hamilton four times in the past month. To be fair, the Brazilian has represented only part of Hamilton&apos;s problems this season. The British driver is Formula One&apos;s most compelling act, a driver of such pace and daring menace that the others, however good they are, cannot match his box-office appeal. This year, however, Hamilton has cut a forlorn figure. Last year he ended his professional relationship with his father Anthony; more recently he has broken with his long-term girlfriend. He has also felt the pressure from Button, who has moved serenely on and who now looks certain to become Hamilton&apos;s first McLaren team-mate to defeat him; he has an advantage of 38 points with two races remaining. Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren&apos;s team principal, said on Sunday night: &quot;If you&apos;re honest, the first driver you want to beat is your team-mate. We don&apos;t hide from that and nor does Lewis or Jenson. They are there to beat each other and Jenson&apos;s been on a run. Lewis is the great, exciting driver but he will not like being beaten by his team-mate. I don&apos;t want him to like it, and the other way round.&quot; Whitmarsh was less happy to talk about personal issues. &quot;I&apos;ve got my own views on that. But he is a professional racing driver in this team and I will contain my comments to that. And as a professional racing driver he drove brilliantly at the last race. He made a mistake on Friday but he was completely open about it. It&apos;s not for me to speculate on his personal life.&quot; Whitmarsh really wanted to talk about Button, though he was fighting an uphill battle: &quot;I feel sorry for Jenson really because he made a fantastic start. It was assertive, aggressive but great, to get through to second place. Then he looked after his tyres and didn&apos;t put a foot wrong. &quot;At the end of the race he came within two and a half seconds of Sebastian, who frankly had the legs of us today, again. But for Jenson to be that close he did a brilliant job. He&apos;s been driving so well.&quot; But no one drove better than Vettel here and he already looks a firm favourite to make it a hat-trick of titles next year. The team principal, Christian Horner, said: &quot;I think Seb wanted to demonstrate what he&apos;s capable of. He wanted to ensure he had the perfect weekend; race win, pole and fastest lap. I think that was one of the best drives of his year.

Fair Work Australia, an independent arbiter, ordered that rolling industrial action be halted in a ruling that forces Qantas and three unions to return to the negotiating table. It also ends one of the most extraordinary acts of industrial brinkmanship of recent times, which had seen the world&apos;s second oldest airline ground its entire fleet on Saturday in apparent exasperation at union behaviour, catching the Australian government and passengers by surprise. Alan Joyce, Qantas chief executive, said the airline aimed to have some planes in the air by the early hours of Monday morning, UK time. &quot;We will be getting our aircraft back up in the air as soon as we possibly can,&quot; he said. &quot;It could be as early as Monday afternoon (Australia time) on a limited schedule with the approval of the regulator. I apologise to all Qantas passengers that have been impacted by the industrial action by unions over the past few months and, in particular, the past few days.&quot; The airline&apos;s Heathrow services are expected to resume by Monday evening or Tuesday morning , but a full restoration of global operations is complicated by the fact that the carrier has more than 108 aircraft parked around the world. Qantas said 68,000 passengers had been affected, nearly 500 flights had been cancelled, and that keeping its planes on the ground had cost the airline A$20m (\u00a313m) a day. However, economists fear the cost to the Australian economy could have been 10 times as much. There was tangible relief that the furore had not dragged beyond the weekend. The Australian government, which appointed the tribunal, after Qantas grounded planes on Saturday, welcomed the ruling. But the prime minister, Julia Gillard, reiterated her unhappiness with the timing of Qantas&apos;s decision to ground its fleet. &quot;In terms of the practicalities of this, as late as Friday Qantas was reassuring the government that they were in negotiations in this dispute. At 2pm on Saturday they told the transport minister, Anthony Albanese, the fleet would be grounded at 5pm. No ifs, no buts,&quot; she told ABC radio. The Qantas dispute is taking place against a backdrop of industrial tension across an airline industry that is struggling to cope with higher fuel costs and the rise of Asian and middle eastern carriers operating out of booming markets with lower cost bases. Qantas in particular has been affected by competition with the likes of Emirates and Singapore Airlines, prompting the airline to announce a restructuring in August with the loss of 1,000 jobs and moving some operations to Asia. Industrial action ensued and had been going for weeks when Joyce unexpectedly pulled the plug on operations. Experts warned that Qantas is not alone in facing challenges that will need tough responses, with inevitable consequences for trade union relations. Air France cancelled one in five flights on Sunday after cabin crew stopped work for a second consecutive day to protest against employment conditions, while Iberia \u2013 the merger partner of British Airways \u2013 has received stern warnings from unions over its plan to launch a low-cost carrier. BA is viewed by many aviation executives as the standard bearer, having endured 22 days of strike action last year over a drive to cut cabin crew costs in what it said at the time was a &quot;fight for survival&quot; for the then loss-making carrier. Chris Tarry, an industry consultant, said airlines operating in oversubscribed markets, such as the US and Europe, had to cut costs. The entire industry operates on a collective profit margin of just over 1%. &quot;Business as usual is not an option for any airline,&quot; Tarry said. John Strickland, a consultant and former BA manager, said: &quot;There are still legacy carriers that need to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. If fuel prices are going to remain high and airlines are to maintain long-term profitability, then they have to change.&quot; One of Britain&apos;s most influential industrial relations lawyers, Marc Meryon of Eversheds, said: &quot;In any sector where cost pressures demand greater flexibility to remain competitive, employers will encounter resistance if they try to implement flexibility without union consent.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/30/commonwealth-human-rights-proselytisers", "sentences": ["This is hardly surprising, as the Commonwealth comprises a veritable who&apos;s who of governments with dubious human rights records \u2013 from Nigeria, Cameroon and Rwanda to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Singapore.", "Singapore is the model in microcosm; China is rolling it out on a far bigger scale, with Russia and others not far behind.", "Kagame makes clear his respect for the Singapore model, the so-called &quot;managed democracy&quot;, otherwise known as authoritarian capitalism."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-30T22:00:02Z", "title": "At the Commonwealth summit, the human rights proselytisers no longer hold sway | John Kampfner", "tags": ["Commonwealth summit", "Human rights", "Freedom of speech", "Freedom of religion", "Sri Lanka", "Rwanda", "China", "Uganda", "Trinidad and Tobago", "Australia news", "Africa", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "The death knell of the Commonwealth has been sounded for as long as there have been summits.

At their meeting in Perth over the weekend, the leaders rejected many of the recommendations of a report by a team of the great and good, the eminent persons group (EPG), designed to move the Commonwealth&apos;s democratic laggards towards basic norms. In search of a lowest-common-denominator consensus, the summit accepted some less controversial ideas, such as a charter. The idea of a human rights commissioner, however, proved too much. &quot;There have been a few blips like in any part of the world but I don&apos;t think it demanded a commissioner,&quot; noted Suruj Rambachan, the foreign minister of Trinidad. Under pressure from South Africa and other states, the summit even refused to publish the EPG&apos;s report. The former prime minister of Malaysia, who chaired the EPG, said the summit would be remembered as a failure. Malcolm Rifkind, the former UK foreign secretary, described the unwillingness to publish the report as a disgrace. This is hardly surprising, as the Commonwealth comprises a veritable who&apos;s who of governments with dubious human rights records \u2013 from Nigeria, Cameroon and Rwanda to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Singapore. The prospect of progress at the next gathering in two years&apos; time \u2013 hosted in, of all places, Sri Lanka \u2013 is even more remote. The Colombo government denounces any attempt to call it to account for human rights abuses. In front of their Commonwealth colleagues the Sri Lankans dismissed a UN-commissioned report on massacres against the Tamils as &quot;a travesty of justice and preposterous&quot;. The Canadians, meanwhile, are threatening to boycott the 2013 heads of government meeting in protest. The Commonwealth&apos;s weakness is specific to its history and its constitution. Any whiff of British lecturing is given short shrift; at the same time, all major decisions have to be taken by consensus, allowing recalcitrant countries to stop changes in their tracks. The only sanction, and one used rarely, is expulsion. But the problem is far bigger than the institution. It is one that has been exercising policymakers for years. What is the relationship between human rights and economic development? To what degree do they represent western or universal values? In my book, Freedom for Sale, I argued that the trade-off between liberty and prosperity had become more alluring than ever. Regimes that can satisfy what I call the &quot;private freedoms&quot; \u2013 such as travelling and making money \u2013 can quite easily ensure that citizens leave the public space to them. Singapore is the model in microcosm; China is rolling it out on a far bigger scale, with Russia and others not far behind. Economic growth is the motor; consumerism is the anaesthetic for the brain. This model has permeated into western chancelleries. For the Australian hosts of the Commonwealth conference, much of its economic boom has come from exporting raw materials to China. This has led to a recalibration in Australian priorities, with human rights concerns regarded in government as an inconvenient intrusion into trading relations. Only last month Julia Gillard, the prime minister, commissioned a white paper on Australia&apos;s place in the &quot;Asian century&quot;. It is safe to assume this will formally inject the notion of &quot;gradualism&quot; into discussions about free speech and other freedoms in Asia and Oceania. In so doing, the Australians will only be doing more overtly what the Europeans are undertaking by stealth. The more the Chinese save the flagging old economies, the more the new &quot;reality&quot; will be established. Watch the effect that any Chinese bailout of the euro will have on future political negotiations. The much-vaunted Beijing consensus is now the norm across most of the developing world. This is what gives the likes of Yoweri Museveni in Uganda and Paul Kagame in Rwanda their political confidence. Kagame makes clear his respect for the Singapore model, the so-called &quot;managed democracy&quot;, otherwise known as authoritarian capitalism. After the genocide of 1994 Kagame gradually brought about economic recovery and social stability. He regards strong education, contract law and anti-corruption drives as the true marks of progress. As for freedom of expression, he points to the hate speech that fuelled the massacres, predominantly by Hutu militias, and he sees it as a luxury at best and divisive at worst. A number of journalists and opposition figures have been killed in recent years. In the 2010 general election, with most parties banned, he received an absurd 93% of the vote. In an interview on Sunday with Andrew Marr, Kagame brushed aside tentative questioning, dismissing criticism of his human rights record as &quot;absolute nonsense&quot;. In the same programme David Cameron threatened to withhold UK aid from countries that do not &quot;adhere to proper human rights&quot;. British economic assistance should have &quot;more strings attached&quot;, he said, particularly on the question of repression of homosexuality. But he conceded that countries could not change immediately, and that it would be a &quot;journey&quot;. Leaving aside the many examples of hypocrisy and double standards (who can forget the prime minister trying to flog weapons to dodgy Middle Eastern regimes days before launching the Franco-British &quot;human intervention&quot; in Libya), this message now has even less salience than it has ever done. The role of western governments in proselytising about human rights has been hugely compromised. In most instances nowadays it is counterproductive. African and Asian countries can simply look to China and its allies and reap the rewards of a less squeamish approach to individual liberty. Yet there is room for considerable optimism, and it lies in bottom-up movements, fuelled by new communications tools such as in Tunisia and Egypt. Ultimately, it is only through grassroots pressure that real improvement will come about."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/30/mclaren-lewis-hamilton-felipe-massa", "sentences": ["We cannot have these things being bigger than they are because they will be on the mind of the drivers, which is not good.&quot; The incident was the fourth collision between the pair in a month, following two incidents in Singapore and another minor brush in Japan."], "publicationDate": "2011-10-30T22:01:00Z", "title": "McLaren order Lewis Hamilton to sort out relations with Felipe Massa", "tags": ["Formula One 2011", "Lewis Hamilton", "Felipe Massa", "McLaren", "Ferrari", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa have been ordered to sort out their differences by the team bosses of McLaren and Ferrari, after the drivers clashed for the sixth time this season during the inaugural Indian Grand Prix on Sunday. Sebastian Vettel&apos;s 11th victory of the season was overshadowed by the incident, at turn five of lap 24, when Hamilton attempted to pass Massa on the inside and the Brazilian turned into him. The stewards came down on Hamilton&apos;s side, by giving Massa a drive-through penalty. &quot;They&apos;re young drivers but they&apos;re not that young,&quot; said Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team principal. &quot;They&apos;re men. They&apos;ve got to figure it out for themselves. They have to sort it out. They&apos;ve been coming together too frequently. Clearly Lewis and Felipe are magnetic.&quot; Whitmarsh&apos;s remarks were echoed by his opposite number at Ferrari, Stefano Domenicali, who when asked whether the pair were &quot;magnetic&quot; replied: &quot;Who is the plus and who is the minus? &quot;We can sit down together and play cards but it will not solve the issue. One thing that is crucial in my view is that we need to make sure there is a coherent approach from the stewards about things that happen on the track. &quot;We cannot avoid the fact there were a lot of kisses between them on the track. We cannot have these things being bigger than they are because they will be on the mind of the drivers, which is not good.&quot; The incident was the fourth collision between the pair in a month, following two incidents in Singapore and another minor brush in Japan. Massa appeared to come off better initially but while Hamilton eventually finished seventh Massa retired, because of suspension damage from a later incident. Hamilton, who was advised not to give his normal press conference after the race, said before he left the track: &quot;There is not much to say. &apos;Disappointed&apos; would be an understatement. I tried to overtake but I tried to pull out of it as he didn&apos;t give me any space and we collided. I&apos;ve had to apologise to the team after yet another disastrous race. It&apos;s been an eventful year. Felipe is very reluctant to let me by. He makes his car as wide as he can.&quot; Massa said: &quot;My view is that I braked later than him. I was in front. I was in the grippy area as well. I didn&apos;t see him and then I started to turn. So he is behind and he touched my rear wheel. &quot;To be honest I don&apos;t understand why I have the penalty. It is really not understandable.&quot; Asked if a feud existed, the Brazilian said: &quot;Maybe for him, because in all the incidents he touched my car. I didn&apos;t do anything wrong. That&apos;s the umpteenth time he&apos;s crashed into me \u2013 it must be some fatal attraction.&quot; Hamilton claimed Massa had ignored a peace move by the Briton before the race as the teams observed a minute&apos;s silence to mark the recent deaths of Dan Wheldon and Marco Simoncelli. Hamilton said: &quot;We were standing next to each other \u2013 and he hasn&apos;t spoken to me for a long, long time \u2013 and I put my arm around him and wished him good luck for the race. He gave me a really small acknowledgement, which was to be expected. I wasn&apos;t expecting anything more really.&quot; Massa denied there had been any waving of olive branches. &quot;No, he didn&apos;t try. When I tried to speak to him he passed through.

Think of one league table you&apos;d rather forget. Who&apos;s top in maths until the next round of assessment in 2012? China-Shanghai by miles, with Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan clustered behind. The UK is 28th, the US 31st. And in reading? Shanghai, Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong all over again, with only gallant little Finland, in third place, to disrupt this tale of eastern promise. UK: 25; USA: 17. Science?

This is our future, our Anglo-American future, our European future \u2013 and we&apos;re blowing it. We trot out the old Blair mantra from memory. Education, education, education. We demand that entrepreneurs start new businesses to ease the crushing weight of unemployment. But when it comes to turning out entrepreneurs and technical wizards, the job creators of tomorrow, we are way off the pace. A facile parody of Chinese achievement sees workers toiling for 12 or 14 hours a day for pitiful reward. A more accurate version would see us being outgunned, year after year, in quality and in numbers. Tom Friedman of the New York Times broods over this in his latest book (That Used to Be Us, co-authored with Michael Mandelbaum) and finds naught for either Washington or Westminster comfort. Are the samples representative? Yes they are. Does Finland do so well because it&apos;s a small, homogenous nation that puts teacher standards and teacher pay high on its agenda? Yes again. So perhaps we can&apos;t expect the US or the UK, with its wide spread of immigrants, languages and backgrounds, to do anything close to as well \u2026 Except that Canada \u2013 huge, very mixed, multilingual Canada \u2013 is in Pisa&apos;s top 10 under all three categories. There are no excuses. Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Switzerland are consistently above OECD average. The powerhouses of Obama and Cameron are severely underpowered. Not everything is identical. American primary education is good enough; the problems set in at high school. British primary schooling, in contrast, turns out thousands upon thousands without elementary reading or numerical skills, kids condemned to failure at an obscenely early age. Part of our difficulty lies in bringing deprived inner-city schools up to snuff, of course; but the difficulty beyond that \u2013 the one that ought to be haunting us just as much \u2013 is that the schools we deem adequate, OK to middling, are falling far, far off the world pace as well. Don&apos;t forget the riots, the poverty traps, society&apos;s chronic instabilities, to be sure. But look outwards, towards competitor countries where high levels of education and application keep growth rolling along. Of course all the familiar principles of fairness and equal opportunity still matter. But if Singapore can turn out 10,000 brilliant computer programmers and we can only manage 1,000, then equality won&apos;t give us the critical mass of talent we need. OK isn&apos;t OK any longer. Revoltingly fat pay packets for OK business managers from Baltimore to Bradford aren&apos;t OK either. China isn&apos;t bailing out the euro or the dollar by chance this time round. It&apos;s putting so much more in to get so much more out of us in a jam."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/population-growth-resources-investment-opportunities", "sentences": ["The Singapore and Hong Kong dual-listed company Sound Global is operating water and wastewater treatment solutions across China, providing drinking water to areas where lack of water has led to strikes and conflict."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-01T12:12:40Z", "title": "Spectacular population growth creates investment opportunities", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Behaviour", "Adaptation", "Innovation", "Emerging markets", "Strategy"], "article": "It was announced today that the world&apos;s seven billionth person was born on Sunday 30 October. This has served as an alarming reminder that the global population continues to expand in an unsustainable way. The six billionth person was born as recently as 1998. By 2050, according to most estimates, there will be nine billion people living on the planet. After that, forecasts vary between a more optimistic one which sees population flattening out and pessimistic ones which see a continued increase. Either way, all population observers agree that the increase in population is putting a huge strain on global resources, especially energy, food and water. And as the world population uses more resources, so it creates more pollution of land, sea and air. Atmospheric pollution, especially in the form of climate change, could lead to consequences which will threaten the very population that is causing it. But as with so many man-made problems, there are man-made innovations that could solve or mitigate these problems, were they to be adopted globally. It is towards these solution providers that the IM WHEB Sustainability Fund looks for its investment themes. With more than 1.1 billion people living without clean drinking water, water scarcity and stress require innovative solutions. Water shortages are affecting many parts of the world, exacerbated in particular by increased use from agriculture and increased industrial usage, but also made worse by climate change. Companies equipped to transport and distribute water, and upgrade or build infrastructure, are seeing impressive growth. Rapid economic development in China has had a dire effect on the country&apos;s water resources, according to Dr Zhu Chunquan, WWF&apos;s China conservation director of biodiversity, &quot;one third of rivers and lakes are now polluted&quot;. The Singapore and Hong Kong dual-listed company Sound Global is operating water and wastewater treatment solutions across China, providing drinking water to areas where lack of water has led to strikes and conflict. While the developing world rolls out its water infrastructure, the developed world faces the problem of a crumbling existing water infrastructure. Cash-strapped governments are delaying spending money on upgrading water infrastructure, but this can be a costly delay: $2.6bn and 1.7tn gallons are lost every year from leaking pipes in the US. We invest in Aegion Corporation which provides services for leaky pipes without having to dig up the entire road. We are also interested in companies that help curb demand for water by accurately measuring its usage. Our favourite of the water metering companies is Elster, a German company quoted in the US. Another effect of population growth and increased industrial activity in the developing world is the issue of waste management. The clean disposal of waste water and materials becomes increasingly important to avoid another situation like the &quot;great Pacific garbage patch&quot; or &quot;plastic soup&quot; in the North Pacific Ocean, which is a vast area of high concentration of plastics, chemical sludge and other debris that has been trapped by the currents of the North Pacific Gyre. We invest in waste management services companies such as Viridor (via its parent company Pennon), Republic Services (US) and Shanks (UK) which, we believe, will play an important role in this sub sector. The combination of an increased population and increased industrial activity is leading to worrying projections from climate change scientists. The need to find alternative methods of producing energy, and ways to use less energy, are crucial if the population is going to transition itself to a low carbon fuelled existence. It is interesting that the largest population growth over the coming years is forecast to be in developing countries, which have much lower carbon emissions than the developed world, with its relatively small, ageing and slowing population. Therefore, the clear challenge facing us now is how to promote economic development and growth, in a resource-efficient way, something the developed world did not do during its industrial revolution. Clearly, alternative energy producers are part of the solution, but so also are the companies that are providing energy efficiency solutions. The French companies St Gobain and Schneider and the US company Johnson Controls are providing energy-efficient building materials and insulation which both reduce fuel bills and carbon emissions. The global population is growing not just because more people are being born. Part of the reason that population is increasing is that people are living longer. In the EU, for example, the number of people over the age of 85 is set to treble between 2005 and 2050. Once over the age of 85, a person uses on average nine times the amount of healthcare products and services that someone under the age of 65 uses. Again, crises breed opportunities. The IM WHEB Sustainability Fund also focuses on the ageing side of demographics. We select companies that target typical illnesses that afflict the elderly, such as companies offering dental care, renal care, hearing aids, orthopaedics and cardiology. Currently in our portfolio we have leaders in the field such as kidney dialysis services provider Fresenius Medical Care (Germany), and Smith &amp; Nephew, the industry leader in orthopaedic reconstruction. The challenges created by a burgeoning population will provide compelling investment opportunities over the next few decades. In the current climate of fear around the credit crisis, we think there is an interesting opportunity to back companies that are playing an important role in helping the world adapt to its changing demography.

Last week the prominent agent Andrew &quot;Chubby&quot; Chandler was reeling after losing his &quot;star&quot; client Rory McIlroy. This week he is back on the horse and in Shanghai, breakfasting with the cream of young Chinese golfers and trying to add Asia&apos;s next golfing superstar to his roster. In the eyes of many 20-year-old Noh Seung-yul, currently ranked 93rd in the world, poses one of the biggest threats to McIlroy&apos;s hopes of dominating professional golf for the next decade. But from where Chandler is sitting the talented but virtually unknown (outside of the cognoscenti and of course his golf-mad homeland) Korean is the embodiment of a modern golfing truism. &quot;Asia is where it is to be in this game, it is where it is all happening. We in golf need to recognise that and embrace it,&quot; he says. Casting around the Sheshan International golf club, venue for the HSBC Champions tournament which starts on Thursday, it seems Chandler need have no worries. The heavy hitters of the professional game \u2013 agents, players, sponsors \u2013 are here in force and have been for some time. Lee Westwood, McIlroy and Ian Poulter arrived in China three weeks ago to take part in a week-long, cross-country exhibition match (eight courses, seven cities, a total of 18 holes) for which they each picked up a fee believed be at least $500,000 (\u00a3312,000). They have been here in Shanghai since \u2013 long enough for Westwood to pick up a few phrases of Mandarin, for McIlroy to collect the $2m winner&apos;s cheque (the biggest in the sport) at the Shanghai Masters on Sunday and for Poulter to become evangelical about Asia&apos;s status as golf&apos;s emerging powerhouse. &quot;In a purely golfing sense they have some amazing talent. I played with Noh last week and he is a seriously, seriously awesome player. A tall, slim kid who hits it 330 yards off the tee \u2013 watch out when he gains a bit more experience playing against the world&apos;s best players,&quot; the Englishman says. If current trends are anything to go by, Noh will get all the experience he needs and he won&apos;t have to travel too far either. This week the caravan has stopped in Shanghai. Next week it will arrive in Singapore. Between now and the end of the European Tour season in December there will be five more events in Asia. &quot;I used to say in five years&apos; time there will be more European Tour events in Asia than there will be on continental Europe,&quot; says Chandler. &quot;I now think that will happen in three years. The shift is happening that quickly.&quot; That shift isn&apos;t just reflected in the scheduling of the European and US PGA Tour (which last week staged an event in Malaysia) it is also reflected in the priorities of the biggest names in the sport. While most of the world&apos;s top players are in Shanghai this week, Tiger Woods has slipped into Singapore, where he is reportedly doing some corporate work on behalf of a Las Vegas-based casino company. Like everyone else in the sport, the former world No1 is gravitating to where the money is to be found. Chandler explains how the economics work. &quot;What we have now is a bunch of golfers who are willing and able to travel to Asia. You have companies here that are booming, an economy that is growing between seven and 10% a year, you have a growing middle class and a growing interest in golf. Put all of those things together and you can see why we are seeing more and more tournaments in this part of the world,&quot; he says. Contrast all of that with what is happening in Europe, both in the broader economic sense and in the world of professional golf. &quot;How can a company that is, say, English possibly justify putting up two or three million pounds to stage a golf tournament when they are laying people off? They can&apos;t,&quot; says Chandler. The upshot will be fewer events in Europe \u2013 an inevitability that is met with differing emotions on the range in Shanghai. Poulter is one of those who believes golfers should embrace their world as it is and not as they would like it to be. &quot;It would be good if, say, there were a couple more tournaments in England but that&apos;s not going to happen right now, is it. So let&apos;s get on with it.&quot; The Englishman&apos;s insouciance is not universally shared, at least not by Thomas Bjorn, one of continental Europe&apos;s best ever players. &quot;From a personal point of view I&apos;m always happy to come to Asia. The courses are good, we are treated very well and the prize money is good,&quot; says the Dane. &quot;But I&apos;m worried about the effect all of this will have on the game in Europe. If we don&apos;t have tournaments in certain European countries how are we going to generate and maintain interest in golf?&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/john-elkington-long-term-planning-business-strategy", "sentences": ["I was in Singapore, preparing for presentations featuring our new report, The Future Quotient about sustainability stars of the future.", "As lightning flashed through immense tropical clouds outside my Singapore bedroom, I went back to fundamentals, pondering whether 100-year plans are actually useful or achievable?"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-02T18:41:31Z", "title": "Spoofed!

Visit Wikipedia and you&apos;ll find that the possibilities include such delights as fake vomit, chewing gum bugs, exploding cigars, stink bombs and whoopee cushions. Call me prissy, but even as a child I was never much taken by the Keystone Kops or by Laurel and Hardy. But I loved the Marx Brothers and, later, the antics of Yippies!, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, aka the &quot;Groucho Marxists&quot;. Their attempt to levitate the Pentagon in 1967 was my favourite stunt, but their dropping a fistful of dollars over traders in the New Stock Exchange and, separately, trying to enter a pig for a presidential race ran a close second. As a lover of history, I also pored over hoaxes from the Trojan Horse through to Operation Mincemeat, designed to mislead the Nazis about Allied plans for the invasion of Sicily. But one of my favourite spoofs was executed by The Guardian in 1977. It involved the paper publishing a seven-page supplement celebrating the tenth anniversary of the independence of the imaginary island state of San Serriffe \u2013 a hoax so successful that it apparently spawned further versions in 1978, 1980 and 1999. But it&apos;s a bit different when you&apos;re caught out yourself \u2013 as I was last week. I was in Singapore, preparing for presentations featuring our new report, The Future Quotient about sustainability stars of the future. Carrying out some further background research via Google, I stumbled upon a disconcerting thread that we had missed. In the process, I discovered that one of the 50 &quot;Stars of Seriously Long-term Innovation&quot; featured in the report had been an elaborate hoax. This was Project Virgle, a 100-year plan developed by Google and Virgin. The wildly ambitious aim: to build a city on Mars. There was something about this that chimed with what we already thought we knew about the two companies. When we had surveyed corporate social responsibility and sustainability experts around the world, as part of the project, Google and Virgin had both been mentioned repeatedly as highly innovative businesses. Richard Branson has his Virgin Galactic and Google has its $30m (\u00a319m) Lunar X-Prize, which will go to the first privately funded team to land operational robots on the Moon. At the same time, Project Virgle, with its century-long time-scale, seemed to be exactly the sort of initiative we were looking for. Apart from the need for better fact checking, several key lessons emerge. First, hoaxes work best when their victims see in them what they want to see \u2013 in our case, companies apparently embracing very different time horizons. Second, if and when you fall victim, be open about your mistakes \u2013 as soon as you discover them. Third, learn the necessary lessons, however painful. And, fourth, move on. As lightning flashed through immense tropical clouds outside my Singapore bedroom, I went back to fundamentals, pondering whether 100-year plans are actually useful or achievable? On balance, as long as no one expects the future to run on rails, I think the answer is yes. Indeed, I recently helped the Dow Chemical Company stretch its thinking to 2097, when it expects to celebrate its 200th anniversary. Certainly, there are those who think it makes sense to think a century or so into the future. Some years back, for example, I found myself standing next to a Chinese government minister overlooking Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Partway through the proceedings, he turned to me and observed that the trouble with the West is that market capitalism and democracy mean that we are often dangerously myopic. China, he insisted, can \u2013 and does \u2013 think 100 years ahead. Clearly, if you are involved in planning urban infrastructures or studying climate change or ocean acidification, inter-generational timescales make sense \u2013 because solutions cannot be developed and deployed in normal human timescales. Many moons ago I trained in long-term planning, but we live in such turbulent times that I would be very wary of anyone who told me they could plan 50 years into the future, let alone 100. Still, if I came across a serious attempt at Virgling, with companies joining forces to address major environmental, social or governance challenges over inter-generational timescales, I would be first in the queue to buy a copy of their plan. But what do you think? Does it make sense to produce 100-year plans? If so, who would you like to see produce such plans? Are there any existing models that you think are worth building on?

Speaking a day after police sealed the offices of his Movement for Democratic Change party (MDC), firing teargas into the building and at bystanders in central Harare, Morgan Tsvangirai said: &quot;It appears the demons of violence are back \u2013 a siege mood seems to be slowly gripping the country. &quot;The state security agents have instituted a coup over the civilian authority and they are now above the law, to the extent of disrupting government programmes and assaulting civilians with impunity.&quot; Incidents of political violence decreased after Mugabe and Tsvangirai formed a unity government following disputed elections in 2008 during which more than 200 people died, but talk of a possible poll next year has reignited tensions. Tsvangirai remains critical of the president for clinging to power, but describes the relationship in their weekly meetings as cordial. He has told of heated exchanges between MDC ministers and Mugabe&apos;s Zanu-PF in cabinet. The MDC claims the power-sharing compromise has allowed it to make progress in reviving the economy and improving schools and hospitals. But in the past few weeks police have disrupted Tsvangirai&apos;s rallies in the western Matabeleland region, where the MDC won the majority of parliamentary seats in 2008. On Saturday, Zanu-PF militants disrupted an MDC rally organised by a minister jointly responsible for police affairs. Tsvangirai said: &quot;The violence we are witnessing is state-sponsored and state-driven. It is being championed by a few fascist leaders who want to reverse the little progress we have made. &quot;The country is at a high risk of imploding if some in the leadership continue to be privately abetting lawlessness while publicly preaching non-violence.&quot; Tsvangirai said Mugabe had assured him, during a meeting on Tuesday, that the issue of violence would be dealt with. He gave no further details. In a speech to parliament in September, Mugabe called for an end to violence. While he was speaking, Zanu-PF supporters attacked MDC activists outside. Zanu-PF denies engaging in violence and instead accuses MDC supporters of provoking its supporters. Some analysts believe Zanu-PF is rattled by speculation over Mugabe&apos;s failing health and that he could even face a challenge from within the bitterly divided party at its conference next month. Senior figures are said to be worried that the 87-year-old is unfit for another arduous campaign. On Sunday, Mugabe returned from a private visit to Singapore, to which he travels on an almost monthly basis, apparently for medical reasons. Tsvangirai said Mugabe should consider resigning now. &quot;The question of age is catching up, the question of health is catching up,&quot; he added. &quot;I am sure that advisably he would be in a position for the sake of the country, for the sake of his legacy, for the sake of his children, to consider stepping down.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/03/malaysia-obedient-wives-sex-manual", "sentences": ["The club is believed to have at least 800 members in Malaysia and has branches in Indonesia, Singapore, Jordan and Britain.", "God created them like that.&quot; Her comments have been echoed by Darlan Zaini, co-founder of the Singapore club, who said: &quot;In Islam, if the husband wants sex and the wife is not in the mood, she has to give in to him."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-03T18:06:55Z", "title": "Malaysia bans Obedient Wives Club sex manual", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Women", "Life and style"], "article": "The Malaysian government is to ban a sex manual written by the head of an Islamic sect that teaches women to &quot;be submissive and keep their spouses happy in the bedroom&quot;, for fear it could cause religious confusion. In the 115-page book \u2013 entitled Islamic Sex \u2013 the founder of the Obedient Wives Club outlines her experiences of, and opinions on, marriage. It has passages on how couples should physically and spiritually approach sex, and claims that most women only satisfy 10% of their husbands&apos; sexual needs. Club leaders, who argue that a wife should serve as a &quot;good sex worker&quot; and a &quot;whore&quot; to her husband, showed the book to journalists last month in an effort to dispel what they called misconceptions that it was obscene and demeaning to women. They said the book, which contains no explicit photographs, was intended to be a spiritual guide read exclusively by club members to help them better understand sex. Many Malaysians have denounced the club, saying it makes a mockery of modern gender roles in a country where women hold prominent posts in both the government and the private sector. A spokesman for the home ministry said the government&apos;s Islamic affairs department had studied the manual and recommended a ban on the grounds that it may confuse Malaysian Muslims about what constitutes acceptable religious teaching. People caught in possession of it could be fined up to 5,000 ringgit (\u00a3995), the spokesman said, and anyone who makes copies for sale could be imprisoned for three years and fined 20,000 ringgit. Representatives of the club did not respond to calls made to them on Thursday. The club is believed to have at least 800 members in Malaysia and has branches in Indonesia, Singapore, Jordan and Britain. Many members are in polygamous marriages, insisting the practice helps husbands to avoid committing adultery. The club&apos;s international vice-president, Rohaya Mohamad, explained the club&apos;s provocative pronouncements in an interview with a Malaysian paper earlier this year. &quot;Eve was created because Adam had needs,&quot; she told the Star. &quot;Men have [sexual] needs which they can&apos;t control. And if the needs are not fulfilled, men will find another woman. God created them like that.&quot; Her comments have been echoed by Darlan Zaini, co-founder of the Singapore club, who said: &quot;In Islam, if the husband wants sex and the wife is not in the mood, she has to give in to him.

His Decade of Destruction series of five films, shot over 10 years between 1980 and 1990 for\u00a0ITV and Channel 4, alerted the world to the systematic ravaging of the Amazon rainforest and helped to make the environment a political issue.     Adrian Cowell    The director began by filming colonists who had been given plots of land by the Brazilian government as they invaded the territory of a previously uncontacted tribe and began deforestation. The story was included in the first film, The Ashes of the Forest, which was aired in 1984. By 1990, the fires were being brought under control, but the colonisation had left three-quarters of the tribe dead. In between, there were similarly shocking stories. The murder of Chico Mendes, a rubber-tappers&apos; union leader and environmentalist with whom Cowell had worked closely, led to The Crusade for the Forest (1990), a film about the struggle to organise traditional communities to protect their\u00a0lands. After discovering that the World Bank was lending nearly half a billion dollars to the colonisation project, Cowell screened his footage at congressional hearings in the US. This formed part of\u00a0the campaign that resulted in the US cutting 20% off its annual donation to the World Bank, which then halted loan payments. Cowell documented the saga in his film Banking On Disaster (1987). His longer-term achievement was to trigger the founding of the Television Trust for the Environment (now TVE), which produces documentaries about the human and political causes of\u00a0devastation to the natural world. &quot;I need to be in the Amazon rainforest for 10 years,&quot; Cowell had told Richard Creasey, ATV&apos;s head of documentaries, in 1980. With no guarantee that the company would win back its broadcasting franchise two years later (it\u00a0was replaced by Central), the IBA, ITV&apos;s regulator, agreed that the programmes would be screened regardless of the outcome if they were made by a trust. So the new organisation was formed in conjunction with the UN\u00a0environment programme and the World Wildlife Fund, with\u00a0Cowell as\u00a0a\u00a0trustee. Cowell was born in Tongshan, China, where his British father worked for a\u00a0coalmining consortium. The family later moved to Australia. He\u00a0attended Ampleforth college in North Yorkshire and graduated in history from St\u00a0Catharine&apos;s College, Cambridge, in\u00a01955, when he became one of six former students to take part in the Oxford and Cambridge far eastern expedition from London to Singapore, via countries such as Afghanistan and Burma. Their film was screened in the BBC&apos;s Traveller&apos;s Tales series (1956), produced by David Attenborough. A year later, Cowell was part of an Oxford-Cambridge expedition filming in\u00a0the Brazilian rainforest, which gave him the material for his book The Heart of the Forest (1960). Subsequently working for the BBC, he directed three Carnival of Violence documentaries (1960, 1962, 1966) about the effects of western civilisation on Peruvian Indians. Switching to ITV, Cowell and the camera operator Chris Menges joined Tibetan guerrillas as they attacked a\u00a0Chinese military convoy for the Prix Italia-winning Raid into Tibet (1966). It was an early instance of Cowell&apos;s tenacity in bringing to the outside world largely unreported stories. The director then returned to Burma, under military dictatorship. In The Unknown War (1966), he and Menges filmed the Shan guerrillas. During six months in the remote Shan state, from where much of the world&apos;s heroin originated, they also shot footage for The Opium Trail (1966). The pair returned to the subject in The Opium Warlords (1974), when they were trapped in Burma for 18 months and survived several ambushes, and the series Opium (1978). Cowell updated the\u00a0story in The Heroin Wars (1996). He was back in Brazil for the award-winning The Tribe That Hides from Man (1970), trekking through the Amazon to make contact with Indians never previously seen by the outside world; The Kingdom in the Jungle (1971) and The Last of the Hiding Tribes (1999). For 30 years, the quiet, contemplative Cowell was part of the formidable documentaries department established by ATV and Central, which also included John Pilger, Antony Thomas, Michael Grigsby, Brian Moser and, for a while, Ken Loach \u2013 until such films became rare\u00a0on ITV. When he later made Fires of\u00a0the Amazon (2002) for the BBC&apos;s Correspondent series, he found some rubber-tapper reserves protected and the sustainable logging of timber, but the Brazilian government was building roads that would cause further deforestation. Cowell&apos;s marriage to Pilly Chamberlayne in 1960 was dissolved in 2008. He\u00a0is survived by their daughter, Boojie, and Barbara Bramble, his partner since 1987. His son, Xingu, died in a canoeing accident in 1986. \u2022 John Adrian Cowell, director, born 2\u00a0February 1934; died 11 October 2011"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/nov/04/stephen-fry-qantas-flight-diverted", "sentences": ["Flight QF31, heading from Singapore to London, landed safely with its 258 passengers and 25 crew unhurt.", "A year ago another Qantas A380 suffered a midair engine explosion after takeoff from Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-04T09:17:34Z", "title": "Stephen Fry's Qantas flight diverted to Dubai", "tags": ["Stephen Fry", "UK news", "Culture", "Air transport", "World news", "Dubai", "Airline industry", "Business", "Qantas"], "article": "In a week when its whole fleet was grounded amid a dispute with striking staff, the last thing Qantas needed was an engine failure on a plane carrying a man with more than 3 million Twitter followers.

Forced to land in Dubai. An engine has decided not to play,&quot; he tweeted. The flight crew noticed a problem with the oil level, forcing it to shut down the engine, according to a Qantas spokeswoman, Olivia Wirth. Flight QF31, heading from Singapore to London, landed safely with its 258 passengers and 25 crew unhurt. A year ago another Qantas A380 suffered a midair engine explosion after takeoff from Singapore. In that case a defective engine pipe leaked oil, sparking a fire that destroyed a turbine disc and sent pieces of the disc into the plane&apos;s wing, an Australian safety report said. A380s around the world were grounded so the engine-maker Rolls-Royce could replace the part. Wirth said the anniversary was a coincidence and the events were unrelated. &quot;This is a one-off incident,&quot; she said of the latest engine problem. &quot;Obviously it will be a priority of ours to work out what the particular problem is in this engine.&quot; Engineers were inspecting the plane in Dubai to see whether it could continue to London. The airline was finding hotels or alternative flights for passengers, Wirth said. Qantas grounded its entire fleet last weekend and threatened to lock out unions that had been staging months of strikes. The move stranded thousands of passengers around the world and enraged Australian government officials, who ordered an emergency tribunal hearing. On Sunday, the tribunal ordered the airline to end the lockout and the unions to halt their strikes. Flights resumed on Tuesday. On Wednesday officials said police were investigating the suspected sabotage of the entertainment system on a Qantas plane. Qantas said engineers noticed several wires were cut on the plane&apos;s in-flight entertainment system on 26 October, at the height of the labour dispute. The engineers&apos; union said it was unlikely the plane was sabotaged because of anything to do with the dispute. As passengers were kept waiting on the tarmac at Dubai for more than an hour, according to Fry, the comedian tweeted his frustration: &quot;@abcnews24 So either Sydney send another one out or they come to an accommodation with Emirates. Either way not a great week for #qantas !&quot; The airline was finally moved to reply via its own Twitter account after Fry tweeted that he had left his wallet on the plane and was considering &quot;taking up smoking again.

Qantas Airways, the Australian carrier which has a business &quot;alliance&quot; with British Airways, said it expected to spend $20m (\u00a312.5m) offering 100,000 return economy flights inside the country or to New Zealand. &quot;This ticket offer is one of a range of initiatives we will be launching as a way of saying sorry as we move forward into this period of stability,&quot; said Alan Joyce, the Qantas chief executive. &quot;Throughout the long period of industrial activity we have been acutely aware of the impact on our customers,&quot; he added saying this was the company&apos;s way of winning back customer loyalty. Qantas grounded its planes to force a resolution to an ongoing dispute with trade unions over pay, conditions and job security. The shutdown stranded tens of thousands of passengers and triggered a political storm. The government under the Welsh-born prime minister Julia Gillard stepped into the dispute and brought in workplace arbitration service, FairWork Australia, which then ordered an end to the industrial action. The airline said it would make further announcements about compensation packages in relation to customers based outside Australia and for members of its frequent flyer programme. The first tranche of free tickets will be available to anyone who was affected by the grounding and Qantas has promised to refund all &quot;reasonable losses&quot; for passengers affected by the drama. The Australian pilots&apos; union claims the airline is losing a &quot;pilot a day&quot; to rivals such as Middle East company, Emirates, and said it would have been &quot;a lot cheaper for them to work with their workforce&quot;. Irish-born Joyce worked at rival carrier Ansett when it collapsed in 2001, costing 17,000 jobs, and told local newspapers that the experience had scarred him: &quot;There were suicides, that was horrendous.&quot; He has been rounded on by politicians and the public alike, with the media dubbing him the nation&apos;s most loathed man, but Joyce said he was sick of what he described as &quot;racist&quot; slurs about his accent and heritage. &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any difference between attacking somebody because of their Irish accent and attacking someone because of their colour \u2013 they&apos;re all forms of racism,&quot; he said. Joyce is one of a triumvirate of top Irish aviation executives alongside Willie Walsh of BA \u2013 now part of the International Airlines Group (IAG) \u2013 and Michael O&apos;Leary, the boss of Ryanair. The trouble at Qantas is not over yet with the ground staff union saying it is considering a legal challenge to the ban imposed on any further strike action. There have also been technical problems. On Friday the airline was again hit by reliability worries when a flight from Singapore to London was diverted to Dubai after an engine was shut down and the incident occurred almost exactly one year after a mid-air engine explosion forced an emergency landing of a Qantas A380 jet in Singapore. That emergency landing resulted in Qantas yet again grounding for safety checks its entire fleet of A380 aircraft each of which is powered by four Rolls Royce engines. Many airlines around the world are struggling to cope with lower demand at a time of economic uncertainty, high fuel costs and ever increased competition and consolidation of companies continue. Last week Walsh announced his new IAG was forging a deal to buy loss-making bmi \u2013 formerly British Midlands \u2013 from Lufthansa of Germany. He rejected concerns the deal could produce an increase in fares, promising to use bmi&apos;s takeoff and landing slots at London&apos;s Heathrow as bridgeheads to cities in China, Korea, and Vietnam.

Who exactly was this &quot;Jane&quot; you spent so much time with? What other surprises might be lurking within the Jane-shaped shell you once called a friend? Where was she on the night of the fifth? Is that her real leg? Who is Keyser S\u00f6ze? Etc etc. Still, if it&apos;s slightly creepy when a friend behaves atypically, it&apos;s borderline terrifying when the person behaving out of character is wearing your shoes and your haircut and looks like you and is you. Take me for instance. For years, I thought I knew vaguely who I was, and the kind of things I liked. And one thing I&apos;d definitely class myself as is &quot;un-sporty&quot;. I&apos;ve never had a gym membership and have always been profoundly suspicious of anyone who willingly does anything more physically demanding than wiping their arse. So imagine my shock, in recent weeks, to find myself running around a local park. Not once, not while being chased in a waking nightmare, but voluntarily and\u00a0often. I confess: I have become a runner. I\u00a0go running. I run. Like a runner. Which is what I have become. A running runner. Forgive me. Oh Christ. Forgive me. It started innocuously, not to mention geekily. I stumbled across an app. An app designed to encourage couch potatoes to &quot;get into&quot; running by easing them in at a pace so non-threatening you&apos;d have to be physically glued to the sofa to be daunted by it. Here&apos;s how it works: you pop a pair of headphones in and put some music on. Then you start the app. It fades the music down for a moment and tells you to stroll around for about 90 seconds. Once that time limit&apos;s up, it interrupts again and politely asks you to run for 60 seconds. Sixty seconds, no longer. Then you walk for 90 seconds again. And so on. It&apos;s literally a walk in the park. And before you know it, the app&apos;s voice \u2013 a slightly patronising female whose accent hovers somewhere between Devon and Melbourne \u2013 is saying well done, that&apos;s enough for today, you can go home now, and incidentally you&apos;re wonderful. You repeat this three times a week; each time, it incrementally lengthens the run and shortens the walk. After nine weeks, to your own astonishment, you&apos;re running uninterrupted for 30\u00a0minutes. I always hated healthy outgoing types. Really despised them. And when they smugged on about how physical exercise gave them an endorphin rush, I felt like coughing blood in their eyes. Now, to my dismay, to my disgust, I discover they were right. If I don&apos;t get to run, I become irritable, like a constipated bear that can&apos;t find the woods. I have to get out there. And I run for longer: I&apos;m up to an hour at a time now, sometimes more. I remember the psychological barrier I had to pass through when I\u00a0bought my first pack of cigarettes. I&apos;d\u00a0cadged here, dabbled there, mainly at night, over a drink, until finally one day, I had to face facts: it was the middle of the afternoon, and I\u00a0was gasping. I popped into a newsagent&apos;s and bought my inaugural pack of Marlboros with a burning sense of\u00a0shame. I don&apos;t smoke any more, but I felt that shame again a few months ago, when I finally snapped and bought a decent pair of running shoes to replace the crappy trainers I&apos;d been using. Once that dam was broken, I bought some wanky running shorts. Not one pair \u2013 but several. I even bought a preposterous sports top made of some kind of cybernetic superskin designed to slurp sweat off your back and email\u00a0it to a parched section of the developing world. It&apos;s a fabric with its own trademarked name and diagram, squarely designed to appeal to the kind\u00a0of person I hate, and I own it. I\u00a0can\u00a0scarcely bear to look at myself in\u00a0the mirror. This is how low I&apos;ve sunk: I went on\u00a0holiday recently, all the way to Australia, and on the way there we stopped in Singapore for a night and I\u00a0\u2026 I can scarcely type this \u2026 I used the hotel gym. At 6.30am. God help me I\u00a0ran on a treadmill at 6.30am. With other people in the room. And then I\u00a0went on a cross-trainer. In full view of\u00a0everyone. It feels good to admit it. It\u00a0feels cleansing, somehow. And that was the first day of the holiday. I ran as often as I could after that. And then flew home and ran some more. Running, exercising, using gymnasiums \u2026 it&apos;s a betrayal of everything I stand for. I hope it&apos;s some kind of temporary life crisis. Or a complete mental breakdown from which I&apos;ll eventually recover. Otherwise I&apos;m going to have to start physically beating myself up. And even then, even as my own fists swoop towards my self-hating face, I&apos;ll be secretly anticipating the endorphin rush of all that extra exercise. Doomed.

Blackett, who chaired an inquiry earlier this year that published a report that was critical of governance at Twickenham, has been chief disciplinary officer since 2003. His report into the circumstances that led to the appointment and sacking of John Steele as RFU chief executive, submitted to the council in July but only made public 10 weeks later, led indirectly to the resignation last week of Martyn Thomas as acting chief executive and chairman of the body that will organise the 2015 World Cup. The RFU&apos;s board of directors has made a number of submissions to Slaughter and May, the law firm that was asked after the Blackett report to look at how the RFU was run and to make suggestions for reform. One submission is that the chief disciplinary officer be removed from the council. Slaughter and May is expected to deliver its recommendations next week, before a board meeting on 30 November and a council gathering on 2 December that will vote on the proposed changes. If Blackett, a co-opted member of the council, is removed from the decision-making body it will undermine his position. &quot;This is nothing more than an attempt by some on the board to get revenge on Jeff Blackett because of what happened last week,&quot; said an RFU insider. &quot;They seem to forget that at the last meeting of the council last September they all stood up and apologised for the way the Blackett report had shown they had acted. They did not contradict the evidence and even Martyn Thomas accepted the report was not a witch-hunt. Those on the board who are looking to remove Blackett should be very careful because their own positions are far from secure and the clubs have faith in him.&quot; Following the conclusion of the Blackett inquiry, there was a debate among the board of directors over whether the role of the chief disciplinary officer should be assumed by the legal department at Twickenham. When the board decided to investigate allegations of misconduct by England players at this year&apos;s World Cup, the head of the RFU legal department, Karena Vleck, was given the job instead of Blackett, who has led inquiries before, notably in 2008 after allegations of sexual assault were made during a trip to New Zealand. &quot;A key reason that Jeff Blackett chaired the inquiry panel into the Steele affair was that he was a member of the council and when the decision was made to get answers to various questions about what happened over Steele, he was on the spot to take charge,&quot; said the RFU source. &quot;He and his four panel members went into the investigation with open minds. What they discovered appalled them and they quite rightly brought everything to the attention of the council.&quot; Thomas, whose resignation was accepted by the board last week, will remain as acting chief executive until 16 December. His contract ends on 10 December but he will carry on because, as one of the RFU&apos;s International Rugby Board representatives, he will be at the meeting in Singapore that will decide the next IRB chairman. Bill Beaumont, a co-opted member of the RFU board, is challenging the current IRB chairman, Bernard Lapasset. A meeting in Auckland last month failed to resolve the issue, with the pair locked at 13 votes each, although one member of a federation of unions had ignored his mandate and voted for Beaumont. Thomas&apos;s last task as an RFU official will be to help deliver victory for Beaumont. Cardiff Blues announced on Monday that they had reached a compensation agreement with Wasps over David Young, who left the Welsh region last summer while under contract to take charge at Adams Park."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/07/design-invention-james-dyson-award", "sentences": ["In 2007 just 6.2% of British graduates read engineering, compared to 12.8% in Germany and 40% in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-07T22:00:01Z", "title": "Design and invention can power us out of recession | James Dyson", "tags": ["Engineering", "Education", "Business", "Technology", "Design", "Art and design", "Engineering general", "UK news", "World news", "James Dyson"], "article": "Nature or nurture? Inventiveness relies on both. A vibrant economy built on the export of new technology must have inventive companies and institutions at its heart, but also encourage the people who develop the ideas; we need more engineers. Ideas create wealth, and the intellectual property they develop not only improves lives, but will also power us out of recession. The world buzzes with talk of microchips, touch screens and processors; but clever, tangible design and engineering are often forgotten. We face challenges of epic proportion \u2013 global warming, energy shortages, growing populations. Engineers can develop the solutions that ease them. I&apos;m dizzy hearing about the Silicon Roundabout; hi-tech should not be confined to the digital world \u2013 our biggest problems require a response grounded not in the cloud but in tangible form. The allure of digital should not distract us from the bigger challenges. Apple is an example of the required balance \u2013 it combines the digital with the functional. Microchips still require expert materials and precise assembly; Apple still develops ideas and manufactures the well designed hardware. As we rebalance our economy away from the City towards making things, we must rediscover our inventiveness. The government should not pick winners (a dangerous pastime), but focus on investment in ideas, robust education fostering academic as well as practical skills, and a culture in which inventiveness is encouraged. Inventive companies must keep inventing, creating jobs in research and development and exporting the resulting technology. George Osborne set the tone in his &quot;budget for making things&quot; \u2013 rising exports of hi-tech goods are imperative. Increases in the research and development tax credit, bolstering the enterprise investments scheme and measures for the patent box show he can see the value of inventiveness, and is challenging business to do the same. But inventiveness depends on inspiring bright young people to develop ideas and use their intelligence in a productive way, like making something work better. Unfortunately, there are not enough young people taking up the challenge in Britain. In 2007 just 6.2% of British graduates read engineering, compared to 12.8% in Germany and 40% in Singapore. These choices begin at school \u2013 with subjects like design and technology. This is practical and creative, but is at risk of being removed from the national curriculum by the government. To be a technology powerhouse we must strengthen our practical education, and combine it more closely with rigorous subjects such as science and maths. We must direct more young people towards careers in engineering through these subjects \u2013 encouraging their natural inventiveness. Too often the education system stifles them. Unlike Edison, they aren&apos;t allowed to fail, and then learn from that failure. Engineering is a worthwhile career. But it&apos;s no surprise that in the UK the top career choice for girls aged seven to 16 is hairdresser or beautician, while only 1% wanted to work in science and engineering. Scientists and engineers are perceived to be &quot;geeks&quot;; this intelligence isn&apos;t revered and it&apos;s seen as odd. Education can encourage engineers, and the government can help business \u2013 but to bring it all together we need a culture that celebrates design and invention. Grand schemes like the HS2 project and the proposed airport for the Thames estuary go a long way towards showing young people what is possible. The projects themselves are not the crux of the matter. It&apos;s what they represent \u2013 large-scale endeavours to help the economy, encourage employment and drive invention. Over the past six months, my foundation has been challenging young people in 18 countries to develop problem-solving inventions for the James Dyson Award \u2013 and on Wednesday we will announce the winner. They have responded with a host of ingenious solutions: from a mop bucket that only dispenses clean water (why do we clean our floors with the same dirty water?) to a device that extracts water from thin air, overcoming the problem of droughts destroying crops (a growing problem as a result of global warming and population growth). The ideas are inspiring and are a startling sign that ingenuity is alive and well. We will know the winner later, but the important lesson Britain can take from it, even on this scale, is that we face stiff competition \u2013 not just in the James Dyson Award, but in the global economy too. Our competitors have good ideas and the talented young people to develop them.

With preparations for the venues proceeding remarkably smoothly in east London, despite a global financial crisis, the big unanswered question has remained not whether the capital will be ready, but what the Games will feel like when they finally take place. If Athens had history and Beijing had jaw-dropping scale, what will the unique selling point of a London Games be? After a troubled birth, organisers believe the Cultural Olympiad \u2013 and its more focused, high-profile cousin the London 2012 Festival \u2013 can be a large part of the answer. Along with the torch relay (the full route for which was unveiled on Monday, promising to pass within 10 miles of 95% of the population) they see the Cultural Olympiad as a means to convince the rest of the country of the benefits of hosting the Olympics and tell the world what makes London special. Get them right, and they will help set London&apos;s Games apart, define them as great, and bolster national support for the investment of \u00a39.3bn of public money by making everyone feel involved. Get those ancillary elements wrong, and it will only heighten criticism that the Games is nothing more than a colossal waste of public money. The Cultural Olympiad alone has cost some \u00a397m over four years. &quot;When we started out seven years ago we said culture was going to be a big part of it because it&apos;s a big deal in London. It&apos;s where we lead the world in so many areas,&quot; said Paul Deighton, the chief executive of the London organising committee at Friday&apos;s luvvie-heavy launch at the Theatre Royal. The worlds of culture and sport are not often happy bedfellows, despite being yolked together in a single department. Usually they are bitterly scrapping for public funding but Deighton insisted they could complement one another. &quot;What was important to us is that it was right around the country. It was important it touched every area of culture, be it fashion, high art or comedy. And it was important that we knit it back into what was key to us in winning the Games \u2013 that it reaches out to new audiences, particularly young people, and has a big accent on participation.&quot; The same rhetoric has been attached to the torch relay, with Coe assuming the role of rabble-rousing residents&apos; association chairman as he unveiled the full route on Monday. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be too prescriptive about this. It&apos;s not Big Brother sitting in headquarters telling people how to enjoy themselves,&quot; said Coe, immediately in danger of sounding just that. &quot;But whether it&apos;s inviting friends round for Olympic-themed quizzes or getting everyone on your street to welcome the flame in your community, for three people or 300, it&apos;s all about organising celebrations at a local level. We saw the appetite for that around the royal wedding and that&apos;s what we want to do.&quot; This comparison with the royal wedding (and the phrase &quot;business as unusual&quot;) is one you hear a lot around Locog&apos;s HQ \u2013 but that was a single day and it remains to be seen if such an atmosphere can be maintained from 19 May when the torch arrives at Land&apos;s End until the Paralympic closing ceremony on 9 September. London 2012&apos;s evolution has been peppered with Marmite moments. That was most obviously manifest in the logo launch (vilified at the time but now broadly accepted), but also its font (recently labelled the worst ever by Simon Garfield in a book on the topic), the mascots (hi-tech one-eyed monsters rather than a more traditional lion or Beefeater), and Friday&apos;s posters (12 by modern artists rather than a single traditional image). The London 2012 Festival continues that trend \u2013 but appears genuinely inclusive and ambitious, a huge improvement on earlier Cultural Olympiad commissions, which were easy to ridicule. The focus throughout has been on looking forward rather than back, pushing London&apos;s status as a thriving, evolving melting pot rather than concentrating on its history, or trying to exploit that heritage in new and surprising ways. Expect a similar approach in the opening ceremony currently being masterminded by Danny Boyle in a top-secret warehouse. Deighton is insistent the cultural element will support, rather than detract from or be swamped by, the sporting spectacle: &quot;What&apos;s key for me is that everyone feels like they&apos;re part of it. This allows people to join in who aren&apos;t attracted by sport. And it just reinforces the sense of celebration and excitement.&quot; Whether an exhortation to ring a bell for three minutes, pyrotechnics on Lake Windermere or a successful torch relay have much to do with sport is open to debate. What is clear is that their success or failure will have an impact on how the Games are remembered by the population at large \u2013 though not as much as the number of British medals or preponderance of iconic sporting moments."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/nov/08/worst-ever-pop-song-rhymes", "sentences": ["As a huge fan of the Eurovision song contest, tolerating awful English-as-a-second-language rhymes has become almost a hobby: &quot;Stop don&apos;t say that it&apos;s impossible/&apos;Cos I know it&apos;s possible&quot; (Sweden 2011); &quot;Your addiction/My conviction/You&apos;re my passion, my relief, my crucifixion&quot; (Greece 2005); and &quot;Just yesterday we were on the floor/Like somewhere in a movie or a club in Singapore/The lights are bright, mood is raw/And in the middle of the night we dance &apos;til we get sore&quot; (Hungary 2005) are some of the best from the contest, but there are plenty that never make it to Eurovision: &quot;When I was wearing a star/ Back in the USSR&quot; (Belarus 2011) and &quot;We can dance all night with the bourgeoisie/ Oh oh/Lay your love on me&quot; (Sweden 2008) are particular highlights that most of Europe missed out on."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-08T21:00:05Z", "title": "Notes and queries: Worst-ever pop song rhymes; Why are footballers so unfit?

William Merrin, Swansea Why are footballers so unfit? They get tired if they play more than once a week, even though they spend most of a match jogging about. Tennis players often have four three-hour matches in a week, at much higher intensity. Tennis might seem more intense, but that&apos;s because the court is 78ft by 27ft, compared to a football pitch, which measures something like 100-130 yards by 50-100 yards. You could say a footballer wouldn&apos;t cover all of that, but most of them cover a hell of a lot of ground during a game. Also, a professional footballer doesn&apos;t get a nice sit down with drink (and banana or energy bar) every five minutes or so. stooze Compared to professional cyclists, almost all other sportspeople are pampered.

Amid the high hopes and dashed dreams of a principality long associated with desperate spins of the roulette wheel, Lord Coe will join the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, the UK Athletics chairman, Ed Warner, and the chair of the Olympic Park Legacy Company, Baroness Ford, in an attempt to beat Doha to the prize on Friday. For the politicians and sports administrators, the decision of 27 members of the International Association of Athletics Federations Council will have a large bearing on how the unfolding chaos surrounding the future of the \u00a3496m Olympic stadium plays out. Win, and the case to retain the athletics track in a 60,000-seat stadium in Stratford is bolstered. Lose, and the rationale for maintaining a track in a stadium of that size starts to break down. &quot;I think the case for a mixed use community stadium in Stratford is an absolute commitment we&apos;ve given and that case remains as strong as it can be, regardless of what happens on Friday. But I do want these world athletics championships very, very badly indeed,&quot; said Robertson, without specifying big that stadium may utlimately be in the event that London loses.There are also high-stakes personal considerations. As ever, the decision will be made partly on the merits of the two bids but against the backdrop of a host of other political and financial calculations. Coe, the London 2012 chairman and IAAF vice-president who vowed to leave a strong athletics legacy in the Singapore speech that helped secure the 2012 Games, is widely suspected to have ambitions to succeed Lamine Diack as president of the IAAF in 2015. But he is jostling for position with Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian former pole vaulter who is also an IAAF vice president, which could split the European vote. Coe insisted that internal IAAF politics would not be a factor: &quot;My council will make a balanced judgment on Friday and those judgments will be based on the merits of the two cities and the sport going forward.&quot; Meanwhile, Johnson and Robertson are still bearing the scars of their ill-starred involvement in the 2018 World Cup campaign, on which \u00a321m was spent in securing a single non-English vote. Johnson, with a re-election campaign looming, and Robertson, having pledged to underwrite the bid, are also desperate to deliver a meaningful manifestation of the Olympic legacy. Having already missed out on hosting the world hockey championships and the football World Cup, the only events currently inked in for the period once hubristically dubbed the &quot;golden decade&quot; were won under a Labour administration. Their determination was in evidence whe IAAF inspectors arrived in London last month. Robertson skipped the Tory Party conference to host them, while David Cameron left behind the keys to Number 10 for him to host a reception there. &quot;I do still feel a bit bruised about 2018 but I also recognise athletics is a different sport to football. Personally, I know the electorate here much better than the Fifa delegates and that does give me confidence in the integrity of the process,&quot; Robertson told the Guardian. For Doha, the stakes are also high. The oil-rich middle eastern state of Qatar has targeted international sport as the means by which to promote itself to the world and undertake infrastructure improvement projects of mind-boggling scale. The 2017 World Athletics Championships are seen as the ideal staging post towards its hugely ambitious aim of securing the 2020 Olympics, two years before it will host a World Cup secured in controversial circumstances. Having persuaded the IAAF to accept its bid on the basis of moving the championships to September, victory would provide further ammunition in its campaign to win over IOC members sceptical about the prospect of doing the same for the Games. In some senses, it is a replay of the choice faced by a series of international sports bodies in recent years. Doha is offering to take the sport into new territories, pledging substantial financial support for a not hugely cash rich sport in the interim and promising innovative solutions to deal with the oppressive heat, which could top 100F even in September. London, on the other hand, will argue that after Daegu, Moscow and Beijing by 2017 a return to western Europe will be overdue and cautions that long-term relationships with sponsors and fans could be damaged if not. Coe and Warner will promise full stadiums for all sessions, claim the support of athletes and sell the potential commercial benefits of London. Qatar can offer deep pockets and the prospect of untapped new horizons. Doha, for example, has already promised to underwrite the IAAF&apos;s entire \u00a35m prize fund for the 2017 championships. London cannot compete except to argue, as Warner has, that the sum is modest compared to the potential overall commercial boost for the sport in coming to London. Coe is also planning to borrow a couple of pages from his London 2012 playbook in emphasising the potential benefits to the future of the sport in inspiring young talent. &quot;We are a world capital for young people and we are a global media hotspot. Those two combinations are very important. It is driving that message through to the next generation and encouraging them to choose a life in track and field,&quot; he said. Warner and Coe are convinced they have neutralised the ongoing uncertainty over the fate of the Olympic Stadium, despite the high-profile collapse of a deal with West Ham and Newham Council last month under the weight of legal challenges from Tottenham, Leyton Orient and amid rancorous accusations of spying and subterfuge. For the avoidance of doubt, they will be accompanied by Ford, deployed to reiterate the commitment to the track remaining in the stadium no matter what. But it is perhaps telling that the OPLC is delaying its re-tender of the Olympic Stadium tenancy until early next month, when the outcome of the bid will be known. It admits going back to the original &quot;base case&quot; - a 25,000 seat, stripped down athletics stadium with no roof - remains an option. In what those involved will hope is not an echo of the blighted 2018 World Cup campaign, Diack is under investigation by the International Olympic Committee over claims that he accepted bribes from the defunct sports marketing firm ISL. Diack denies the claims, made in a BBC Panorama documentary broadcast last December, but the IOC executive committee will hear the results of an investigation by its ethics committee in December. The IAAF president is considered crucial to London&apos;s chances, as he is expected to sway the votes of others. Warner insisted Diack&apos;s view would not be coloured by the allegations. &quot;One of the things I&apos;ve realised in recent weeks is that there is a huge industry of people who make it their job to see conspiracies behind every door, to get you to worry about what the opposition is doing and what people might be thinking,&quot; he said. &quot;I have taken a policy decision that we&apos;ll put our front foot forwards, go through the front door and engage in a dialogue with people about the merits of our bid. Every indication has been that this whole process has been fair, open, honest, straightforward and will be decided on its merits on Friday.&quot; Robertson and Coe, who went to Monaco last week in an advance party to meet with Diack, will try to persuade the Senegalese that he must deliver on his side of the bargain over the retention of the track. At the height of the battle between Spurs and West Ham over the Olympic Stadium, Diack was pressed into action to claim London&apos;s 2012 bid would amount to nothing more than a &quot;big lie&quot; and a &quot;betrayal&quot; if Spurs&apos; plan to demolish the track won the day. Having now promised to keep it, there is a belief that Diack has something of a moral obligation to deliver. For London&apos;s critics, there is evidence of the arrogance charge that always tends to be flung at domestic bids for major sporting events. In 2005, London successfully diffused that perception; in 2010, the World Cup bid did not. Critics say that Warner talking of Europe being the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the sport and London&apos;s commercial offering being &quot;head and shoulders&quot; above Doha&apos;s may reinforce that perception. Coe sought to strike a different note: &quot;You have to be the right city at the right time. You have to chime with the environment...We&apos;re not bidding with an air of entitlement, this is about service.&quot; Warner also insisted that, rather than the failed bids for 2005 and 2015 being seen as a black mark, London would be given credit for staying power. A previous bid to host the 2005 world athletics championships ended in ignimony and embarrassment after plans to build a new stadium at Pickett&apos;s Lock were abandoned, while a bid for 2015 also had to be shelved because the wording of the tender document for the stadium left some ambiguity over whether the track would remain, leading Spurs to propose that it be removed. There is now talk around the hotel lobbies of Monaco of an elegant solution that would see one city awarded the 2017 championships while the other hosts the 2019 edition. But Warner said unequivocally that London was only interested in 2017 because the &quot;stars were aligned&quot; for that date and government funding guarantees would not stretch to 2019, a stance Robertson confirmed. A representative of the Doha bid also said on Wednesday that it was not interested in 2019 either, because it would not fit in with its wider plans. Coe said he believed the single vote would go ahead as planned and would go to the wire. &quot;Out of a group of 27 people, you have to assume there are a few that are yet to make their mind up. That&apos;s natural.&quot; All of which leaves both cities placing everything on red on Friday. For Coe, this time it&apos;s personal. &quot;It&apos;s my sport. It&apos;s what I am, it&apos;s what defines, it&apos;s what shapes me, it&apos;s been my passion. We have fought long and hard to keep the Olympic legacy alive in that stadium. I won&apos;t be involved in another bid. This is my sport, I wouldn&apos;t be doing this for anything else.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/10/european-debt-crisis-eurozone-breakup", "sentences": ["Asian markets also fell, with Japan&apos;s Nikkei closing down 2.9% while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng lost nearly 5% and Singapore&apos;s Straits Times shed 3.1%."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-10T08:59:26Z", "title": "Markets hit by European debt crisis as threat of eurozone breakup persists", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Stock markets", "Financial crisis", "Global recession", "European banks", "European monetary union", "Banking", "Business", "Economics", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Italy", "Greece", "Germany", "France"], "article": "Global stock markets suffered sharp losses on Thursday morning as the political chaos in Athens and Rome continued and the eurozone teetered on the brink of breakup.

The yield on Spain&apos;s 10-year debt increased to 5.9%, nearer to the &quot;danger zone&quot; where countries risk losing the confidence of the financial markets. Soaring Italian borrowing costs have stoked fears that the eurozone&apos;s third-largest economy will need to be bailed out. Italy has now replaced Greece as the focus of the debt crisis, with Italian interest rates reaching levels that triggered bailouts in Portugal, Greece and Ireland. But amid fears that Italy is too big to rescue, reports have surfaced from Brussels suggesting Germany and France have begun preliminary talks on a breakup of the eurozone. Brent crude oil dipped below $112 a barrel as the escalating European debt crisis overshadowed robust demand for oil from China. Spot silver shed nearly 2% to $33.40 an ounce. China&apos;s foreign ministry expressed hope on Thursday that European countries would overcome their difficulties. Ministry spokesman Hong Lei added that China also hoped Europe would stabilise financial markets and push for economic recovery and growth. Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income at Evolution Securities, said: &quot;Italy had a particularly bad round on Wednesday and it may prove to have been a seminal event in European history.&quot; He added: &quot;Italy is too big to bail, which leaves us with the nuclear options of getting the printing presses working overtime or common bond issuance as we head towards a fiscal union. Neither option is politically palatable and both would be in breach of existing treaty agreements, but then rules have been twisted before and a treaty change may be a lot more palatable than a eurozone in which the largest debtor and third-largest economy cannot access markets and the EU (and the financial system) collapses.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/nov/10/ghost-bikes-memorials-cycling-victims", "sentences": ["A website tracking ghost bikes records several hundred, taking in locations as varied as Poland, Singapore and Mexico."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-10T19:56:06Z", "title": "Ghost bikes: memorials to road victims blamed for putting people off cycling", "tags": ["Cycling", "Life and style", "Transport", "UK news"], "article": "Marooned on a traffic island in the centre of one of London&apos;s more aggressive, unpleasant junctions, it is at first glance an almost discordant note of beauty: a bicycle completely painted a spectral white and covered with a mass of flowers. But it is in fact a deeply gloomy spectacle. Commemorating Min Joo Lee, a 24-year-old fashion student killed last month while cycling through King&apos;s Cross, it is one of the latest examples in the fast-growing global phenomenon of &quot;ghost bikes&quot;. Often painted entirely in white and locked to a fixed object as close to the accident site as possible, ghost bikes aim to act as both a memorial \u2013they feature the name of the dead rider and other details, whether on a sign or painted to the frame \u2013 and a cautionary reminder for cyclists and drivers about what can happen when bike and vehicle come into contact. The practice can be traced back to the US in 2003, and now exists worldwide. A website tracking ghost bikes records several hundred, taking in locations as varied as Poland, Singapore and Mexico. Despite their eerie poignancy, some cycling campaigners worry that the memorials could, in fact, act in the main to put off would-be cyclists. &quot;While ghost bikes may help ensure road users pay more attention to one another, they make give the impression that cycling is more dangerous than it actually is,&quot; said Chris Peck, policy co-ordinator for the CTC, the UK&apos;s main national cycling organisation. &quot;Cyclists in general live two years longer than non-cyclists and are in general healthier \u2013 even in heavy traffic, a three-mile ride to work is healthier than driving to work every day and failing to get any exercise.&quot; The first recorded ghost bike was in St Louis, Missouri, in 2003. A man who witnessed a fatal collision decided to mark it with a painted bike bearing the message, &quot;Cyclist struck here.&quot; The first documented UK example commemorates James Foster, a London-based Australian man struck by a speeding drink-driver in Islington, north London in 2003. Colleagues at the cycle shop where he worked, Mosquito Bikes, erected the ghost bike on the fifth anniversary of his death. Yet now staff at the shop admit they are unsure about the general practice. &quot;Even though the shop has this personal connection with James, we&apos;ve got mixed feelings about them,&quot; said Gill Ord, a director. &quot;Personally, I&apos;m not sure other riders pay much attention, and there&apos;s a danger they can put people off cycling.&quot; Cycle safety, particularly in big cities, remains a vexed and much-debated subject. While the number of cyclists killed on the UK&apos;s roads rose slightly last year, campaigners say this must be seen in the context of a downward trend longer term, plus greater numbers of people on bikes. However, in London there has been alarm at the number of female cyclists killed in recent years in collisions with lorries, particularly construction trucks. At the ghost bike marking Lee&apos;s death, most cyclists seemed to think the project was worthwhile. &quot;There hasn&apos;t been much publicity about them, so though people see the ghost bikes, they don&apos;t necessarily understand their significance,&quot; said Tom Rosenfeld. &quot;As a regular cyclist I know I can get very complacent \u2013 it is easy to forget about the dangers and assume that it will never happen to you. But when I see one they do make me reconsider my safety and reassess whether I am being careful enough.&quot; \u2022 Help us create a global map of ghost bikes"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/10/gurkhas-mod-cuts-end-role", "sentences": ["Dip Magar was among more than 12,000 young hopefuls who applied this year for 176 posts in the British army; there were an additional 80 trying for the Gurkha Contingent Singapore police force.", "Some say that from next year, there will be no recruitment for the British army, only Singapore police.&quot; Rumours that the British Gurkha recruitment centres face the axe as part of Ministry of Defence spending cuts have been consistently denied by the army."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-10T20:10:00Z", "title": "Gurkhas: the beginning of the end?", "tags": ["Gurkhas", "Ministry of Defence", "Nepal", "Military", "Foreign policy", "Joanna Lumley", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "As scores of British Gurkha soldiers are made redundant by the British army and recruitment numbers fall, there is deep concern among Nepal&apos;s mountain tribes that their proud 200-year tradition could be under threat. It is recruitment season in the Himalayan foothills, a time when recruiters for the British army, locally known as &quot;Galla walla&quot;, themselves former Gurkha soldiers, go from village to village looking for raw talent. But this year there is a chill in the air. More than 140 Gurkha soldiers were told of their compulsory redundancy by the British army this year. In Nepal, where army pay makes a huge difference to poor communities, this is a blow. &quot;We hear more soldiers will lose their jobs. Recruitment is also down. I don&apos;t know if the British government wants to do away with the Gurkha regiments,&quot; said Mahesh Ale Magar, who, in August, sent his son Dip to try for this year&apos;s regional selection at the British army camp in Pokhara, central Nepal. It is a measure of the prestige attached to service with the Gurkhas that, despite being one of the toughest courses in the world, the selection process is keenly contested. Dip Magar was among more than 12,000 young hopefuls who applied this year for 176 posts in the British army; there were an additional 80 trying for the Gurkha Contingent Singapore police force. To be considered Gurkha material candidates have to pass a series of demanding physical and mental tests. These include the infamous doko race, in which potential recruits have to complete an uphill run of more than three miles carrying 35kg (77lb) of sand in a basket strapped to their backs. Dip did not qualify. &quot;My friends who qualified in regionals will take the next stage soon,&quot; said the 18-year-old. &quot;I will try again next year. It&apos;s my dream to be a Gurkha.&quot; His earnest young face became anguished as he added: &quot;I don&apos;t know if I will get another chance. Some say that from next year, there will be no recruitment for the British army, only Singapore police.&quot; Rumours that the British Gurkha recruitment centres face the axe as part of Ministry of Defence spending cuts have been consistently denied by the army. Rebecca Clark, a spokesperson for the army&apos;s 4th Division, which controls British Gurkhas Nepal, said: &quot;Although there is a small reduction in the numbers that are being recruited, in proportion to the reduction in size of the future army the operation of the recruitment centres remains the same.&quot; But the so-called martial tribes, such as the Rai, Limbu, Gurung and Magar, from which the bulk of the Gurkha force is drawn, have seen British Gurkha numbers drop from a second world war peak of 112,000 men to the present-day level of 3,600. The Gurkhas continue to put their lives on the line for the British military. Only last month a 21-year-old, Rifleman Vijay Rai of the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, was killed in Afghanistan, dying from gun wounds after a checkpoint he was guarding was attacked. He had followed his father and brother into military service. The tribes fear the Gurkha warriors will bear the brunt of military cuts. Under the strategic defence and security review, announced in October 2010, the MoD is to slash 7,000 jobs in the army, and it is expected that a third of the reduction will be achieved through a decrease in recruitment. The yearly Gurkha intake is now 176, down from 230 a few years ago. More redundancies seem almost certain. Gurkha support groups, such as the Gurkha Justice Campaign, championed by the actor Joanna Lumley, have, in recent years, won high-profile victories in the campaign for better rights. In 2008 Gurkhas&apos; terms of service were improved, giving them terms similar to those of the rest of the army. Ironically, though, this has made the Gurkha units more vulnerable to cuts. &quot;Earlier, Gurkha units were cheaper to run than other British units,&quot; said Raj Limbu, who served with the 7th Gurkha Rifles. &quot;But now they&apos;re equally costly.&quot; It is easy to see why young men like Dip are desperate to enlist in the Gurkhas. There are few jobs in the mountain villages of Nepal and the only alternative there is likely to be subsistence farming on the terraced slopes. A Nepalese farmer earns roughly \u00a3200 a year. A Gurkha soldier takes home almost 90 times as much. But Gurkha veterans argue that the lure of the Gurkha life is about more than money. &quot;It is a life-changing experience,&quot; said Damarbahadur Gurung, a retired captain, who served for 22 years with the 2nd Gurkha Rifles, also known as the Sirmoor Rifles. &quot;You&apos;re educated and you see the world. That is why it is very important for the ethnic groups who have been traditionally known as martial tribes.&quot; In Nepal the families who serve in the British army are known as Lahures, after the city of Lahore in present-day Pakistan where the first Gurkha regiment was raised in the 19th century. Small in stature, but famed for their hand-to-hand combat skills with the kukri \u2013 a long, curved Himalayan knife \u2013 Gurkhas fought almost everywhere the British army went in the 20th century, garnering 13 Victoria Cross awards along the way. Their battle cry has remained &quot;Ayo Gurkhali!&quot; \u2013 the Gurkhas are upon you! The Gurkha reputation for fearlessness has carried over into recent conflicts where they have been praised as a disciplined, determined and apolitical fighting force. Dipprasad Pun, a corporal, was recently awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross by the Queen after he single-handedly thwarted a Taliban attack on his checkpoint in Afghanistan. After he ran out of ammunition, Pun used the tripod of his machine gun to beat back the attackers. Damarbahadur Gurung said: &quot;I am proud to have served as a Gurkha in the British army. I hope I&apos;m not among the last of a dying breed.&quot; Despite the uncertainty in London, up in the hills of Nepal becoming a Gurkha is still the dream of many a boy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/11/lewis-hamilton-felipe-massa-feud", "sentences": ["Six in a single season makes it look as though something unusual is going on between Hamilton and Massa, who have failed to avoid each other in Monaco, at Silverstone, in Singapore (twice), at Suzuka and in the inaugural race in Delhi, where twisted metal was again followed by harsh words.", "After the race in Singapore there was even a brief public confrontation in front of the television cameras, with Massa&apos;s tap on the shoulder and sarcastic taunt (&quot;Good job, bro&apos;!&quot;) followed by a brief flare of anger from Hamilton (&quot;Don&apos;t touch me, man!&quot;).", "Every time the feud between Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa boils over, however, the Englishman and the Brazilian tend to be squabbling over a minor placing: 10th in Monaco, fourth at Silverstone, fourth at Singapore, fourth in Japan, fifth in India."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-11T12:40:43Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa's feud is unhealthy but not unusual | Richard Williams", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Felipe Massa", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2011"], "article": "Perhaps even Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa don&apos;t know how their feud got started. It could have been when Hamilton snatched the world championship from a bitterly disappointed Massa in front of the Brazilian&apos;s hometown crowd one gloomy November afternoon in Sao Paulo three years ago. Or perhaps it was the moment during the previous season when Massa &quot;playfully&quot; spat a mouthful of champagne at the English rookie on the podium at Indianapolis, while Hamilton was celebrating his second grand prix win. Whatever it was, a perfectly conventional Formula One rivalry seems to have taken on a different shading this season. At one race after another the stewards have been required to examine incidents involving Hamilton&apos;s McLaren and Massa&apos;s Ferrari, handing out punishments to both men. &quot;Clearly Lewis and Felipe are magnetic,&quot; Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team principal, said after the Indian Grand Prix a fortnight ago, reflecting on the seeming inability of the two drivers to stay out of each other&apos;s way. &quot;Maybe,&quot; responded Stefano Domenicali, his equivalent at Ferrari. &quot;But who is the plus and who is the minus?&quot; One collision is an accident. Two might be a coincidence. Six in a single season makes it look as though something unusual is going on between Hamilton and Massa, who have failed to avoid each other in Monaco, at Silverstone, in Singapore (twice), at Suzuka and in the inaugural race in Delhi, where twisted metal was again followed by harsh words. After the race in Singapore there was even a brief public confrontation in front of the television cameras, with Massa&apos;s tap on the shoulder and sarcastic taunt (&quot;Good job, bro&apos;!&quot;) followed by a brief flare of anger from Hamilton (&quot;Don&apos;t touch me, man!&quot;). In a sport where the participants risk their lives every time they get behind the wheel, such a protracted series of confrontations is highly unusual. &quot;I don&apos;t remember anything like it in my time,&quot; Sir Stirling Moss said this week, &quot;and the main reason was because racing was bloody dangerous. The thinking was that if you made a mistake, you were going to die.&quot; Half a century ago, Moss&apos;s generation of drivers wore cotton overalls and flimsy helmets, and raced without seat belts or fire-extinguishing systems. Technology and a greater concern for safety enable today&apos;s drivers to walk away unharmed from the most lurid accidents. Which at least partially explains why Hamilton and Massa feel free to run each other off the track, trashing the sport&apos;s traditional etiquette along with their cars. The context makes their little war even stranger. When Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost conducted their spectacular vendetta 20 years ago, they were fighting for nothing less than the world championship. Every time the feud between Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa boils over, however, the Englishman and the Brazilian tend to be squabbling over a minor placing: 10th in Monaco, fourth at Silverstone, fourth at Singapore, fourth in Japan, fifth in India. &quot;You can understand it when people are fighting for the top slot,&quot; Damon Hill said this week. But those relatively lowly placings may offer a partial explanation of what is going on. For two men who were fighting each other for the championship three years ago, the last couple of seasons have been vastly disappointing. After one title had been torn from his grasp, Massa expected to be fighting for more. Hamilton had envisaged his first championship as the start of a series. Now they find themselves seething with a dangerous frustration. Thanks to mishaps in qualifying sessions, a disenchanted Hamilton has also found himself starting races further down the grid than usual. In the rush to regain what he sees as his rightful place at the front of the race, he has taken risks \u2013 particularly against Massa, in a manner suggesting that he does not believe the Brazilian should have been in a position to challenge him in the first place. Drivers have disliked each other in the past. James Hunt and Mario Andretti nurtured a mutual dislike that came to a head when they crashed at Zandvoort in 1977, while Andretti was trying to take the lead from Hunt around the outside of a corner. &quot;In Formula One,&quot; the English public schoolboy announced afterwards, &quot;we don&apos;t overtake on the outside.&quot; &quot;Where I come from,&quot; retorted the man who served his racing apprenticeship on American dirt tracks, &quot;we overtake wherever the hell we can.&quot; A lethal dispute blew up in 1981 within the Ferrari team when Gilles Villeneuve believed that Didier Pironi had tricked him out of victory at Imola; the two were not speaking when, a fortnight later, Villeneuve met his death at Zolder. More relevantly, perhaps, there was a sour relationship between Hamilton and Fernando Alonso in 2007, when the Spaniard joined McLaren as a double world champion, only to discover that he had walked into a team in which an English rookie was the great hope. Any negative view of Hamilton already held by Massa may have deepened when Alonso joined him at Ferrari last year. &quot;I think it&apos;s all quite unusual,&quot; Hill said. &quot;Is it sheer bad luck, or it is something else? It&apos;s never desirable for there to be a personal antagonism between two guys who&apos;re racing cars close to each other at 150-plus miles an hour. It can be a problem when you know that a guy you&apos;re racing against has a problem with you. &quot;I can&apos;t really remember a situation where people couldn&apos;t stand each others&apos; guts, although in the days of Mansell, Piquet, Senna and Prost it all got a bit out of hand. There was a total lack of trust between Senna and Prost, and Piquet was someone who went out of his way to upset people as part of a general approach to life. But a lot of it is bluster, like a couple of guys squaring up to each other outside a pub. It always seems to be a bit futile.&quot; When confronted with the video evidence of shunts between Massa and Hamilton in Monaco or Delhi, even men with years of Formula One experience find themselves unable to reach unanimous verdicts. In India, for example, there was no consensus. Some sided with the stewards, who concluded that Massa should have left room for Hamilton to overtake him on lap 24. Others believed that the McLaren driver should have backed out of a manoeuvre that depended for its success on his opponent&apos;s willingness to surrender. In Moss&apos;s view, two factors are contributing to the current spate of incidents. The first is the influence of kart racing, where today&apos;s drivers serve their apprenticeships and a measure of physical contact is taken for granted. Senna, a childhood karting champion, was the first to import karting tactics into Formula One, followed by Michael Schumacher. &quot;I don&apos;t know that karts don&apos;t incite one to show a bit more bravery than is strictly required,&quot; Moss said, choosing his words carefully. There is also, he points out, the simple difficulty experienced by drivers of the current generation of cars in actually seeing what others are doing. &quot;I don&apos;t think they have very good mirrors,&quot; he said. &quot;And they&apos;re also sitting so far down in the cars nowadays, with high-sided cockpits, that it&apos;s very hard for them to get an overall picture.&quot; Overtaking, Hill points out, depends on the behaviour of two men. &quot;It&apos;s a shared responsibility,&quot; he said. But it is hard to see how Massa and Hamilton can be persuaded to stay out of each other&apos;s way in future, now that they have reached the point where any backing-off would look like an unacceptable admission of weakness. And there are those who will say that at a time when Sebastian Vettel is reducing an entire season to one long victory parade, an outbreak of bare-knuckle fighting can only enhance the sport&apos;s box-office appeal. Until, heaven forbid, it ends in tears."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/11/london-2017-world-athletics-championships", "sentences": ["The decision will be regarded as personal vindication for Coe, closely associated with the promise in Singapore that there would be a legacy for his sport from the Games, who fought hard to retain the track in the stadium."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-11T16:39:00Z", "title": "London wins bid to host 2017 World Athletics Championships", "tags": ["World Athletics Championships", "Lord Coe", "Olympic Stadium", "Olympic Games 2012", "Athletics", "Sport", "London", "Olympic Games"], "article": "London has beaten Doha to the 2017 world athletics championships, leading Lord Coe and the bid team to claim their victory would have far-reaching benefits for the sport and the Olympics legacy. Following a vote of the 26 members of the International Association of Athletics Federations Council, London beat the Qatari capital to the prize by a majority of 16-10. But it was a late promise to match Doha&apos;s pledge to cover the entire $7.2m (\u00a34.5m) prize fund, so that the IAAF could invest the money in development projects elsewhere, that helped seal the deal among a handful of key wavering Council members. Coe, the London 2012 chairman who was also a key figure in the 2017 bid and is an IAAF vice president, said that they got the campaign &quot;just right&quot;. He added: &quot;We have the Games in 2012, we have the world athletics championships in 2017 and we have world championships at virtually every level in every sport over the next decade. It&apos;s an extraordinary clean sweep for British sport.&quot; London&apos;s campaign had focused on the fact that its bid had the overwhelming support of athletes, could guarantee full stadia for every session and offered a better commercial return to sponsors and broadcasters. There was also a plea to Lamine Diack, the IAAF president, to &quot;close the circle&quot; after he voted for London to host the 2012 Olympics on the basis that it would leave an athletics legacy for the capital and play a key role in the campaign to keep the track at the stadium. Diack, who has an International Olympic Committee investigation into bribery allegations hanging over him, made clear that delivering on the stadium was a big factor. &quot;Now, we are all agreed that it will be a stadium of athletics and we don&apos;t talk about a stadium of 25,000, it&apos;s a stadium of 60,000 now. I am happy. We deliver now and we have to work together.&quot; Doha had earlier unveiled a package of &quot;additional incentives&quot; that took its total promised investment in the championships and associated IAAF sponsorship and TV deals to $239.2m. The teenage sprinter Jodie Williams had earlier joined the London mayor Boris Johnson, Coe and the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, to drive those points home in a half-hour presentation. More than 100 athletes past and present had supported the London bid. The decision will be regarded as personal vindication for Coe, closely associated with the promise in Singapore that there would be a legacy for his sport from the Games, who fought hard to retain the track in the stadium. &quot;London has delivered, you can rest assured that London will deliver again,&quot; Coe told his 25 fellow Council members. &quot;I sit here today because I will forever be in mountainous debt to a sport I owe everything. It&apos;s who I am, it&apos;s what I do, it&apos;s the way I do it.&quot; The successful bid could also boost his hopes of succeeding Diack as the next president of the IAAF in 2015. The decision will also come as a relief to ministers and Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) officials, who are dealing with renewed questions over the future of the stadium in Stratford following the collapse of a deal with West Ham and Newham amid a slew of legal challenges. They will now proceed with plans to re-tender for the stadium early next month, secure in the knowledge that their promise to keep the track for the next 99 years is bolstered by the fact that the world championships will fill it in 2017. &quot;This is a huge fillip for our programme for bringing other uses into the stadium alongside athletics. This is a massive, massive fillip,&quot; said the OPLC chair Baroness Ford. &quot;I hope it puts an end to the idea that the stadium would not be viable.&quot; For Robertson, Johnson and Coe \u2013 all of whom were involved in the 2018 World Cup bid humiliation \u2013 the decision to bring the third largest sporting event in the world to London in 2017 will bring a degree of catharsis. For UK Athletics, it will boost hopes that next year&apos;s Olympics can be the start of a golden period for the sport with increased commercial appeal and profile. Three previous failed bids for the world championships, most damagingly in 2001 when the 2005 event had to be handed back after a stadium deal at Picketts Lock collapsed, did not ultimately count against London&apos;s bid. It will cost $84m to stage the championships, though most of that will be recovered in ticket and sponsorship revenues. Any shortfall has been underwritten by the government, but Robertson and Johnson claimed there would be huge spin-off benefits for tourism and business."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/11/cash-london-world-championships", "sentences": ["It was when Tony Blair and Lord Coe were said to have sealed the deal in Singapore for London 2012 and where England&apos;s bid for the 2018 World Cup collapsed in Zurich."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-11T19:44:00Z", "title": "Hard cash powers London's sprint to world championships finish line | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Athletics", "World Athletics Championships", "Sport", "Lord Coe", "Sport politics"], "article": "Recent history dictates that the last 24 hours of a bidding race are crucial. It was when Tony Blair and Lord Coe were said to have sealed the deal in Singapore for London 2012 and where England&apos;s bid for the 2018 World Cup collapsed in Zurich. When Coe and his team considered London&apos;s options in the final days of the bid to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships, they resolved that a final flourish was necessary. It did not involve legacy programmes or athlete development or even the future health of the sport, though promises on each were already present and correct. Instead it involved cold hard cash. A late move, matching Doha&apos;s promise to cover the entire $7.2m (\u00a34.5m) prize fund, may have just been enough to solidify London&apos;s support in a contest that ended 16 votes to 10. They may well have had enough support anyway but it was also clear they felt the late gesture necessary. &quot;We listened. It was clearly what our council colleagues were hoping we would do and we will do it in a way that places no burden on the public purse,&quot; Coe said. This was far from a sure thing, despite the appeal of London&apos;s bid and the belief that the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Lamine Diack, owed a debt after he played a part in ensuring the track stayed in London&apos;s 2012 Olympic stadium. Badly bruised by memories of his Zurich humiliation, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, betrayed an uncharacteristic nervousness before the bid presentation. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson \u2013 aware of the extent to which perceptions of the London 2012 legacy and ongoing uncertainty over the Olympic Stadium risked clouding the pre-Games feel-good factor \u2013 was mentally counting votes as he paced the carpet. For both politicians this had significance beyond an athletics event \u2013 underscored by personal letters from prime minister David Cameron to each council member on the morning of the vote. And for Coe, an IAAF vice-president as well as London 2012 chairman and the man who made the legacy promises that secured the Games, the pressure was even greater. It was down to him to deliver for his sport, among his colleagues. If they had listened to Doha&apos;s presentation, nerves would have jangled louder still as it unveiled a package of &quot;additional incentives&quot; \u2013 funding, sponsorship, broadcasting deals and prize money that totalled $236.2m (\u00a3146.6m). The London bid had already resolved to match the offer to subsidise the prize fund and secured a special dispensation from the president to do so in the 24 hours before the vote. &quot;Rarely is there one thing that takes you across the line. We were reviewing it. We have always reviewed it but it&apos;s what a good bid is about \u2013 listening to what people are saying to you, particularly those who want you to succeed,&quot; Coe said. London&apos;s presentation \u2013 determinedly low key until Coe finished with a personal flourish \u2013 covered all bases but underlined the fact that \u00a39.3bn had already been poured into sporting facilities and infrastructure as a result of the Olympics. Some ideas seemed to have been thrown together at random \u2013 a shot put training area at Tower Bridge, for example. But there was a compelling logic to the pitch that London would prove a championships that would appeal to sponsors, broadcasters and IAAF delegates but also, most crucially, to fans and athletes. The teenage sprinter Jodie Williams and 2012 bid veteran Denise Lewis were called on to underline the point. In contrast to Doha, Lewis said London&apos;s championships would be held &quot;in a temperate climate at a time of the season when they&apos;re already in Europe and already peaking&quot;. She added: &quot;Athletes aren&apos;t robots, we can&apos;t just be dropped anywhere and be expected to compete.&quot; Above all this was a personal victory for Coe, boosting his ambitions of becoming the next president of the IAAF in 2015. He had repeatedly stressed that he was only leading another bid because this was his sport and he was personally linked so heavily with the promise to leave a track in the stadium. For ministers and Olympic officials considering the future of the \u00a3496m Olympic Stadium in the wake of a bitter legal row that has taken in allegations of spying, subterfuge and the Olympic Park Legacy Company, battered by 18 months of criticism and delays, it will come as a huge relief. Robertson and Johnson were visibly relieved, recognising that it gave some substance to claims about delivering an Olympic legacy \u2013 whether in sport, facilities or tourism. &quot;It does absolutely cement in everybody&apos;s minds the understanding that this is not just going to be a stadium where there is football or pop music but it is going to be a fantastic venue for athletics from now until Doomsday,&quot; Johnson said. The OPLC chair, Margaret Ford, said the decision was a &quot;major milestone&quot; that removed any uncertainty, as it moved towards restarting the tender process for the stadium early next month. She will still have to deliver a viable solution but this should give her some cover. The verdict came as a hammer blow to a Doha team who looked furious as they filed out of the council room, and is likely to impact on their chances of landing the 2020 Olympics. But it is unlikely to deter their determination to invest huge sums in infrastructure through bidding for major sporting events. As with the 2012 bid, Coe was able to marry commercial logic and passionate rhetoric with just enough hard-nosed political nous to remind Diack of his debt on the stadium deal. That was enough to carry the day and buck the trend of major events heading for virgin territories. Just as ever louder questions about the Olympic legacy were reaching a climax \u2013 though they will not go away \u2013 this decision could turn the tide. &quot;I fought very hard, along with the minister and the mayor, for the maintenance of a track and field facility,&quot; said Coe. &quot;It was important to recognise that support for a track and field legacy was hard fought. This is an extraordinary decade for British sport now.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/12/from-the-vault-frazier-ali", "sentences": ["Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Indonesia, Iran \u2026 the names flow from him like guarantees from a snake-oil salesman."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-12T23:00:00Z", "title": "From the Vault: Requiem for the heavyweights | Guardian Classic", "tags": ["Muhammad Ali", "Joe Frazier", "Boxing", "Sport"], "article": "It takes a rare purity of spirit to irrigate the moral and aesthetic desert that is forever threatening to engulf the world of heavyweight boxing. What we saw in Quezon City, capital of the Philippines, in midweek represented a shining flood of that purity. To say so is not to claim that the third and last meeting of Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali would leave all who witnessed it ready to embrace the values of the prize-ring. Those 40-odd minutes of unremitting violence must have had the opposite effect on many. They would recoil from the thought that two men who were formidable in so many ways should seek to express themselves through an exchange of suffering, and especially they would wince at the sight of Frazier, his marvellous body reduced to a dilapidated, lurching vehicle for his unyielding will, reeling blindly in the murderous crossfire of the world champion&apos;s final assaults. But whatever misgivings remain about the social validity of professional boxing, there is no room to doubt the worth, the simple nobility of what Frazier and Ali extracted from their harsh context in which they found themselves at the Quezon Coliseum on Wednesday morning. There was nothing morbid or sadistic about the thrill that their performances sent through the blood. What we felt was awe at the spectacle of extraordinary men setting new limits for themselves, pushing back the boundaries of their courage, their physical and psychological capacity. With the dramatic images of the fight still filling the memory, there is deep reluctance to listen to all the feverish plans for moving Ali&apos;s big top on to another exotic fairground. Naturally, that cosmic promoter, Don King, a hawk in peacock&apos;s feathers, is eager to swoop on some more of the millions that are waiting to be snatched around the world. He talks of Munich as having &quot;the inside track&quot; but admits to a special fancy for Haiti, where even the unsavoury caravan that has attached itself to Ali&apos;s heavyweight championship might look wholesome against the local fauna. There are, he assures us, still plenty of governments sufficiently ambiguous about the distinction between prestige and notoriety to want to invest in his kind of promotion. Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Indonesia, Iran \u2026 the names flow from him like guarantees from a snake-oil salesman. However, Mr King&apos;s anxiety to put the show on the road again is not shared by its star. Ali&apos;s mumblings on Wednesday about imminent retirement invited as much scepticism as his demands 24 hours later that the purse for his next appearance should be $25m. But his confession of profound weariness, his pleas for a genuine rest at the end of 12 months that have seen him box 63 championship rounds and accumulate gross earnings of more than \u00a37m, were convincing enough. The morning&apos;s work in the Philippines had drained him as none of his previous 50 fights \u2013 not even his two defeats, the first epic with Frazier and the night Ken Norton broke his jaw \u2013 had drained him. No champion in history has ever had access to a greater storeroom of physical and spiritual reserves, but Frazier seemed to have emptied it, to have forced Ali to lift the floorboards and scrape the very foundations of his nature for the last traces of strength. Ali&apos;s subsequent assertion that he wanted to retire as early as the tenth round was familiar hyperbole, but there was an aching honesty about a later admission: &quot;I felt like quittin&apos; at the end of the fourteenth, well, not like quittin&apos; but like I didn&apos;t want to go no more.&quot; On the way back to the dressing room, his face had the greyness of terminal exhaustion and he moved as if the marrow of his bones had been replaced by mercury. At first he dismissed any suggestion of talking to reporters, but then he heard that Frazier, with bruised flesh around his eyes pressing against dark glasses, had undertaken the ordeal. So Ali struggled off his back and pulled on a pair of black slacks. He could not manage his shoes, so he shuffled to the press conference with only his white boxing socks on his feet, leaning heavily on his attendants and bodyguards. Once there, his monologue was muted, solemn and shot through with a direct, poetic eloquence far removed from the doggerel of his more superficial moods, and when he said that going into the thirteenth and fourteenth rounds against a man like Frazier was &quot;the next thing to dyin&apos;&quot; it did not ring false. As always, he bore minimal evidence of the war he had won (only the small lumps and discolourations around the eyes were conspicuous), but he said he hurt everywhere, and each pain was echoed by a tribute to the unique opponent who had inflicted it. &quot;Don&apos;t let me ever again hear anybody put Joe Frazier down,&quot; he had said in his dressing room. &quot;That is a man.&quot; Since Ali&apos;s own tongue is the one that has lacerated Frazier most vindictively and unjustly, we were anxious to believe in the permanence of his conversation to reality. &quot;Joe Frazier is a real, real fighter. He is the toughest man in the world. Nobody can put pressure on me like he can, can take what I gave and come back to hurt me. If I&apos;d taken the punches he took in there I&apos;d have quit long before he did. He is a man.&quot; In the evening they demonstrated their recuperative powers in characteristic ways, Ali by calling on President Ferdinand Marcos, Frazier by turning up at a party of his friends in the Hyatt Hotel. A warmth too basic to be called anything but love went out to him as he entered the room with his wife, Florence. He was wearing a dinner suit with the collar of the dress shirt open wide. &quot;You all havin&apos; a good time?&quot; he called through the microphone. &quot;You all boogyin&apos; right on in there?&quot; Then he sang a rock song about having a good thing and not wanting to lose it. He had the championship of the world once and lost it, but the best thing he has he can never lose. It is the undecorated grace of his nature. When he had finished dancing with his wife and one of his younger daughters, he was asked if his feud with Ali had exhausted itself of bitterness, if there would be a mellowing of feeling now. &quot;I sure hope so,&quot; he said. &quot;I sure do hope so.&quot; Perhaps Ali at last will help to realise the hope of friendliness, will finally stop allowing obsession with his own ego to distort the huge respect he has always felt for the greatest of his adversaries. In the ring that respect was unmistakable. The fight had an intense dignity, unblemished by any attempt on Ali&apos;s part to con or ridicule his opponent. Everything he did was an admission that he was in with an equal. After a smoothly effective start, he was frequently made to suffer in the middle rounds, driven into the corners by an aggression as insistent as fire, hammered by left hooks of a ferocity that put his title seriously at hazard. His retaliation was vehement, of course, but it was hard to see how the three Filipino officials (whose scoring of rounds, leaving out those that were even, showed 8-4, 8-4, and 8-3 in Ali&apos;s favour) came to have him much better than level entering the thirteenth. That round virtually concluded the argument, opening with a superb right hand to the jaw that sent Frazier&apos;s gum shield into the crowd and ending with the challenger&apos;s upper face so cruelly swollen that he was unable to see the blows that were smashing into his head. The fourteenth painfully confirmed the obvious: that no one can fight Muhammad Ail by braille. Frazier is now being pressed to retire, and the most fervent urgings come from those who admire him most, who do not wish to see his greatness rewarded with irreversible damage to the body and brain. And if Joe goes, can Ali, who is 33 and feeling it, be far behind? He does not have to be told that their destinies have been inextricably linked. &quot;I couldn&apos;t be what I am without him and he couldn&apos;t be what he is without me,&quot; says Ali. &quot;We been a pretty good team over the last five years.&quot; There is no one around who could develop a comparable rivalry with him. George Foreman was psychologically dismantled in Zaire. Now, he is a tortured and remote figure who refuses to take the fights that might rebuild his confidence. &quot;I got to talk to George, get him back on his feet,&quot; says Ali, adding that he would welcome the Texan as his next opponent. But for the moment, Foreman, who only a short year ago loomed like an ogre of invincibility, stays out of sight, not so much sulking as demoralised, an Achilles whose tent has fallen about his ears. In contrast, Ken Norton, who was devoured by Foreman in five minutes, has been a ubiquitous and muscular presence in the Philippines. He beat Ali once, and took the champion to a photo-finish in the return, but Norton at 31 looks a lot less hungry than he did. He has played a stud in a film and must have found it an untaxing role, for he is surrounded by attractive women of all shades wherever he goes. With Smokin&apos; Joe gone and Foreman discredited, Ali would find it increasingly hard to invest his doings with a sense of universal drama. The likelihood is that after one or two more fights he will depart the stage and devote himself to such trivia as a $5bn export business between America and Asia that he promises to supervise. His passing will surely have a cataclysmic effect. The championship he holds can never hope to mean as much without him. What happened in\u00a0Quezon City may prove to have been\u00a0a kind of requiem for the heavyweight division."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/13/alan-sugar-discovered-design-route-jobs", "sentences": ["Students from China and Korea, Taipei and Malaysia, Singapore and India who have all come to London to learn the skills that their economies need can see when they are being taken for a costly ride."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-13T22:00:00Z", "title": "As Alan Sugar discovered to his cost, design is our route to jobs | Deyan Sudjic", "tags": ["Design", "Terence Conran", "Culture", "Art and design", "V&A", "Museums"], "article": "Terence Conran started what has now become the Design Museum almost 30 years ago as a guerrilla operation within the Victoria and Albert Museum. Behind its venetian blinds and gleaming white-tiled floors, the Boilerhouse, as it was called then, felt a little like an upmarket squatter in the V&amp;A basement. The V&amp;A&apos;s more sensitive curators were troubled by exhibitions on the design of a Ford Sierra and the branding of Coca-Cola. In those days, amid the Raphael cartoons, the studio pottery and the Great Bed of Ware, they seemed mildly shocking. But lots of people came\u00a0to look. Contemporary design is now firmly on the cultural agenda, in no small part because of Conran&apos;s 60-year campaign to show there is more to life than the three-piece suite, Anaglypta wallpaper and toad in the hole. But the museum he founded still has a lot to do. The point of the Design Museum is not to lay down the law about taste; it is to show why design matters and what it can do to make the world work better. Design is about the things that shape the way we live, the choices we make and the way we earn our living. Railway carriages that treat their passengers with contempt, cell phones that are unusable, incomprehensible official forms: these are not just badly designed, they reflect badly on the values of the society that is forced to use them. And in the long term, they are unlikely to make much money for the companies that produce them. Largely on the basis of being the first\u00a0modern industrial\u00a0economy,\u00a0Britain has had an amazing track record\u00a0in making things. But with a few exceptions \u2013 such as aircraft wings, Formula One cars and software \u2013 that is no longer true. And\u00a0while Britain still produces many designers that the rest of the world wants to hire \u2013 from Stella McCartney and James Dyson to Apple&apos;s Jonathan Ive \u2013 it is increasingly difficult to believe it will go on producing those designers unless it invests in design and finds new ways to explore the subject. The UK&apos;s education system has been industrialised. Art and design are expensive to teach in terms of space and staff, but both have been cut back at the same time that student numbers have shot up. Government funding for design education has been swept away. Students from China and Korea, Taipei and Malaysia, Singapore and India who have all come to London to learn the skills that their economies need can see when they are being taken for a costly ride. Meanwhile the world&apos;s emerging economies are beginning to take design very seriously indeed. Seoul is building a Design Plaza \u2013 a massive complex of museum, gallery and event spaces designed by Zaha Hadid that is intended to underpin South Korea&apos;s determination to assume\u00a0the leadership of the consumer electronics and\u00a0car markets. Beijing has just staged its first design week, despite China&apos;s cavalier ways with intellectual property. Istanbul will stage its first design biennale next year. Hong Kong is planning a design museum; Belgrade now has a design week. A modern economy has to be based on\u00a0the creative use of design, rather than\u00a0generic\u00a0manufacturing.\u00a0 Design is\u00a0a way to create or safeguard jobs. But it&apos;s also a cultural issue. Some parts of the planet have been turned into passive consumers, while others decide what we all consume. There are no Jamaican, Nigerian or Icelandic cars, just as there are no Cambodian passenger planes. These cultures are, by certain key measures of the contemporary world (the ability to produce the goods that define everyday life), at the edge of things rather than the centre. Like it or not, they have been rendered passive consumers rather than leaders. Not everybody can make a Ferrari or a Mercedes, a Chanel or a Dior.\u00a0But it also seems that surprisingly few cultures can make an office chair or a tap, let alone a laptop or even an electric razor. It is a sharp divide between the passive and the active; between those who are limited to buying from the\u00a0market place\u00a0and those who create the goods that supply them. For countries made rich on natural resources, perhaps\u00a0this\u00a0doesn&apos;t matter. Dior and Ferrari are perfectly happy to tailor their products to the particular requirements of their customers in Qatar or Abu Dhabi. However, consumers who live in states less favourably endowed are not so fortunate. For Britain, this is an opportunity. We still have the ability to be at the centre of things, provided we go on investing in design. It is something that Alan Sugar understands better than most. Amstrad was once the company Steve Jobs and Bill Gates came to see to understand how to sell low-cost computers to the masses.\u00a0 But design, research and development were never the heart of Amstrad&apos;s business model. Now, they have\u00a0to be at the heart of Britain&apos;s. Which is why the Design Museum, with Terence Conran&apos;s support, is moving to a new, substantially larger home in London&apos;s former Commonwealth Institute, to help nurture a new generation of creative talent. \u2022 An exhibition celebrating Terence Conran&apos;s design legacy opens at theDesign Museum on 16 November \u2022 This article was amended on 16 November 2011.

It said trading in the US and Europe was in line with forecasts but results elsewhere had been hit by tough market conditions and delays in a number of large projects. In the UK it has closed its third regional office in two years, with work on Crossrail and an upgrade of Victoria station not expected to contribute to results until 2012. Analyst Joe Brent at Liberum Capital said:  While many had expected a warning today, the scale may surprise. The US was slightly ahead, the UK slightly worse. [There was a] \u00a35m cut in Australia, \u00a32m cut in Singapore, \u00a32m cut in India.  The order book continues to grow and will at some point trigger price stability. [In 2012] we expect strong recovery from a low base in the UK. Australia should benefit from the cost saving measures. We expect the US to be unexciting. Asia should be better. There is a risk that Europe is much weaker, due to the strength in Poland in 2011, and the risk of fall-out from the Eurozone crisis.  Investec cut its price target from 695p to 500p but kept its buy rating. Analyst Andrew Gibb said:  We expect today&apos;s profit warning will hit the share price and sentiment badly. However, we remain convinced that there is long term value in this stock, backed up by an net asset value per share of over 350p (excluding intangibles).   Meanwhile Mark Howson said this was the company&apos;s second profit warning this year, following one in May, and there could be risks to the payout to shareholders:  At the company guided \u00a321m-\u00a323m of pretax profit, we would view the current year dividend as being around 1.1 times covered by earnings per share. If the group had planned to cut it, we feel that they would have signalled that today, but nevertheless there are obvious risks to that 22.8p dividend per share that was paid in 2010 being paid again at that level in 2011.  The group net debt should be in region of \u00a3115m-\u00a3120m for 2011 - not a problem at this stage but that needs to be kept an eye on.

A cultural explosion followed the end of military rule in 1987: on the cinema front, film festivals and magazines sprung up to feed the new curiosity. Attendance more than doubled between 2000 and 2006, when it stood at 153m admissions a year (comparable to Britain&apos;s, with a smaller population). The directors who were packing them in the aisles were real-deal cinephiles, too. Many of the so-called &quot;386 generation&quot; who oversaw the Korean blockbusters \u2013 Shiri, Silmido, Joint Security Area, Taegukgi \u2013 came from the film clubs that appeared at the big universities in Seoul and elsewhere. Democratic South Korea had the film bug. But how much did South Korea really love cinema? Audiences had been encouraged, by the government, critics, commercial incentives and a protective quota, to consume homegrown product: in 2006, 63% of its box office went to local films \u2013 one of the highest rates in the world. Watching the south&apos;s sharply cheekboned face-off against whatever communist threat was featured in the latest blockbuster was deemed the patriotic thing to do. But some were sceptical about the nationalist slant of this &quot;cine-mania&quot;, as it was dubbed in Korea. After Bong Joon-ho&apos;s The Host swept all before it in August 2006, fellow director Kim Ki-duk, didn&apos;t mince his words: &quot;When you go to the multiplexes these days, you&apos;re immediately grasped by six posters of The Host. Rather than propagating this kind of repressive effect, why don&apos;t you build a cinema with 10,000 seats, so everyone can chant &apos;Dae-Han-Min-Gook!&apos; (long live great Korea!)?&quot; Perhaps this was sour grapes from a wilful arthouse tearaway. But the suggestion was still valid: there was something narrow about South Korea&apos;s brand of cinephilia \u2013 at least the commercial end of it. If the South Koreans were genuine cinephiles, or if the claustrophobic marketing applied to their marquee films allowed them to be, then Kim&apos;s work \u2013 such as the caustic The Isle, or the searching Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter \u2026 and Spring \u2013 might play as well in its home country as it did at foreign film festivals. Other countries, trying to elbow their way on to the global cultural stage in the noughties, also resorted to similar &quot;Your cinema needs you!&quot;-style loudhailing. When Day Watch, the second in the Matrix-esque trilogy produced by Russia&apos;s main TV station, was released in 2006, its producer spelt out the deal at its Moscow launch: &quot;This is our cinema, and whoever isn&apos;t with us is against us.&quot; State-sponsored cinephilia had patchy results there: Russian films never took more than 30% of box office. The disadvantages of the government-led approach began to show in South Korea, too: after the film quota was slashed in 2007, locally-made films dropped below the 40% mark. Of course supporting the home side is just one form of cinephilia \u2013 though you&apos;d hope a strong national cinema would be a side-effect of any culture with a firm interest in film. France is the other country that really springs to mind for raw passion for celluloid: it has done so much to shape the DNA of cinema, from arguably inventing it, through to the New Wave. And the love still resonates today. The UK is supposed to be the exact opposite: mistrustful of cinema&apos;s aesthetic haughtiness, more wedded to the cosy domestic certainties of television, and thoroughly in hock to Hollywood when we do fork over our \u00a310 to cross the threshold of the multiplex. I&apos;m not sure that the level of connoisseurship is the best way of gauging cinephilia around the world (and, short of memory-testing every self-declared film buff on the last edition of Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, it can&apos;t be measured anyway). Perhaps the simplest, most non-judgmental method is the average amount of cinema tickets bought per person in a particular country (the per capita figure). Then the cinephile world map, with statistics from 2010, is remade: 1. Iceland (5.4 tickets per person per year) 2. Singapore (4.5) 3. Australia (4.1) 4. US (4.0) 5. Ireland (3.7) 6. New Zealand (3.5) 7. France (3.4) 8. Hong Kong (3.2) 9. Canada (3.1) 10. South Korea (3.0) Source: IHS Screen Digest We shouldn&apos;t take this chart as the last word on cinephilia either. But there are a few interesting conclusions to be had. One: the aforementioned hardcore cinephile nations \u2013 either by design (South Korea) or by heritage (France) \u2013 aren&apos;t at the top. Two: wealthy countries with small populations and strongly developed cinema infrastructures (Iceland, Singapore, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong) dominate the list. It&apos;s obviously easier to maintain a high average under those conditions. Three: despite sliding or plateauing audience figures, the three big movie-producing powerhouses here (France, Hong Kong and the US) are still holding up OK. The US figure, given the much-discussed falloff of the American domestic market, is especially intriguing. If having over 6,000 cinemas is an indication of one thing, it&apos;s that your country still adores the movies, even if the love affair has grown a bit stale lately. Anyway, well done, Iceland: a free all-night showing of Twilight out-takes for you. And the UK? Loitering further down, with 2.7 tickets per person in 2010. I guess we saw Harry Potter, Inception and got bored two-thirds of the way through Tamara Drewe. \u2022 Thanks to Charlotte Jones at IHS Screen Digest for the statistics.

New Zealand, perhaps, or Canada? You&apos;re unlikely to choose Vietnam. But a new report from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), comparing the performance of public sectors globally, says managers and politicians should look to south-east Asia for inspiration. Since the end of the war there in 1975, Vietnam \u2013 population 90.5 million \u2013 has transformed its impoverished, centrally-planned economy to a mixed and fast-expanding one, where GDP has grown in real terms between 5% and 8%. More recently, Vietnam has instituted a radical simplification of its public sector. In 2007, the government launched Project 30, a plan to cut its administrative procedures by 30%. The country created a single, national database of all its administrative procedures and then assessed them against three criteria: whether they are necessary, whether they are user friendly, and whether they are legal. Vietnam has not yet succeeded in cutting its public services by almost a third \u2013 it has reached what the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) calls a &quot;crucial stage&quot; in attempting to implement its radical cuts, with the first results only just beginning to materialise. But in the UK its bold approach will be music to the ears of the government&apos;s efficiency and reform group, which has been wielding the axe over public services since the coalition government came to power. CIMA and the OECD, which reviewed Vietnam&apos;s project earlier this year, believe that other countries could learn from the Vietnamese approach. One of the key factors of its success was having a strong co-ordinating unit at the centre of government, with backing from senior politicians. Nguyen Xuan Phuc, the minister who led the reforms, is now deputy prime minister, so there is backing for reform at the very top of the government. Dedicated taskforces to carry out the plans in each department have also been important. The report&apos;s main conclusion is that public sectors around the world need a better, more professional way to make decisions. &quot;Effective performance management is crucial to achieve sustainable and stable public finances, and to gain public confidence that tax revenues are being used effectively,&quot; says Louise Ross, head of corporate management at CIMA. But using the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and Singapore, also singled out for praise in the CIMA report, as exemplars for public services will raise some eyebrows. It is no coincidence that the authoritarian regimes are being studied by China, as part of its reform programme. Noel Tagoe, head of research and development at CIMA, argues that the way forward is not just efficiency for its own sake but better and more open statistics about public spending in western-style democracies. He cites another example in the report: in 2009, there was a big discrepancy between the Greek government&apos;s estimate of the country&apos;s public sector deficit and official EU figures. A lack of trust in the figures led credit agencies to downgrade the country&apos;s debt rating, pushing Greece into further economic failure. &quot;Figures aren&apos;t going to determine political outcomes,&quot; he says. &quot;Politicians will still have to argue about their own philosophy and the practical appeal of any policies.&quot; But he clearly believes that shining a light on what works best means politicians may just be forced out of making short-term decisions and towards more fundamental measures that would ensure better public services. \u2022 Jane Dudman is editor of the Guardian&apos;s Public Leaders Network.

UK Sport, the government funding agency responsible for funnelling hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer and Lottery money into an elite sport system that is increasingly the envy of the world, is holding its annual conference. However, the pressure on these delegates goes way beyond meeting sales targets or delivering a PowerPoint presentation that satisfies the board. As the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, pointed out at the opening dinner on Monday night, for all the wider legacy aims of the Games, large sections of the public will weigh the success of the London Olympics in precious metal. Having promised to finish at least fourth in the medal table \u2013 and top Beijing by also winning more medals across more sports \u2013 the rhetoric must soon give way to delivery. By the understated reckoning of the UK Sport performance director, Peter Keen, Team GB is &quot;doing OK&quot; and remains on track to deliver. Robertson praised the progress made by UK\u00a0Sport since the amount of money going into Britain&apos;s elite sport system was turbocharged in 2005. The chairwoman, Sue Campbell, the chief executive, Liz Nicholl, and Keen will deserve all the plaudits they get next summer if they deliver on that ambitious target and leave behind a system that will ensure it is maintained in Rio and beyond. Nicholl&apos;s predecessor John Steele will also deserve his share. But first they must deliver \u2013 not only next summer but in years to come. Spain, Greece and even Australia experienced a performance low at the Games that followed the soaring high of a home Olympics. Robertson at once said that momentum must be maintained \u2013 but also fired a warning shot about the fact it would likely have to be done with less money. Indeed, for all that Robertson was full of praise for the achievements of Britain&apos;s sportsmen and women, there were several coded warnings for sports administrators. He made mention of reducing administrative costs \u2013 a reference to the stalemate over the plan to merge the elite sport agency UK\u00a0Sport and the grassroots funding body Sport England \u2013 and dropped a heavy hint that only by doing so could expansive legacy promises be delivered upon. That is controversial because the very success of UK Sport&apos;s &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; model has been in maintaining its separateness and laser-like focus on improving elite performance to the exclusion of all else. Its Mission 2012 (now apparently renamed Mission Control following the realisation it was necessarily time-limited) ethos is ruthlessly focused on rewarding success. The government wants to apply the lessons of that approach to the faltering grassroots sport legacy, delivered by Sport England, but there are those who argue its edge will be blunted if its mission is blurred. And just as his culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has done in the arts Robertson was keen to make the case for sport helping itself by securing better links with big business as a result of the Games. He sees it as a one\u2011off opportunity to cement those links and increase investment in British sport, both at elite and grassroots levels \u2013 and fears that chance may be missed if the union between the two is not sealed. Cynics will suspect that may also lead to a commensurate reduction in Treasury funding. Watching Robertson speak was Tessa Jowell, the Labour minister who did most to win the Olympics and remains on the 2012 board. One intriguing sideshow to the 2012 run-in will be whether the cross\u2011party unity that has been a hallmark of the Olympic project since Robertson accompanied the victorious party to Singapore in 2005 is maintained. He paid tribute to Jowell&apos;s role and the degree of unanimity of purpose across the government. Easy to say, given how well things have gone so far. It will be telling to see whether that holds as the pressure increases \u2013 and Boris faces Ken in the battle to be mayor of London just a few months before the Games. For those at the sharp end, too, the intense scrutiny will only increase from hereon in. A diverse range of speakers, from the conductor Charles Hazlewood to Wendy Pattenden, who oversaw Canada&apos;s controversial but successful Own the Podium strategy at the Vancouver Winter Games, will aim to frame the most important nine months of their professional lives. In conference rooms that will next summer play host to a series of Olympic events, buzzwords will abound at sessions on everything from handling the peculiar pressures of a home Games to ensuring athletes make the most of every tiny incremental advantage they can. For all concerned, from the politicians to the performance directors, the stakes are high and getting higher."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/15/anti-capitalist-occupy-pigeonholing", "sentences": ["And then there are hybrids that defy definition: China, with its large socialist legacy, is an obvious case, but Singapore is another, even more interesting, example.", "Singapore is usually touted as the model student of free-market capitalism, given its free-trade policy and welcoming attitude towards multinational companies.", "Would you say that Singapore is capitalist or socialist?"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-15T21:00:02Z", "title": "Anti-capitalist?

It is routinely described as anti-capitalist, but this label is highly misleading. As I found out when I gave a lecture at its Tent City University last weekend, many of its participants are not against capitalism. They just want it better regulated so that it benefits the greatest possible majority. But even accepting that the label accurately describes some participants in the movement, what does being anti-capitalist actually mean? Many Americans, for example, consider countries like France and Sweden to be socialist or anti-capitalist \u2013 yet, were their 19th-century ancestors able to time-travel to today, they would almost certainly have called today&apos;s US socialist. They would have been shocked to find that their beloved country had decided to punish industry and enterprise with a progressive income tax. To their horror, they would also see that children had been deprived of the freedom to work and adults &quot;the liberty of working as long as [they] wished&quot;, as the US supreme court put it in 1905 when ruling unconstitutional a New York state act limiting the working hours of bakers to 10 hours a day. What is capitalist, and thus anti-capitalist, it seems, depends on who you are. Many institutions that most of us regard as the foundation stones of capitalism were not introduced until the mid-19th century, because they had been seen as undermining capitalism. Adam Smith opposed limited liability companies and Herbert Spencer objected to the central bank, both on the grounds that these institutions dulled market incentives by putting upper limits to investment risk. The same argument was made against the bankruptcy law. Since the mid-19th century, many measures that were widely regarded as anti-capitalist when first introduced \u2013 such as the progressive income tax, the welfare state, child labour regulation and the eight-hour day \u2013 have become integral parts of capitalism today. Capitalism has also evolved in very different ways across countries. They may all be capitalist in that they are predominantly run on the basis of private property and profit motives, but beyond that they are organised very differently. In Japan interlocking share ownership among friendly enterprises, which once accounted for over 50% of all listed shares and still accounts for around 30%, makes hostile takeover very difficult. This has enabled Japanese companies to invest with a much longer time horizon than their British or American counterparts. Japanese companies provide lifetime employment for their core workers (accounting for about a third of the workforce), thereby creating strong worker loyalty. They also give the workers a relatively large say in the management of the production process, thus tapping their creative powers. There are heavy regulations in the agricultural and retail sectors against large firms, which complement the weak welfare state by preserving small shops and farms. German capitalism is as different from the American or British version as Japanese capitalism, but in other ways. Like Japan, Germany gives a relatively big input to workers in the running of a company, but in a collectivist way through the co-determination system, in which worker representation on the supervisory board allows them to have a say in key corporate matters (such as plant closure and takeovers), rather than giving a greater stake in the company to workers as individuals, as in the Japanese system. Thus, while Japanese companies are protected from hostile takeovers by friendly companies (through interlocking shareholding), German companies are protected by their workers (through co-determination). Even supposedly similar varieties of capitalism, for example Swedish and German, have important differences. German workers are represented through the co-determination system and through industry-level trade unions, while Swedish workers are represented by a centralised trade union (the Swedish Trade Union Confederation), which engages in centralised wage bargaining with the centralised employers&apos; association (the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise). Unlike in Germany, where concentrated corporate ownership has been deliberately destroyed, Sweden has arguably the most concentrated corporate ownership in the world. One family \u2013 the Wallenbergs \u2013 possesses controlling stakes (usually defined as over 20% of voting shares) in most of the key companies in the Swedish economy, including ABB, Ericsson, Electrolux, Saab, SEB and SKF. Some estimate that the Wallenberg companies produce a third of Swedish national output. Despite this, Sweden has built one of the most egalitarian societies in the world because of its large, and largely effective, welfare state. And then there are hybrids that defy definition: China, with its large socialist legacy, is an obvious case, but Singapore is another, even more interesting, example. Singapore is usually touted as the model student of free-market capitalism, given its free-trade policy and welcoming attitude towards multinational companies. Yet in other ways it is a very socialist country. All land is owned by the government, 85% of housing is supplied by the government-owned housing corporation, and a staggering 22% of national output is produced by state-owned enterprises. (The international average is around 10%.) Would you say that Singapore is capitalist or socialist? When it is so diverse, criticising capitalism is not very meaningful. What you have to change to improve the Swedish or the Japanese capitalist systems is very different from what you should do for the British one. In Britain, as already physically identified by the Occupy movement, it is clear the key reforms should be made in the City of London. The fact that the Occupy movement does not have an agreed list of reforms should not be used as an excuse not to engage with it. I&apos;m told there is an economics committee working on it and, more importantly, there are already many financial reform proposals floating around, often supported by very &quot;establishment&quot; figures like Adair Turner, the Financial Services Authority chairman, George Soros, the Open Society Foundations chairman, and Andy Haldane, the Bank of England&apos;s executive director for financial stability. By labelling the Occupy movement &quot;anti-capitalist&quot;, those who do not want reforms have been able to avoid the real debate. This has to stop. It is time we use the Occupy movement as the catalyst for a serious debate on alternative institutional arrangements that will make British (or for that matter, any other) capitalism better for the majority of people."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/15/markets-distrust-democracy-beijing-moscow", "sentences": ["And yet, according to one who was there, the leaders of the world&apos;s authoritarian states \u2013 China, Russia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia \u2013 had a spring in their step in Cannes, confident that they could face down whatever the economic meltdown threw at them."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-15T22:00:00Z", "title": "The markets distrust democracy.

Some wonder if the Arab revolutions put 2011 on a par with 1917, when the Ottoman Empire broke up. Perhaps it will stand alongside the great European upheavals of 1848 or 1989. Or there might be a mixed story to tell, with 2011 remembered as the year when democracy was demanded in one part of the world just as it was exposed as paralysed and impotent in the face of economic crisis almost everywhere else. Democracy&apos;s humbling has been most dramatically visible in Greece and Italy, where elected leaders have been pushed aside in favour of technocrats and fixers, elevated without so much as shaking a single voter&apos;s hand. Their mission will include the surrender of much economic sovereignty, putting those decisions further out of the reach of their own citizens. What Greeks and Italians endure today, other eurozone nations might well face tomorrow as they are told to make similar sacrifices of autonomy to save their economic skin. Whether in Europe or beyond, democratic leaders have seemed powerless to beat back the engulfing global crisis, the failure of the G20 at Cannes exposing their weakness for all to see. And yet, according to one who was there, the leaders of the world&apos;s authoritarian states \u2013 China, Russia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia \u2013 had a spring in their step in Cannes, confident that they could face down whatever the economic meltdown threw at them. Why is the democratic world faring so much worse than its non-democratic rivals in the current storm? Start with austerity. It may not be the best solution for a worldwide crisis of anaemic growth and falling demand \u2013 indeed it is surely making the problem worse \u2013 but it is what the markets demand in return for manageably low rates of interest on the money they lend to governments. That it is these men, not those we elect, who are all-powerful is not new: Bill Clinton discovered as much nearly two decades ago when, in a spitting rage, he shot back at advisers who warned he had to trim his economic plans: &quot;You mean to tell me that the success of my program and my re-election hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders?&quot; Given that it is the markets who call the tune, the question then becomes one&apos;s ability to dance to it most nimbly \u2013 and in that endeavour democracy is an impediment. Leaders who have to face the voters simply cannot impose austerity on an unwilling population without paying a price, whether in riots on the streets of Athens, protests in Madrid or Occupy camps in London and New York. In the immediate postwar era, people might have been readier to endure rationing and hardship in, say, Britain because there was a sharper sense of collective identity and solidarity, a belief\u00a0that their sacrifice was the consequence of a worthy cause and that good times would come eventually. But now society is less cohesive: austerity is seen as the result not of defeating foreign tyranny in a just war but of bankers&apos; reckless greed; and few believe, as they once did, that they are guaranteed to be better off than their parents. None of these headaches press the same way on the masters of Beijing or Moscow. &quot;Vladimir Putin is the most powerful human being in the world,&quot; says the political scientist and head of the Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer. &quot;He can change his country on a dime&quot; \u2013 unrestrained by the rule of law or by any meaningful democratic checks. Similarly China&apos;s rulers can switch national budgetary priorities in a heartbeat, spending trillions on stimulus with a stroke of a pen. If China&apos;s banks show the same unwillingness to lend as they have in Europe or the US then the politburo in Beijing simply issues an order for them to do so. No wonder that, contemplating the paralysed decision-making of Washington DC, the New York Times columnist Tom Friedman has fantasised about America becoming &quot;China for a day&quot;. For democracies, saddled with the creaking machinery of checks and balances, slow, incremental change is possible \u2013 but firefighting in a crisis is much harder. Indeed, it is democracy itself that the markets seem to despise. They don&apos;t mind when it delivers stability and predictability. The gridlock implicit in the US system was once appealing to the markets, with their conservative belief that the government that governs least, governs best. But now that same tendency tries their patience. When Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s downgraded the US credit rating in August, it stated baldly that this was its verdict on the weakness of &quot;American policymaking and political institutions&quot; and their inability to cope with the economic hurricane. Mark Leonard, who leads the European Council on Foreign Relations, calls this the &quot;democratic penalty&quot; that western nations are paying, a judgment that &quot;there is a real crisis of governability,&quot; with both the EU in a mess and the US paralysed by partisanship, the latter trend towards dysfunctionality exacerbated by the retreat into a dogmatic, rightwing laager by the Republican party. It&apos;s amusing, especially for outsiders, to laugh at the parlous state of the Republican presidential field, whether at Rick Perry&apos;s inability to remember his own proposals or Herman Cain&apos;s struggle to recall what exactly it was the US did in Libya recently. But what does it say when the highest office of the most powerful democratic nation on earth is sought by a group of such low quality? Some say it means no more than that the talented Republicans \u2013 the\u00a0likes of Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Mitch Daniels \u2013 have calculated that Barack Obama is too formidable a campaigner and fundraiser to beat, and that it makes more sense to run in 2016. But it&apos;s hard not to view a foreign policy debate as bad as the one the Republican candidates staged last Saturday as evidence of a fundamental lack of seriousness, a flight from the world from one of the two main parties. The larger problem of democracies&apos; weakness has not been caused by the economic crisis, so much as revealed by it. The growth statistics for the pre-crash decade tell a revealing story. The EU, US and Japan did OK, clustered together in the low single digits. But China and Russia enjoyed figures nearly twice as high. The best performing economies were the most authoritarian states. This is hard for westerners to take. Our post-1945 story is that democracy is the best possible system, delivering the best possible outcomes for peace and prosperity. We long believed that authoritarian systems were always bound to fail, because they could not adapt or innovate, that they were fated to be clumsy and out of touch with their\u00a0citizens, like the old\u00a0Soviet Union.\u00a0But China, for one, is challenging\u00a0that received and comforting wisdom. It uses\u00a0some of the\u00a0techniques of democracy \u2013 including\u00a0ceaseless polling \u2013 to ensure it avoids\u00a0steps that might trigger social unrest, an approach Leonard calls &quot;deliberative dictatorship&quot;. In the end, democracy will surely prove its innate strength. Putin&apos;s tsarist rule \u2013 which, like that of the Saudi royal family, is reliant on extracting resources from the ground \u2013 cannot last for ever. But 2011 has punctured the sense of easy supremacy democratic societies used to enjoy. To reassert themselves they might have to break from the rules now choking them, and insist that it is people, not markets, that are sovereign."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/16/china-us-troops-australia", "sentences": ["In the last year the Pentagon has also negotiated wider access to military facilities in Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines, prompting fears in Beijing that it is engaged in a policy of encirclement, as well as becoming involved in the row over waters in the South China Sea, which are claimed by several nations."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-16T18:53:43Z", "title": "China uneasy over US troop deal in Australia", "tags": ["US news", "US foreign policy", "Australia news", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Barack Obama", "Julia Gillard", "Hu Jintao", "Australian politics"], "article": "Strains between China and the United States look set to overshadow a key Asian summit later this week after Barack Obama unveiled plans to station troops in Australia and step up Washington&apos;s commitment to the entire Asia-Pacific region.

Beijing&apos;s unease has also been heightened by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&apos;s insistence that the South China Sea issue be included as a topic for discussion at the east Asia summit in Manila, which will be attended by President Obama, President Hu Jintao of China and other regional leaders. China had requested that the sensitive issue be omitted. Ahead of the summit Obama made a whirlwind 27-hour visit to Australia, where he and Julia Gillard, the prime minister, announced that from next year 250 marines will be stationed in the Northern Territory, rotating in and out of Darwin for around six months at a time. Over the next few years this will build to a force of 2,500 US personnel. In the last year the Pentagon has also negotiated wider access to military facilities in Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines, prompting fears in Beijing that it is engaged in a policy of encirclement, as well as becoming involved in the row over waters in the South China Sea, which are claimed by several nations. &quot;The United States is also trying to get involved in a number of regional maritime disputes, some of which concern China&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity,&quot; a commentary from China&apos;s official Xinhua news agency said.

China, he said, stood for peaceful development and co-operation. &quot;We also believe that the external policies of countries in the region should develop along these lines,&quot; Liu told a news briefing in Beijing.

Now Burma&apos;s most famous face is becoming ubiquitous in Rangoon: on trinkets, posters and newspaper front pages, the serene features of Aung San Suu Kyi are hard to avoid. And so is the impression that Burma is on the edge of something quite unexpected and unusual in these parts. Change. After more than two decades of rule that has been by turns obstinate, cruel and surreal, the generals are showing tentative signs of reform. Labour unions have been granted the right to strike. Some political prisoners have been released. An unpopular dam project on the Irrawaddy was suspended, the authorities preferring to annoy their Chinese paymasters rather than furious locals. But is Burma about to undergo a proper thaw after years of frosty diplomacy \u2013 or is it just a play by the generals to improve international relations at a time when they are short of cash and intimidated by the rise of their mighty northern neighbour? Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary and the first cabinet minister from an EU country to visit in decades, told journalists on Thursday that the country was &quot;making clear and immutable progress&quot;. &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi is an inspiration and a personal hero to many across the world. It is an immense honour to have met her \u2026 As I saw today on the visit we made to a school in Rangoon, she represents the hopes and dreams of Burma&apos;s people,&quot; said Mitchell. &quot;I am making this unprecedented visit because there are tentative \u2013 but real \u2013 signs of progress in Burma, which I welcome. But my message is clear: we need urgent further progress. I call upon the Burmese government to release all political prisoners, including Min Ko Naing, immediately; to ensure the coming byelections are free and fair; and to take steps to end the conflict on Burma&apos;s borders and strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law. These actions would signal the way for a fundamental shift in the relationship between Burma and Britain.&quot; Hundreds of people are still detained by the authorities, but there have been signs of an imminent release of prisoners in recent days. Labour minister Aung Kyi said the move would come &quot;in the near future&quot;. Earlier this week, Aung San Suu Kyi, who is considering a return to the political fray, expressed cautious hope about recent progress. Reform hopes have centred on the figure of Thein Sein, president since March, a moderate who consented to a meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi in August. Burmese in Rangoon generally speak well of a president whom many believe did not want the job, seeing him as a figure of compromise and relative honesty, with an aim of modernising his moribund country. The president speaks of wanting to move Burma towards a &quot;disciplined, flourishing democracy&quot;. U Win Tin, a founding member of Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s National League for Democracy, said: &quot;There are really two governments in this country; the government of Thein Sein and then the military.&quot; He pointed to Thein Sein&apos;s much-applauded speeches to parliament promising &quot;clean government&quot; and peace with ethnic armed groups, while the military waged war against ethnic rebel groups. Others trust the leadership still less. Newly released labour activist Su Su Nwe said: &quot;The government doesn&apos;t follow the law; that&apos;s why there are a lot of problems.&quot; Thein Sein&apos;s military proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, rigged last year&apos;s election, and took up the majority of seats in the country&apos;s two national parliaments. Still, legislative reforms have been passed and include a labour organisation bill that gives Burmese the right to strike and unionise for the first time since the 1960s. A &quot;massive&quot; step, according to Steve Marshall, the International Labour Organisation&apos;s Rangoon liaison officer. &quot;Our labour can organise according to their will,&quot; said the deputy labour minister U Myint Thein. &quot;It will bring benefits to the economy.&quot; The president has made overtures to the west and reform-minded elites, promising human rights progress and market-orientated economics. Changes have included an easing of censorship, reform of electoral laws, privatisations and calls for exiles to return. U Myint Thein said: &quot;Already we have changed, now the west should respond.&quot; Part of the leadership&apos;s motivation for change could be economic. Sanctions and international isolation left Burma solely in the orbit of China, especially with regard to loans. Professor Shujie Yao of the University of Nottingham said that, in the face of China, &quot;many countries are fearing for their sovereignty, even Japan&quot;. &quot;We need new friends,&quot; said Burmese economist Khin Maung Nyo. &quot;We have two problems: a lack of funds and also the government should manage funds effectively and wisely.&quot; Burma&apos;s debt has been growing fast and its currency is unstable. &quot;Officially $1 is equal to six kyat but in practice it&apos;s 800 or 900 kyat to the dollar,&quot; added Khin Maung Nyo. Some allege this is a part of a broader scam to hide revenues. The government spends around 23% of GDP on the military, yet only 1% on education and 1% on health, causing what Paul Whittingham, head of the Burma section of the Department for International Development, describes as a &quot;crisis in healthcare&quot;. Another legislative move has involved a re-examination of laws for protest. Four years ago, protests led by Burmese monks were brutally crushed. Parliament is now drafting laws that allow protesters to peacefully &quot;process&quot; if they remain silent. Slogans may be carried only if pre-approved. Mindful of the startling change in the Arab world, popular revolt is a matter of serious concern to the generals. This week a small group of monks in Mandalay persisted with a public rally to demand prisoner releases. More dramatic still was the outcome from a grassroots movement against the Myitsone dam being built by the Chinese on the Irrawaddy. The dam would have flooded an area the size of Singapore and destroyed fisheries and infrastructure downriver. Ninety percent of the energy generated was to go to China, while the cash generated would have disappeared into the dark recesses of the junta&apos;s inscrutable financial ledger. Not surprisingly locals revolted, with bomb attacks and &quot;save the Irrawaddy&quot; messages plastered on the walls of towns and cities, even Rangoon. On the streets of Rangoon, the people wait for change. &quot;We hope things are moving, slow and steady,&quot; said one wistful teacher who did not want to be named. &quot;Maybe.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 18 November 2011 to remove references to Rangoon as the capital, and to correct the spelling of Su Su Nwe."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/17/northern-rock-branson-virgin-trains", "sentences": ["That is the success that Virgin brings to business.&quot; If Virgin Trains proved to be a smart piece of business, so was a deal to sell 49% of Virgin Atlantic to Singapore Airlines for \u00a3600m in 1999.", "Singapore Airlines has written down its stake in the carrier to zero but several attempts to sell the shareholding have proved fruitless."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-17T21:18:12Z", "title": "Will Northern Rock go the way of Virgin Trains?", "tags": ["Northern Rock", "UK news", "Richard Branson", "Banking", "Banks and building societies", "Virgin Trains", "Business", "Venture capital"], "article": "An industry in crisis, held together by handouts from the public purse and hated by its customers. De-nationalised on the cheap, with an entrepreneurial billionaire promising to sprinkle his personal magic on a tired and worn-out business model. Richard Branson&apos;s takeover of Northern Rock draws striking parallels with the controversial creation of Virgin \u00a0Trains in March 1997. As now, the deal was fronted by Branson but backed by venture capitalists. Likewise, it was regarded as unprofitable and potentially damaging to an astutely crafted brand. And, as now, only the &quot;good&quot; bit of the public-owned business (the train operating companies) passed to Branson. The &quot;bad&quot; bit, the rails network, was left in the hands of the taxpayers, who still subsidise Network Rail to the tune of \u00a33.7bn a year. Virgin Trains, operator of the west coast mainline and cross-country services, almost single-handedly destroyed what was until then Branson&apos;s bulletproof brand. In 1998 Virgin Trains attracted the most complaints from rail passengers: 195,000 letters were received complaining about its services and each month there were 7,000 critical phone calls. In survey after survey passengers ranked it bottom on service and time-keeping. But Virgin Trains, albeit many years later, cemented Branson&apos;s reputation not just as a start-up entrepreneur but also as a turnaround merchant. Following the \u00a31.2bn investment in Pendolino trains, Virgin Trains entirely replaced the pre-1997 rolling stock it had inherited. In August it showed record revenues and profits, and a doubling of passengers over the past six years. A magnet for media coverage around the world thanks to his entrepreneurial success and love of a photo opportunity, Branson can be surprisingly diffident in person. However the demeanour \u2013 a mixture of the distracted and laid back \u2013 belies the commercial acumen of one of the sharpest deal-makers around. Since launching Virgin Trains he has taken home dividends surpassing \u00a3188m, including \u00a317.8m last year. It is widely known within rail industry circles that the 2006 renegotiation of the west coast franchise still rankles in some corners of the Department for Transport. A Virgin Trains spokesperson said the business had taken a &quot;huge risk&quot; in operating a franchise on the London-to-Glasgow line. &quot;Virgin took over a failing rail business in 1997 and took the huge risk of turning it round. For seven years no dividends were taken, until the business became one of the fastest-growing and successful rail franchises, doubling the number of customers and achieving 90% customer satisfaction. That is the success that Virgin brings to business.&quot; If Virgin Trains proved to be a smart piece of business, so was a deal to sell 49% of Virgin Atlantic to Singapore Airlines for \u00a3600m in 1999. Singapore Airlines has written down its stake in the carrier to zero but several attempts to sell the shareholding have proved fruitless. Branson is seeking to renew the West Coast franchise again next year but the new contract is expected to be less lucrative. Nonetheless, he has impeccable timing and his investments in transport are compelling evidence of it. Branson built the Virgin brand around his willingness to take on entrenched and powerful interests, championing consumer interest in the face of corporate might. The &quot;Bank of Branson&quot; (also dubbed Northern Virgin by City traders) will follow the same marketing path Branson has just published a book, entitled Screw Business as Usual. It opens with Branson standing outside his Necker Island villa, flames sweeping into the night sky while the actor Kate Winslett emerges through the smoke. The next morning he gathers everyone for breakfast to talk about the new house he will build, &quot;more innovative, more beautiful, even more inspiring&quot; than the previous one. His banking vision is in the same vein. He writes of Virgin Money as a community rather than profit-making vehicle \u2013 &quot;we do pay bonuses, though not quite on the RBS scale!&quot; The existing banking model is broken, he says. &quot;Virgin should always remain a retail bank, and the big banks should be broken up.&quot; But he has pledged to break the mould in banking before. In the 1990s he told journalists the &quot;big four&quot; banks were exploiting customers and his Virgin One account would revolutionise matters. &quot;We hope to turn the four big clearing banks into the four little clearing banks \u2026 this account is going to be the most radical thing that&apos;s happened to the banking industry in the last 50 years,&quot; he said. But two years on the enterprise had just 25,000 customers. The Virgin tag came off as it was rebranded the One account. Branson bailed out, selling his stake to RBS for \u00a345m. His previous forays into financial services include Virgin Direct, which started in 1995 with a no-frills personal equity plan before swiftly moving into life insurance and personal pensions; but during the late 1990s it came under fire for allegedly penalising healthy gay men by &quot;loading&quot; their life insurance premiums. His UK stock market index-tracking fund, another &quot;mould-breaker&quot; fighting entrenched fees in the fund management industry, attracted more than 200,000 investors; but it is frequently cited as among the worst-value in its sector, charging an annual fee of more than double that of low-cost competitors. It&apos;s timely for Branson to take on the banks. But with his claims last time round being over-inflated, it could be a while before his new rivals take fright.

And the UK is in the vanguard of adoption of non-PC devices such as mobiles, tablets and games consoles for browsing the web, ranking with the US second only to Singapore in the use of the new devices for browsing the web. Although tablet browsing is still only a tiny slice of overall browsing, together with smartphones they are a fast-growing segment of the browsing market, the research found. The comScore research also found patterns of usage were different throughout the day depending on the device being used: during weekdays, tablet traffic had a morning peak at about 8am before falling off and then rising again from 4pm onward until it hit a daily peak at 10pm \u2013 suggesting that people were using them at home, possibly while watching TV. For smartphones, there was a similar 8am peak and a smaller fall which then also rose to a 10pm peak, though without such a large fall during the day \u2013 suggestive of people using them as a device they carry with them everywhere. PCs, meanwhile, have a peak in web browsing at 9am which then fell steadily through the day.     Variation in US web traffic by source to news sites during the week. Data and graphic: comScore    At the weekend, the usage pattern in the US is much steadier, with tablets, mobiles and PCs all seeing a peak at 9.30am and tailing away, with a second peak at about 9.30pm for PCs and around 10pm for tablets.      Variation in US web traffic by source to news sites during the weekend. Data and graphic: comScore    The study, carried out in August and September, gathers data from site access by devices as well as other information gathered by the company. In the UK and US, 6.8% of web browsing comes from non-PC sources. Singapore, which leads the world, has 7.2% of web browsing coming from non-PC devices.  In the UK, 67.6% of non-PC web browsing was from mobiles, 24.7% by tablets and 7.7% by other devices such as games consoles and e-readers. In the US the figure was 64.4%, 28.1% and 7.5%. That means in the UK and US about 4% of overall web browsing comes via smartphones and 1.6% from tablets. While small, they also indicate rapid growth in a markets which barely existed four years ago. The iPhone first went on sale in mid-2007, while the first Android phones were not available until the end of 2008. The iPad only became available in the UK in May 2010; since then about 40m iPads have been sold worldwide, with the number of tablets including Android models in use probably at 50m. That compares to an installed base of around 1.5bn PCs worldwide. Estimates for the number of smartphones in use worldwide are between 600m and 800m, depending on replacement speed.  The comScore figures might imply at first that tablets are under-represented in web viewing, as the number in use is equivalent to 2.6% of the number of installed PCs. Similarly, there are nearly half as many smartphones as PCs in use. But instead the figures appear to point to the way that people are jumping between devices \u2013 and especially to the way that tablets have begun to be used at the beginning and end of the day instead of a PC. Thus tablet owners use their devices to browse news websites at the start of the day, and then move on to a PC during the working day, and then back to a tablet at the end of the day. Similarly, mobile phones may be used for web browsing through the day when people are away from a PC. The growth of tablet use is borne out by the fact that even as non-PC traffic grew over the past four months, the proportion from tablets rose within it from around 20% to 30%. Meanwhile smartphones were pushed down, as were games consoles and e-readers, even though usage increased. &quot;While tablets have thus far only penetrated a small percentage of the US population, the potential for this device to break into the mainstream is significant, as more manufacturers offer tablets at varying price points,&quot; comScore notes.  &quot;Currently, half or more of tablet users report having engaged in activities such as consuming news, viewing entertainment, social networking, and shopping on their devices at least once in the previous month. With more publishers optimising their properties for tablet presentation and developers creating apps specific to tablets, it is likely that tablet owners&apos; engagement with their devices will only continue to grow.&quot;  Overall, comScore says the patterns are indicative of a new, global breed of &quot;digital omnivores&quot; who consume internet content across a multitude of devices through the day. In five global markets \u2013 the UK, US, Australia, Japan and Singapore \u2013 more than 5% of internet traffic came from non-PC devices. The increase in Wi-Fi availability in places such as coffee shops and some food outlets is also helping drive that use, with 37.2% of US digital traffic coming from mobile phones using a Wi-Fi connection. Yet tablets \u2013 commonly used with a Wi-Fi connection \u2013 were increasingly seen accessing the net via mobile broadband, with just less than 10% of connections coming on the move. In all, the US mobile population grew 19% to 116m users \u2013 compared to around 260m of the total population in the US \u2013 whose use of mobile media is being driven by smartphones. Of those, half use &quot;mobile media&quot; via the web; the others use a mixture of voice and texting. Tablets \u2013 principally the iPad \u2013 are growing rapidly in use, the report found. &quot;Although tablets have yet to be widely adopted, they already contribute nearly 2% of all US web browsing traffic, driven almost exclusively by the iPad, which currently accounts for more than 97% of all tablet traffic,&quot; the company said.  Apple devices were also used disproportionately to their installed base, said comScore: Apple&apos;s iOS runs 43.1% of the smartphones and tablets in use in the US, compared to 34.1% for Android devices and 15.4% for BlackBerry maker RIM. But in browsing, iOS makes up 58.5% of the use, against 31.9% for Android and 5.0% for RIM \u2013 suggesting iOS users browse about 36% more than expected, Android users 6.5% less, and BlackBerry users only one-third as much. US tablet ownership was concentrated among young males, with half being used in households earning $100,000 (\u00a363,000) and above, the research found, though the expectation is that the Amazon Kindle Fire, priced at $199 against the iPad&apos;s $399, will broaden tablet adoption. Content availability was also important: half of tablet users had made a purchase via a tablet in the past month, the study found."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/nov/20/new-to-nature-labuanium-vitatum", "sentences": ["Peter Ng of the National University of Singapore and Peter Davie of the Queensland Museum report the new species, Labuanium vitatum, from Christmas Island, Nicobar Island, Nias and Java."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-20T00:05:41Z", "title": "New to Nature No 59: Labuanium vitatum", "tags": ["Zoology", "Animals", "Wildlife", "Science", "World news", "Environment"], "article": "A bright purple, tree-climbing crab has been discovered on several Indian Ocean islands. Peter Ng of the National University of Singapore and Peter Davie of the Queensland Museum report the new species, Labuanium vitatum, from Christmas Island, Nicobar Island, Nias and Java. Secretive habits had contributed to this conspicuously coloured species remaining unrecognised. It appears to be active only in wet weather and at night and to spawn during full moon cycles between November and April. When active, these and related arboreal crabs are encountered near the bases of trees growing along the seashore. The carapace of mature crabs can reach 40mm in width. Its ecological low profile, however, is only part of the story. Specimens collected in the late 1970s were mistakenly identified as Sesarma oceanicum, a species that is itself now considered a junior synonym of the diverse crab species Labuanium rotundatum. In their study, Ng and Davie concluded that specimens long identified as L. rotundatum represent a species complex. In addition to describing N. vitatum as new, they elevated a subspecies first described in 1899 from New Guinea to full species status as L. papuomalesiacum. Scientific names must keep pace with the growth of knowledge. Based on new collections and evidence, experts periodically review earlier species descriptions to test whether they still reflect our best theories about the evolution of that group. With so many species and so few specialists there are many groups of invertebrates that, like arboreal crabs, will continue to yield biodiversity surprises as they are studied in greater detail in the field, museum, and laboratory. Even with these improvements, our knowledge of crabs of the genus Labuanium remains fragmentary. There are few specimens of the 10 known species, including the four known from the Indian Ocean. A colleague and former Christmas Island chief warden, Max Orchard, has a forthcoming book on Christmas Island crabs that will facilitate future observations on their fascinating natural history.

The strength of the voluntary sector in the town is amply demonstrated by the plethora of clubs, groups, societies and courses available, catering for just about every interest, from music of all types, am-dram, art, craft, dance, photography, sport, politics, cooking, gardening, astronomy, story-telling, conservation, history, mystery and alternative healing, to the Tolkien readers&apos; group, knitting circle, women&apos;s discos, men&apos;s breakfasts, and the Steiner education group. So much is happening on every day of the week that local people are spoilt for choice.  For example, on Thursdays you could choose to sing with the Community Choir, attend a zumba class, practise Tibetan yoga or Pilates, meditation or French conversation, go to a quiz night or do dances of universal peace; all are available on the doorstep. Then there are the committees supporting various specific events, such as the Handmade Parade, the summer Arts Festival, the World Dock Pudding Championships, the Mytholmroyd Gala, and the November Charity Bonfire, all working away quietly throughout the year to ensure the success of their particular event.      Hebden Bridge interior. Photograph: Rachael Smith    As well as groups pursuing established interests, Hebden Royd residents have demonstrated an admirable capacity to quickly get together to create new ones should the need suddenly arise. A community association was rapidly formed at Scout Road in nearby Mytholmroyd, when the local Methodist cricket club was selling its ground, threatening an important piece of green space.  Most houses in the area are former mill-workers&apos; terraced cottages, built closely together on steep hillsides, and in such streets gardens are something of a rarity, so a flat open space such as the cricket pitch and adjoining play area was a valuable community asset. People gave whatever they could afford to successfully secure the site, while the community association quickly applied for lottery and other grants to modernise the play equipment and develop a community garden.  Another rallying round occurred when Hebden Bridge Community Association obtained an asset transfer of the former Town Hall building, which is now being extensively re-developed to include a Creative Quarter, with its own website and blog. And the ability of Upper Valley people to respond in an emergency was again demonstrated when the community raised thousands of pounds within a few days in order to repatriate the body of a young local woman who had died in unexplained circumstances in Singapore. The proceeds from quickly arranged fund-raising events and donations ensured that her sisters could travel to the Far East to make arrangements.  Hebden Bridge is a small town with a big heart - only last week, the local Churches Together group stepped forward to save the town&apos;s annual Children&apos;s Christmas Toy Appeal, which has benefitted nearly 3,000 families during the 18 years it has been in operation. The project was in danger of folding because the Ground Floor centre, which has co-ordinated the appeal since its inception, has this year been obliged to reduce staff numbers as a result of local council funding cuts.  Thankfully, altruism is alive and well and flourishing in the Upper Calder Valley. Just one question \u2013 does the free jam afternoon advertised for Sunday 27th at the &apos;Hole In The Wall&apos; involve cookery or music?

The iPhone 4S topped 1m pre-orders in a single day. The number is also far lower than estimates for the company&apos;s previous flagship smartphone, the N8, which launched in October 2010 and is thought to have sold between 3.5 and 4m units in its first quarter, according to research firm Inderes.

But China&apos;s leaders are engaged in a vigorous debate about the country&apos;s direction as they jockey for position before next year&apos;s transition of power to a new generation. And, in a rare departure from the disciplined displays of unity that characterise the communist elite, they are beginning to air their differences in public. &quot;The gap between people holding different opinions is pretty large. It is also evident to the public, which is very rare,&quot; said Qiu Feng, a liberal scholar from the Unirule Institute of Economics in Beijing. &quot;There are differing views. There were before, but they couldn&apos;t be seen easily. Now leaders have expressed them in public,&quot; said Professor Zhang Ming, of the political science department at Renmin University. For more than 20 years, since a split in senior ranks helped to foster the student pro-democracy protests, leaders have striven to preserve a facade of unity. &quot;One of the most important lessons Chinese leaders have learned from the 1989 Tiananmen incident is that they should not reveal their internal conflicts to the public,&quot; said Cheng Li, director of research at the Brookings Institution&apos;s John L Thornton China Centre. But there are growing hints of an internal debate about the country&apos;s economic and social direction, amid increasing unrest and concerns about economic prospects. Some see this as a choice between the &quot;Chongqing&quot; model and the &quot;Guangdong&quot; model. &quot;This phenomenon is caused by the extremity of China&apos;s social problems,&quot; said Qiu. &quot;On the one hand, over the past 30 years we have seen the emergence of China&apos;s middle class, who now have a stronger appetite for political participation and rights protection. The Guangdong model is focusing on this social structure. On the other hand, [there is] a wealth gap, which is what the Chongqing model is about.&quot; That does not mean that the Guangdong model is promoting democracy: it seems to be about a broader sense that the better off are looking at issues beyond their pay packets, such as quality of life and perhaps greater government transparency. Others see the split in more crudely economic terms, with the Chongqing model focusing on lifting up those at the bottom of society, and the Guangdong model suggesting that the benefits of development will help everyone. The theoretical discussion is inseparable from the prospects of the men who have promoted these ideas: Bo Xilai and Wang Yang, the party secretaries of Chongqing and Guangdong respectively. It is now assumed that Xi Jinping will become president next year, and Li Keqiang is expected to take over as premier. But other senior figures are manoeuvring for spots on the politburo standing committee. &quot;If you read People&apos;s Daily [the official Communist party newspaper], you will see indirect campaigning on behalf of the different leaders. You read about Bo Xilai; you read about Wang Yang,&quot; said Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese elite politics at the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore. &quot;Before the sixth plenum [a meeting of senior leaders which this year focused on culture] there was a major article about Guangdong&apos;s cultural development \u2013 very timely promotion for Wang,&quot; he added. Wang has promoted &quot;Happy Guangdong&quot;, a concept that addresses quality of life issues. Bo Xilai has taken an even more striking approach, launching a crackdown on organised crime, followed by a &quot;red culture&quot; campaign with wholesome television programming and the mass singing of revolutionary songs. While they have delighted many in Chongqing, the crackdown&apos;s methods and the quasi-Maoist tone of the cultural drive alarmed liberals. nalysts say Bo seems to fear his campaign is struggling: recently, he launched a sudden and unexpected defence of his record. &quot;Some comrades have misunderstood, feeling that economic development and improving people&apos;s livelihoods might be a contradiction,&quot; Bo told editors, according to Caixin magazine. Bo Zhiyue said: &quot;This is Chinese politics; you are not supposed to stick your neck out \u2026 Bo is so high profile and a lot of people are unhappy.&quot; Meanwhile, Wang told a provincial meeting this summer that learning and reviewing party history was more beneficial &quot;than just singing its praises&quot;, a comment that some suspected was a dig at Bo&apos;s red songs campaign. But while Cheng Li believes some of the recent developments &quot;suggest political infighting in the top leadership is getting out of control&quot;, others stress that disagreements over people or policies should not be read as outright conflict. Some analysts thought a flurry of publicity for Li Keqiang this year was evidence that he was certain to become premier, while others wondered if his backers felt he needed more promotion. In the end, said Bo Zhiyue, the issues will be settled in the usual way: &quot;Collective bargaining among top leaders, mainly among the current members of the standing committee and former leaders, with politburo members also having a say.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/nov/25/f1-sebastian-vettel-red-bull", "sentences": ["Di Resta outqualified his team-mate in the first half of the season, though Adrian Sutil has been stronger in recent races Season high Sixth place, Di Resta (Singapore), Sutil (Germany) Low point The team looked most forlorn in Turkey Key to next season Boss Vijay Mallya is sure to stick with Di Resta next year but will he keep Sutil or bring in Nico H\u00fclkenberg?"], "publicationDate": "2011-11-25T21:42:28Z", "title": "F1 review of the season: Sebastian Vettel leads Red Bull stampede | Paul Weaver", "tags": ["Formula One 2011", "Formula One", "Sport", "Red Bull", "McLaren", "Ferrari", "Mercedes GP", "Renault", "Force India", "Sauber", "Toro Rosso", "Williams", "Hispania Racing", "Caterham F1", "Virgin Racing"], "article": "Red Bull S Vettel (Ger): Wins 11 Pts 374 Podiums 16 Poles 14 M Webber (Aus): Wins 0 Pts 233 Podiums 9 Poles 3 Total: Wins 11 Pts 607 Podiums 25 Poles 17 Season in a sentence Eradicated the silly mistakes of 2010 to land another championship double with the best part of two months of the season remaining  How do the drivers rate?

My travel buddy Nicole and I are lying flat-out on our sarongs. We&apos;ve hiked for three hours through villages, across savannah-like terrain and down a vertical cliff path to get here. And now, in the shade of a boulder on Nyang-Nyang beach \u2013 a vast, isolated stretch of coast on the southernmost tip of Bali \u2013 we realise it&apos;s going to take us another three hours to get back. At least Argus has packed provisions. He hands out bottles of Pocari Sweat (the Indonesian equivalent of Lucozade) and parcels of noodles, tofu and boiled eggs wrapped in banana leaves. After lunch, we swim in the bubbly waves of the Indian Ocean. &quot;It&apos;s OK,&quot; says Nicole, staring up at the cliff from the sea, &quot;I think I can see a handrail.&quot; But there is no handrail. There isn&apos;t even a path. The route back up the cliff is a terrifying vertical scramble. Hearts racing and knees shaking, we scrabble over boulders, down gullies and through thick, tropical foliage. We recover in a nearby warung (a roadside shop and cafe). Newborn chicks scamper around our feet as Argus shares a selection of dragon fruit, pineapple and passion fruit. Next stop: Pura Luhur, an 11th-century Hindu temple overrun with thieving monkeys. Filthy, sweaty and sunburnt, we return to our hotel at dusk. We are staying at the ultra-luxurious Alila Villas Uluwatu. There are four Alila properties in Bali, each offering guests &quot;a total destination experience&quot; \u2013 a chance to discover Bali via a choice of guided tours or &quot;journeys&quot; that introduce you to local life, taking you to rural and remote parts of the island. Our six-hour endurance test was the first of many incredible journeys we sampled during our 10-day visit to the island. To celebrate our safe return from the hike, we are served champagne (all part of the &quot;journey&quot; package) in the sunset cabana \u2013 a bronze and wooden jigsaw structure that protrudes over the Bukit peninsula.     Rice terraces, Ubud, Bali. Photograph: Will Venning    The hotel was designed by Singapore-based architects WOHA and has received a slew of architectural and environmental awards since opening in 2009. It has 84 one-, two- and three-bedroom villas built from local rattan and recycled wood and clad in flat lava rocks, which absorb the heat and camouflage the villas. A screen door behind the bed opens up on to a private, planted courtyard with an outdoor rain shower (which is also a night-time hangout for copulating frogs). Another screen door enables you to plop into your own plunge pool straight from the sofa. Outside, angular frangipani trees artfully shed their flowers on my sun lounger. There&apos;s even a private cabana constructed of flat black lava slabs. It&apos;s like sunbathing inside a giant Jenga game. On day three, we reluctantly pack up and head west. The hotel provides a taxi service between resorts (public transport on Bali is virtually nonexistent and the roads are unruly and overcrowded), so we&apos;re driven the 50km to Alila Villas Soori near Kerambitan, a discreet complex of 44 beach-side villas. The landscape is equally rural here: bristling green rice paddies tickle the glittering black coastline. We wander down to the beach. &quot;It&apos;s like walking on a giant eyeshadow,&quot; says Nicole as we scrunch up our toes in the compact, black sand. We&apos;re watched by young, chestnut-coloured cows as we explore the rock pools and intricately carved Hindu temples on the shoreline. In the shallows I find a small, hand-formed red clay pot, which I take home with me. That afternoon, we arrange our next Alila adventure: a cycle tour of the villages of Tabanan and Kerambitan. Tabanan is known locally as the rice bowl of Bali. Ancient irrigation systems lace the fields and black, bird-shaped kites soar high above the crops. A young boy wrapping the string of his kite around an old flip-flop waves as we pedal down the narrow lanes that separate the tiny plots of land. The Balinese still widely worship Dewi Sri, the pre-Hindu era goddess of rice and fertility. Every paddy has its own temple, where handmade offerings \u2013 tiny morsels of rice and bright petals arranged on origami-like banana leaves \u2013 are left. You see these offerings scattered all over the island. Later, we stop in the shade of a hairy old banyan tree to examine a little heap of offerings which include a lone cigarette and what looks like a handful of mini Ritz crackers. Beyond the rice paddies, we come to our first village, Tabanan, home to the Pande clan. In Bali, all blacksmiths originate from this clan and the craft is handed down from generation to generation. Our guide introduces us to Wayan, a blacksmith who makes knives and agricultural tools with his wife. His home is a row of single rooms built in the 1950s. Some of the rooms are open platforms; others are shut behind intricately carved doors. Three generations live and work here, and they all come to watch us drink a young coconut in the shade of their open living room. In the workshop next door, Wayan and his wife hammer white-hot metal into tools. From Tabanan we scoot through the village of Pejaten, famous for its red clay ceramics. After another 7km we reach the village of Kerambitan. The area was once home to one of Bali&apos;s most important royal families \u2013 great patrons of art and culture who commissioned local craftsmen to kit out their palaces and temples. Our tour ends at Kerambitan palace, built in the 17th century. The eighth royal generation still lives here. We snoop around the peach plastered buildings. The walls are inlaid with dozens of painted plates and each pillar is swaddled in multicoloured fabric. We find miniature stone gods in sarongs, black and white portraits of kings and a pair of red and gold thrones within reach of a fridge full of Bintang beer. We are sorely tempted, but we get back on our wheels and pedal home to raid our own mini bars.     Mountain biking around Uma Ubud, Bali. Photograph: Martin Morrell    Ubud in central Bali is the island&apos;s second tourist destination (after the beach resort of Kuta). In the 1930s, it attracted European bohemians; now the city&apos;s sprawling &quot;art villages&quot; sell nasty teak carvings (think life-size, muscular unicorns) and stoneware. After two nights at Soori, we check into Uma Ubud, a boutique hotel on the outskirts of town surrounded by jungle-like gardens. Our colonial-style room is thatched and smells deliciously of damp straw, and the communal areas are furnished with huge pieces of Balinese furniture: beautiful antique wood carvings and two-metre deep sofas carved from teak. Uma is a 30-minute drive from Mount Batur, an active volcano that serves as an adventure playground for tourists. It, too, offers a range of guided tours and we agree for Anom, our guide, to lead us on a 40km freewheel from the summit. Before we begin, he decides we need a caffeine hit and takes us to an organic coffee farm in Kintamani, a crater-top town. &quot;Come and taste the civet coffee,&quot; he urges, ushering us through the coffee plantation to a makeshift kitchen. Civets are mongoose-like creatures that steal coffee cherries from the trees. The beans are partially digested before being pooped out whole, collected, washed and ground. The end result is a Balinese delicacy called kopi luwak: one of the world&apos;s most expensive coffees. &quot;It&apos;s, um, kind of sour \u2026&quot; I politely suggest. &quot;It tastes like shit,&quot; whispers Nicole. We&apos;re both fighting a creeping sense of nervous hilarity. On the drive up, Anom had told us that the ride down would be pretty fast \u2026 &quot;Ready for the big downhill?&quot; he shouts. With sour tongues and jangling nerves, we let go of the brakes. The fertile flanks of Mount Batur are intensely farmed. Orange and passionfruit groves separate leafy fields of potatoes and chillies. A truck of bouncing cabbages rolls by. The tarmac lanes are bustling. Women fry tempeh (fermented tofu) on the roadside and palm sugar rice cakes bake on the pavement in the morning sun. Men groom their cockerels in preparation for their next fight while school children in peach uniforms overtake us on mopeds. We see a procession of women and girls on their way to a Hindu ceremony dressed in jewel-coloured sarongs and sashes carrying multicoloured, handwoven baskets on their heads. &quot;I want one of them!&quot; Nicole hollers as we zip by. Towards the end, some school kids race out of the playground and line up on the roadside to give us a high five. It&apos;s the only point I take my hands off the brakes for the entire ride.     Uma Ubud     Saddle sore, we take the next day off and treat ourselves to a Balinese massage at the sprawling Como Shambhala Estate (cse.como.bz) on the outskirts of Ubud. The mother of all wellbeing retreats, this estate is built in a jungle clearing on the edge of a ravine overlooking the rapid Ayung river. We explore the spectacular gardens before being stretched and pummelled back into shape. Our final hotel, Alila Manggis, is on the east coast of the island. Compared with its glamorous sisters, Uluwatu and Soori, the accommodation is lacklustre and the surroundings less spectacular. That said, it offers great value for money and the choice of &quot;journeys&quot; sound just as promising. We sign up for our final outing \u2013 a journey to the Bali aga (ancient village) of Tenganan, an isolated community famous for its double ikat \u2013 a rare fabric which is produced by dyeing both the warp and weft threads, then painstakingly weaving them into symbolic motifs. We leave the bikes this time and trek to the roadless village on foot. The walk begins in Kastala and quickly rises through verdant rice terraces. (&quot;This is our Old Trafford,&quot; boasts our guide.) Mount Agung, Bali&apos;s highest mountain, dominates the skyline as we make our way along the edge of a mountain spring used by locals to irrigate the fields. The countryside is one giant tropical fruit bowl: red pineapples grow in the hedgerows and we walk in the shade of jackfruit, durian, snakeskin fruit and cashew nut trees. We edge across a precarious bamboo bridge and find, all on its own, a table-top stall of handwoven goods. I buy a selection of beautiful little rattan boxes for about 30,000 rupiah (\u00a32.10) each \u2013 perfect Christmas pressies. After another hour or so we reach the outer walls of Tenganan. We step through a narrow gateway, and it feels as though we&apos;re entering a new zone in the Crystal Maze. Sacrificial water buffalo drink from troughs in the central square and fluorescent cockerels in handmade cages \u2013 dyed green and orange by their owners \u2013 guard the gates. Economically separate from the rest of the island, Tenganan is a fiercely private community. We&apos;re told that a village official sweeps away the footprints of strangers at the end of each day. Our guide introduces us to a weaver with cloudy eyes who takes us into his workshop (the Indigo Art Shop) and drapes me in an incredible piece of double ikat. He explains that these fabrics were traditionally worn during ceremonies and rites of passage: for weddings, tooth filings (the Balinese file the teeth of adolescents to rid them of invisible forces of evil), or during a child&apos;s first haircut. He is only one of about 15 people in the village who still weave on small makeshift looms and his wares grace the homes of Prince William and Mick Jagger, so we&apos;re told. I deliberate for an hour, then he whips out a card reader and I leave \u00a3160 poorer with a unique piece of double ikat I will forever have to rescue from behind the back of the sofa. Outside, dusk has fallen and the villagers are preparing for a celebration at the temple. As we step through the gates of the village, I look back and see a group of men roasting spices over an open fire. Two suckling pigs have been caught, their legs tethered to sturdy stakes. They are preparing babi guling, a spicy pork Balinese delicacy served at ceremonies. The buffalo lurk nervously. In the gloom, I think I can make out the shape of a man sweeping the sand in the central courtyard \u2026"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/nov/27/new-court-rothschild-koolhaas-oma-review", "sentences": ["The rulers of the City permit themselves the incredible luxury, inconceivable in Singapore, Shenzhen or even Canary Wharf, of weighing and deliberating every tweak of its fabric."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-27T00:04:12Z", "title": "New Court \u2013 review", "tags": ["Rem Koolhaas", "Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "The City of London is, in its own special way, surprisingly fond of architecture. You might have thought that niceties of design would get in the way of its relentless contest with other financial centres to be the most fearsome money machine in the world, but no. The rulers of the City permit themselves the incredible luxury, inconceivable in Singapore, Shenzhen or even Canary Wharf, of weighing and deliberating every tweak of its fabric. There are the historic buildings, the monuments of Wren, Hawksmoor and Lutyens, that are reverentially coddled. There are also the monuments of the masters of our own time, as recognised by the biggest architecture award in the world, the Pritzker prize. There are works by no fewer than five winners of the prize (Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Jean Nouvel, James Stirling and Rem Koolhaas&apos;s practice OMA) within the Square Mile. A sixth, Renzo Piano&apos;s Shard, makes its presence felt from just outside its boundaries. Such concentrations are hard to find outside places such as Saadiyat Island, the instant cultural district under construction in Abu Dhabi, or the 1980s tea services designed for the Italian company Alessi, by the biggest stars of the time. The latest addition to the collection, OMA&apos;s whitish tower for the financial advisory group Rothschild, has ghosted its way on to the skyline with a surprising degree of discretion. Usually every sneeze of Rem Koolhaas and his team is the object of global fascination by architects and followers of architecture, but this not-small building has been sitting there for some time, its exterior more or less finished, without anyone paying much attention. Now the interior fit-out is also complete, bar a few details. The discretion is part of Rothschild&apos;s corporate personality. As a distinguished 200-year-old institution, it doesn&apos;t feel the need to shout. It doesn&apos;t put its name on the door, and while it hangs a coat of arms outside, reused from former buildings, this is not very communicative to non-students of heraldry. It is located in a lane of extraordinary narrowness a short distance from the Bank of England, a narrow strip of pitted tarmac that seems one remove from being a cart track. You are supposed just to know that it is there and if you don&apos;t, you are not someone who needs to know or whom it needs to know. You do, however, know that you are in the presence of something with a high degree of self-confidence. From the lane you rise through a steel colonnade to an ample podium of perfect emptiness, the main body of the building overhead, which then opens on to an also ample reception area. You are treated to the luxury of sheer space, precisely delineated with the oblong architecture. The floor is of travertine, also the ceiling, which creates a vertiginous blurring of up and down. Off to one side is an oak-shelved library that will house the Rothschild archive.     \u2018Sheer space\u2019: the reception area. Photograph: Philippe Ruault/OMA    Should you be allowed past the security barriers you can then rise through the building, past the gym and cafe, and floors of close-packed desks, to the top levels of meeting rooms, dining rooms and events suites. There is a quasi-Soviet collectivism about the way the place is organised; as in the 1920s Narkomfin housing project in Moscow, the space allotted to individuals is modest, but the shared spaces of exercise, eating and meeting are generous. In these spaces, an ever more magnificent panorama unfolds. In one direction St Paul&apos;s Cathedral sits in mighty repose, placed in the middle of a glass wall as if it were put there for the special benefit of Rothschild. In another there are the Gherkin and other towers of the City, which somehow look more impressive and serene than they do from ground level. These are celestial, Olympian spaces that convey the certainty that this \u2013 here, at this elevation, in this part of London \u2013 is where Rothschild belongs.     \u2018As if it were put there for the special benefit of Rothschild\u2019: the view of St Paul's Cathedral. Photograph: OMA    It is not all about sheer pomp and prestige. This is not OMA&apos;s way, and running through the building are touches of wit, irony and teasing. There is a play of small and big, which starts with the transition from lane to podium and continues with such things as extra-heavy or extra-light handrails. There are very thick walls (&quot;Like castles and palaces,&quot; say OMA) and very thin ones made of glass. There is also a play with the history of which Rothschild is so proud. In the meeting rooms are ancestral portraits, of well-mounted men riding to hounds and such like, and antique furniture. These are placed, with a touch of the eclecticism of a boutique hotel, alongside glass and aluminium, the latter embossed, in another moment of old/new overlay, with woodgrain patterns from the old oak panelling.     \u2018The interplay of oak, oil paint, silk and aluminium is where all the fun is to be had.\u2019 Photograph: OMA    In Richard Rogers&apos;s Lloyd&apos;s Building a Robert Adam interior, imported from the institution&apos;s earlier premises, was recreated. There, it is a touch embarrassing in relation to the high-techery around it. In Rothschild the interplay of oak, oil paint, silk and aluminium is where all the fun is to be had. It delivers the required message that the institution is both ancient and modern. More than that, it is shown to be cultured, sophisticated, self-aware and sufficiently self-assured to allow a little humour. Rothschild advises but doesn&apos;t lend, which sets it apart from the casino banks of ill-repute, and its architecture reminds you of this fact. OMA also likes to squeeze whatever public value there might be in a commission, even out of a discreet private bank. The colonnade along the lane can be used by anyone, in effect widening the street, and on the far side of the podium a view opens up to the churchyard of Wren&apos;s St Stephen Walbrook. It is clear that the podium is privately owned space, but the building still offers more than the many City blocks which rise sheer and opaque from the pavement. Next door, for example, one of Foster&apos;s least good works has been squelched on to the ground, an assertive, ribbed, over-inflated blob that is oblivious to its surroundings. OMA&apos;s building interacts with its neighbours, enriching itself and them in the process. The City&apos;s fondness for architecture has, in fact, its limits. Often it runs as far as licensing a big name to sculpt the external form of a block, but not to such architectural qualities as the play of volumes and scale, the interconnection of outside and in or the creation of three-dimensional settings for the lives that go on in and around a building. Rothschild does all these things, with skill and subtlety. The only shame is that some of the best bits are on the far side of the security barriers. Come the revolution, though, it will make a great collectivist housing scheme."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/nov/29/george-osborne-broadband-autumn-statement", "sentences": ["It&apos;s a step in the right direction to catch up with the capacity in other countries such as Korea, Singapore and Japan.&quot; The urban broadband funding is over and above some \u00a3830m already allocated in this parliament and the next for rural broadband."], "publicationDate": "2011-11-29T18:54:14Z", "title": "George Osborne announces \u00a3100m broadband boost in autumn statement", "tags": ["Broadband", "Internet", "Technology", "Autumn statement 2011", "Politics", "Economics", "Budget", "UK news", "George Osborne", "Wi-Fi", "Cardiff", "Edinburgh", "Economic policy"], "article": "The government has set aside \u00a3100m to create high speed internet links in 10 cities across Britain. Cardiff, Belfast, Edinburgh and London will receive support from the fund, chancellor George Osborne announced in his autumn statement, and a competition will decide which six other cities will join the list. The money will be spent on providing 80 to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) broadband and city-wide high speed mobile connections, most likely through Wi-Fi. Efforts will focus on areas where companies such as Virgin Media and BT would not have built high-speed links without subsidy. City councils will bid for a share of the money, identifying which areas are to be connected, with a particular focus on small to medium-sized enterprises and strategic employment zones to support economic growth. Announcing the fund, Osborne said: &quot;It means creating new superfast digital networks for companies across our country. These do not exist today. See what countries like China or Brazil are building, and you&apos;ll also see why we risk falling behind the rest of the world. &quot;Our great cities are at the heart of our regional economies. And we will help bring world leading, superfast broadband and Wi-Fi connections to 10 of them \u2013 including the capitals of all four nations.&quot; The &quot;super-connected cities&quot;, one of an array of infrastructure projects announced in the autumn statement, will see \u00a320m allocated in the year to April 2013, \u00a360m spent the following year and the final \u00a320m by April 2015. Companies bidding for a share of the pot will be expected to contribute matching funding. A BT spokesman said: &quot;This is a positive initiative that will help ensure our major cities have the best available super-fast broadband. BT is already upgrading large parts of these cities under its commercial roll out plan and these funds could help us go further.&quot; Naomi Climer, vice president at the Institution of Engineering and Technology, Europe&apos;s largest engineers&apos; body, also welcomed the money: &quot;This announcement is good news for improving UK business productivity and closing the digital divide. It&apos;s a step in the right direction to catch up with the capacity in other countries such as Korea, Singapore and Japan.&quot; The urban broadband funding is over and above some \u00a3830m already allocated in this parliament and the next for rural broadband. The government wants all 25m British homes, however remote, to have access to a minimum speed of 2Mbps by 2015. Some 90% of homes should be able to get over 24Mbps, enough for several computers to download video simultaneously on a single line. A further \u00a3150m was committed by Osborne at the Tory party conference in October to roll out mobile coverage to 99% of the UK, ensuring six million more people would be able to get a signal. Mobile coverage is currently at 95%, although in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, masts only reach 90% of locations. Critics said the money would have been better spent boosting rural broadband. &quot;\u00a3100m between 10 cities is about \u00a31.50 per person,&quot; said Andrew Ferguson, editor of news site ThinkBroadband. &quot;If the government had put the money in rural projects it would have boosted rural businesses. Broadband is already available in cities.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 1 December 2011. The original said 90% of homes should be able to get broadband speeds of up to 24Mbps by 2015.

It is a trait of hers, and one that became a hallmark in a career that has taken her to the highest levels of the diplomatic service, overseeing MI5 and MI6, and as a security minister in government. Looking back on this time in the highest echelons of Whitehall, she can speak a little more bluntly than perhaps she used to about the hurdles she faced as a woman making her way in what was \u2013 and to a certain extent remains \u2013 a man&apos;s world. &quot;We were second-class citizens, really,&quot; she says. &quot;There were quite a lot of things that women were considered unsuitable for.&quot; Neville-Jones is referring specifically to her early days in the Foreign Office and the rules, both institutional and otherwise, that were designed to make life difficult for women seeking a career as a diplomat. She can laugh about them now, but at the time \u2026 &quot;There was the bar on marriage. That lasted until the mid-1970s. The situation was that you had to resign if you got engaged, if you were a woman that is.&quot; She recalls that official uniforms, or rather the lack of them, was another divisive issue. &quot;Women diplomats didn&apos;t have them. This was said to raise serious problems in certain countries with monarchies because it was thought that women couldn&apos;t possibly go to formal ceremonies without one. The men had them, though they were not often worn, but not the women. &quot;There was some talk about creating an official evening dress with oak leaves. That came to nothing, luckily. It was a sign of the times, part of a forgotten world. Some heads of ministry wouldn&apos;t even have women on their staff.&quot; That era has passed, though Neville-Jones may be reliving some of these moments this week, when she appears as one of the main speakers at a conference starting tomorrow at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank in London. The two-day event is the first of its kind to bring together women from across the world who have forged careers in defence and security; sharing the platform will be an admiral from the US Navy, a brigadier from the Israeli Defence Force, and the secretary general of the Spanish Intelligence Agency. In all, more than 30 women will discuss the jobs they do, the difficulties they have had to overcome, and offer advice to others embarking on similar journeys. Neville-Jones may have come further than any of them during her 50-year career. A grammar-school girl from Leeds, she read history at Oxford University before deciding to test the thickness of the glass ceiling within the civil service. It was 1961, and it had been impenetrable. &quot;There were two women in my year out of a class of 20, but in other years there were none at all. So we were in a minority, there were very few of us around.&quot; For obvious reasons, it seems. The decade may have been swinging for some women, but the winds of change hadn&apos;t blown very far into Whitehall when Neville-Jones started. Was there sexism in the service at the time? &quot;I do think that, yes. I think that climbing the tree was harder. Women were examined and criticised for things that men were not criticised for. The women certainly believed that to make average progress, they had to be rather better than average. &quot;I think some women believed that they would not be able to overcome this. They underrated their potential, and if you do that, then the system will underrate you too.&quot; Some decisions appear to grate even now. &quot;I had been in Singapore for a period and wanted to know if I could learn Chinese. I got a very short note saying &apos;no&apos;. I was convinced this was because I was a woman. I think they thought there was no point putting in that investment, particularly with languages. The attitude was, &apos;We are not going to train women who are going to leave.&apos; And they would never think of putting a woman in the Middle East.&quot; A thick skin has been one of the secrets of her longevity, and it is something she believes all women have to develop if they are to challenge the status quo. &quot;I am sure that there were [incidents of sexism]. But I am not one to dwell on difficulties or be thrown by slights. I can recall swallowing hard sometimes. One thing I do remember is the way some men would stand in front of you, and be talking to each other about you, as if you weren&apos;t there.&quot; The Equal Opportunities Act in 1976, she says, &quot;changed the game&quot;, and she believes she was fortunate with the jobs she was appointed to. She also excelled in them. They included a senior post at the British embassy in Washington, and then a move to Brussels where she was Chef de Cabinet to the Budget Commissioner, Christopher Tugendhat. This was obviously a nightmare of a job; it was during the period when Mrs Thatcher was handbagging other European leaders, thumping tables and demanding her money back. Neville-Jones was caught in the middle \u2013 for five long years. &quot;That was quite hard to navigate,&quot; she says. &quot;We were constantly under pressure.&quot; Understatement may be her preferred way of describing events, but there are certain issues about which she is more robust. One is that she never used gender as a weapon to get her own way, nor did she turn alpha male to survive. &quot;I was certainly never conscious of &apos;playing the woman&apos;. I would not have approved of that. It is not a winning tactic. I operated in the world as I found it, and it was a man&apos;s world.&quot; That world increasingly included working with the armed forces, and then the intelligence services \u2013 she was chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee in 1993 and 1994. Dame Stella Rimington was head of MI5 at the time, the first woman to head the security service, and the two got on well. And she didn&apos;t find the generals as difficult as she might. &quot;The thing about the military,&quot; she says, &quot;is that they are always very courteous.&quot; Neville-Jones has remained friends with Rimington, though they never had a chance to share their experiences properly back then. She also knows Eliza Manningham-Buller, who became the second woman to run MI5. All three were pioneers in their own way, but Neville-Jones accepts that their success has, perhaps, masked the difficulties other women have had underneath them. She believes the latest generation of women entering Whitehall are &quot;pretty level pegging&quot; with the men, but in the intermediate generation some women are struggling to push through. &quot;It will happen. The process is under way but because of the nature of these things, it will not change overnight.&quot; Women, she says, have to learn some of the tricks that have given men such an advantage. &quot;We are not the greatest networkers, and particular networks begin at school. Women tend to break the network of friends they make, but it is a habit that men have learned. It is an approach to life that involves planning almost without thinking about it. And men sustain this. I came from a northern grammar school. I had a good education, but I didn&apos;t have a good network.&quot; Careers where there are formal systems of assessment also help women, she believes. That is why, for all the difficulties she encountered, Neville-Jones says the public sector is now a better bet than the private sector for the ambitious. &quot;When I first left university, I thought about going into the private sector. But I discovered when I went to interview that I could only have a career in the back office, or doing HR. The attitude was, &quot;My dear lady, you cannot possibly think about going on the board.&quot; &quot;I believe women profit from merit and performance assessments which exist in the public sector. But this culture is much less strong in the commercial world. I think there is a huge waste of talent in the private sector.&quot; Inevitably, there have been sacrifices along the way. Neville-Jones doesn&apos;t speak with rancour or bitterness about any of her experiences, but there is, I sense, just a hint of regret when she talks about her private life. She says she never made a conscious decision not to marry, it just happened that way. She admits there were circumstances in which she would have liked to have someone alongside her, if only to have helped out at the merry-go-round of drinks and dinner parties she hosted on her own. &quot;Some people say that I didn&apos;t make it easy on myself. There are prices one pays, but I was not going to give up something that I enjoyed doing. I suppose that official entertaining was harder without a partner to shoulder the burden. As a man, it would have been easier for me to get married. But I had demanding jobs. I undoubtedly made it difficult for myself.&quot; She adds: &quot;And I hope I have never held back other women. I hope I have not been guilty of that because I have always tried to protect them. I was aware of their situations. I know some women did manage to pull off the very difficult trick of having a successful career and a family. It can be done.&quot; Neville-Jones doesn&apos;t like to generalise, but she believes women have innate skills that make them good at the kind of intelligence jobs she has done well in. &quot;I do think that women are good at detail. The average woman is better than the average man in this respect, and detail is important in security \u2013 it is primordial. &quot;You cannot do it properly unless you are capable of recognising everything that is relevant. You have to get right down in there. &quot;Women are better at getting in among the weeds, maybe partly because women accept that weeds are part of life. Men try to get away from them.&quot; And her advice to women starting out? Learn to deal with the mess, work hard, and come up with the occasional big idea. &quot;Do what you want to do. Follow your instincts. Even if you have difficulties, don&apos;t accept second best. Ever.&quot; &apos;I denied my female traits&apos;: life in the US Navy in the 1970s Vice Admiral Carol Pottenger hesitates before telling a story about her rise through the US Navy. In 1977, she was one of the first women selected for sea duty. This involved joining the crew of the USS Yosemite for deployment in the Mediterranean. She had prepared for the reaction of the other sailors, but not of their families, some of whom took a dim view of the women&apos;s presence on board. That unhappiness became all too clear when the crew returned to port months later to see banners: &quot;Welcome Home Yosemite \u2013 Men.&quot; Pottenger has been pushing back the boundaries ever since, and is now one of the US Navy&apos;s senior officers, who has served in Iraq and won the distinguished service medal. Pottenger says the US Navy has come a long way since the days when women were only assigned to ships &quot;that were welded to port or in decay&quot;. She admits that during most of her early career, she &quot;was careful to ... deny my female traits&quot;. &quot;This was the way to prosper in a male-dominated organisation. You don&apos;t want to stand out, you don&apos;t want to be someone who brings tension to the mission. You want to adapt, to fit in smoothly.&quot; Now, she feels she can be more herself. &quot;Being a woman is part of who you are. I might have denied that early on, but now I have the confidence not to care whether this is an issue.&quot; Pottenger now mentors other women. &quot;It is really important for women to look up and see other women being successful. When I was in that position, all I wanted to do was blend in and be one of the guys.&quot; &quot;Service should be colour-blind, and gender-blind,&quot; she says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/dec/01/subtracting-calculators-adds-children-maths", "sentences": ["Gibb compared England to three high-performing regions and countries around the world: Massachusetts, Singapore and Hong Kong.", "In Singapore, which is ranked second for maths in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) league tables, almost no 10-year-olds use calculators in the classroom."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-01T15:13:32Z", "title": "Subtracting calculators adds to children's maths abilities, says minister", "tags": ["Primary schools", "Mathematics", "Numeracy", "Schools", "Education", "Students", "Politics", "Education policy", "UK news", "Curriculums"], "article": "Calculators may be restricted in primary schools until children have mastered basic arithmetic including knowing times tables by heart, a minister has said. The use of calculators will be looked at as part of a national curriculum review, after the schools minister, Nick Gibb, expressed concern that children&apos;s mental and written arithmetic was suffering because of reliance on the devices. Gibb said: &quot;Children can become too dependent on calculators if they use them at too young an age. They shouldn&apos;t be reaching for a gadget every time they need to do a simple sum. &quot;They need to master addition, subtraction, times tables and division, using quick, reliable written methods. This rigour provides the groundwork for the more difficult maths they will come across later in their education.&quot; In a parliamentary debate on Wednesday led by the Conservative MP Elizabeth Truss, she warned of the dangers of producing &quot;a satnav generation of students overly reliant on technology&quot;. The review is under way, and ministers are due to announce new programmes of study for English, maths, science and PE early next year. These will be introduced in schools next September. Students are encouraged to use calculators in the national curriculum, which has a section on &quot;calculator methods&quot; for children aged between eight and 11. The use of calculators is common in Year 5, when children are aged between nine and 11. A 2007 study found that only 2% of Year 5 pupils in England were banned from using calculators, compared with the international average of 54%. A recent Ofsted report on maths, which looked at 20 successful primary schools, found most only introduced calculators in the later stages of primary schooling, and then only for checking answers for calculations carried out without them. Gibb compared England to three high-performing regions and countries around the world: Massachusetts, Singapore and Hong Kong. In all three, curriculums state that calculators should not be used as a replacement for basic understanding and skills, the government said. Fourth and sixth grade state assessments in Massachusetts \u2013 equivalent to Years 5 and 7 in England \u2013 do not permit the use of a calculator. Massachusetts is the highest performing US state for maths. In Singapore, which is ranked second for maths in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) league tables, almost no 10-year-olds use calculators in the classroom. The UK is currently rated 28th for maths in the same league table. One in five 11-year-olds in England failed to reach the expected level in maths this year, according to provisional figures. Gibb added: &quot;You can&apos;t expect children to cope with complicated quadratic equations if they don&apos;t know their times tables by heart. &quot;Without a solid grounding in arithmetic and early maths in primary school, children go on to struggle with basic maths skills throughout their school careers. It also means they leave school without the knowledge they need to complete everyday tasks in their adult lives. &quot;The use of calculators in primary schools must be appropriate.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/01/india-china-move-to-protect-burmese-interests", "sentences": ["&quot;Burma will want to keep China on its side and ensure its interests are protected,&quot; Dr Ian Storey of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore wrote in an essay this week."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-01T17:39:23Z", "title": "India and China move to protect interests in Burma from US influence", "tags": ["China", "India", "World news", "US news", "Foreign policy", "Myanmar"], "article": "Officials in India and China have moved to downplay fears that reforms in Burma will spark a fierce competition for influence between the two emerging Asian powers. Delhi has long favoured engagement with the Burmese regime and opposed sanctions imposed by the US and the European Union. &quot;We are not in the business of hoorahs because we have been vindicated. You don&apos;t do that in the world of diplomacy,&quot; said one senior Indian official. &quot;But we always said dialogue was best and sanctions were counterproductive.&quot; The official said that Delhi had warned Washington and London that &quot;a vacuum in [Burma] has unintended consequences&quot; \u2013 a reference to the growth in Chinese influence. Burma has borders with both regional rivals. Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary and ambassador to Burma, said the Burmese regime&apos;s growing concern about its heavy dependence on China was one reason for the recent changes. &quot;China has exploited the isolation [of the Burmese regime] to such an extent they are now keen for a rapprochement with India or others out of a desire to diversify their foreign relations,&quot; Saran said. Strategists in Delhi worry that Chinese influence in Burma is a link in a chain passing through Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal \u2013 which effectively encircles India. Chinese investment in vast new facilities in the Bangladeshi port of Chittagong has particularly riled India, as have infrastructure projects in the north. The surprise halt ordered by the Burmese government to the construction of a vast Chinese funded-and-built dam was therefore welcomed. &quot;There&apos;s no reason why some kind of modus vivendi can&apos;t be found, despite possible tensions,&quot; a second Indian official told the Guardian. Gareth Price, an expert in Burma at Chatham House, the London-based thinktank, said the west needed to be careful not to antagonise China, which remains the country with the greatest leverage over Burma. While US officials have denied that Clinton&apos;s trip to Burma is primarily about countering Chinese influence there and in the region, many in Beijing disagree. &quot;The more conservative camp sees this as part of a wider US effort to contain China and as part of a continuum of recent US engagement and policy pronouncements in the region,&quot; said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, north-east Asia project director for the International Crisis Group.  But she stressed there were widely diverging views. US engagement with the Burmese regime has potential benefits for China, which is worried about Burma&apos;s stability, particularly given the ethnic conflicts along their long border. Chinese businesses could also benefit from an end to sanctions, increased aid and a normalised business environment. China is Burma&apos;s biggest economic partner, with trade hitting $4.4bn (\u00a33bn) last year, and its largest foreign investor. It values the country&apos;s natural resources and access to the Indian Ocean.  The popular Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times warned in an editorial this week that Beijing would not accept &quot;seeing its interests stamped on&quot; but said it had no resistance to Burma improving relations with the west. Beijing&apos;s anxieties about the visit in large part reflect President Obama&apos;s recent trip to the region: his message that the US was &quot;here to stay&quot; as a Pacific power; the announcement that the US would station troops in Australia; the discussion of a new trade alliance that would probably exclude China; and the decision to join regional powers in pressing China over South China Sea territorial disputes. &quot;Some people feel very nervous \u2026 [and] consider what&apos;s happening as containment. But I don&apos;t think the mainstream of foreign policy sees these developments in that way,&quot; said Professor Jin Canrong, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University. Experts also stressed that while Burma may be broadening its ties, it will hardly turn its back on Beijing. &quot;Burma will want to keep China on its side and ensure its interests are protected,&quot; Dr Ian Storey of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore wrote in an essay this week."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/01/mike-roberts-obituary", "sentences": ["His father was in the merchant navy, and some of\u00a0Mike&apos;s formative years were spent in\u00a0Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-01T18:07:23Z", "title": "Mike Roberts obituary", "tags": ["Stage", "Culture", "English National Opera (ENO)"], "article": "Our friend Mike Roberts (Big Mike), who has died aged 66 of organ failure as\u00a0a result of osteomyelitis, was one of\u00a0the theatre&apos;s more colourful sons.

But at this point, she is still a little girl.&quot; The standard master-class drill, in fact, except that Von Otter, energetically attired in a powder blue tracksuit, is imparting her knowledge not in a conservatory or concert hall, but in a luxury car showroom in Beijing adorned with both high-end Audis and huge images of Gustav Mahler. &quot;I did know beforehand that the venue was called the Audi Forum,&quot; she later laughs. &quot;But when I came in I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes. I didn&apos;t think we would actually be in the middle of all these fantastically macho cars. It felt like being in a James Bond movie. I&apos;m not used to the smell of so much leather and rubber when singing lieder.&quot; Von Otter was in China as one of the star turns of the 14th Beijing Music festival and in many ways her master class typified the ethos of the whole event. Serious music-making from a stellar cast delivered within the very modern Chinese context of glittering new venues, enthusiastic young audiences and an unapologetic embrace of business. In China along with Von Otter were such luminaries as Riccardo Muti, Charles Dutoit, Christoph Eschenbach, Daniel Harding and Matthias Goerne. They played with some of the best Chinese and other Asian orchestras to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Mahler&apos;s death. &quot;It is plainly a moment of political and economic change in the wider world,&quot; observed Muti, who conducted the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra in the festival&apos;s closing gala. &quot;And to see that reflected so clearly in music is fascinating. During my career the way people think about music has completely changed. When I started out there was the idea that Germans were the best at German music and Italians were the only ones who could really play Verdi and so on. It was never really true. Toscanini, for example, was a great Wagner conductor. Now the idea seems preposterous.&quot; Muti says the stereotype that China&apos;s rapid musical advances had given them &quot;technique, while we, the west, still have the soul, is now very outdated. They are certainly running rather than walking with regard to technique, but they have demonstrated that their classical musicians also have soul. Of course I can see the commercial and political motivations for making links with other cultures, but when you do that via Beethoven, Verdi, Vivaldi and Mahler, people communicate in a way that will go beyond the commercial and political. The sense of universality we so value in the great tradition of our music is just that. It belongs to them as much as it belongs to us.&quot; But even for a music culture developing as fast as China&apos;s, isn&apos;t such a high-profile series of more than 20 Mahler concerts \u2013 as well as associated talks, education-outreach sessions and master classes \u2013 quite a leap? Not on the evidence of this festival, say local musicians and visitors alike. In fact Mahler is a peculiarly apt choice for such blanket exposure. It is almost exactly 100 years to the day that the first complete performance of his vast &quot;symphony&quot; for orchestra and voices, Das Lied von der Erde (&quot;The Song of the Earth&quot;), was heard in Munich. He set the 8th-century Tang dynasty poet Li Bai \u2013 who was later adapted by Ezra Pound and many other writers in the west \u2013 and the work is musically full of Chinese motifs. The Chinese-American conductor Lan Shui was brought up in Beijing in the 70s and 80s and is now chief conductor of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, as well as the principal conductor of the Copenhagen Philharmonic. He says that at the time Mahler was composing, the links between east and west were comparatively open, certainly more so than in many of the periods before and after. &quot;As a student it took me much longer to connect with the music of, say, Bach than Mahler. Perhaps in practical terms because there was not too much church music here when I grew up, but also because the emotions felt more distant. Mahler&apos;s musical language seemed to contain universal emotions and much of his work, not just Das Lied von der Erde, appeared similar to Chinese poetry in that it seemed to have both a free form and a strong structure.&quot; Von Otter was noticeably aware of Mahler&apos;s impact at her recital. &quot;The concert culture is a little different here\u00a0from the west and I detected more\u00a0noise and movement in the audience than is usual. But when I got to those six Mahler songs it suddenly became extremely still. Either they knew the music well, or the music was speaking to them in a special way.&quot; The history of classical music in China has been long and sometimes tortuous. There was a professional orchestra in Shanghai as far back as 1879, albeit one packed with European players performing to an expat audience. Classical music survived the 1949 revolution, came under Soviet influence and ebbed and flowed according to the state of relations between the two countries, before being banned and musicians persecuted during the 1966-69 cultural revolution. Its slow re-emergence began after Madame Mao allowed some of her personal favourites \u2013 Dvorak&apos;s New World Symphony, Beethoven&apos;s Pastoral \u2013 to be played. Eugene Ormandy&apos;s Philadelphia Orchestra toured the country in 1973, and education reforms in the late 70s opened the discipline up again, although well into the 1980s students were still hand-copying scores not on the official curriculum, including those of Mahler. Now tens of millions of Chinese children are learning piano and violin, and the music is heavily supported at home by local and national government and promoted abroad through organisations such as the British-based KT Wong Foundation, whose efforts have resulted in a Beijing production of Handel&apos;s Semele and will see a young Chinese-cast version of Britten&apos;s Noye&apos;s Fludde in Belfast as part of next year&apos;s Olympic celebrations. At the elite level of international music-making, Chinese players, conductors and composers have become part of the furniture, or in the case of pianist Lang Lang, a global phenomenon. A key figure behind the recent expansion of Chinese classical music is the conductor, and close associate of Lang Lang, Long Yu, who, remarkably, is music director of three of China&apos;s most prestigious orchestras and was a co-founder of both the Beijing Music festival and the China Philharmonic Orchestra. Since it was founded in 2000 the CPO has toured extensively throughout China and played the first official concert in a church since the revolution \u2013 a performance of Mozart&apos;s Requiem to mark the composer&apos;s 250th anniversary \u2013 as well as playing in New York&apos;s Central Park and for the Pope at the Vatican: &quot;He was very surprised when I spoke to him in German,&quot; chuckles the Berlin-educated Yu. &quot;I am part of the first generation to have grown up through the cultural revolution, then to have gone abroad to study and work, and then to have returned home. We have a different view of the world at a time when China is opening up to the world. Classical music is not so much a western import for us, more an obvious way to communicate.&quot; Yu is well connected both musically and politically and his take on the political, cultural and personal role music could play in the new China is an almost uniquely informed one. It offers a tiny philosophical straw in the wind, as he explains that historically in China what was good for society was regarded as also being good for the individual. But now, maybe what is good for the individual can also be good for society. &quot;Of course economics, business and money are important. But we also need spiritual nourishment. For the past 30 years we have paid a lot of attention to the development of the economy. All over Asia, people are very good at business, but how we balance life and society is increasingly questioned. For me the music is like water and people are vases of all different shapes. The music is the same, but people&apos;s individual responses release their own imagination and creativity. And surely more imaginative and creative people are more useful within society and happier within themselves. So my job is to provide them with the very clearest water. What shape they then make of it is entirely up to them.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/04/simon-westin-falklands-war-veteran", "sentences": ["Between the ages of three and four I lived in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-04T00:04:00Z", "title": "This Much I Know: Simon Weston", "tags": ["Falkland Islands", "Children and teenagers", "Books"], "article": "There are people in their 30s who don&apos;t know anything about the Falklands.

The nurses on the ward said, &quot;If he doesn&apos;t make you broody, nothing will.&quot; He&apos;s got black hair and the most piercing blue eyes you&apos;ve ever seen. He&apos;s going to break some hearts. I am a very happy person. I think that&apos;s something people may not assume because of what has happened to me. Laughing isn&apos;t just cathartic, it&apos;s essential. I love daftness and nonsense, which is perhaps why writing children&apos;s books came so naturally to me. I&apos;d like to play the harmonica. I was very musical when I was younger, and I played the cornet. With my injuries, my top lip isn&apos;t much use at all so I daren&apos;t pick it up again to try now. But with the harmonica you can make it up as you go along. I would love to change my injuries and what happened to me. Of course I\u00a0would.

Having distance works wonders for a relationship. My wife loves to go out a\u00a0lot, and I let her go. As long as she&apos;s safe I don&apos;t care. There&apos;s only one thing I&apos;ve done in my life that I am ashamed of. When I was 14 I got into a stolen car. I was taken to court and had to pay a \u00a330 fine. I regret it because I\u00a0embarrassed by mother. I always remember kindness. A while ago, a young lad who was begging on the streets gave me a pound when I walked by him.

If it were a football team it would be Leeds United. Our glory days are behind us - or at best, we&apos;re a snoozing giant. That&apos;s the message the coalition has drawn from international comparisons which show us &quot;plummeting down&quot; league tables for the reading, maths and science abilities of teenagers. Our blistering debut was the OECD survey of 2000, when we ranked 8th for maths, 7th for literacy and 4th for science in the thinktank&apos;s Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa). England&apos;s difficult second album was Pisa 2006, when we fell to 24th for maths, 17th for reading and 14th for science. And when the results of the 2009 survey came in, we risked parting ways with our record label. England&apos;s 15-year-olds ranked 28th for maths, 25th for reading and 16th for science. This narrative of national decline provides a powerful rationale for the coalition&apos;s school reforms. In a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank in June, education secretary Michael Gove said: &quot;As a country, only about half our pupils manage at least a &apos;C&apos; in both English and maths GCSE - in Singapore, it&apos;s four in five. In the last decade, we have plummeted down the international league tables: from 4th to 16th place in science; from 7th to 25th place in literacy; and from 8th to 28th in maths.... This stagnation leaves children poorly prepared for the world we face.&quot; The argument that England&apos;s school performance declined over Labour&apos;s term in office has now been attacked in a new study from the Institute of Education, part of the University of London. Dr John Jerrim of the IoE points out that while Pisa indicates a slide over time another major study, TIMSS (Trends in International Maths and Science Study) shows that the maths scores of English 13 and 14-year-olds rose compared with other countries over the past decade. Why, Dr Jerrim asks, should two respected international surveys produce such contrasting findings? He identifies a range of possible reasons. The Pisa surveys are carried out at three yearly intervals - so far, there have been studies in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2009. In England, Wales and Scotland, the two most recent surveys - the ones in 2009 and 2006 - were pulled forward to the winter term rather than spring and summer to avoid clashing with GCSE exam preparation. That means pupils who took the survey in earlier years had about &quot;five months more schooling,&quot; Dr Jerrim says. Findings could also be skewed by the fact that children with weaker maths abilities refused to take part in earlier surveys, artificially boosting England&apos;s position, the IoE says. Meanwhile, the number of countries covered by PISA rose from 43 in 2000 to 65 in 2009. &quot;It is easier to come tenth in a league of 43 than it is in a league of 65,&quot; Dr Jerrim says. Some of this has been pointed out before, and the OECD has itself warned against making comparisons over time with data from the UK. The UK was excluded from international comparison in the 2003 survey, because the OECD judged that their sampling standard had not been met - failing to meet the thinktank&apos;s 85% threshold for responses from schools. For the UK, it is only possible to compare 2006 and 2009 data, the OECD says [pdf]. Schleicher, the thinktank&apos;s deputy director of education, said in an email to me: &quot;The UK&apos;s PISA data for 2000 and 2003 were not sufficiently robust to establish trend lines that meet OECD standards. However, it is hard to derive any interpretation of these data that wouldn&apos;t imply a decline in the relative standing of the UK internationally.&quot; The UK&apos;s performance in Pisa is not poor - but shows plenty of room for improvement, Schleicher says. The government continues to use a comparison that shows a steep decline. Contacted about the IoE study, a spokesman said: &quot;The evidence from OECD&apos;s Pisa study is clear that this country has fallen from eighth to 27th in maths, seventh to 25th in reading and fourth to 16th in science... Other international studies such as PIRLs and TIMSS show we&apos;re not doing well enough. &quot; The government&apos;s reforms are based on &quot;wide-ranging domestic and international evidence and practice,&quot; the spokesman added. The Full Fact blog has noted that the OECD&apos;s guidance on comparison has been ignored by the Department for Education, as well as some parts of the media. But the IoE goes a bit further than that and argues that England&apos;s changing position can&apos;t be used to justify politicians&apos; calls for reform. There is: &quot;...no hard evidence of any decline in comparative performance over time,&quot; the IoE&apos;s release states. That assertion seems questionable to me. After all, even the comparison between 2006 and 2009 shows a modest decline in England&apos;s performance. And if you ignore comparisons over time, and simply look at how England does in relation to other countries now - we&apos;re in the middle of the bunch.

I scarcely blinked when boarding a giant Airbus A380 in Singapore recently, yet was totally sideswiped when I first saw a Boeing 747 in the early 1970s. It seemed like a city on wings. Then, a few weeks ago, I watched a BBC programme showing how the wing of an Airbus A380 is built. And it struck me that the process is very close to that of designing an integrated reporting approach for a company or economy. Like an aircraft wing, which provides such critical things as lift, control over the rate of climb or descent, and storage for fuel, a company&apos;s bottom line has huge implications for the ways in which the business is valued, managed and steered. As with bottom lines, the early years of flight saw experiments with single wings (remember Otto Lilienthal teetering on the edge, about to jump) giving way to biplanes (think of the Wright Brother&apos;s Flyer) and then increasingly complex formulations, where three (as in Baron von Richthofen&apos;s deadly and highly manoeuvrable red triplane), four and even more wings were stacked on top of one another. But ultimately designers opted for the simplicity and strength of a single wing, often built as an integral part of the fuselage, and the same will ultimately be true of bottom lines. The proliferation of different accounting and reporting formats, including double, triple and even quadruple bottom lines, has increasingly been challenged by those who talk in terms of &quot;blended value&quot;, like Jed Emerson, or &quot;shared value&quot;, like Michael Porter. Organisations that grew out of triple-bottom-line experiments, like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes, continue to analyse multiple dimensions of value creation (and destruction), while companies like Puma continue to experiment with much deeper explorations of individual areas of performance, as in the German sportswear company&apos;s environmental profit and loss (EP&amp;L) calculations. But such experiments are increasingly being developed with an eye on how they might be wrapped into new integrated reporting formats. When Puma recently tested its EP&amp;L work with stakeholders, for example, Bob Eccles, author of the book One Report and an active participant in the International Integrated Reporting Committee (IIRC), was a speaker. The IIRC&apos;s objective is to get the heavyweights into the game, including the stock exchanges, financial rule-makers and big accounting firms. Meanwhile the GRI&apos;s proposed new G4 guidelines (due for launch in 2013) are also being evolved with reporting integration trends very much in mind. The drivers for all of this, the IIRC argues, include globalisation, growing concern about recent financial and governance crises, heightened expectations around corporate transparency and accountability, and the prospects for population growth, resource scarcity and environmental challenges, including climate change. The ultimate aim is to pull together the different strands of reporting \u2013 financial, management commentary, governance and remuneration, and sustainability reporting \u2013 into &quot;a coherent whole that explains an organisation&apos;s ability to create and sustain value.&quot; More specifically, there is an expectation that proper integration will help reduce the burden on reporting organisations, while improving the understanding of investors and other stakeholders. &quot;The connections need to be made clear,&quot; the IIRC explains, &quot;and the clutter needs to be removed.&quot; All well and good, but sometime&apos;s one person&apos;s clutter is another&apos;s critical context. And that leads me to encourage readers of Guardian Sustainable Business to seize the day and comment on the critically important discussion paper launched by the IIRC, where the period for comment ends on 14 December. Comments can be submitted online via the IIRC website, or emailed. So what will be different when integrated reporting is the new norm? Previously isolated streams of data, information and intelligence will be brought together in new combinations; the narrow focus on financial capital will expand to embrace multiple forms of capital (eg manufactured, human, intellectual, social and natural); financial reporting&apos;s focus on the past will be complemented by forward-looking reporting; long and complex reporting will be replaced by concise and material (ie relevant to the company&apos;s future prospects) analysis; and much paper-based reporting will be replaced by online platforms enabled by the internet and technologies like XBRL. The IIRC paper gives various examples of current initiatives in integrated reporting, spotlighting companies like AkzoNobel, AngloAmerican, BHP Billiton and Sasol, with an ongoing pilot scheme aiming to considerably expand the number of experiments. In terms of next steps, a so-called &quot;exposure draft&quot; of the International Integrated Reporting Framework is slated for 2012, with the stated aim being to &quot;explore with national, regional and global policymakers, regulators and standard-setters opportunities for harmonising reporting requirements within and across jurisdictions, and help to develop a compatible regulatory landscape.&quot; When the world convened in Rio de Janeiro for 1992&apos;s UN Earth Summit, corporate reporting was only just coming on to the agenda \u2013 with the publication in 1990 of the first voluntary reports by Monsanto and Norsk Hydro giving the field a sharp nudge forward. As we head towards the 20th anniversary event, again in Rio, there seem to be three big tasks in the reporting agenda. First, we must ensure that a much higher proportion of companies report on their performance in relation to the environmental, social and governance agenda. Second, we need to evolve new integrated reporting frameworks that inform top management, investor and stakeholder thinking and decision-making in timely, accessible and effective ways. And, third \u2013 just as a superjumbo depends on immense flows of information when achieving a safe, fuel-efficient takeoff or landing \u2013 investors, business-to-business players and government policymakers must learn how to make better use of the information gathered. Superjumbo wings are massively intelligent systems, continuously monitoring their environments and rebalancing weight and flight dynamics. That&apos;s what properly integrated reporting promises to help us do, as we move to embrace new forms of capitalism that value multiple capitals and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 continuously balance the short-termism of many financial market agents against wider stakeholder needs. Most of those who saw them experimenting on the sand dunes at Kitty Hawk thought the Wright Brothers dreamers or even lunatics; we should be careful of making the same mistake with the GRI, IIRC and their fellow travellers.

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the authority charged with providing civic services to the city, hopes to introduce a system to levy a 150-rupee (\u00a32) fee on cars, motorbikes and even rickshaws entering central areas during the day. &quot;This will help reduce congestion \u2026 [and] encourage people to use public transport,&quot; the head of the authority, KS Mehra, told local press. Lorries will be made to pay a higher fee. A congestion charge has existed in Singapore since the 1970s and various systems have been successfully introduced in London, Rome, Milan and several Scandinavian cities in recent years. Authorities in Beijing recently said they were considering congestion charging, and other Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Nangjing are reported to be interested. But no city of the size and complexity of Delhi has attempted to introduce such a scheme. Few doubt the necessity of radical measures in India&apos;s capital. Construction of a metro system and measures to boost the use of buses has barely slowed the increase in traffic in recent years. A decade of rapid economic growth and a broad distaste for public transport among the expanding middle class means there are now 6.8m vehicles on Delhi&apos;s roads, at least twice as many as five years ago. Gridlock is common and, during winter, heavy smog leads to accidents, respiratory diseases and mass flight cancellations. Other Indian cities such as Mumbai, the country&apos;s commercial capital, are considering similar measures. The Delhi scheme would first be implemented in areas around the historical old centre. But experts are sceptical. &quot;If you look at what is already in place to reduce congestion, such as toll gates around Delhi, they make the problem worse, not better,&quot; said Rumi Aijaz, of the city&apos;s Centre for Policy Research thinktank. &quot;Even if the proposal is accepted politically, the necessary infrastructure simply isn&apos;t there.&quot; The tolls on key roads linking Delhi with satellite cities cause huge traffic jams. Occasionally they are the focus of protests that can turn violent. Aijaz said a broader strategy to tackle traffic in the city was necessary. &quot;There has to be a range of measures to manage the issue. Nothing done in isolation will work,&quot; he said. Experts point out that one serious problem is a lack of proper licensing or law enforcement in Delhi. Driving permits can be bought illegally and laws that should ensure safe driving and a smoother traffic flow are routinely ignored. Fines for traffic violations can usually be avoided by paying a small bribe to police officers. There are few cameras, although a Facebook page asking irate commuters to post their own photographs of offenders has met with a massive response. Senior police officers said charging would be a positive step \u2013 if technology to avoid queuing was introduced. But even if the practical obstacles can be overcome, the support of the infamously fractious &quot;delhiwalla&quot; \u2013 inhabitants of the city \u2013 will be hard to win. Some shopkeepers welcomed the move, but their customers were less enthusiastic. &quot;People are already reeling under taxes \u2026 we don&apos;t need any more,&quot; Mamta Choudhary, a teacher who regularly shops in one of the areas designated for the new scheme, told the Times of India newspaper. Ram Thakur, a 45-year-old manager who spends up to two hours a day in traffic driving from the satellite city of Faridabad to his office, said no amount of charging would make him give up the small car that he bought a year ago. &quot;I started on a bicycle and I&apos;ve taken buses for 20 years. Now I am a car owner and life is very much nicer. I am not giving it up to go back on buses or bikes,&quot; he told the Guardian. Dr Robin Hickman, an expert in urban transport at London University, said that implementing a congestion charge in Delhi would be &quot;extremely difficult. &quot;It would probably be a better option to increase tax on fuel in the city and invest the funds generated in public transport,&quot; Hickman, who has worked in Delhi, said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/congestion-charges-around-the-world", "sentences": ["Singapore Dating back to 1975, the original congestion charge scheme started as a cumbersome, manual system of colour-coded paper licences that motorists had to buy and display at police checkpoints to enter a restricted zone.", "The government has long stressed that the purpose is purely traffic management, with entry to the zone typically costing one or two Singapore dollars (50p-\u00a31) \u2013 nominal for a country where high road taxes and certificates make car ownership very expensive."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-08T15:35:21Z", "title": "Congestion charges around the world", "tags": ["Road transport", "World news", "Congestion charging"], "article": "Singapore Dating back to 1975, the original congestion charge scheme started as a cumbersome, manual system of colour-coded paper licences that motorists had to buy and display at police checkpoints to enter a restricted zone.

The government has long stressed that the purpose is purely traffic management, with entry to the zone typically costing one or two Singapore dollars (50p-\u00a31) \u2013 nominal for a country where high road taxes and certificates make car ownership very expensive. Oslo With a national population half that of London, Norway seems an unlikely place for congestion charging. But its two largest cities, Oslo and Bergen, introduced tolls for ring roads in the 1980s, explicitly as a money-raising exercise. Public opposition gave way to grudging acceptance, with the development of an automated system and low operating costs and a political commitment that revenue was entirely devoted to roadbuilding and improvements. London Ken Livingstone&apos;s brainchild, the congestion charge went live in February 2003. Bus use went up significantly, and road safety and journey times improved. Public opinion, which had been marginally against introducing the charge, quickly swung round substantially in favour. However, the 2007 western extension into plusher residential districts proved unpopular and was scrapped after Boris Johnson took over as mayor. Stockholm Trials in the Swedish capital in 2006 had dramatic results, cutting traffic by 20-30%, and in 2007 a referendum approved making the scheme permanent. Drivers pay a modest 10-20 krona (95p-\u00a31.90) depending on times of day to enter or leave the capital on weekdays, and evenings and weekends are free. A similar electronic cordon is now planned for Gothenburg from 2013. US New York&apos;s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, was keen to implement a scheme along the lines of London&apos;s. In 2007 his proposal for a weekday charge for vehicles south of 86th Street in Manhattan garnered surprisingly positive press and public backing. The city council voted in favour, but plans were blocked by the state assembly and eventually dropped. Although toll roads are widespread, no city congestion charge yet exists in the US, although San Francisco looks the most likely with pilots pencilled in for 2015."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/dec/09/android-games-downloads", "sentences": ["South Korea tops the list, followed by Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Singapore, Sweden, Israel, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-09T07:47:18Z", "title": "Games take largest share of Android's first 10bn downloads", "tags": ["Apps", "Android", "Google", "Eric Schmidt", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Technology", "Games", "Culture"], "article": "Android games have notched up more than 2.5bn downloads since the launch of Google&apos;s Android Market store, taking a 25.6% share of the store&apos;s first 10bn downloads.

Or even a scarf. It&apos;s a\u00a0bit like how no one invites chefs to supper, I guess. The only clothing-related gift I get are gloves: people feel on safe ground with gloves. Don&apos;t worry. I am not trying to spin the fashion editor&apos;s life as a sob story. My husband is a dab hand with a Net-a-porter link, and my sister is so uncannily good at choosing clothes for me that the most likely hitch is that I have already bought the same item. But my point is: clothes make brilliant presents for the fashionable people in your life. Don&apos;t be scared. The fashion industry does itself a\u00a0disservice by cramming gift guides with \u00a31,000 handbags, with a few \u00a399 key fobs scattered casually around as &quot;stocking fillers&quot;. Er, hello? As a result, there is a general impression that fashion gifts are only for those with more money than sense. Which is daft, when the high-street fashion stores are full of gifts with wow factor and real-world price tags. There is an element of risk \u2013 but if you avoid marked-down clothes that can&apos;t be returned, there is always a happy ending to be had. Example: this Zara suit would make me very happy. Not only is it just the thing for New Year&apos;s Eve, but finding this under the tree would mean that someone else had done the hard part of high-street shopping, which is getting on the shop floor with sharpened elbows. In December. That&apos;s love, that is. Imogen Fox, deputy fashion editor     Imogen wears hat, \u00a369, by\u00a0J\u00a0\u00adGordon from Fenwick.

Photograph: Paul Farrell for the Guardian    I&apos;m not going to lie: I am extremely fussy when it come to\u00a0clothes. But that&apos;s no surprise considering what I do for a living. As\u00a0a result, only one friend \u2013 who I can confidently say has the best taste in Britain \u2013 buys me anything fashion-related at Christmas. Everyone else retreats towards DVD box sets and vouchers. To be honest, I quite like it that way: if I want a particular item of clothing, chances are I&apos;ve bought it, or at least crossed my fingers it&apos;ll go on sale. But this can be a bit joyless and not very Christmassy, and it rules out loads of potentially lovely gifts. So here&apos;s what I think you should do if you know a fashion fusspot: choose weekend clothes. My tinpot theory is that stuff you wear to do relaxing things in is stuff you are likely to be less uptight about. Jumpers are the Christmas clich\u00e9 that are actually in fashion this year, and I&apos;m struggling to think of\u00a0a\u00a0woman I know who wouldn&apos;t love to unwrap a navy cable knit. Padded gilets are this year&apos;s woolly\u00a0scarf: the shape is what it is,\u00a0but you\u00a0get to\u00a0inject some choice\u00a0when it comes to the colour (even if you end up with black). But my best tip for hard-to-please\u00a0women who like fashion gifts\u00a0is an overnight bag. It&apos;s low-risk\u00a0but not\u00a0bland. It says, &quot;I\u00a0think\u00a0you&apos;re glamorous and jet\u00a0set&quot;, but there&apos;s no sizing issues\u00a0and it&apos;s not nearly so personal\u00a0as a handbag. And this gold\u00a0one is undeniably joyful and Christmassy, is it not?

I like things that feel like indulgences \u2013 coffee-table art books, fancy candles, a nice bottle of port. Or something a bit practical. So why am I wearing expensive polka dots? Because they&apos;re fun. And fashion is allowed to be fun, especially at Christmas. I&apos;m not really expecting anyone to buy me these dotty clothes, but if you&apos;re looking to get the man in your life something with a little fashion va-va-voom, you can&apos;t go wrong with a polka. If you think a shirt is too much of a statement, buy a standard stocking filler \u2013 socks, tie or a scarf \u2013 but with dots on. Buying trousers for a loved one is high-risk, but if you are going for it this year, there are two styles to consider: a modern tweedy number or a slim pair of cords in a deep burgundy. These Chelsea boots are admittedly quite a posh present, but I think can be justified because of their quality and long-lasting sartorial appeal. And anyway, there&apos;s no reason you can&apos;t club together with friends or family on the splashier gifts, is there? Priscilla Kwateng, stylist     Priscilla wears polo neck, \u00a345, by Banana Republic Skirt, \u00a359.99, by H&M. Bag, \u00a3259, by Raoul, from\u00a0\u00adFenwick.    Photograph: Paul Farrell for the Guardian    Present-giving should never be about the stuff that people buy regularly \u2013 what&apos;s the point? Presents should be things lusted over in mags, envied on someone else at a party, that kind of thing. This skirt is real leather, feels gorgeous and is most definitely not office wear \u2013 which only makes it that bit more special at Christmas. And it gets an extra gold star for being in keeping with the current pencil skirt trend and for the Carine Roitfeld-esque side split. Singapore-based label Raoul, who\u00a0make the bag I am holding, is great in terms of price \u2013 it&apos;s relatively affordable for an upmarket handbag. Plus, it&apos;s still a fairly small, fashion-insider label, so should you splash out on one as a gift, you&apos;ll also score points for seeming in-the-know. Also I&apos;ve done the research, and no bag label quite does the minimalist 70s vibe like Raoul does. And as for\u00a0polo necks, well, they get plenty of bad press, but with this much leg\u00a0flesh on show, surely it&apos;s indecent to reveal so much as one&apos;s collarbone as well? \u2022 Styling: Aradia Crockett.

David Cameron&apos;s long night in Brussels is also threatening to rearrange British politics for years and transform the political dynamics of the Commons. Thatcher&apos;s accusation that France and Germany were trying to create a &quot;fortress Europe&quot; marked the beginning of the end of her time in office. On Monday Cameron will face the Commons to explain his actions after an extraordinary few days during which, according to critics and supporters alike, he tore up the diplomatic rule book, disdained negotiations and deal-making, and encouraged the rest of the EU to make their own arrangements without the UK. In the words of one Tory MP, Cameron told Europe: &quot;Enough is enough.&quot; However, those closest to the prime minister understandably fear that this may well come to be regarded as a moment as ominous for Cameron as it proved for Thatcher. During the prime minister&apos;s statement to the House, Cameron will present his actions, a spokesman insisted, not in a triumphalist spirit but as the &quot;best that could be done&quot;. As the Observer reveals, the fury felt by the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, is real. For the future of the coalition, it is also, surely, highly dangerous. Sources close to Clegg have told of his disbelief that Cameron did not negotiate, &quot;play for more time&quot; in his so-called negotiations with Germany and France, but had arrogantly presented Britain&apos;s position as a &quot;take it or leave it ultimatum&quot;. Liberal Democrat chairman Tim Farron goes further: &quot;Britain is in the mess it is in now and we got the appalling offer from France and Germany on Thursday as a consequence of the Tories being infantile about Europe and self-indulgent.&quot; Referring to the Eurosceptics who believe Cameron has done a great deal for the country, he told the Observer that &quot;the image in my mind is the same position as Thelma and Louise&quot;, adding: &quot;A wonderful glorious image of them escaping from the authorities, this marvellous happy ending together. Actually, no, you die in a ball of flames 30 seconds later. Obviously lots of people are going to be irritated by the claims that this is a victory for the Tory right. The reality is that it is a massive defeat for Britain. &quot;Liberal Democrats work to look to be the mature, stable heart of the coalition ensuring that Britain does not, in an infantile rash way, do something which is completely against its own interests.&quot; The language being used by senior Lib Dems suggests that Cameron is gravely mistaken if he believes there can be a quick reversion to coalition business as usual. Many Lib Dems are as passionate about &quot;Europe&quot; as the most hardline Tory eurosceptic. And then there is Labour. On Monday, Ed Miliband is likely to make hay with the divided coalition benches. He may mention the resignation speech by Thatcher&apos;s foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe when Howe complained that he had, all too often before a big summit, been like an opening batsmen who found his bat &quot;had been broken before the game by the team captain&quot;. Labour MPs are desperately hoping this could be a moment for the Labour leader to shine. Denis Macshane, Europhile MP for Rotherham, and former Labour Europe minister, said: &quot;This is going to be one of the turning moments of British political history. A bit like the Corn Law reforms of the early 19th century, or the Irish question at the beginning of the 20th century. &quot;In the end, we are a small, medium- ranked power, but we have managed to have a great deal of influence because no meeting takes place about what happens in the world without Britain being present. I think the prime minister has thrown that object of British policy away and Labour needs to point this out.&quot; A report from left wing thinktank Progress, compiled following interviews with former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, Tony Blair&apos;s chief of staff Jonathan Powell, current shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy and a cast of other Labour experts in the field shows the way ahead, it claims. Published on Monday, it says Labour must illustrate that the current anti-European sentiment across the political divide is fundamentally against Britain&apos;s long-term national interests. &quot;Assuming we will be able to act bilaterally in an increasingly multipolar world is folly,&quot; it adds. Labour, it says, must be the counterfoil to Cameron&apos;s apparent desire to turn Britain into the &quot;Singapore of Europe&quot;. It claims that under Miliband, the party has not spoken out as the &quot;internationalist&quot; party as much as it could and should. Now, it says, is the time to do so. &quot;The lack of immediate clear response to these issues from the Labour party was seen, at best, to be politically expedient in the short-term and, at worst, as cowardly and politically lazy from a progressive pro-European party,&quot; authors Sam Hardy and James Denselow write. They add: &quot;Labour must fill the void left by the current government and grapple with the foreign policy agenda. This is not because it will necessarily be a key electoral issue, but because it is natural ground for Labour and a policy area for which the party has the time and space to lead the debate, project confidence and imagination in policy formulation, and ultimately prove its ability to govern.&quot; Time, perhaps even this week, will tell if Labour is ready to rise to the challenge should the coalition fall."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/11/dunaden-hong-kong-vase", "sentences": ["Sacred Kingdom, one of the most celebrated Hong Kong speedballs of recent years but nowadays a shadow of his former self, could finish only 10th of the 14 runners, two places ahead of the great Singapore sprinter Rocket Man."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-11T14:33:24Z", "title": "Dunaden follows Melbourne Cup win with victory in the Hong Kong Vase", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Melbourne Cup"], "article": "A great global festival like the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong International Races is conducted in the international language of racing. But there are still intriguing regional variations to that language, as Australian jockey Craig Williams demonstrated when describing how last month&apos;s Melbourne Cup winner Dunaden had added to his 2011 haul with an emphatic victory in the Hong Kong Vase. &quot;When the other runners came around him I asked him to lift for me,&quot; said Williams, who had missed the winning ride in the Melbourne Cup through suspension, &quot;and when he saw the bunny in front he really laid his ears back and lengthened like the horse that he is.&quot; The bunny in question was not specifically identified but you get the drift \u2013 and the sight of that bunny so galvanised Dunaden that he was able to hold off local veteran Thumbs Up by three quarters of a length. Dunaden epitomises the international dimension of modern Flat racing \u2013 trained in France by Mikel Delzangles, owned by Qatari prince Sheikh Fahad Al Thani, ridden by an Australian \u2013 but his was the only overseas success at this annual bonanza of international racing. The Ed Dunlop-trained Red Cadeaux, who had gone so close when beaten a pixel by Dunaden in the Melbourne Cup, finished fast to dead-heat for third with French challenger Silver Pond, earning from jockey Ryan Moore the rather more succinct compliment that &quot;he ran a blinder&quot;. Sadly, the same could not be said of the other British-trained Vase runners Jakkalberry and Redwood, who finished seventh and 11th. Godolphin stalwart Campanologist, who was representing the UAE, came fifth. First blood to the away team \u2013 26 horses from eight countries taking on 25 residents \u2013 but the rest of the card belonged to Hong Kong. It came as no great surprise that the locals dominated the Sprint, and Hong Kong-based runners filled the first four places, with victory going to the Brett Prebble-ridden Lucky Nine. Sacred Kingdom, one of the most celebrated Hong Kong speedballs of recent years but nowadays a shadow of his former self, could finish only 10th of the 14 runners, two places ahead of the great Singapore sprinter Rocket Man. What had appeared a strong Anglo-Irish challenge never got a look in. Bated Breath finished eighth, Sole Power ninth and Society Rock 13th of the 14 runners. The British contingent for the meeting came closest when Cityscape \u2013 trained like Bated Breath by Roger Charlton \u2013 failed by just a neck to catch locally-trained Able One in the Mile. Jockey Steve Drowne described the effort as Cityscape&apos;s best race but the horse could not compensate for a wide draw. Xtension, trained in Britain by Clive Cox before being sold to Hong Kong, was a further neck back in third, with the Richard Hannon-trained Dubawi Gold a fast-finishing fourth. Able One&apos;s victory struck a remarkable blow for the veterans, as the horse, whose career has been blighted by stress-fractures, is nine-years-old \u2013 very long in the tooth for a Group 1 winner on the Flat \u2013 and winning jockey Jeff Lloyd is no spring chicken himself at 50. Able One had been favourite for this race last year before being withdrawn at the start on veterinary grounds but his form had deteriorated since then and he started at 66-1 \u2013 an astounding price for those who had kept the faith. By contrast, local star Ambitious Dragon seemed to have been backed for the Hong Kong Cup by pretty well everybody in the 67,000-strong crowd and the tumult when he made his move in the straight threatened to send the roof of Sha Tin&apos;s towering stands spinning out into the South China Sea. Then the communal roar swiftly dissolved into groans of disappointment as Ambitious Dragon&apos;s effort petered out, and 21-year-old jockey Matthew Chadwick brought the grey California Memory, trained at the track by Tony Cruz, through for a decisive win from Irian, who had finished runner-up to Snow Fairy in last year&apos;s Cup. German-trained Zazou did best of the Europeans by finishing third with such notables as Champion Stakes winner Cirrus Des Aigles and Byword well behind. So a 3-1 victory to Hong Kong, the first time that the home team has &quot;won&quot; since 2002 and further evidence of the former colony&apos;s now indisputable place at racing&apos;s top table.

The results of last week&apos;s parliamentary elections were a surprise, not just because of his party&apos;s low level of popularity but because they were allowed to happen. In a totally controlled system his United Russia party would have won easily. But Putin has erected a facade of nominally democratic institutions and they went out of control. While there was clearly a great deal of cheating, United Russia won less than half the votes, with the electorate expressing massive alienation from the ruling elite. How that alienation plays out in the presidential election in March is the next major issue. The protests in scores of cities on Saturday are being treated less violently by the police and more respectfully by state-controlled TV than in the past. Will Putin continue this softer approach as the March poll approaches? If he fails to get half the votes there will be a second round in which victory for him is not guaranteed, although no doubt his ballot-stuffers will work harder than last week. The central lesson of last week&apos;s result is that Russia&apos;s post-Yeltsin era has ended. After the collapse in living standards and the wholesale privatisation of the 1990s under Boris Yeltsin and the political turbulence of his constant battles with the Duma, Putin emasculated the parliament and returned the country to stability. Surging oil and gas prices allowed enough cash to trickle down to wages and pensions to create an illusion of creeping prosperity. Russia now faces annual budget deficits like almost every other major economy. Findings by the respected pollsters VTsIOM in November showed 53% citing low living standards as their top priority, with inflation, unemployment and poor healthcare running close behind. Nearly 40% complained of bureaucracy and corruption. After last week&apos;s election Putin and his colleagues not only have to deliver economic growth and better social services, they have to bring in the rule of law for citizens as well as for businesses. This is not quite the same as democracy and human rights, which the VTsIOM poll showed to be important for only 9% of respondents. There is much facile talk that Russia needs a middle class to anchor democracy, even though there is no automatic linkage between the two. China and Singapore are prominent examples of countries with authoritarian systems and a large middle class. Russia&apos;s trouble is the absence of law, with its clear and enforceable rules. The communist system collapsed in part because many of its previous defenders travelled abroad and wanted the consumer goods and the modernity as well as the intellectual freedom they saw. Russia&apos;s post-Soviet generation travels and studies abroad in much vaster numbers. They feel shamed by their rulers&apos; criminality. No wonder so many young Russians choose to emigrate when they see how justice is administered selectively, the rich pay no tax and officials charge fees for services that should be normal civic entitlements. Vladimir Pozner, a well-known TV presenter, was right to say recently that many Russians have &quot;a feeling of being totally unprotected&quot;. Igor Yurgens, head of the Institute of Contemporary Development (and a former supporter of president Dmitry Medvedev) complained that the Kremlin &quot;underestimated the gap between a society that has become sophisticated and advanced and the feudal relations that operate at the upper echelons of state power&quot;. It will take a large and sustained shift in elite attitudes for the problem to be rectified. But if Putin has any sense, last week&apos;s majority vote against his party will have got the ball rolling."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/dec/11/lewis-hamilton-f1-mclaren", "sentences": ["By the time F1 reached Singapore, the 14th race of the year, he had won only twice, had not been on the podium since the fifth race of the season in Spain and was being strongly outperformed by his team-mate, Jenson Button."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-11T23:01:09Z", "title": "The year the wheels and everything else came off for Lewis Hamilton", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Formula One 2011", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Anthony Hamilton steered his son Lewis as father, manager and mentor from karting through to a Formula One debut in 2007, when he was beaten to the championship by one point, and on into the following year, when he took the title by the same margin. His role was not that of the traditional manager and it even caused some disquiet in the paddock \u2013 a forceful presence never far from his son&apos;s side. Just one year later on the eve of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the first race of 2010, the driver announced his father would no longer manage him and that he would take on the role himself. The Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has described the decision and the driver&apos;s subsequent use of a management company as &quot;a disaster&quot;. Perhaps it should not have been such a surprise that this hugely successful young man wished to be more in control of his destiny. He noted tellingly, after the split, that while growing up: &quot;School felt like an escape. It was my time to mess about and have a kid&apos;s life \u2013 to be\u00a0normal.&quot; That season, the absence of a close professional and personal relationship seemed to have little ill-effect. He was in the fight for the championship at the final race in Abu Dhabi, where Sebastian Vettel claimed the win and the title. This year could not have been more different. From the start, an off-the-pace McLaren did not augur well but speed was to prove the least of Hamilton&apos;s problems. By the second meeting in Malaysia he had received his first drive-through penalty. There would be four more in a year during which he would be investigated by the stewards 14 times. Despite the win in China that followed, he was in trouble again at Monaco, clashing with Felipe Massa for the first time in a season during which the pair seemed unable to avoid one another on track, coming together on six occasions. That he found himself regularly competing with Massa rather than at the front of the field must have been exasperating but when he was given two drive-throughs at Monaco his frustration was given voice. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m black. That&apos;s what Ali G says,&quot; he said in a flippant remark for which he later apologised. More importantly, it was also clear that he felt he was being singled out: &quot;It&apos;s an absolute frickin&apos; joke. I&apos;ve been to see the stewards five times out of six this season,&quot; he said, as questions started to be asked about how well he was coping without his father. Hamilton signed with Simon Fuller&apos;s XIX Entertainment management company in March, a decision initially welcomed by Anthony. But Fuller&apos;s organisation played the more traditional behind-the-scenes role and besides the clashes, retirements and bad luck, he simply was not achieving the results on the track. Again frustration and clear dissatisfaction were the result when, before the British Grand Prix, with McLaren way off the pace, he complained volubly about the amount of sponsor-related work he was expected to do, and then in Canada where he arranged a private meeting with the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner. By the time F1 reached Singapore, the 14th race of the year, he had won only twice, had not been on the podium since the fifth race of the season in Spain and was being strongly outperformed by his team-mate, Jenson Button. Under the floodlights there was further contact with Massa, which earned another drive\u2011through, after which his father, back in the paddock managing Paul di\u00a0Resta, questioned Fuller&apos;s role. &quot;His management need to do more,&quot; he urged. At the Japanese Grand Prix, Hamilton dismissed as &quot;rubbish&quot; suggestions that he would benefit from having someone to talk to. &quot;If I wanted to speak to anyone I would give my missus a call and speak to her,&quot; he said. But things were falling apart off the track too. Visibly so in Korea. The joyously celebrated mid-season win in Germany had been a flamboyant victory and he drove brilliantly in Yeongam to take pole and fight off Mark Webber to hold second place in the race, but his reaction was resolutely stern. While insisting he was happy, his demeanour suggested otherwise and he commented tersely : &quot;I&apos;ve had the worst year, if you expect me to be all happy-doolally after a race like that you&apos;re not going to hear it.&quot; Soon afterwards he admitted he had split from his girlfriend of four years, Nicole Scherzinger. An already tough season had been further complicated as he coped with another part of normal life, although, interestingly, he did admit: &quot;I&apos;ve my family who are helping, so I feel pretty good&quot;. How many of this season&apos;s trials and tribulations can be attributed to management is debatable. Certainly a faster car would have made have a big difference but what Ecclestone described as &quot;an uphill year&quot; closed with a final win in Abu Dhabi before, by this season&apos;s standards, the relatively serene exit of a gearbox problem and reconciliation with Massa in Brazil, from where he contemplated: &quot;In future I will look back on this year and smile and say: &apos;I needed that.&apos; I&apos;ve grown up a lot this year and I want to take it into next year.&apos;&quot; Which may be a big one \u2013 it is the final year of his contract with McLaren and a new deal has yet to be signed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/12/bmi-takeover-ba-virgin-rivalry", "sentences": ["The carrier founded by Sir Richard Branson, who co-owns the business with Singapore Airlines, controls just 3% of the slots at Heathrow."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-12T16:15:35Z", "title": "British Airways rivalry with Virgin resumes over bmi airline sale", "tags": ["British Airways", "Virgin Atlantic", "Mergers and acquisitions", "International Airlines Group", "Airline industry", "Heathrow", "Travel & leisure", "Willie Walsh", "Richard Branson", "Business", "Travel"], "article": "British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have resumed their bitter, decades-old rivalry in a suitors&apos; duel over the airline bmi. Bmi&apos;s owner, the German national carrier Lufthansa, confirmed that takeover talks were underway with Virgin Atlantic as well as at BA&apos;s parent, International Airlines Group. &quot;We can confirm that we are also in talks with Virgin Atlantic,&quot; said Lufthansa, which hopes to make a final decision on the auction winner by the end of March. IAG had emerged as the frontrunner in November when it confirmed that it had reached &quot;an agreement in principle&quot; to acquire bmi, which would take its share of slots at Heathrow from 45% to 53%. That brought immediate warnings from BA&apos;s arch-competitor in the UK-to-US market, Virgin Atlantic, which said a takeover could be bad for consumers by allowing its rival to raise fares on routes to and from Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic is now hoping to capitalise on those concerns with its bid. It is offering a deal that would expect less scrutiny from officials at the European commission, the authority responsible for competition concerns within the European Union, and therefore be signed off more quickly. The carrier founded by Sir Richard Branson, who co-owns the business with Singapore Airlines, controls just 3% of the slots at Heathrow. The airline said today : &quot;We have signed a terms [of agreement] sheet. We have long said that we remain interested in bmi and that we remain in talks with Lufthansa.&quot; Both bidders are now conducting due diligence, amid reports that Virgin Atlantic has bid \u00a350m for the loss-making carrier, which reported an operating loss of \u20ac154m (\u00a3131m) for the first nine months of the year. Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the news was &quot;straightforwardly adverse&quot; for IAG, which was created this year by the merger of BA and Spain&apos;s Iberia. &quot;The probability of them winning bmi looks lower today and if they do win it, it seems likely it will be for a higher price than they previously might have thought,&quot; said Lobbenberg. BA has reportedly bid \u00a3100m for bmi and analysts believe it might have to raise its price further in order to dissuade Lufthansa from choosing the swifter option of a Virgin Atlantic deal. One legal expert said Virgin Atlantic appeared to hold a regulatory advantage owing to its much smaller share of the Heathrow slots market, even in combination with bmi. Julianne O&apos;Leary, head of competition at the law firm Stephenson Harwood, said: &quot;From a competition perspective, the Virgin Atlantic deal does indeed appear to raise fewer issues.&quot; It is also understood that Etihad, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier, has dropped its interest, leaving just the two parties in the race. An IAG spokeswoman said: &quot;IAG and Lufthansa continue to negotiate about the sale of bmi. Lufthansa has kept us appraised of other parties involved in the process.&quot; Competition over the lucrative transatlantic market has been at the heart of a series of spats between BA and Virgin Atlantic, most recently over the formation of an alliance between BA and American Airlines that allows both carriers to co-operate over fares and scheduling \u2013 anathema under conventional competition rules. IAG&apos;s boss, Willie Walsh, said this year that he would be interested in acquiring Virgin Atlantic for its slots, in an apparent dig at the airline&apos;s founder. &quot;If it is someone from within the industry, then I don&apos;t see that they&apos;ll want to retain the Virgin brand, particularly a brand that is so intrinsically linked to a personality.&quot; Walsh was speaking after Virgin Atlantic underwent a strategic review that has yet to yield a transformative sale, takeover or merger."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/13/najib-malaysia-anwar-ibrahim-sodomy", "sentences": ["The example of recent political upheavals in neighbouring Thailand and Singapore also played a part."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-13T17:10:40Z", "title": "Najib risks Malaysia's reputation in his treatment of Anwar Ibrahim | Simon Tisdall", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Anwar Ibrahim"], "article": "The portents do not look good for Malaysia&apos;s opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, whose trial on highly dubious sodomy charges draws to a close this week. If Anwar is found guilty \u2013 and the trial judge seems to have made up his mind already \u2013 he will not be the only or even the most important victim of an egregious, politically suspect injustice. Malaysia&apos;s democratic reputation will have been critically wounded, and for that outrage, Malaysians will have their prime minister, Najib Razak, to thank. The plodding Najib&apos;s overriding objective is winning the general election expected next year, possibly within a few months. The son of Malaysia&apos;s second prime minister, the nephew of its third, president of the dominant United Malays National Organisation (Umno), and a former defence minister, Najib was born to power and is accustomed to wielding it. As the charismatic leader of the opposition coalition, Anwar represents the biggest challenge to his continuing ascendancy. It hardly seems coincidental that the sodomy charges were levelled at Anwar shortly after the opposition inflicted unprecedented defeats on Umno and its allies in the 2008 elections. Anwar&apos;s main campaign plank \u2013 combating the official, institutionalised discrimination that favours ethnic Malays over the country&apos;s large ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities \u2013 threatened the post-colonial order that has kept Umno and its National Front coalition on top since 1957. In a court appearance earlier this year, Anwar, 64, a married father of six, denied accusations he had had sexual relations with a former male aide. Homosexuality is punishable by law in Malaysia by caning and up to 20 years in jail. The allegations were &quot;a vile and desperate attempt at character assassination&quot; and a &quot;blatant and vicious lie&quot; spread by his political enemies, he said. &quot;This entire process is nothing but a conspiracy by Najib Razak to send me into political oblivion by attempting once again to put me behind bars.&quot; Najib flatly rejects the idea of a political vendetta. But the recycling of sodomy accusations \u2013 Anwar was jailed on a similar charge in 1998 and detained until the conviction was quashed in 2004 \u2013 suggests a lack of originality characteristic of the prime minister. The case turns on the testimony of the alleged victim and DNA evidence produced by the prosecution. Defence lawyers suggested this week that Anwar&apos;s accuser was a &quot;compulsive and consummate liar&quot; who may have been put up to it. Yet the trial judge has already declared the prosecution&apos;s evidence &quot;reliable&quot; and credible&quot;, leading Anwar to claim he is being denied a fair trial. Najib gives every appearance of preparing for snap polls on the assumption that Anwar will be out of the way and the opposition decapitated. He told Umno&apos;s annual congress to prepare for battle because &quot;the time is near&quot; and urged delegates to work harder, for example by using social media, to attract a &quot;new generation of Malaysians who are more critical and have rising expectations of the government&quot;. The party must adapt or face &quot;tragedy&quot;, he warned. To Najib&apos;s evident alarm, that tragedy almost occurred in July when tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Kuala Lumpur. The highly unusual public display of discontent was spurred by a range of factors: spending cuts, official corruption and cronyism, a defective electoral system, curbs on public assembly and debate, and state-imposed censorship considered draconian even by regional standards. The example of recent political upheavals in neighbouring Thailand and Singapore also played a part. In response, thousands were beaten and detained by police. Now Najib is taking no chances as his lieutenants warn that Anwar is fomenting an Arab spring-style uprising \u2013 a so-called &quot;hibiscus revolution&quot;. Having more or less reneged on shaky, post-July promises of civil rights reform, Najib is now pushing through remodelled restrictions in the form of the Peaceful Assembly act. The act effectively makes peaceful assembly impossible by restricting it to undefined &quot;designated places&quot;. No gatherings are permitted within 50 meters of prohibited places including hospitals, schools or places of worship. The police can dictate the date, time and place. Najib&apos;s idea of engaging the &quot;new generation&quot; of young Malaysians is to ban anyone under the age of 21 from organising a protest. Opposition parties, lawyers and activist groups have condemned the new law, as has Amnesty International. But Khairy Jamaluddin, Umno&apos;s youth-wing leader, articulated Najib&apos;s paranoia last month when he accused Anwar&apos;s coalition of &quot;trying hard to manufacture panic and disorder&quot; by promoting street rallies instead of elections. &quot;The opposition often quotes social movements in the Middle East to instigate people to take part in street revolutions and in the process manufacture a Malaysian version of the Arab spring,&quot; Khairy said. Najib&apos;s authoritarian tendencies, blatant political scaremongering, and the judicial travesty that is Anwar&apos;s trial all suggest Malaysia&apos;s western allies, including Britain and the US, should take a closer look at their friend. Malaysia is valued as a trading partner, counterproliferation collaborator, and noncombatant member of the Afghanistan coalition. But the government&apos;s human rights record and democratic practices merit closer scrutiny. In a visit last year, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton extracted a promise that Anwar would receive a fair trial. &quot;The US believes it is important for all aspects of the case to be conducted fairly and transparently and in a way that increases confidence in the rule of law in Malaysia,&quot; she said. In a recent speech, Clinton urged all states to end discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. As Anwar&apos;s ordeal approaches an ugly climax, it seems increasingly unlikely that these benchmarks will be met. The next question is: what will Malaysians and their friends do about it? \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 14 December 2011.

O&apos;Neill has refused to give up power despite the court order and the recognition of Somare&apos;s cabinet by the governor general, Sir Michael Ogio. O&apos;Neill&apos;s MPs have continued to pass legislation recognising him as leader. The battle escalated when MPs backing O&apos;Neill stormed the governor general&apos;s gates a day after the supreme court ruling that Somare&apos;s removal and O&apos;Neill&apos;s election by parliament in August was unconstitutional. &quot;We are unarmed and we&apos;re the legitimate government,&quot; the Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted the MPs as telling police. Somare said on Wednesday that his cabinet had been sworn in by Ogio, who represents PNG&apos;s head of state, Queen Elizabeth II. Somare insisted he did not need to be sworn in himself because the supreme court had already reinstated him as prime minister. &quot;It is regretful that all of government was put on hold but this situation has been diffused by the swearing-in today of my cabinet,&quot; Somare said. The crisis continued on Wednesday, with MPs loyal to O&apos;Neill passing a motion ordering Ogio to swear in O&apos;Neill as prime minister. O&apos;Neill could not be reached for comment but on Tuesday he said he had met with Ogio briefly after the march to the official residence in the capital, Port Moresby. The supreme court&apos;s 3-2 decision on Monday that ruled O&apos;Neill&apos;s election unconstitutional came after O&apos;Neill&apos;s government passed a series of retroactive laws legalising its decision to dump Somare from office while he was in Singapore recovering from a heart condition. One of Somare&apos;s first acts when the supreme court ordered his return to power was to reinstate the former police commissioner Fred Yakasa and oust O&apos;Neill&apos;s appointee, Tom Kulunga. Both police chiefs were present at the governor general&apos;s home and held discussions with MPs loyal to O&apos;Neill. Somare has based himself at the Ela Beach Hotel, where he has set up a cabinet made up mostly of ministers from his previous government. Somare had been in Singapore for five months between late March and 6 September, when he returned to parliament after three heart operations.

We should hope that the answer is a resounding no. Think of the Swiss economy and the thing that will come to mind for most people will be banking and finance. Cameron&apos;s recent defence of the City might imply that he thinks of the UK economy in similar terms. But if he does, then his logic is wrong for four reasons. First, Switzerland has built its banking business on the basis of being a tax haven. It is impossible to know for sure how much money is illicitly located in Switzerland, but a past chairman of the Swiss Private Bankers&apos; Association has admitted it may be as high as 30%. This is unsurprising. Switzerland deliberately created banking secrecy in 1934 to assist those evading tax in their home jurisdictions. Whether or not this was acceptable in 1934 does not matter: it is wholly unacceptable now. To make the UK into even more of a tax haven than it already is would only increase our isolation from Europe, as it would effectively be a declaration of economic warfare on the already tax-starved economies of the EU. The fightback would be serious, strenuous and quite possibly effective, which makes it all the more interesting that Jonathan Faull, the UK&apos;s most senior official in Brussels, has suggested the UK&apos;s new position is to be the Channel Islands of Europe, knowingly referring to the fact that they have for too long based their economies on such activity. Second, Switzerland&apos;s other finance activities \u2013 of which reinsurance and head-office location services are the major part \u2013 have also been based on very low corporate taxes and a logic that few jobs should be located in a place where there is little space to accommodate people. In contrast, the UK badly needs high corporate tax revenues from businesses capable of generating large numbers of jobs, as employees alone are currently unable to fund the social services they require \u2013 hence the need for a serious tax contribution from their employers. The needs of the UK and Switzerland are also very different are in a third regard. The Swiss industrial economy, as that of a landlocked state, is based on small trade volume with very high added value. In contrast, the UK has been and remains a bulk-trading nation, adding relatively little added value to goods in transit. If, by alienating our strongest trading partners, we threaten that reality then favouring the City, as Cameron has done, puts at risk our already weakened industrial base, potentially making him the biggest threat to UK manufacturing since Margaret Thatcher. But all these concerns should pale into insignificance when one further fact is appreciated. Switzerland&apos;s hot money and the best of their real businesses are currently heading en masse for Singapore. The cash is pouring out for two reasons. First, the US has broken Swiss secrecy, and second, the EU and its member states are lining up to do the same. As for real business activity, Singapore and the east Asia are simply cheaper. In that case, the reality is that the Swiss business model may itself already be bust, and only a fool would copy it. \u2022 Richard Murphy is an adviser to the Tax Justice Network and director of Tax Research LLP Anthony Pickles: Switzerland has flourished in its self-enforced isolation      Following last week&apos;s EU summit in Brussels, many have suggested that the UK is now cut off from Europe, left on its own as Europe unites together, against it. Rather like Switzerland \u2013 much like Switzerland, in fact. But how isolated is Switzerland really? The Swiss have stayed outside the EU since its creation, preferring to use the European Free Trade Agreement and over 160 bilateral agreements with the EU instead. The reasons for Swiss independence from the EU are complex, although similar to the motives behind British hostility, namely historical independence, a fear of diminished sovereignty and a view that they know best when it comes to running their own affairs. Like Britain, Switzerland has a financial sector which makes up close to 10% of its GDP. In the worst year of the economic downturn, 2008, the Swiss continued to grow at a staggering 3.1%, while regulating their banks firmly. In recent weeks, Swiss government bonds fell so low that creditors had to pay the Swiss government to lend to them. These are hardly figures of a nation struggling with isolation. To demonstrate further, the Swiss are consistently listed in the top three richest countries in the world, and exports twice as much per head to EU countries as the UK does. Yet as good as these figures are, many claim that success in this &quot;isolation&quot; wouldn&apos;t be possible for the UK: we&apos;re told we are &quot;too big&quot;.

The National theatre largely misfired for me: A Woman Killed with Kindness, Cherry Orchard, 13, The Kitchen, Frankenstein and Greenland were all largely disappointing.

At the Royal Opera, the three most memorable performances were Madama Butterfly with Kristine Opolais in the title role and her husband Andris Nelsons in the pit; Werther with Sophie Koch and Rolando Villaz\u00f3n doing his best (still short of what Jonas Kaufmann can do); and the recent revival of Faust, with Vittorio Grigolo, Ren\u00e9 Pape, Angela Gheorghiu and Dmitri Hvorostovsky.  digit The release by the BFI on DVD and Blu-Ray of Barney Platts-Mills&apos;s 1971 film Private Road, starring Bruce Robinson (who later wrote Withnail and I).

I think the major problem with this absurdly hyped show is that, apart from the two versions of the Virgin of the Rocks and the unfinished St Jerome, the other six &quot;Leonardo&quot; paintings on display are either too unattractively gauche, stiff and mannered to be considered good or significant. Or they&apos;re too implausibly naturalistic to be an autograph work (La Belle Ferroni\u00e8re is too lifelike to be by Leonardo). Or just too\u00a0plain weird and damaged to take seriously (step forward, the newly discovered Salvator Mundi). Thank you, Adrian Searle, for having the integrity to give your honest opinion about this insanely promoted but hugely disappointing show.  andglove The High Country, an album by Portland band Richmond Fontaine, demands your attention from first song to last.

I got mugged the week before it\u00a0was released and actually found watching it quite cathartic. I was rooting for the little shits by the end. That&apos;s good screenwriting.  JimTheFish A really disappointing year for British TV, which has been on a downward slide. Doctor Who was probably still the best thing domestically. The Crimson Petal and the White and The Hour were underwhelming misfires; The Shadow Line was about the only really promising new kid on the block. The basic problem is that there&apos;s just not enough TV drama being produced. We need more one-offs, more Plays for Today to allow TV to find new voices and take more chances. Everything seems to be market-researched and focus-grouped into mediocrity.

It&apos;s also one of the few films I&apos;ve seen at the cinema where people were either (vociferously) walking out in disgust or staying behind just to boo.

The precise anniversary of the Queen&apos;s coronation is 2 June [see footnote], so it will combine with Olympics fever in a sort of ad for British retro-patriotism and obliviousness to, or enthusiasm for, very expensive parties for the benefit of other people with more money. Details are already available, exciting newspapers and disgusting republicans. There will be a magnificent flotilla on the Thames, much harassment (I am guessing) of protesters, and an enormous royal tour, starring the headliners (HM and spouse; William Wales and photogenic middle-class bride) and bit players (Andrew, Edward and the cousins). Out they will roll, in a Hanoverian-themed rip-off of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, &quot;reinventing the monarchy for a new generation&quot;. The Romanovs and the Habsburgs may be dust, but the\u00a0Windsors are still in the palace that looks like Selfridges. My only joy comes from wondering how, exactly, they carved up the planet \u2013 that, and who will look after the dogs. The tour&apos;s itinerary proves, amusingly, how this most hierarchical of families has a strict hierarchy within itself. So the Queen, 86 next year, does the global HQ \u2013 the British Isles \u2013 assisted by the cadaverous Philip. Charles, senior but uninteresting, goes where the white people are \u2013 Canada, Australia, New Zealand. The hot ticket, although I do not know why, is William and Catherine Cambridge, visiting Malaysia, Singapore, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. This news kicked the highest unemployment figures for 17 years off the top of the news agenda \u2013 although to be fair, unemployment does not have the hair of Catherine Cambridge. Sometimes I think if you dissected her, you would find the cell structure of a BaByliss 2100W Elegance hairdryer in metallic purple. If you are wondering what this will all cost, visit the royal website for details of their typical spending on &quot;work trips&quot;. They don&apos;t travel cheap. The grant-in-aid for royal travel and air annual report, 2010\u201311, explains that Charles Windsor spent \u00a3298,089 on a five-day trip to Delhi and Jodhpur \u2013 and the Queen spent \u00a3356,253 on a trip to Abu Dhabi and Muscat. But even if republicans moan that Catherine Cambridge spends thousands on her hair (I&apos;m sorry, I just cannot get past the hair) while disabled children lose essential services, we cannot deny that the royal family, who used to get it so fabulously wrong, has finally got its PR together. This is terrible news for those who despise the hereditary principle and scream at its new robustness \u2013 in politics and the professions as well as royalty \u2013 while waving farewell to the very concept of equality. There is a tough new shininess in the non-posh bits of Buckingham Palace, as anyone who has ever dealt with an effective corporate press office will recognise. Charles Windsor&apos;s director of communications, Paddy Harverson, used to run PR for Manchester United, so is skilled in the branding of displacement activities that still manage to rivet the planet. Processes have changed; reforms have been made. The royals, too, are heirs to Blair. You can&apos;t walk down the Mall without stepping on an heir to Blair. The family now produce brochures detailing all their good works. Charming and competent PRs release detailed accounts \u2013 which is great until you read them, and realise the Windsors are more profligate than ever. The big announcement this year, of course, was the news that if the eldest child of William and The Hair is a girl, she will inherit the throne. As a feminist I was confused for about three seconds, until I remembered we would still have a monarch. (Diana the First, perhaps, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Defender of the Faith \u2013 and now endorsed by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.) Royal historians of the future will no doubt wonder when our monarchy threw off bad press representation and embraced the global brand ethos. For me, the turning point was the meeting of William Cambridge and David Beckham in Los Angeles this summer. Why LA? Why not Sierra Leone or the failing cities of the north? Because LA is the first place that any aspiring starlet, from a trailer park or the Almanach de Gotha, has to go to pitch. The Beckhams blazed a trail for the Windsors in America, and how easy they seemed together. Regard the photos. Welcome to the monarchy of Coke. \u2022 This footnote was appended on 16 December 2011.

In fact, the most unexpected moment arrived towards the end of the ceremony, when the winner of best worldwide act award was announced. The\u00a0winners of the fan-driven award were Korean group Bigbang, who won 58m votes to beat Britney Spears. This was the one act that night most viewers wouldn&apos;t have known. Bigbang&apos;s victory shed light on the rise and rise of Korean music across Europe. Korean pop \u2013 K-pop for short \u2013 has become one of South Korea&apos;s most notable exports in recent years. Paul Han, co-founder of the\u00a0South Korean pop culture blog Allkpop.com, defines the style as &quot;fun music, with\u00a0a fusion of many genres&quot; \u2013 it takes in electro-driven bubblegum pop;\u00a0sometimes it&apos;s sprinkled with semi-nonsense English lyrics; sometimes there&apos;s an added R&amp;B sway. Its audience is largely female, from early teens through to late 20s. &quot;K-pop, I think, is personality,&quot; says the Korean-Canadian singer G.Na. &quot;It&apos;s very melodious, very easy to sing along to.&quot; Since Allkpop.com launched in 2007, Han has seen a consistent growth in its European readership, reflecting K-pop&apos;s spread from its homeland. &quot;When we first opened our blog, the Europeans made up maybe 1% of the readers,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it&apos;s close to 25%.&quot; That spread has been noticed by the big corporations: iTunes started selling K-pop to European audiences early in 2010, and Google is planning to set up up a K-pop channel. This past year has already seen several major K-pop events in the west, with the SMTown World Tour \u2013 featuring Super Junior, TVXQ and Girls&apos; Generation \u2013 selling thousands of tickets for shows in Paris, Los Angeles and New York. SHINee played the UK&apos;s first ever K-pop show at the opening of the London Korean film festival earlier this autumn, and at the start of this month the Brixton Academy in London hosted the United Cube Concert, with a bill made up of acts on the Korean label Cube Entertainment, with fans paying up to \u00a365 a ticket. The spread of Korean pop culture \u2013 a phenomenon nicknamed hallyu, or Korean wave \u2013 has been driven by TV, but not by the reality shows that are breeding grounds for UK manufactured pop. Instead, drama has been the vehicle to bring K-pop to new audiences. The process started with What Is Love All About, which was shown on Chinese state TV in 1997, and which sparked a wider interest in Korean TV and music across east Asia. At the same time, the Korean boy band H.O.T. (which stands for High-five of Teenagers) found a big audience across the region with hits We Are the Future, Candy and Warrior&apos;s Descent. They had been put together by the SM Entertainment company in 1996, and their success \u2013 they even had their own brand of soft drink at their peak \u2013 provided a template for future K-pop bands. Their international success was followed by BoA \u2013 the female artist Kwan Boa, whose stage name stands for Beat of Angel \u2013 who sold 1m copies of her Listen to My Heart single in Japan in 2001. The big breakthrough, though, came with the show Winter Sonata in 2003, which was shown in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines. With the rise of YouTube, subsequent dramas were able to spread further in a second Korean wave \u2013 Boys Over Flowers, launched in 2008, now has dedicated viewers around the world, both through the web \u2013 with fans uploading and subtitling episodes \u2013 and on TV stations as far afield as Kazakhstan and Peru. As Jae Kim of the Korean TV network MBC explains: &quot;Before\u00a0the internet, many fans had very little access to K-pop. You only would really have access by visiting Korea. The internet created accessibility.&quot; Now countless fan sites draw attention to every piece of\u00a0news, now matter how minute, from Korean TV and music. K-pop has benefited from the rise of these dramas, because music is a key part of these shows. SHINee&apos;s Stand By Me, for example, featured heavily in Boys Over Flowers. Key songs are repeated in Korean dramas, giving them exposure every bit as potent as a video in heavy rotation. When SHINee played in London, for example, though Stand By Me was not included on their setlist, it was repeatedly played through the PA to deafening cheers from fans who&apos;d travelled from across the UK and Europe to see the band. Those fans in Leicester Square testify to the power of the TV dramas in drawing them into the music, and to the fan-driven nature of its spread: &quot;A lot of my friends were watching [the show] You&apos;re Beautiful, and suggested that I watch it and listen to [the group] F.T. Island, and it just started from there,&quot; says 17-year-old Londoner Jessica. The result, according to a survey conducted by the Korean Culture and Information Service, is that there are an estimated 460,000 Korean-wave fans across Europe, concentrated in Britain and France, with 182 hallyu fan clubs worldwide boasting a total of 3.3m members. The Korean Connection, based in Paris, is a hallyu fan club with 4,000 members, established with the backing of the state-run Korean Cultural Centre, which arranges K-pop club nights, dance classes, and trips to Korea, and spreads the word about K-pop through social networking sites. Maxime Paquet, its president, sees K-pop&apos;s strength as being its refusal to stand still. The average K-pop event, he says, is &quot;close to what we can call &apos;total entertainment&apos; \u2026 K-pop is not only music, but a complete show. K-pop groups are managed by smart entertainment companies that invest a lot in artistic innovation. Every month, new groups appear and disappear.&quot; K-pop&apos;s fans use the internet as if they were a campaigning group. When the SMTown tour&apos;s sole Paris date sold out in minutes this summer, fans organised a flash mob in front of the Louvre to demand a second date be added, with Facebook and Tumblr communities adding their voices to the mix. Freya Bigg, who runs the UK-based blog UnitedKpop.com, helped organise similar flashmobs in London&apos;s Trafalgar Square to demand shows from her preferred K-pop acts. &quot;They&apos;re a great way to get the attention of the Korean media \u2013 it shows the dedication of fans here in the UK. They&apos;re also a great way to connect fans and find more \u2013 imagine thinking that you&apos;re the only fan around and then you see a flashmob in town.&quot; The level of hysteria now the K-pop acts are finally coming to London is comparable to any X Factor live show. &quot;United Cube London means so much to me,&quot; exclaims a breathless Li Suhaimi, from east London, who says she&apos;s followed the band Beast \u2013 on the Brixton bill \u2013 &quot;through several time zones. I&apos;ve travelled to Seoul, Thailand and Singapore to see them.&quot; So, how does K-pop grow in the West from here? Can it make the transition from being an internet-based phenomenon, with a self-selecting if hugely active fanbase, to crossing over into the mainstream media? Was BigBang&apos;s win at the European Music awards the shape of things to come, or just an indication of how well-organised those fans are \u2013 in short, was it K-pop&apos;s Belle and Sebastian at the Brits moment? Simon Hong, the CEO of Cube Entertainment, the label whose bands came to London a couple of weeks ago, is optimistic but cautious: &quot;The show in Brixton is a good opportunity for this part of the world to get a glimpse of our high-level artists in Korea. But there&apos;s a lot more work to be done, so K-pop is just on the starting line.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/16/ian-jack-hospital-sympathy-comradeship", "sentences": ["My days at home in bed began with a blackbird absurdly tuneful, like a toy in an opera, followed by the whine of the pre-dawn flights from Singapore and Hong Kong as they began their descent to Heathrow."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-16T19:59:01Z", "title": "Seen from my sick bed, a scene straight out of The Singing Detective | Ian Jack", "tags": ["NHS"], "article": "Several weeks ago I was lying ill in bed at home and\u00a0considering the sounds I could hear from the outside world. They had that muffled, but at the same time, selfish quality, heedless of the predicament of the sick, that I first heard in the\u00a0middle of the last century as a boy with mumps and measles: there you lay\u00a0on the dozy edge of consciousness while your so-called friends ran down the hill to school in the morning and in the evening played games under the street lamps until they were called indoors. Pitilessly, life went on without you. Nobody cared. In his autobiography, the Irish writer John McGahern beautifully described this feeling of separateness, though in terms of the starker division between the healthy and the dying, rather than the merely unwell. &quot;Suddenly,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the waitress pouring coffee at tables, the builder laying blocks, a girl opening a window, the men collecting refuse, [all\u00a0these things] belong to a world that\u00a0went mostly unregarded when it was ours but now becomes a place of unobtainable happiness, in even the meanest of forms.&quot; No children play in my street now, of\u00a0course. My days at home in bed began with a blackbird absurdly tuneful, like a toy in an opera, followed by the whine of the pre-dawn flights from Singapore and Hong Kong as they began their descent to Heathrow. An electric milk float would come squeaking along. Builders would arrive talking in languages from eastern Europe as they set to work on house renovations. Later, there might be an inexplicable shout of &quot;Lo-lay, lo-lay&quot; that could have been in any language or none. And all the while London hummed in the background: traffic, trains, jet engines, buzz saws, the\u00a0rise and fall of sirens. All this stopped when I was taken into\u00a0hospital. Hospitals admit very little noise from the outside world, and manufacture quite a lot of their own. Through the ward&apos;s double-glazed windows I could see the same planes on\u00a0the same flight paths, but now they crossed the London sky without a sound. I had a wonderful horizon that stretched all the way from the clock tower of the old Caledonian Market, standing like a minaret in the east, to the winter-black copses of Hampstead Heath. Every piece of it was silent. Eight or nine floors below, cars and buses crawled up and down the Euston Road, but they and the purposeful crowds on the pavements were silent too: a lively world beyond the glass. In the ward, we made our own noise. Some of this was expected. Spasms of coughing broke out, lungs gurgled, men rose in their beds to hawk and spit, drips bleeped. Drowsiness and drugs caused confusion. I thought I heard someone say &quot;Do you know that beautiful steamer?&quot; \u2013 my kind of question if ever there was one \u2013 but it turned out to be Joseph asking his nurse if she knew the song Beautiful Dreamer, which she didn&apos;t, and which Joseph then started to hum. In our four-bedded bay, Joseph was easily the most popular patient. He had a sweet disposition and the kind of\u00a0white hair you find on portraits of medieval saints. &quot;You&apos;re a lovely, lovely man, but you can&apos;t go there,&quot; nurses would tell him as he set off on a walk that might take him into the women&apos;s section. He was never sure where he was. &quot;You&apos;re in hospital, Joseph.&quot; &quot;Am I now, is that so? And who are you?&quot; He wore hospital-issue orange pyjamas, a sign that he had arrived suddenly and that in the days since he&apos;d\u00a0had no visitor to bring him alternatives. He liked biscuits. We all liked biscuits. In hospital conversation, they assumed abnormal proportions. Bourbons came round with the tea. &quot;Remember the garibaldi?&quot; asked Tony in the next bed. &quot;We used to call them dead-fly cakes.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s disgusting,&quot; said the nursing assistant, who had come long ago from Jamaica. &quot;There was another kind of biscuit that everybody liked at one time. What was the name now?&quot; We guessed the ginger snap, the rich tea and the jaffa cake, but the answer turned out to be the custard cream. &quot;Ah, the dear old custard cream,&quot; said Joseph, who was explaining what the phrase &quot;silver service&quot; meant to another nursing assistant, this time from west Africa. How you lifted the lid on the salver and showed the contents to the customer; how you transferred the meat or the fish to the customer&apos;s plate; and above all how it paid to fuss over the woman in the couple you were serving, because the man would notice and be pleased and leave a bigger tip. So Joseph had been a waiter. What else he had been wasn&apos;t clear, though every night a nurse would sit with him and try to talk him through his life. One\u00a0Saturday evening he and his nurse began to dance together. Joseph sang: &quot;Picture me upon your knee, with tea for two and two for tea, just me for you and you for me alone&quot; \u2013 and then, changing his step slightly: &quot;Oh, you beautiful doll, you great big beautiful doll, let me put my arms about you, I don&apos;t want to live without you \u2026 &quot; They went up and down between the beds, a\u00a0little Irishman in orange pyjamas and a\u00a0big nurse from Senegal in her white uniform, and naturally I thought of Dennis Potter, because the scene had surely been inspired by the Singing Detective. But it had nothing to do with fiction. It came out of that interesting compound of sympathy and comradeship that lives still inside hospitals and the NHS and flashes unexpectedly like kindly lightning. More than a week went by. The routines of hospitals are comforting. A\u00a0lunch of cauliflower pasta and tinned pears turned from an appalling prospect on Friday to a delicious feast on Monday, though the opening of the Jacob&apos;s Cream Crackers portion (a sweet option, with cheese) never got any easier. &quot;Nurse, nurse,&quot; I heard myself saying one day, &quot;could you help me with this?&quot; And she took it in her hands and the wrapping, which had defied all efforts by my fingers and my teeth, came off in\u00a0an instant. It struck me then how vigorous our carers were \u2013 how young, how strong, how global (Spain, India and Romania as well Senegal and Essex); and how much they contrasted with the white husks they were charged to look after \u2013 insular men who remembered ration books and often needed oxygen. It was possible to see the difference as the symbol of a bigger collapse. Then I got out with my drugs and discharge papers. The sound of the outside world returned in Tottenham Court Road. A taxi. &quot;Where to, guv?&quot; What does one say? Remembering McGahern, I might have said: &quot;To that place of ordinary, obtainable happiness, which goes so unregarded for so much of our lives.&quot; I didn&apos;t, of course. I gave an address that meant home."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/dec/18/aedas-number-one-architecture-practice", "sentences": ["They are working on a performance venue in Singapore that is something like a colossal beetle, and the new Crossrail station at Farringdon in London."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-18T00:05:00Z", "title": "The rise of Aedas is a triumph for efficency", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "Last week&apos;s news from the world of architecture is that there is a new global No 1 practice. It is British in origin, although now spread all over the world, which should inspire a warm glow in these troubled times. The firm in question, Aedas, has deposed the former leader, the American Aecom, in Building Design magazine&apos;s World Architecture 100 list of leading practices, which measures a practice&apos;s size by the number of architectural employees. Aedas has nearly 1,500 of them. It is likely you haven&apos;t heard of either, still less be able to tell these similarly named practices apart. They don&apos;t get the same column inches as the Zahas, Rems, Franks and Normans, nor much by way of Stirling prize nominations. Aedas have, however, designed more than 1,000 schools. The West Kowloon Terminus, part of a programme to connect Hong Kong to the largest high-speed rail network in the world, is being built to their designs, and they have done their share of glassy tower projects in Abu Dhabi, Saigon and Chinese cities such as Shenyang and Wuxi that, like the architects, are both big and little known over here. They are working on a performance venue in Singapore that is something like a colossal beetle, and the new Crossrail station at Farringdon in London. Aedas are part of a phenomenon \u2013 the rise of the very big architectural firm \u2013 that does more to shape the lives of more people than the work of celebrity designers. The company, what is more, is under 10 years old, albeit made out of the merger of practices founded decades ago, and in one case, the Yorkshire practice of Abbey Hanson Rowe, in the 1830s. Brian Johnson, chairman of Aedas&apos;s European operation, describes its growth in pragmatic terms. They wanted to be able to compete for larger projects, and they wanted to be large enough to have a professionally managed business. They saw a boom coming in commissions for schools and other public buildings under the now infamous private finance initiative, and positioned themselves to take full advantage. They joined up with a firm in Birmingham, then one in Hong Kong, to increase their geographic spread, and move into new areas of work, such as transport. If they see an opportunity in a particular place or a sector, they move into it. Because &quot;there are only so many dead architects you can have in your practice&apos;s name&quot;, they chose Aedas, based on the Latin for &quot;to build&quot;. They don&apos;t seek out glamour: their British offices are spread around the major cities, with quite a modest one in London. They do well, says Johnson, because they are big. They can summon a large amount of expertise to huge projects at short notice. They can pay for the latest software and good research. They can make sure that they have up-to-date knowledge about technology and sustainability. They can afford to fund themselves when bidding for major contracts, for which architects don&apos;t get paid unless they win the job. They aim to provide, in other words, an efficient, well-oiled, technically efficient service, which is suited to the scale and speed of modern projects, especially in the Far East, and to the demanding contracts under which architects have to work everywhere. They have an advantage in a world where architects can&apos;t survive without computing power, because they can afford to invest in it. They are also the logical outcome of Margaret Thatcher&apos;s transformation of the British economy. Johnson points out that in the 1970s there were also large architectural practices, but they were part of the public sector, in the form of architects departments for local authorities and the health service. Thatcher&apos;s policies had them closed and privatised to the extent that only one in three local authorities now employ any architects on their staff. The likes of Aedas have soaked up the work that used to be done by employees of the state. All of which is somewhat threatening to the old idea that architecture is somehow an art, or a craft, and about shaping spaces for inhabitation by the imagination and the body. Most of the strengths Johnson lists are technocratic, and about the processes of business. Aedas would certainly like to be liked for the architectural quality of their designs, and to attract more attention from awards juries, but it is clear that their systems of delivery are their main selling points. They have no house style, but allow their architects to choose their own, which also means they can choose the approach that works best in a given situation. For schools they can do the skimpy business-park-plus-bright-colours look \u2013 the almost inevitable outcome of the PFI process. In Abu Dhabi they can do big curves with an Islamic flavour, like everyone working else there. With their Kowloon station they channel Zaha Hadid&apos;s bunches of energetic curves. They can do Foster-ish, and Koolhaasian, and more sober Netherlandish styles, as the occasion demands. In this they are neither the best nor the worst of the very big practices. Aedas differ from Aecom and some others in that they focus on architecture, whereas many of their competitors are enormous engineering firms with an architectural wing attached. At times their work does not seem so very different from that of the more esteemed Foster and Partners (sixth in the BD list, with 879 architectural staff): because all these architects are dealing with the same pressures and demands, their projects have a way of ending up quite similar to one another. Aedas is what you get when you weigh up the way the modern world works, and adapt architecture to suit it. It is not about challenging or criticising, but trying to do a good job in the prevailing circumstances. It is about adaptation, not friction or resistance, because the financial forces\u00a0to which they are responding can&apos;t really be bothered with such things. Architecture, in the place-making sense, is tolerated to the extent that it doesn&apos;t get in the way. The results can be more or less pretty, and when it is not it is because the forces behind them are not particularly pretty, either. Aedas pose an important question, without entirely answering it: if businesses and governments want to make cities where almost everything is\u00a0shaped by efficiencies and processes, what can architects do to make them\u00a0better?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/dec/19/cribsheet-gove-likes-hong-kong-singapore-schools", "sentences": ["Weary now of Swedish models and American charter schools, he&apos;s fallen for the sciencey approach to primary education that keeps Hong Kong and Singapore in business."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-19T12:22:29Z", "title": "Cribsheet 19.12.11", "tags": ["Education"], "article": "Keeping it Christmassy, that wise man Michael Gove appears to spotted something shiny in the east.

On Monday the world was presented with the official version as propagated by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA): images of sobbing schoolchildren, marshalled into public view in the capital, Pyongyang, the soldiers falling to their knees with undiluted grief. Hours after a female presenter, dressed in black traditional dress, delivered the news, a live stream of North Korean TV showed occasional news &quot;bulletins&quot; extolling the virtues of the departed &quot;Dear Leader&quot;. Most airtime, though, was filled with sweeping mountain vistas, gaudy sunsets and black clouds rolling ominously across an unmistakably North Korean landscape, all to the accompaniment of forbidding choral and military music. In between, there were black and white photographs from Kim&apos;s youth, and more recent images of his widely ridiculed visits to state-run farms and factories. The KCNA, while hardly a barometer of public opinion, is nonetheless the only available window into the apparent grief of a nation. Soon after Kim&apos;s death was announced, people poured on to the streets of Pyongyang to begin what will be 10 days of national mourning. A two-minute report released by KCNA showed Pyongyang residents gathering at monuments to the Kim dynasty in what was described as a spontaneous show of grief. Reporters for Xinhua, China&apos;s official news agency, said they witnessed large numbers of people gathering around a bronze statue of Kim Il-sung \u2013 the country&apos;s founder and Kim Jong-il&apos;s father \u2013 in the centre of the city. &quot;Some laid wreaths to the statue. Some burst into tears. Some women even fainted and fell to the ground,&quot; the Xinhua report said. Japan&apos;s Kyodo news agency quoted a source in the capital as saying that, grieving aside, life appeared to be continuing as normal. &quot;It&apos;s calm, and people are gathering around monuments along the streets,&quot; it quoted the source as saying. &quot;People are seen going about their business as usual, and traffic is flowing normally.&quot; Another said that the streets were generally quiet, adding that some businesses had remained closed for the day. This evening, Kim&apos;s passing is being marked with repeated tributes on state TV to his patriotism and leadership, while other arms of the country&apos;s propaganda machine prime its citizens for a new, and relatively unknown, leader. &quot;The Korean people have suffered the great loss but are decisively rising up as they have Kim Jong-un, great successor to the revolutionary cause ... prominent leader of the party and the army and people of [North Korea] who is standing in the vanguard of the Korean revolution,&quot; KCNA said on its website. &quot;He is another great person produced by Korea who is identical to Kim Jong-il. No force on earth can block the revolutionary advance of our party, army and people wisely led by Kim Jong-un. At this moment of greatest sorrow and grief, people feel as if the sky were falling down. The hearts of all of them are now filled with stronger faith in victory, optimism and solemn pledge.&quot; The agency quoted Jong Il-guk, an officer in the Korean People&apos;s Army, as saying that Kim&apos;s vision of Juche \u2013 a version of self-reliance pioneered by his father \u2013 would be safe in the hands of Kim Jong-un. &quot;We will overcome sorrow and display fresh strength and courage to tide over the present difficulties and work harder for the great and fresh victory of the Juche revolution, true to the leadership of Kim Jong-un.&quot; Ho Song Chol, a member of the cabinet, said: &quot;The Korean revolution is sure to always triumph under the leadership of Kim Jong-un.&quot; The few North Koreans who were outside the country when the news broke reacted much like their compatriots at home. One woman, part of a group of North Koreans waiting to board a plane in Beijing, broke into tears and was led away by friends when it looked like she would collapse. While traffic was said to be moving normally in Pyongyang, the Associated Press reported that staff at the Koryo hotel, which usually accommodates visiting foreigners, were in tears. Hopes that Kim&apos;s death could spark grassroots political change are wildly optimistic. The social networks that gave impetus to the Arab spring uprisings are available to only a small number of North Koreans. Instead, groups with contacts in Pyongyang said they were expecting an even greater clampdown on communications. &quot;We&apos;re expecting some form of lockdown on communications and travel in the immediate period as North Korean authorities move to stabilise the situation and prepare for mourning,&quot; said Geoffrey See, managing director at Chosun Exchange, a Singapore-based non-profit group that promotes academic exchanges with North Korea. The Daily NK, an online news service that monitors North Korea from Seoul, said the regime had moved quickly to stifle potential unrest, including the closure of markets and the imposition of a curfew in Musan, a city in North Hamkyung province near the border with China. The Daily NK quoted sources as saying that local Workers&apos; party officials were ordering residents not to leave their homes, adding that security agencies had posted agents and on the streets and in alleyways &quot;to control civilian movements&quot;. &quot;Not even children are allowed to go out,&quot; one source said. Kim&apos;s sudden death, it added, had caught the country&apos;s people by surprise. &quot;Nobody had the slightest idea about [his] death even right before they saw the broadcast,&quot; another source said. &quot;You can hear the sound of wailing outside.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/19/kim-jong-il-north-korea1", "sentences": ["&quot;We&apos;re expecting some form of lockdown on communications and travel in the immediate period as North Korean authorities move to stabilise the situation and prepare for mourning,&quot; said Geoffrey See, managing director at Chosun Exchange, a Singapore-based non-profit group that promotes academic exchanges with North Korea."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-19T20:53:46Z", "title": "After Kim Jong-il's death, what next for the people of North Korea?", "tags": ["Kim Jong-il", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "They howled and whimpered and scrubbed raw eyes with fists. They flailed their arms in grief and marched in their thousands to the capital&apos;s landmarks. But no one, outside of North Korea, really knows what North Koreans felt at news of Kim Jong-il&apos;s death. There was shock, of course. Some perhaps wept from sorrow for their Dear Leader, some from sorrow for themselves. Some cried for fear that inadequate public anguish might damn them, and some from anxiety about what lay ahead. Kim veiled his country throughout his life and uncertainty shrouded his death. State media said he died at 8.30am on Saturday, felled by a heart attack &quot;due to physical and mental overwork&quot;, as he travelled by train on one of his innumerable inspection visits. There had been not a whisper of anything unusual in the two days before the announcement. The official news agency KCNA swiftly hailed his third son, Kim Jong-un, as the &quot;great successor&quot; and &quot;the eminent leader of the military and the party&quot;. The young man, thought to be just 28, has been groomed as heir since his father&apos;s apparent stroke in 2008. The 69-year-old left his son a nuclear-armed but impoverished country where food is scarce and human rights abuses rife, and his unexpected death sent a chill far beyond the 24 million inhabitants of North Korea. Politicians in Washington, Seoul, Tokyo and beyond weighed the prospects of a third generation of this communist dynasty with the risk of regional instability. Concerns were underscored by South Korean media reports on Monday that the North had fired short-range missiles, although the Yonhap news agency said the tests had been conducted before the death announcement. The defence ministry in Seoul did not comment. The South&apos;s military was already on high alert, while a spokesman for the Japanese prime minister said he had set up a crisis management team. Officials in the Obama administration, due to hold talks with the North this week and rumoured to be pondering an aid-for-disarmament deal, said it was closely monitoring developments. The UK foreign secretary, William Hague, said in a statement it was a difficult time for the North Korean people, but could prove a turning point. He urged the country to take steps towards the resumption of the stalled six-party denuclearisation talks. It was left to China, the North&apos;s chief ally, to lament Kim&apos;s passing. &quot;We feel incomparably anguished, and offer our deepest condolences to the entire North Korean people,&quot; the top leaders said in a statement. They described Kim as a great leader and close friend of China, adding that they were sure the Korean people would unify under his son&apos;s leadership. It was a rare encomium. In the wider world Kim was mocked as much as reviled. That is hardly surprising: the claims of his propaganda machine grew ever more extravagant over the years. But those who dismissed him \u2013 as a crazed and erratic nuke-toting maverick; as a &quot;pygmy&quot; (George Bush&apos;s word); as a pompadoured, platform-shoed buffoon, in the image by Team America perhaps most widely disseminated \u2013 underestimated the man. By turning his failing country into a nuclear state, he reinforced its pariah status, but wielded an influence he could never have otherwise achieved. There was logic in the threats to turn Seoul to ashes, as there was in the shelling and missile launches and nuclear tests. &quot;He left the country with the ultimate deterrent. He ensured it won&apos;t be Iraq and won&apos;t be Libya,&quot; said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in South Korea, on Monday. Behind the oversized, tinted glasses &quot;was a man of some skill&quot;, said James Hoare, the former British charge d&apos;affaires in Pyongyang. Foreigners who negotiated with him thought him sharp and knowledgeable, good at mastering briefs, but willing to refer to aides when necessary. &quot;He was competing in a hostile world and his solution might not be yours or mine, but his country is still there and the elite has survived \u2013 which is really what they are concerned with,&quot; said Hoare. The clownish image was still less fair to the people he ruled with an iron grip. Observers have called the country the world&apos;s only Stalinist theme park, but there was nothing entertaining about it. Around 200,000 North Koreans are believed to be in prison camps thanks to the system of collective punishment. Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, described the country as &quot;a human rights hell on Earth&quot;. &quot;Kim Jong-il ruled through fear generated by systematic and pervasive human rights abuses including arbitrary executions, torture, forced labour and strict limits on freedom of speech and association,&quot; he said in a statement. North Korea has long dismissed such criticisms as the jealous and destructive lies of capitalist aggressors. But experts say even its vast propaganda and state security apparatus has struggled to counter increasing domestic cynicism about the regime, which has proved incapable of meeting its people&apos;s basic needs. While Kim enjoyed sipping cognac and dining on sushi, his country has struggled with food shortages since the devastating famine of the 1990s, in which hundreds of thousands of people died. &quot;When the history of North Korea is written I think [his time] is going to be a pretty dark chapter,&quot; said Delury. &quot;It was doing well in the 50s; it was starting to have problems in the 1970s, but not totally; it was grinding down in the 80s before the end of the socialist block. Then right after Kim Il-sung dies, it goes into freefall. You go from the paternal rule of Kim Il-sung to famine in the space of a couple of years. &quot;To some extent it was the cards handed him \u2026 [But] in the end that&apos;s going to be his legacy.&quot; Kim&apos;s efforts to transform foreign relations did better. Yet dramatic improvements in dealings with the South, the US and Japan were soon reversed by his own decisions and those of foreign leaders. In North Korea&apos;s media, of course, there was only gratitude and sorrow. &quot;It is the biggest loss for the party \u2026 our people and the nation&apos;s biggest sadness,&quot; a tearful, black-clad anchorwoman told viewers as she announced Kim&apos;s death on television. &quot;At this moment of greatest sorrow and grief, people feel as if the sky is falling down. The hearts of all of them are now filled with stronger faith in victory, optimism and solemn pledge,&quot; KCNA said. Footage showed anguished citizens hammering at pavements in Pyongyang; sobbing schoolchildren marshalled into public view; soldiers falling to their knees with undiluted grief. &quot;When I see the videos I certainly don&apos;t believe in the first image of a total outpouring of grief. But nor do I believe that it is totally an act and they want to overthrow the government,&quot; said Delury. Associated Press reported that people in the streets of Pyongyang began crying when they learned of Kim&apos;s death. Staff at the Koryo hotel, which usually accommodates foreigners, were in tears. In Beijing, waitresses at a North Korean restaurant wept hysterically and fled the room on learning the news. Korea specialist Dr Leonid Petrov, of the University of Sydney, said that while many North Koreans would be genuinely distraught, &quot;it will not be as dramatic as it was in 1994 when Kim Il-sung died \u2026 political cynicism is growing.&quot; He predicted a long and &quot;extremely convenient&quot; state of mourning. Kim&apos;s death comes days before the beginning of 2012, which the regime has long heralded as a year of glory. &quot;[Now] they don&apos;t need to honour the promise that North Korea will become a strong, powerful and prosperous state \u2026 The population will be required to work hard for long hours with very few celebrations of Kim Il-sung&apos;s centenary,&quot; Petrov added. KCNA said Kim Jong-il&apos;s bier would rest at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang \u2013 where his father&apos;s embalmed body is displayed \u2013 before the funeral on 28 December. A national memorial service the following day, ending the official mourning period, will be marked with the firing of guns, the sounding of sirens and a three-minute silence. But already the transition of power has begun. &quot;The Korean people have suffered the great loss,&quot; KCNA said on its website, &quot;but are decisively rising up as they have Kim Jong-un, great successor to the revolutionary cause \u2026 prominent leader of the party and the army and people [of North Korea] who is standing in the vanguard of the Korean revolution. He is another great person produced by Korea who is identical to Kim Jong-il.&quot; While the Dear Leader was groomed for well over a decade before his succession, Kim Jong-un&apos;s elevation has been far more abrupt. &quot;I think the North has done quite a bit to accelerate the succession process,&quot; said Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group. &quot;So I think at least in the short term they will coalesce around the next generation of leadership and watch and see whether his son will be able to consolidate power.&quot; The official death notice stressed that Kim Jong-il had continued his father&apos;s legacy, and his son would do the same. That reflected the country&apos;s Confucian culture, but also the extent to which the regime still bases its authority on Kim Il-sung&apos;s. The country&apos;s founder remains &quot;eternal president&quot; 17 years after his death. &quot;Kim Jong-un&apos;s leadership provides a sure guarantee for creditably carrying to completion the revolutionary cause \u2026 started by Kim Il-sung and led by Kim Jong-il to victory,&quot; said the notice. The Dear Leader did not wield the same power as his father, essentially ruling with the army, and experts predict that Kim Jong-un&apos;s authority will be even more contingent on the actions of the military and political elite. His aunt and her husband \u2013 who, like the &quot;young general&quot;, were promoted last year \u2013 are expected to be key. Some wonder if his uncle is a potential challenger; others see him as a protector. Prof Jennifer Lind, an expert on the regime at Dartmouth College, noted: &quot;We don&apos;t know anything about how people in North Korea \u2013 the political and military elites \u2013 think about [Kim]. There is always a chance of unhappy people who might contest his succession. &quot;But that same group of people are going to be pretty afraid of unleashing any chaos or instability that might lead to collapse and reunification \u2013 which they would pretty much equate with a death sentence for themselves.&quot; While some warned the new leader might sabre-rattle to help establish himself, Petrov said Pyongyang could instead seek to engage with the international community. &quot;They will try to use it to resume negotiations with the US, saying there is a new leader so why not go and talk,&quot; he predicted. In the short term, the country is shutting down even further. Foreign delegations will not be accepted during the mourning period. &quot;Come back next year,&quot; said staff at the Beijing embassy, when asked if visas were available. Any hopes that Kim&apos;s death could spark grassroots political change are wildly optimistic. There is no civil society and communications are tightly monitored. Instead, groups with contacts in Pyongyang said they were expecting an even greater clampdown on communications. &quot;We&apos;re expecting some form of lockdown on communications and travel in the immediate period as North Korean authorities move to stabilise the situation and prepare for mourning,&quot; said Geoffrey See, managing director at Chosun Exchange, a Singapore-based non-profit group that promotes academic exchanges with North Korea. The Daily NK, an online news service that monitors North Korea from Seoul, said the regime had moved quickly to stifle potential unrest, including the closure of markets and the imposition of a curfew in Musan, a city in North Hamkyung province near the border with China. It quoted sources as saying that local workers and party officials were ordering residents not to leave their homes, adding that security agencies had posted agents on the streets and in alleyways &quot;to control civilian movements&quot;. &quot;Not even children are allowed to go out,&quot; one source said. Kim&apos;s sudden death, it added, had caught people by surprise. &quot;Nobody had the slightest idea about [his] death even right before they saw the broadcast,&quot; another source said. &quot;You can hear the sound of wailing outside.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/20/irish-property-developers-battersea-power-station", "sentences": ["The company controls more than 130 property projects across Ireland, the UK, Russia, Singapore and China, with a value of more than \u20ac4.6bn, and is one of the most prominent western developers in China."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-20T20:11:27Z", "title": "Irish property developers' grand vision for Battersea power station left in ruins", "tags": ["Real estate", "Commercial property", "Business", "Ireland bailout", "Ireland", "Europe", "World news", "London", "UK news", "Eurozone crisis", "Regeneration", "Communities", "Society"], "article": "The flamboyant Irish property tycoon Johnny Ronan and his business partner Richard Barrett have kept a low profile since their \u00a35.5bn plan to revamp Battersea Power Station ignominiously collapsed into administration last week. They bought the 16-hectare site with the derelict London landmark, Europe&apos;s biggest brick building, which has stood empty since it was decommissioned 28 years ago, for \u00a3400m in 2006. Five years later, their Real Estate Opportunities (REO) vehicle had run up debts of more than \u00a3500m and still not found an investor for the south-west London site. REO&apos;s main lenders \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group and Ireland&apos;s state &quot;bad bank&quot;, the National Asset Management Agency (Nama) \u2013 lost patience and put the power station holding company into administration in the hope that this would facilitate a sale of the site. Nama is thought to favour Chelsea football club, which has hired developer Mike Hussey and international &quot;starchitect&quot; Rafael Vi\u00f1oly to draw up a plan for a potential 55,000 stadium at the site. The Malaysian property firm SP Setia, whose previous bids were spurned by REO and the lenders, and a number of UK developers, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds are also understood to be in the frame. Some developers say the Irish duo failed to attract a partner for the Battersea revamp partly because of their reputation for being litigious. At one stage in the past, their company Treasury Holdings, which owns 50.7% of REO, was involved in more than 30 lawsuits simultaneously. &quot;REO are a good developer, but [Ronan and Barrett] are exceedingly litigious,&quot; said a London-based developer. &quot;A lot of investors didn&apos;t want to work with them.&quot; Legal chaos Barrett once wrote to Paul Clinton, a property developer with whom the pair had clashed repeatedly over a Dublin shopping mall: &quot;Certain opponents of ours have underestimated our ability to cause legal chaos to their detriment.&quot; Michael Smith, former chairman of conservation agency An Taisce, National Trust for Ireland, described Treasury as &quot;cavalier, litigious and gratuitously truculent&quot;, referring to court papers. Further hurdles were the large debts run up by the pair. To some extent, the latest failed redesign for Battersea has fallen victim to the Irish property boom and bust. In April 2009, the Irish government created Nama to buy up impaired property loans from Ireland&apos;s struggling banks. Treasury, one of the largest Irish property developers, had \u20ac1.4bn (then about \u00a31.2bn) of its \u20ac2.7bn loans taken over by Nama. Not long after, in March 2010, Ronan had a public bust-up outside a pub in Ranelagh with his glamorous former girlfriend Glenda Gilson, a model and TV star. After the fracas, Ronan, now 57, whisked their 25-year-old mutual friend Rosanna Davison, a former Miss World and daughter of singer Chris de Burgh, off in his private jet to Marrakech for a reported \u20ac60,000, week-long extravaganza. Along with a female friend of Davison, they checked into the \u20ac500-a-night La Mamounia Hotel. Davison later described it as a &quot;bout of Sunday afternoon drinking gone crazy&quot; to the Irish Independent. Officials at Nama were furious. Since then, the bearded and pony-tailed tycoon \u2013 known in the Irish press as &quot;the Buccaneer&quot; \u2013 has had to tone down his lavish lifestyle and even sold his private jet this summer, along with his black Maybach limousine. He reportedly left the country for a while, but has been sighted in Dublin recently. The son of a pig farmer in Tipperary who later branched out into property, Ronan trained as an accountant but soon followed his father into developing offices. In 2009, his wealth was listed by the Sunday Times as \u20ac239m but by May 2011 both Ronan and Barrett had dropped off the list of Ireland&apos;s richest. Ronan&apos;s son, a pony-tailed &quot;Mini-Me&quot;, also joined the property world and worked for REO on the Battersea site for some time, where he was described as &quot;very charming and agreeable in an Irish kind of way&quot; by a local resident. Ronan met Barrett at Castleknock College, a private secondary school for boys in Dublin, and they later decided to become partners after bumping into each other on the same deal. A barrister who hails from a wealthy grain merchant family in Co Mayo, Barrett keeps out of the limelight. He is described as &quot;very bright&quot; and the brains behind Treasury. One London developer described the pair as &quot;the only financially sophisticated developers in Nama \u2013 with [virtually] no personal guarantees or borrowings who did everything on a corporate structure&quot;. Treasury was formed in 1989 and named after the pair&apos;s first major development, the Treasury building in Dublin (now, coincidentally, home to Nama). The company controls more than 130 property projects across Ireland, the UK, Russia, Singapore and China, with a value of more than \u20ac4.6bn, and is one of the most prominent western developers in China. A \u00a3125m bid for the Millennium Dome in London in 2001 collapsed after Tony Blair stepped in to block the sale."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/22/ba-owner-iag-virgin-buy-bmi", "sentences": ["Virgin Atlantic is 49% owned by Singapore Airlines and controls just 3% of the slots at Heathrow."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-22T09:39:00Z", "title": "BA owner IAG beats Virgin to buy bmi", "tags": ["British Airways", "Airline industry", "Travel & leisure", "Business", "Virgin Atlantic", "Mergers and acquisitions"], "article": "British Airways owner International Airlines Group has beaten arch-rival Virgin Atlantic to the acquisition of bmi, prompting Sir Richard Branson to slam a deal that &quot;screws the travelling public&quot;. IAG announced on Thursday morning that it had reached a binding agreement with Germany&apos;s Lufthansa to buy Heathrow airport&apos;s second-largest carrier in a \u00a3172.5m deal. Virgin Atlantic was also in talks to buy bmi, but confirmed that it had been beaten to second place. Once the deal is completed, IAG&apos;s share of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow will rise from 45% to 53%, consolidating its position as the airport&apos;s most powerful carrier. Branson, Virgin Atlantic&apos;s co-owner and founder, urged competition authorities to block the deal. He dismissed IAG&apos;s recent claim that it would use the bmi slots to target new markets in Asia: &quot;Claiming that this deal is about new markets from Heathrow is a smoke screen. This deal simply cuts consumer choice and screws the travelling public. BA is already dominant at Heathrow and their removal of bmi just tightens their stranglehold at the world&apos;s busiest international airport. We will fight this monopoly every step of the way as we think it is bad for the consumer, bad for the industry and bad for Britain.&quot; IAG&apos;s boss, Willie Walsh, renewed his on-off war of words with Branson over the comments. &quot;You would expect him to say that and quite honestly I am disappointed he didn&apos;t come up with something better than that,&quot; said Walsh, adding that a financially weak industry had been bad for passengers. &quot;Clearly the industry is not sustainable with the level of profitability that it has generated historically. I don&apos;t think the consumer has benefited from an industry that is incapable of investing for the future. In America the consumer has suffered because of a lack of profitability,&quot; he said. IAG has already flagged up the deal with the European commission, the authority responsible for competition concerns within the European Union, as it seeks to win approval for its latest tie-up in a rapidly consolidating aviation market by the end of March 2012. IAG was formed by the merger of BA and Spain&apos;s Iberia, while regulators recently gave their blessing to a deal between the two carriers and American Airlines, in which they will co-ordinate ticket prices and scheduling. Such behaviour is anathema under conventional competition law, but airlines have argued successfully in recent years that consolidation is vital for a perennially loss-making industry that has announced a collective multibillion-dollar annual loss seven times over the past 11 years. IAG will also argue that its competitors are allowed an even larger proportion of slots at their bases, with Lufthansa controlling 66% of Frankfurt and Air France controlling 59% at Paris Charles de Gaulle. Walsh said the realignment of bmi&apos;s domestic and international slots, which currently fly to destinations such as Freetown in Sierra Leone and Beirut, would make inspire other airlines to open up similar routes from the UK. &quot;We drive the competition because we are the ones that drive the expansion. BA is good for the consumer.&quot; Walsh said key bmi domestic routes such as Belfast to Heathrow would not be axed. Walsh also warned of job losses as IAG revamps a business that reported an operating loss of \u20ac154m (\u00a3130m) in the first nine months of the year and employs 3,691 people. He argued that without the IAG takeover, bmi would have been shut down or potentially sold to a foreign buyer who would not have hired staff in the UK. &quot;Jobs would have been exported from the UK,&quot; said Walsh, adding that converting some of bmi&apos;s short-haul slots to long-haul would involve bigger aircraft, which in turn require more employees for operation and maintenance purposes. Bmi&apos;s regional and low-cost businesses are certain casualties and will be sold, while Walsh confirmed that bmi&apos;s Castle Donington base would also go. Lufthansa acquired bmi from Sir Michael Bishop in a \u00a3223m deal two years ago. The development leaves Virgin Atlantic searching once again for its next strategic gambit, having commissioned a review of its options by Deutsche Bank last year. Virgin Atlantic is 49% owned by Singapore Airlines and controls just 3% of the slots at Heathrow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/25/japan-casinos-fund-earthquake-recovery", "sentences": ["Las Vegas Sands, which opened a luxury casino resort in Singapore in 2010, has had its sights on the potentially lucrative Japanese market for several years.", "Supporters point to the Singapore complex, which includes the world&apos;s most expensive hotel, as proof that casinos can operate without attracting organised crime or creating gambling addicts.", "Singapore Marina Bay Sands, which boasts 1,500 slot machines and 600 gaming tables, is expected to help generate about $1bn in gaming taxes this year, according to one estimate, while Macao&apos;s casinos could give the government $13bn."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-25T17:38:01Z", "title": "Japan bets on casinos to fund earthquake recovery", "tags": ["Japan", "Japan disaster", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Earthquakes"], "article": "Croupiers and poker players could fuel Japan&apos;s recovery from the March earthquake and tsunami as the country moves closer to legalising casinos. A cross-party group of MPs wants to resurrect a 2006 campaign to put casinos on the same legal footing as betting on horse, speedboat and bicycle racing. The cost of rebuilding the north-east coastline, estimated at $245bn (\u00a3157bn), has given fresh impetus to the campaign, which has the support of a growing number of influential politicians including four former prime ministers. Members of the 150-strong group have met senior police officials in an attempt to calm fears that casino resorts of the kind springing up elsewhere in Asia will fall under the influence of the yakuza \u2013 Japan&apos;s answer to the mafia. &quot;Some members of the Diet are now insisting that casino legislation be passed,&quot; according to Gaming Capital Management, a US-based group that funds casino construction. &quot;Casinos are a great taxation source and can contribute a lot under current financial difficulties related to the earthquake recovery process.&quot; Issei Koga, an MP from the governing Democratic party of Japan and leader of the group, said casino resorts would be &quot;enormously strong engines&quot; for generating international tourism. The 11 March disaster and the accident at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant sent visitor numbers spiralling earlier this year. Inbound tourism has recovered, but Japan could struggle to achieve its aim of attracting 25 million visitors a year by 2020. Las Vegas Sands, which opened a luxury casino resort in Singapore in 2010, has had its sights on the potentially lucrative Japanese market for several years. A 2009 study by Osaka University of Commerce found that casino resorts could be worth $44bn a year. The promise of bigger tax revenues in the midst of an economic crisis appears to be winning over politicians who had voiced moral objections to Macao-style casinos. Supporters point to the Singapore complex, which includes the world&apos;s most expensive hotel, as proof that casinos can operate without attracting organised crime or creating gambling addicts. Singapore Marina Bay Sands, which boasts 1,500 slot machines and 600 gaming tables, is expected to help generate about $1bn in gaming taxes this year, according to one estimate, while Macao&apos;s casinos could give the government $13bn. &quot;There is more momentum and greater optimism than there has ever been in the past,&quot; George Tanasijevich, the company&apos;s representative in Japan, told Bloomberg. The move has the support of Tokyo&apos;s governor, Shintaro Ishihara, and Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, who wants to use casino revenue to fund welfare programmes. Other forms of gambling in Japan, together with pachinko, a pinball derivative played by 18 million people, generated $322bn last year, according to the Japan Productivity Centre. Pachinko, in which prizes are exchanged off-premises for cash, generates 30 trillion yen a year \u2013 more than Japan&apos;s top five carmakers put together. Japan&apos;s parliament would have to pass a law to nullify the ban on casino gambling, and some commentators believe the pro-casino lobby could struggle to win over the public after two high-profile gambling scandals. The traditional sport of sumo was rocked by revelations last summer that dozens of wrestlers had gambled illegally on professional baseball matches, with members of the yakuza acting as bookmakers. Mototaka Ikawa, the former chairman of Daio, a leading paper maker, has been in the headlines amid allegations that he used more than 5.5bn yen borrowed from the firm&apos;s subsidiaries to fund trips to casinos around the world. &quot;The media has been running stories about how certain people become easily addicted to gambling, and in addition to wrecking their own lives in spectacular fashion, ruin the lives of others. That&apos;s great ammunition for the anti-casino crowd,&quot; says Mark Schreiber, a media commentator who writes about social trends. He is not convinced that casinos will aid tsunami reconstruction, even if MPs find time to debate a gambling bill. &quot;By the time the casino resorts are up and running \u2013 I reckon it would take three to five years \u2013 the recovery will be far enough along and Japan will have a completely new set of problems,&quot; he said. The move could fall victim to an ingrained cultural aversion to gambling among Japanese leaders stretching back to the 18th century, when authorities had run-ins with bakuto gamblers, the forerunners of the yakuza. Schreiber said: &quot;There is also an old Japanese expression \u2013 nomu, utsu, kau (booze, gambling and womanising) \u2013 to describe a samurai who had fallen into a dissolute life.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2011/dec/28/london-olympics-2012-progress-report", "sentences": ["Verdict The test events have already proved that the strategy is sound \u2013 beach volleyball on Horseguard&apos;s Parade and equestrian events in Greenwich Park will be among the defining images of the Games \u2013 but loud questions will remain about legacy and value Security Ever since London&apos;s victory in Singapore to secure the Games was followed a day later by the terrorist attacks on 7/7, security has been among the thorniest issues facing organisers.", "But judged purely on the wide ranging promises made in Singapore and afterwards it is clear that huge challenges remain, particularly in sports participation."], "publicationDate": "2011-12-28T22:59:01Z", "title": "Olympic year is almost here \u2013 but are we ready for it? | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Athletes UK Sport, the body responsible for investing more than \u00a3100m a year of public money in Olympic sport, has recently reiterated its belief that Team GB will meet lofty expectations and the recent round of test events have stoked those hopes. Britain&apos;s athletes are, they insist, on track to record their best performance since 1908 by finishing at least fourth in the medal table with &quot;more medals in more sports&quot; than Beijing. With British Cycling unable to match its extraordinary 2008 haul due to rule changes, there will be more pressure on rowing and sailing to deliver. Other sports in which Britain is traditionally less strong will also have to step up to the plate \u2013 taekwondo and hockey among them. Tracking the number of world championship medals won in 2011 provides further reassurance they are on track. The one unquantifiable factor remains the home Games effect \u2013 some will shrink in the face of huge pressure, others are bound to come from nowhere to be inspired. Verdict They appear to be on track by every available measure, and UK Sport&apos;s high performance system inspires confidence in the 550 athletes who will represent Team GB. But fourth in the medal table remains a huge challenge and the margins impossibly fine Stadium The \u00a3438m main stadium divides opinion with its stark appearance but all who have been inside praise its sightlines and intimate feel. With 80,000 ticket holders packed in, organisers stand a good chance of generating the electric atmosphere they say will set London apart. But the stadium also remains a totemic symbol of the ongoing arguments over the legacy of the Games. Upon coming to power the coalition government and the London Mayor rightly decided tearing down half the stadium immediately afterwards to reduce it to a 25,000 capacity athletics bowl in the name of sustainability was the wrong call. But having decreed that only a top flight football team could support a larger stadium, a hugely damaging and bitter battle was set in train between West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur. The east London club won preferred bidder status, only to see the process scrapped as it became gripped by legal paralysis and allegations of dirty tricks. With the capture of the 2017 World Athletics Championships having finally ended the debate over keeping the track, the Olympic Park Legacy Company will have another go at solving the conundrum with a new tender process that began earlier this month. Verdict Completed on time and to budget, the Olympic Stadium, standing alone on its own island, looks better in reality than on the plans. It feels at once intimate and, when lit at night, suitably dramatic. But \u00a3438m still seems a lot to spend on what is essentially only the exoskeleton of a stadium \u2013 it will cost another \u00a395m to make it fit for lasting use afterwards Other park venues The now completed other venues are a mixed bag but the overall report card is positive. The velodrome has been almost unanimously praised for its smooth lines and distinctive looks, while the handball arena has emerged as an unsung architectural hero. Opinion remains divided over Zaha Hadid&apos;s dramatic \u00a3253m Aquatics Centre. Its sizeable budget was justified on the basis of its dramatic looks but at Games-time its sleek wave form will be obscured by ugly temporary stands. From inside, however, one can&apos;t fail to be impressed by the steepling stands, space and light. The temporary nature of the venues for basketball \u2013 a dramatically lit white cube \u2013 and water polo have been justified on the basis that they won&apos;t be left as white elephants. But there is a legitimate debate about how much they have cost for a few days of use and whether they will find genuine uses afterwards. In many ways, the star of the Olympic Park may be the park itself. Because most of the venues were finished early, there should be time to make the Park feel like a living, breathing, mature space rather than the usual concrete wasteland. Verdict Simply completing the venues on time and on budget in the teeth of a recession and in the wake of the embarrassments of Wembley, Pickett&apos;s Lock and the Millennium Dome was a big achievement. That a fair number so impressively marry form and function is a huge bonus Other venues The vision for a &quot;compact&quot; Games leaving no white elephants and making the most of dramatic London landmarks has proved difficult to deliver in practice. Greenwich Park, where a huge temporary arena will house equestrian events, has stirred local protest while the shooting range at Royal Artillery barracks in Woolwich sparked a debate about the lack of legacy. But organisers believe the end result \u2013 iconic images that will showcase sports afforded little coverage at other times \u2013 will be well worth it. Following two batches of test events, teething troubles were identified but the plan appears robust \u2013 even if questions remain about the atmosphere at the cavernous Excel. Verdict The test events have already proved that the strategy is sound \u2013 beach volleyball on Horseguard&apos;s Parade and equestrian events in Greenwich Park will be among the defining images of the Games \u2013 but loud questions will remain about legacy and value Security Ever since London&apos;s victory in Singapore to secure the Games was followed a day later by the terrorist attacks on 7/7, security has been among the thorniest issues facing organisers. Shortly after coming to power, the coalition government launched a wide ranging review of security \u2013 which led to a realisation that, against the backdrop of a severe terrorist threat, more resources would be required. At the same time, it became clear that Locog had woefully underestimated the number of guards that would be required as an initial estimate of 10,000 became 23,700. Costs doubled to \u00a3553m. The risk of damage to the credibility of organisers has been outweighed by the argument that there is no room for scrimping on security. Overall, the budget for security has soared to well over \u00a31bn. As a result there will be 13,500 military personnel on duty during the Games, as well as 12,000 police, along with an impressive array of military hardware. Verdict For all the concerns over soaring costs and the rare mis-step by Locog in underestimating the number of in-venue guards that will be required, there will be little criticism for spending whatever it takes to secure the Games. The challenge for organisers will be to balance reassurance for the public with the requirement to maintain a party atmosphere and avoid overbearing or intrusive security Transport Along with security concerns, London&apos;s transport infrastructure has long been regarded as the most likely achilles heel for organisers. Responsibility has been passed from the Olympic Delivery Authority to Transport for London and much will depend on its ability to persuade businesses and individuals who are not going to the Games to change their routine. &quot;Business as unusual&quot; will be the message, but there are already signs of growing cynicism among the public. The London Mayor, Boris Johnson, is buoyantly insistent transport will be the 2012 dog that doesn&apos;t bark, but those at the sharp end betray more anxiety. Among the challenges for the self-proclaimed &quot;public transport Games&quot; will be managing the perception issues around the Games lanes that will transport dignitaries and officials around London. Verdict There is ongoing concern that local consultation over the detail of the impact of the transport plan at local level has been left worryingly late. Much will depend on the willingness of visitors and Londoners to put up with even more inconvenience than usual Tickets There were conflicting emotions from organisers at the deluge of applications for the first batch of the 6.6m tickets available to the British public of a total of 8.8m (the rest go to sponsors, the media and overseas buyers). The usually surefooted Locog looked unsure how to react to criticism that the process was biased in favour of those able to bid big money for large numbers of tickets. But, ultimately, the fact that every event bar football sold out was a huge result for organisers with around a year to go. The money was banked and, ultimately, the statistics proved the process was fair and offered plenty of reasonably priced tickets. However the process was handled there would have been criticism and, within the strictures imposed by the International Olympic Committee and the proportion of tickets reserved for sponsors and officials, it was probably as fair as could be expected. Locog&apos;s chief executive, Paul Deighton, has vowed to sell out every ticket, but women&apos;s football in particular will be a huge challenge. The final batch of 1.2m tickets across all sports will go on sale in April once the final venue layouts have been finalised and are likely to spark a huge stampede. Attention will then turn to touting, the grey hospitality market and the difficulty in policing it. Verdict Criticism during the process from disappointed applicants was a small price to pay for the certainty of selling out in atmosphere and revenue terms. Locog has banked \u00a3537m with just \u00a3130m left to raise. Whether enough of those tickets found their way into the hands of a diverse population in terms of age and background will remain an open question until the Games National mood With the nightmare scenario of cost overruns and delays on the venues averted, and Locog successful in raising sponsorship money and shifting tickets, attention will turn to what these Games will feel like. Organisers have long insisted that it will be the unique atmosphere that will grip the capital and the nation, not only in the venues but at the huge live sites and elsewhere, that will set London&apos;s Games apart. The Royal Wedding is the most often cited example of what they want to achieve. But that was a single day and the Olympics \u2013 together with the torch relay, Diamond Jubilee, Festival 2012 cultural programme and the Paralympics \u2013 is part of a summer-long orgy of flag waving. Lord Coe has repeatedly said Britain is a &quot;slow burn&quot; nation but expects enthusiasm to begin to ignite around the torch relay in May. Whether communities up and down the land engage with that procession in the way organisers hope should be a fairly accurate barometer of the public mood. It will also begin to give an idea of the extent to which the Games will be embraced by the whole nation. Moreover, no one really knows whether the size and scale of the capital will swallow up the Games or whether it will be transformed by them. As in Sydney, the 70,000 volunteers will play a key role. The government and organisers had all hoped that mid-2012 would be the point at which the economy started to turn and chime with a more optimistic national mood. That now looks extremely unlikely and much may depend on whether the population at large is in the mood to forget its troubles and party regardless. Verdict History would suggest widespread cynicism will reign up until the opening ceremony, whereupon the nation will enthusiastically embrace the Games in as yet unimaginable ways Legacy Until recently, when intense focus began to alight upon operational issues around tickets, security and transport, the much vaunted legacy was a key area of controversy. Due to the unique range of promises loaded on to the Games in order to secure them, and later to justify the \u00a39.3bn public sector funding package, the ambitious legacy aims were always going to attract intense focus. The regeneration of the east end can already be judged a partial success, partly as a result of the gamble taken by an Australian shopping centre giant in building the Westfield that acts as the gateway to the Park in the teeth of a recession. Assessing whether it has achieved the bold aim of rebalancing the poverty of the east of the city with the relative wealth of the west will take rather longer. The legacy for elite sport will depend largely on whether a sustainable future can be found for the venues and whether confidence and investment in the high performance systems that won success in Beijing and beyond can be maintained. And the biggest question mark hangs over whether the Games can truly be used to inspire generations of young people and adults to get off their sofas and do more exercise. No other Games has achieved that feat and, despite \u00a3250m of investment a year, adult participation targets have been scrapped in light of glacial progress. Meanwhile, the budget for school sport has been halved, which may in time come to be seen as a perverse decision a year from the Games. Verdict Legacy has become the most over-used, and ill-defined, word associated with the Games and London is way ahead of most of its predecessors at a similar stage. But judged purely on the wide ranging promises made in Singapore and afterwards it is clear that huge challenges remain, particularly in sports participation. As the all-consuming focus becomes the Games themselves, the legacy questions may fade temporarily \u2013 only to return at even louder volume afterwards Ceremonies Olympic opening and closing ceremonies are curious things. Almost everyone agrees they are too long and do little to boost the chances of the athletes involved. But they also insist that they are vital to the way the Games are perceived. Danny Boyle and Stephen Daldry recently saw their budgets doubled to \u00a381m when an extra \u00a341m was found from the public funding package to boost Locog&apos;s investment, with the government determined it will act as a three-hour advert for UK plc. There are bold ambitions to use it as a showcase for Britain&apos;s strength in the creative industries but the red bus Beijing handover will remain a reminder of how not to do it. Verdict Matching the scale and grandeur of Beijing will be impossible, while avoiding embarrassment is seen as the minimum requirement.
