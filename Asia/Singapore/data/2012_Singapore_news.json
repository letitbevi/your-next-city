There&apos;s the 26ft-tall skyscraper beehive, a bicycle covered in wool with sheep horns for handlebars and a piece inspired by two cross-dressing cage fighters in Swansea&apos;s city centre \u2013 all described in a laconic and often hilarious deadpan. &quot;He&apos;s marvellously talented and \u2013 unusually for contemporary art \u2013 very funny,&quot; says Laura Cumming, the Observer&apos;s art critic. &quot;I caught sight of him in the 2006 Beck&apos;s Futures and he has never made anything that didn&apos;t fascinate ever since.&quot; Williams is not unduly concerned that his light-hearted approach will mean his work is taken less seriously. &quot;Is it comedy? Is it art?&quot; he muses. &quot;Call it what you like, it&apos;s either good or bad in the end. I like that moment when I do a performance in a gallery setting when the audience doesn&apos;t know if it&apos;s going to be serious or funny. It&apos;s a bit like coaxing a constipated well.&quot; If anything, Williams is relieved to make pieces at all. After studying at Central Saint Martins in London, he moved back to his native north Wales in the early 2000s. He was close to giving up art, but then won a Hamlyn Foundation award in 2004: &quot;It was like being refuelled in midair when I was considering making an emergency landing,&quot; he says. In May, he will have his largest solo show to date, at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham. &quot;My work is darker now and, I think, stronger. I live in the arse-end of nowhere, so I&apos;m always having to trade on the last thing I did, but I&apos;ve definitely got more of an idea of what I&apos;m up to now.&quot; Chloe Dewe Mathews  The 29-year-old documentary photographer Chloe Dewe Mathews was a few months into an overland trip from China to the UK in 2010 when she stopped in Naftalan, Azerbaijan. She had heard about a sanatorium where locals \u2013 since the days of Marco Polo in the 13th century \u2013 have sworn by the therapeutic benefits of bathing in sludgy crude oil heated to 37C and she thought it might make a diverting subject for a portfolio of pictures. Dewe Mathews says, &quot;I remember thinking, &apos;Would this interest anyone at all? Well, I might as well just do it anyway.&apos;&quot; Validation was not long in coming: in June last year, she was signed to the photo agency Panos Pictures; then, in November, her series Caspian, including images from Naftalan, won the 2011 international photography award run by the British Journal of Photography. More enduringly, she now had a blueprint for a lifetime&apos;s work: &quot;I was away for nine months, but I realised it could be a long-term thing, almost a recce for my career.&quot; Dewe Mathews is smart and assured, and her approach is fearlessly single-minded: for example, she crossed Asia and Europe entirely by hitchhiking. &quot;If you&apos;re on a bus the whole time, you have that lovely staring-out-of-the-window thing,&quot; she says, &quot;but it&apos;s not the same as going from one person&apos;s car with all sorts of funny things hanging from the mirror and them telling you their stories. It makes for a much more fertile atmosphere.&quot; She returns to Russia this month to continue the Caspian series and will exhibit the new photographs next October at the 1508 Gallery in London. This time, however, she has been forced to make arrangements for the transport. &quot;It will be too cold to stand out on the road,&quot; she sighs, genuinely disappointed. &quot;But I&apos;m going to do couch surfing, so hopefully I will hear stories that way.&quot; Pernilla &amp; Asif  They officially launched only last month but already it&apos;s clear that Pernilla &amp; Asif is no ordinary design company. Pernilla Ohrstedt, 31, and Asif Khan, 32, met in their first year at the Bartlett School of Architecture, London. After distinguishing themselves individually (Ohrstedt curated the Canadian Pavilion at the 2010 Venice Architecture Biennale; Khan designed the award-winning West Beach Cafe in Littlehampton), they decided to work together. Their first collaboration, a Design Museum commission called Harvest \u2013 described by Khan as &quot;furniture made from flowers&quot; \u2013 set out their ambitions: &quot;We wanted to test the limits of people&apos;s imaginations and introduce new ways of seeing things.&quot; The work that followed also made striking use of offbeat materials. The pavilion for a Singapore architecture festival consisted of two cones made of ropes and steel filled with ice and sand. A performance piece called Cloud, for Design Miami/Basel 2011, created a sort of canopy by sending puffs of helium-filled soap clouds into an overhead net. (They used a larger-scale version to launch their practice at York Hall in east London last November.) Now they&apos;re working on a major commission for the Olympic Park called the Beatbox. Described by Ohrstedt as &quot;a building that people can interact with like it&apos;s a musical instrument&quot;, it contains 200 cushions which activate sounds of athletes in action, recorded by DJ Mark Ronson. &quot;Mark turned these sounds into an anthem for 2012,&quot; says Khan, &quot;and our building deconstructs them again.&quot; Unusually, for a young company with such experimental projects, they have had support from the likes of the British Council and Coca-Cola. Ohrstedt says they want to keep their company &quot;slim and agile&quot; and Khan says their ambition is to do &quot;things we don&apos;t expect to be doing. It&apos;d be interesting to do a music video, or a set design, or a bridge or a road. Anything that challenges us.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/01/eu-conservatives-switzerland", "sentences": ["No: the current Asian champion of peace and stability is Singapore, of course, duly sanctified by HSBC."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T15:10:00Z", "title": "Why can't we be more like Switzerland? | Peter Preston", "tags": ["European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Conservatives", "Politics"], "article": "Be careful what you wish for, even though the sceptics in Tory backrooms seem to have it all figured out.

It&apos;s that globally alluring Swiss riff again. If you don&apos;t like where you are or what you are, think Basel and Bern. If you&apos;re stuck in a valley of black despair, look up at the Eiger. If you&apos;re not sure where you&apos;re going, try munching a pippin with William Tell. Long ago, in Dhaka, I sat with a triumphant Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as he described the young, free country he hoped to build. &quot;Bangladesh will be the Switzerland of Asia,&quot; he buoyantly declared. But then a bunch of army officers murdered him. And so riff moved on. Not, alas, to the nation once memorably designated by the New York Times as the emerging Switzerland of the region: ah! Afghanistan. Nor to another much mentioned contender, Nepal. No: the current Asian champion of peace and stability is Singapore, of course, duly sanctified by HSBC. The stock exchanges, and a soothingly sedated sort of society, have it. But only in Asia. Poor battered Lebanon used to be called &quot;the Switzerland of the Middle East&quot;. Guinea, Lesotho and Swaziland all aspire to be known as &quot;the Switzerland of Africa&quot;. Costa Rica relishes its title as the &quot;Switzerland of Central America&quot;. And now the backbenchers of Britain, too, want to play that game. You can, apparently, live at the heart of Europe without being part of it. You can let the lorries of the free market use your toll roads and cream off a nice dividend. You can keep a highly inflated currency but allow your banks to take deposits from all comers (and scrabble to keep your haven status). It&apos;s all very democratic, of course, a country run by anonymous politicians that lets the technocrats steer its ferry boats, a nation of different tongues and communities that graciously allows outsiders in to sweep its roads and bake its pizzas, but gives them only the most reduced of rights. You want change and constant referendums? Learn here that referendums mean no change. It&apos;s a placid, complacent place. Switzerland has eternal peace and convenient neutrality. Switzerland defines its own national self-interest every day. But is this the future we see for Britain (or, more accurately, for England, since that&apos;s where the wish-fulfillers live)? Even as the question&apos;s asked, you can find the delusionists moving on. If not Switzerland, then somewhere bigger, more bustling and dynamic, on the peripheries of Europe? Yes, of course! Ankara boasts a growth rate of 9.6% this year so far. We can become &quot;the Turkey of Europe&quot;. Turkey cold, or Turkey hot \u2013 on the borders of Iraqi Kurdistan and Syria? Turkey armed, with generals who need shuffling away to keep elected politicians safe from coups? Turkey looking to Brussels for a future \u2013 or Turkey rejected, beginning to swagger in the Middle East? Turkey, secular or Muslim? Somehow, put that way, the quest to be something else doesn&apos;t sound so alluring. We can all the play the transmogrification game: I sometimes think Britain would be best as the new Canada, with enough prosperity and shrunken profile to suit every taste. But the harsh truth in this zone of dreams is escapism, not remote reality. We can become the England of outer Europe if we want. We can stand alone, tall and proud \u2013 or shivering. But why, then, this pile of old Geneva, this load of Istanbul? We are what we are, no matter what we wish for. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2011.

The artist died on 30 December in a hospital near his home in southern France. &quot;[He] passed away peacefully in his sleep, with his children and grandson by his side,&quot; Searle&apos;s daughter Kate Searle told Reuters. Best known for his spiky comic drawings depicting the outrageous antics of the St Trinian&apos;s girls, and for his illustrations of the Molesworth series, written by Geoffrey Willans and which, as any fule kno, tells of life at the boys&apos; prep school St Custard&apos;s. Searle &quot;created an alternative to the conformity of Harold Macmillan&apos;s Britain&quot;, said his publisher Simon Winder. &quot;He gave Britain in the 1950s particularly a sense of anarchy. He was extraordinarily sceptical about all forms of authority [and] there&apos;s something just astonishingly anarchic about Molesworth and St Trinian&apos;s,&quot; said Winder. &quot;That&apos;s why they have appealed to so many generations.&quot; Searle began drawing at the age of five. Leaving school at 15, his talent was quickly spotted by the Cambridge Daily News where he worked as a cartoonist, also working for an earlier incarnation of Granta magazine and studying as an art scholar until the war intervened and he enlisted in the Royal Engineers. In 1942 he was captured by the Japanese in Singapore, spending the war as a prisoner at Changi and working on the infamous Burma railway. He recorded his time as a prisoner of war in drawings, preserving them at great risk. His first St Trinian&apos;s cartoon was also drawn in Changi. &quot;I desperately wanted to put down what was happening, because I thought if by any chance there was a record, even if I died, someone might find it and know what went on,&quot; Searle told the Guardian&apos;s cartoonist Steve Bell, who described the artist as &quot;our greatest living cartoonist, with a lifelong dedication to his craft unequalled by any of his contemporaries&quot;, in 2010. &quot;At times I was so ill that I couldn&apos;t draw at all. You&apos;re doing 16 hours a day rock breaking and you&apos;re exhausted. You come back and have a bowl of rice. You have no light, but you have fire, a big fire keeping the mountain lions away, and snakes perhaps, and by the light of the fire, I made the drawings. I didn&apos;t have a watch or anything, so you just lie down in the tent until you were dragged out the next morning to go back to the rock breaking. And so all these drawings, some of them very bad, were all I could do in a state of exhaustion.&quot; His return from the war saw Searle find success with his St Trinian&apos;s books, and with the Molesworth series. He moved to France in 1961, and in 2007 the country gave him its highest award, the Legion d&apos;Honneur. His most recent book, Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures de Mrs Mole, is a collection of the drawings he created for his wife each time she underwent chemotherapy for her breast cancer, &quot;to cheer every dreaded chemotherapy session and evoke the blissful future ahead&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/03/ronald-searle", "sentences": ["Before he left for second world war service, during which he would be held captive in Changi jail, Singapore, Searle posted off several cartoons to Kaye Webb, the assistant editor of Lilliput magazine.", "Searle thought no more about it until he picked up a tattered copy of Lilliput on a street in Singapore as the Japanese were invading and found his cartoon in it.", "Finally it became clear that they were bound for Singapore.", "They arrived just as General Yamashita&apos;s Japanese army came pouring down out of the Malayan jungle and across the straits to Singapore island."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-03T15:11:31Z", "title": "Ronald Searle obituary", "tags": ["Ronald Searle", "Books", "Newspapers", "Art", "Film", "Second world war", "Magazines", "Singapore", "France", "US news", "Le Monde"], "article": "The artist Ronald Searle, who has died aged 91, will always be associated with St Trinian&apos;s, the anarchic girls&apos; boarding school he created in pen and ink in the 1940s, which inspired a long-running series of films. Searle and St Trinian&apos;s go together like Petruchio and Kate; except that Searle created his own shrews and lived with their reputation for the rest of his life. Before he left for second world war service, during which he would be held captive in Changi jail, Singapore, Searle posted off several cartoons to Kaye Webb, the assistant editor of Lilliput magazine. One of them showed a group of schoolgirls clutching hockey sticks gathered around a noticeboard; the caption read: &quot;Owing to the international situation, the match with St Trinian&apos;s has been postponed.&quot; This is only obliquely about St Trinian&apos;s, but is always known as the first in the genre and has some of the characteristics of the mature version: flesh showing between the girls&apos; black stockings and tunic, specs, pigtails, pointy noses. Searle thought no more about it until he picked up a tattered copy of Lilliput on a street in Singapore as the Japanese were invading and found his cartoon in it. The first full-blown St Trinian&apos;s cartoon in Lilliput came after his release from Changi and was based on a real school (now defunct), St Trinnean&apos;s, in Edinburgh, which Searle had heard of when he was posted to Scotland during the phoney war. Much later, he turned down an invitation to stand for rector of Edinburgh University because, he said, he had done enough damage already to the city&apos;s academic reputation. Searle was born in Cambridge, the son of a railwayman. He left full-time education at Cambridge central school at the age of 14 and started work as an office boy with a firm of solicitors. Doodling on legal documents proved a retrograde career move; Searle was sacked, but his new job packing boxes at the Co-op brought a handsome advance in salary with which he was able to pay for evening classes at Cambridge School of Art. Later, he won a scholarship and became a full-time student. He was 15 when the cartoonist of what was then the Cambridge Daily News left for Fleet Street, and Searle immediately sent in some drawings on spec; the editor was taken with the boy&apos;s talent and took a cartoon a week from him at half a guinea a time. They were much better than the average evening newspaper cartoon, quite edgy about local politics and its pomposities, but there was nothing to suggest Searle&apos;s blazing graphic talent. In the April before the war broke out, Searle, who by now added commissions from the university magazine Granta to his growing experience, joined the Territorial Army. Called to the colours with the Royal Engineers on the outbreak of hostilities in 1939, he spent a relatively relaxed period in Norfolk as a camouflage artist and then Kirkcudbright before embarking on a troopship to an undisclosed destination. The voyage took the Engineers, including Sapper Searle, filling sketchpads all the way in an already totally mature graphic style, to ports of call in Cape Town, Mombasa and the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. Finally it became clear that they were bound for Singapore. They arrived just as General Yamashita&apos;s Japanese army came pouring down out of the Malayan jungle and across the straits to Singapore island. With calm obliviousness to his situation, Searle drew the new imperial conquerors even as they arrived in tanks, armoured trucks and cars, and on motorbikes and sidecars. It was the start of an astonishing enterprise. From Changi, Searle embarked with other PoWs on a forced march to work on the death railway in Siam (now Thailand). He suffered variously beri beri, dysentery, ulcerated skin, and repeated bouts of malaria not much helped by a Japanese guard who drove a nail attached to a pickaxe handle into his body. A fellow PoW, the Australian writer Russell Braddon, remarked that they would only have known that Searle was dead if he had stopped drawing. &quot;If you can imagine something that weighs six stone or so, is on the point of death and has no qualities of the human condition that are not revolting,&quot; Braddon wrote, &quot;calmly lying there with a pencil and a scrap of paper, drawing, you have some idea of the difference of temperament that this man had from the ordinary human being.&quot; The sketchbooks Searle brought home from Changi constitute a remarkable document of survival in the face of the grossest inhumanity and are probably the best visual record of war in the Imperial War Museum; they formed the basis for a book, To the Kwai and Back: War Drawings 1939-45 (1986). His mastery of the fine balance between description and expression was by now fully achieved. He had become, almost incidentally, one of the finest topographical artists of the century. If success seemed to come easily to him after his return to Britain, no one could begrudge it. Searle had drawn the second St Trinian&apos;s cartoon in Changi (&quot;Hands up the girl who burnt down the east wing last night&quot;); it was published in Lilliput in 1946 and established the school as a home of little monsters, wicked as sin. Webb was still at the magazine, and soon Searle and she married. St Trinian&apos;s became a national institution, to the point where Searle began to hate his creation. He said later that he had never drawn that many St Trinian&apos;s cartoons but that the impression was abroad that he did little else. In fact, after the popular success of the novel The Terror of St Trinian&apos;s (1952), Searle balked at producing another in the sequence and instead, with his friend Geoffrey Willans, a BBC journalist, he devised Nigel Molesworth, semi-literate antihero of Down With Skool (1953) and its sequels; the gentler humour (some said whimsical) seemed to suit Searle better and his public lapped it up. Other magazine work followed and Punch became his bread and butter; he repaid it well by helping to move the magazine on from the 19th century with covers of controlled extravagance, such as a clever birthday tribute to Picasso in October 1954. Then there were the Lemon Hart rum advertisements dominating the hoardings. Searle himself was on his way to becoming one of the first media stars, but success became cloying as he found himself being drawn into appearances on television shows such as This is Your Life, so he threw it all up and went to start again in France. The decision was moved along a bit by a chance meeting in Paris with a pretty divorcee, Monica Koenig, later the second Mrs Searle. This gave him the steel to leave Webb when she was away with the children one weekend. There was an angry divorce, in 1967, which probably confirmed Searle&apos;s decision to return to Britain only for visits to his ageing parents. In France he worked for Le Figaro Litt\u00e9raire, and there were constant commissions from the US, where the fine glossy magazine Holiday and Henry Luce&apos;s Life competed for his work. Life opened the way to reportage with commissions to illustrate the John F Kennedy 1960 presidential campaign and to cover the trial in 1961 in Israel of Hitler&apos;s henchman Adolf Eichmann. And then Searle accomplished a long-held ambition, to work for the New Yorker. Some of his fans saw a decline from now on, and it is true that there was a rococo prettiness about some of his work, though its manic qualities eschewed cosiness. He graduated in the 1960s from cartoons to colour covers such as the one of a man alone on a beach with his head buried in a newspaper as a sun rises, gorgeous as a Tiffany lamp; and there were his pet cats, as pampered, avaricious, ugly and dissatisfied as their owners. This work retained to a high degree a sense of poisonous unease which was his legacy from the war, and which he had felt in danger of losing at the Punch round table. In 2004 he was appointed CBE and in 2006 was made a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d&apos;honneur. Monica died in July 2011; he is survived by his son John and daughter Kate from his first marriage. Stephen Moss writes: In 2000, to mark his 80th birthday and a new Penguin anthology of his drawings, I visited Ronald Searle at his home in the gorgeous hill-top village of Tourtour in Provence. He hadn&apos;t been interviewed for years, and said most people in Britain thought he was dead or retired, even though he was still cartooning regularly for Le Monde. He disliked the insularity of Britain and rarely returned, but his house was full of carefully alphabetised videos of films and television programmes, as well as innumerable books his agent sent him, so I assumed he wanted reminders of home. We ended up conducting the interview over two extended lunches at a nearby Michelin-starred restaurant, which he adored and where his adoration was reciprocated. We were joined at lunch by his garrulous wife Monica and Eamonn McCabe, the Guardian photographer, who had come to do the portrait for the article. I ended up with almost seven hours of tape, though Monica did about 90% of the talking. The interview appeared in early December 2000, and a few weeks later a Christmas card arrived drawn by the great man, with Christmas and new year wishes in three languages inside, written in Searle&apos;s spidery script. He had added a PS: &quot;Since your article appeared, both our letterbox and fax have overfloweth with enthusiastic reactions.&quot; He was surprised to find how much he was still admired and loved. \u2022 Ronald William Fordham Searle, artist, born 3 March 1920; died 30 December 2011"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jan/03/prisoners-second-world-war-midge-gillies", "sentences": ["By 1945 scarcely 500 men of his original detachment of 3,270 captured in Singapore were still alive."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-03T23:00:01Z", "title": "How the R&A made its mark at Stalag Luft III | Frank Keating", "tags": ["Golf", "Second world war", "Books", "Cricket", "Glamorgan", "Sport"], "article": "The Christmas present book I am so far most enjoying is the fat 480-pager about the lives of incarcerated Allied prisoners of war between 1939 and 1945. Although I was scarcely a toddler when the war broke out, I am surprised to find that I grew up to work alongside a handful of those who figure in Midge Gillies&apos;s engaging The Barbed Wire University. It is a breezy, edifying history which knits together compelling tragi-comic tales of boredom, stoic ingenuity and sheer courage far beyond the conventional heroic goodie v baddie narratives of such as Colditz and The Great Escape. Veteran Guardian readers will relish the wartime exploits of both our former and fondly loved golf correspondent Pat Ward-Thomas and our distinguished foreign correspondent Terence Prittie. Two others with whom I was privileged often to share a press box \u2013 while never quite realising what a war they had endured \u2013 were EW &quot;Jim&quot; Swanton and Wales&apos;s luminous rugby-playing cricketer, Wilf Wooller. Ward-Thomas had baled out of his stricken Wellington bomber over the Netherlands in 1940 and ended up at Stalag Luft 111 at Sagan in Poland, where he filled his days by helping build an ingeniously difficult golf course around the camp&apos;s sandy scrubland where greens were &quot;browns&quot;, balls and clubs were homemade, and the longest hole only 90 yards long. Meanwhile Prittie, captured at Calais in 1940, was imprisoned at Oflag VIB in Warburg where (between his six escape attempts, I might add) he said he survived the whole war only by organising serious cricket matches \u2013 as he wrote from the camp to The Cricketer in January 1944. &quot;Cricket has been our chief compensation. Whatever we are missing we might, after all, be worse off, for with a cricket bat in his hands, the prisoner of war is rather nearer home than at any other moment of his existence.&quot; War over, and Neville Cardus still in Australia, Prittie contentedly covered cricket for two summers, eventually becoming our long serving and fabled Berlin correspondent. In the early 60s, as a raw sub-editor, I would handle his copy quite often from the desk in London: regularly we got to talk of cricket and I remember as if it was yesterday telling him of Brian Close&apos;s epic defiance in the Lord&apos;s Test of 1963 and delighting at hearing the contented cheers sea-shelling down the crackly telephone wire from Germany. The lives of those two singular and dogmatically opinionated coves, Swanton and Wooller, were defined by their incarceration. The latter had been the freewheeling star of rugby&apos;s Arms Park before the war and thereafter he at once refashioned Glamorgan cricket, indeed outrageously inspiring championship victory in 1948. In his wretched Japanese camp, Wooller played chess and darts and even helped organise the betting on frog races, but physical sport was questionable when prisoners were desperate on preserving some sort of fitness; in Wooller&apos;s case his weight dropped from 13\u00bd stone to under eight. By 1945 scarcely 500 men of his original detachment of 3,270 captured in Singapore were still alive. A feature of the ghastly life on the infamous Thailand-Burma railway line had been Swanton&apos;s public readings from his battered 1939 Wisden, which was bound in the camp with rice paste and sackcloth and stamped &quot;non-subversive&quot; in Japanese. Swanton had left for war a strapping a 15-stoner; on his return, on the platform at London&apos;s Waterloo station, his mother had walked right past her emaciated nine-stone son. Ward-Thomas had sent an article to Country Life about his ersatz Sagan golf course and at once the R&amp;A had dispatched from St Andrews some &quot;proper&quot; balls and, glory be, a gleaming new steel-shafted driver. Pat told me the full story only on his retirement 30 winters ago. &quot;Of course its use was forbidden at the camp,&quot; he said. &quot;Would it have set off alarm bells all over the place? But every day I used to feel it lovingly, so longingly. In the end I could resist no longer. The chance came one bitter winter day when everyone was inside and the camp deserted. I took the club and a real golf ball to a distant corner and, almost trembling with anticipation, I teed off. By golly \u2013 I made perfect contact and the ball soared away out of sight and far over the kitchens&apos; building. &quot;And then I heard at last the crash of broken glass far away and imagined startled people flinging themselves to the floor in the winter silence, thinking a bullet was responsible ... I felt ashamed, but immensely exhilarated as well. It was the first and last golf ball ever to be hit with a real driver at Sagan.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/06/2012-olympics-britain-party", "sentences": ["&quot;We remain 150% true to the vision Seb [Coe] outlined in Singapore in 2005."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-06T18:10:12Z", "title": "Banging Olympic drum for Britain to cost \u00a339m but 'it's not a party'", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Jeremy Hunt", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The government has insisted its increasing determination to invest in making the 2012 Olympics a large-scale advert for Britain has not diminished its desire to honour the legacy promises that secured them. Announcing a \u00a339m promotional campaign designed to capitalise on London 2012, the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the so-called &quot;Great&quot; marketing push and the decision to double the ceremonies budget to \u00a381m would guarantee the Games showcased the country&apos;s strengths in business, tourism and education. Hunt promised the opening ceremony would be &quot;mind-blowing&quot; but said that there was no move to distance the government from the wide-ranging legacy promises that secured the Games in favour of a month-long advert for the nation. &quot;This is not spending money on a party. This is investing in Britain&apos;s future,&quot; he said. &quot;Future generations would never forgive us if we didn&apos;t grasp the opportunity of hosting the Olympics to create jobs for British businesses.&quot; The government has faced criticism for cutting the ringfenced national budget for school sport by half and abandoning an inherited target to increase the number of people playing regular sport by one million by 2013. Hunt is expected to announce new policies designed to address those issues next week. &quot;We remain 150% true to the vision Seb [Coe] outlined in Singapore in 2005. We remain totally committed to that,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a difficult period in terms of public spending. I think we&apos;ve got a very good plan in place that will convince the sceptics we can deliver on a fantastic sporting legacy as well as a fantastic economic legacy.&quot; Hunt has replaced all the art in his office with 2012 prints \u2013 Tracey Emin&apos;s being his favourite. But he will see little of it in the coming months, as he joins leading British figures \u2013 including Sir Richard Branson, Vivienne Westwood, Paul Smith and Denise Lewis \u2013 on a world tour of 17 cities in Brazil, China, the US, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, India and Canada to &quot;bang the drum&quot; and promote British interests. &quot;This is the government completely ignoring all the siren voices that say in times of austerity we should be cutting back on promotion,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;We&apos;re not staying in the middle ground, we&apos;re doing the opposite of what those siren voices are saying. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to promote the UK. Sport has a reach nothing else can match. We know around half the world&apos;s population will watch the Olympics live at some stage. That&apos;s something nothing else can compete with.&quot; The campaign will target cities selected to give &quot;most bang for our buck&quot; with a marketing blitz, including a projection on Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, magazine adverts designed to reach two million Parisians and a tie-up with India Today at an economic summit in Delhi. Hunt claimed a campaign at 13 airports will reach 47 million\u00a0travellers. &quot;We have to be prepared that there might be some sniping and unpopularity in investing in banging the drum for Britain when times are tough but what people want is a government that will get the country back on its feet,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;If you don&apos;t grasp an opportunity like this I really think you&apos;ll be betraying a generation. &quot;My right arm is going to be so sore from waving the flag it&apos;s going to fall off by 9 September [the Paralympics closing ceremony]. People know Britain is an extraordinary country but we do sometimes have an innate modesty. If there&apos;s one time you should cast that aside it&apos;s when you&apos;re hosting the Olympics.&quot; The government is targeting an additional \u00a31bn of investment and trade, an additional \u00a32.5bn in tourist spend and 4.5 million more visitors over the next four years. That will be a huge challenge, given that previous Games have tended to depress tourism numbers. Hunt also defended the decision to hand Locog an extra \u00a341m from the public funding package to double the budget of the opening and closing ceremonies. &quot;We went through a very detailed process,&quot; he said. &quot;Danny Boyle is one of our most talented creative geniuses. He came up with these proposals and we went through them in enormous detail. We couldn&apos;t do everything Danny wanted but we wanted to stay true to his creative vision, which is extraordinary. &quot;We were very impressed with what we saw and in the end we were never in any doubt we wanted a totally mind-blowing opening ceremony.&quot; Hunt said he remained confident that the \u00a39.3bn budget would be sufficient, despite the National Audit Office having warned that there was a &quot;real risk&quot; it would be breached, but admitted there was little margin for error. &quot;I&apos;m as confident as I can be. You never know what is around the corner, but we have managed the budget in a very rigorous way. All the risks going forward are quantified. If you look at the figures in a reasonable way, you&apos;d say we should be all right. There isn&apos;t a huge amount of room for manoeuvre but if we continue to bear down on costs we should be able to deliver.&quot; He said Olympic sceptics would be forced to re-examine their attitudes by the time of the opening ceremony on 27 July. &quot;I&apos;m continually surprised by how few naysayers there are. I was expecting there to be a much higher volume. If you look at the runup to Sydney and Vancouver, there were many, many more sceptics than there have been in the UK. &quot;Locog has done a superb job in helping get the public fully behind the Games. There will always be a few sceptics but the closer we get the more they are starting to realise that this is going to be an extraordinary moment and they will feel perhaps just a tinge of being a party pooper.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/06/china-barack-obama-defence-strategy", "sentences": ["Fears about the implications of China&apos;s rise are producing a similar circling of the wagons in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, notwithstanding their close trading relationships with Beijing."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-06T18:54:35Z", "title": "China syndrome dictates Barack Obama's Asia-Pacific strategy | Simon Tisdall", "tags": ["China", "Barack Obama", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US military", "US politics", "Asia Pacific", "Afghanistan", "Iraq", "Middle East and North Africa", "North Korea", "India", "Japan", "Eurozone crisis", "Africa", "William Hague", "Taiwan", "Vietnam", "George Bush", "Aung San Suu Kyi", "South Korea", "Singapore", "Malaysia", "Australia news", "Pakistan", "Sri Lanka", "Tanzania", "Syria", "Iran", "Sudan", "Myanmar"], "article": "Barack Obama made a special trip to the Pentagon this week to unveil America&apos;s post-Iraq, post-Afghanistan defence strategy. But amid all the president&apos;s talk about a leaner American military, evolving challenges of the new century, and shifting priorities after a decade of warfare, one particular word was nowhere to be heard: China. The omission is understandable, but misleading. As a politician running for re-election as a peacemaker, Obama has no wish to conjure the spectre of a new cold war with the only serious challenger to America as number one global superpower. But as his recent Asian tour made clear, Obama \u2013 born in Hawaii \u2013 is determined to beat back any Chinese bid for hegemony in Asia-Pacific. The focus of the strategy is concentrated on this cockpit region. As chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey likewise has no interest in starting a fight with Beijing so soon after extricating US forces from Baghdad. But Dempsey knows China&apos;s defence spending is growing each year. As the strategy document urges, this growth &quot;must be accompanied by greater clarity [about] strategic intentions in order to avoid causing friction in the region&quot;. Dempsey sees how China&apos;s submarines and missile platforms, soon to be backed up by an aircraft carrier taskforce, are projecting naval power into regions where the US has dominated since 1945. In short, he can read the writing on the Chinese wall and understands that one day, however reluctantly, the US military may be obliged to overtly confront China just as it faced down the old Soviet Union. &quot;The strategy talks about a shift to the future,&quot; Dempsey said, standing alongside Obama at the Pentagon. &quot;And all of the trends, demographic trends, geopolitical trends, economic trends and military trends are shifting toward the Pacific. So our strategic challenges will largely emanate out of the Pacific region, but also the littorals of the Indian Ocean.&quot; Still no specific mention of China. But there was no doubting who and what Dempsey was talking about. And in case anybody missed the point, the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, drove it home with due deference to both sides&apos; political sensibilities. &quot;This region is growing in importance to the future of the US economy and our national security. This means, for instance, improving capabilities that maintain our military&apos;s technological edge and freedom of action,&quot; he said. Beijing has yet to give a direct response. But the Global Times, an offshoot of the Communist party&apos;s People&apos;s Daily, swiftly made it clear China would be ready to match the US step for step, wherever that uncharted path might lead. &quot;Of course we want to prevent a new cold war with the United States, but at the same time, we must avoid giving up China&apos;s security presence in the neighbouring region,&quot; it said in an editorial. The Xinhua news agency warned that increased US engagement could boost stability but warned American militarism might &quot;endanger peace&quot;. The parameters of the coming 21st century US-China contest are already fairly clear. In purely physical terms, they include obvious potential flashpoints such as Taiwan, last resting place of the defeated nationalist Kuomintang. Beijing regards Taiwan as a &quot;renegade province&quot;. Although bilateral relations have improved of late, itChina still menaces Taipei across the Taiwan strait with hundreds of land-based missiles. As de facto guarantor of Taiwan&apos;s security and chief arms supplier, the US is caught in a frozen conflict that could catch fire at any time. China&apos;s pursuit of territorial and resource claims in disputed archipelagos across the East and South China seas provide other flashpoints, not just with the US but with neighbours such as Vietnam, which have been tightening security ties with Washington. Fears about the implications of China&apos;s rise are producing a similar circling of the wagons in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, notwithstanding their close trading relationships with Beijing. During his Asian tour, Obama signalled the opening of a military base in Darwin and possibly one in the Philippines. Ballistic missile defence co-operation with Tokyo is well advanced, although this has more to do with North Korea than China. Amid overall global troop cuts, the US military presence in South Korea and Japan will be maintained. Safeguarding international sea lanes is a key priority. The US-China standoff has numerous other potential and actual aspects. In geo-strategic terms, Washington&apos;s desire to manage if not contain China&apos;s ambitions lies behind the rapprochement with India begun by the Bush administration. China&apos;s efforts to expand its presence in the Indian Ocean, through trade, aid and investment deals with Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania, to name three, are seen in Delhi as the south Asian equivalent of America&apos;s perceived &quot;encirclement&quot; of China. The US took on China at its own game in Burma, expanding diplomatic relations with an unpleasant regime to counter Beijing&apos;s position as a key ally. The desire to support democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is genuine. But calculated self-interest was at work, too. Perhaps somebody should tell William Hague. On a bigger scale again, a battle for raw materials, economic resources, political influence and military footholds is under way in sub-Saharan Africa, where China has placed commercial advantage ahead of governance and human rights concerns, and increasingly in Latin America. US behaviour is not exemplary, either. It talks a lot about democracy but its chief concern, especially in the Maghreb and Sahel regions, is security and terrorism, hence the recent creation of the Pentagon&apos;s Africa Command. China also presents a growing diplomatic and political challenge, whether it be through its protection of North Korea or its reluctance to support action against problematic regimes such as Syria, Iran and, arguably, Sudan. China&apos;s failure to act responsibly as a &quot;good citizen&quot; on the world stage, as American critics see it, is mirrored economically by its policy of maintaining an artificially under-valued currency to boost its exports, and its reluctance to help bail out stricken eurozone economies in the absence of specific rewards. The fact that it is by far the biggest holder of American government debt is a two-edged sword \u2013 but undoubtedly places Washington at a potential disadvantage. A 21st century US-China cold war is not an inevitability. It&apos;s possible the relationship can be managed to the benefit of both sides, given goodwill, good leadership and good luck. But fundamental ideological differences about democracy, openness, values, and religious belief, compounding political and economic rivalries, may ultimately confound efforts to work together. Historically, China is behaving just like any other up and coming great power, just like Britain in the 19th century and the US in the 20th: confident, brash and convinced of its own superiority. Obama&apos;s defence strategy hopes for the best \u2013 and prepares for the worst."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/06/jon-huntsman-criticises-adopted-daughters-ad", "sentences": ["The newspaper described the former US ambassador to China and Singapore as &quot;a genuine conservative&quot; and praised the amount of time Huntsman has spent in New Hampshire."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-06T20:35:00Z", "title": "Jon Huntsman denounces ad showcasing his adopted daughters", "tags": ["Republican presidential nomination 2012", "US news", "Jon Huntsman", "US elections 2012", "New Hampshire", "Ron Paul", "US politics"], "article": "Jon Huntsman has criticised a video, apparently released by a supporter of Ron Paul, which uses footage of Huntsman&apos;s adopted daughters to question his &quot;American values&quot;.

I speak Chinese, of course I do. If someone wants to poke fun of me for speaking Chinese, that&apos;s okay,&quot; Huntsman said. &quot;The thing I object to is bringing forward pictures and videos of my adopted daughters and suggesting that there is some sinister motive there. I have a daughter from China who was abandoned at two months of age and left in a vegetable market, picked up by the police and sent to an orphanage.&quot; The video, entitled &quot;Jon Huntsman&apos;s Values&quot;, was uploaded to YouTube on Thursday. It intersperses clips of Huntsman speaking Chinese with images of him with his daughter Gracie Mei, who he adopted from a Chinese orphanage in 1999. The footage is set to east Asian music, and describes Huntsman as &quot;the Manchurian candidate&quot;. In the novel and film of the same name, the son of a prominent US political family is brainwashed into being an assassin for China&apos;s Communist Party. &quot;Weak on China? Wonder why?&quot; the video asks, before showing a clip of Huntsman with Gracie Mei. His daughter Asha Bharati, adopted from India in 2009, is also shown. NHLiberty4Paul did not immediately respond to the Guardian&apos;s questions on YouTube, but reportedly responded to a Huffington Post query: &quot;Sorry, campaign has asked me not to speak to reporters.&quot; Paul&apos;s spokeswoman for New Hampshire, Kate Schackai, told the Washington Post she didn&apos;t know who was responsible for the footage, but said it was not connected to Paul&apos;s campaign. &quot;The video was utterly distasteful and no one who actually supports Dr Paul&apos;s principles would have made it,&quot; she said. Huntsman, who also served as governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009, has seven children, two of whom are adopted. &quot;I have a second daughter who was born in India in a very rural village ... and left for dead the day she was born,&quot; he said in Concord. &quot;And luckily she was picked up before the animals got her, and she was sent to an orphanage for her safety, was raised and now she is in my family. So I have two little girls who are a daily reminder that there are a lot of kids in this world who don&apos;t have the breaks that you do and face a very uncertain future ... and now these two girls are on the presidential campaign trail. I say, how cool is that?&quot; It is not the first time a candidate&apos;s adopted children have become an issue in the race for the Republican candidacy. In 2000 Senator John McCain, whose adopted daughter, Bridget, is originally from Bangladesh, found himself the subject of a whisper campaign implying he had fathered a black child outside his marriage. Radio stations in South Carolina were inundated with phone calls asking talk show hosts what they thought of McCain having fathered an illegitimate child.McCain lost in South Carolina and eventually lost the Republican nomination to George W Bush. In 2010 Bush&apos;s long-time political adviser Karl Rove denied leading the &quot;whisper campaign&quot; against McCain.  The furore over the video threatened to detract from Huntsman receiving the backing of the Boston Globe on Friday. The newspaper described the former US ambassador to China and Singapore as &quot;a genuine conservative&quot; and praised the amount of time Huntsman has spent in New Hampshire. &quot;With a strong record as governor of Utah and US ambassador to China, arguably the most important overseas diplomatic post, Huntsman&apos;s credentials match those of anyone in the field,&quot; the Globe&apos;s editorial said. &quot;He would be the best candidate to seize this moment in GOP history, and the best-prepared to be president.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/08/financial-crisis-capital-flow", "sentences": ["The World Trade Organisation summit in Canc\u00fan in 2003, part of the now dormant Doha round, collapsed because the rich world insisted that the so-called Singapore issues, which included removing restrictions on foreign investment, must be part of any bargain."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-08T00:01:08Z", "title": "Financial crisis could turn the tide against unrestricted capital flows", "tags": ["Global economy", "Currencies", "Banking", "Bank of England", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Economics", "Economic policy", "Business"], "article": "Watching as the Spanish government announced drastic new austerity measures, you could have been forgiven for thinking that neoliberal orthodoxy holds sway almost as decisively as when Alan Greenspan was the maestro of the Federal Reserve. But away from Brussels, one element at least of the neoliberal canon \u2013 the idea that capital must be allowed to flow unchecked around the world \u2013 is coming under sustained attack. The theory says that free capital flows allow savings to be directed \u2013 by the invisible hand of the financial markets \u2013 to wherever they will be most profitably employed. In this way, savers get a better return on their nest egg, while underdeveloped economies receive the financial leg-up they need. And as firms from one country take over those of another, they bring much-needed expertise as well as help new ideas to be adopted rapidly worldwide. Except that isn&apos;t what&apos;s been happening: instead, for the past decade and more, savings have been pouring uphill from poor countries to rich. Whether you call it a savings glut or a borrowing binge (two sides of the same coin), it has led to a flood of money sluicing through financial markets, looking for a home. And far from nurturing development and improving the standard of living of the poorest, these vast flows of money have created a repeated pattern of boom, bust and financial crisis. When the climate is &quot;risk on&quot;, as they say in Wall Street and Canary Wharf, capital rains down on the fashionable economies of the moment. But a change in mood \u2013 or an increase in interest rates in Washington, say \u2013 can, like the proverbial flap of a distant butterfly wing, unleash an economic storm as capital floods back out again. A recent paper by thinktank the Bretton Woods Project, Time for a New Consensus, enumerates five major threats of unregulated capital flows. There is currency risk, because large inflows can push up a country&apos;s exchange rate (you need to buy Turkish lira if you want to buy a firm in Istanbul). An overvalued currency undermines domestic exporters and leaves them unable to compete. There is flight risk, because funds often leave as rapidly as they arrive, pulling the rug out from under local businesses and stunting economic growth. Contagion risk is the threat that close financial links between economies means a shock in one can drag everyone down \u2013 as shown by the devastating knock-on effects of the US sub-prime crisis over the past four years. Fragility risk occurs when an economy becomes heavily dependent on borrowing from overseas, often in foreign currencies. Hungarian households took out mortgages in euros in the runup to the credit crisis, for example, as their country prepared to join the single currency. That meant the sharp decline in the forint took a severe economic and social toll when the crisis hit, as the loans spiralled in value relative to homeowners&apos; wages. Finally, sovereignty risk, chillingly familiar to a string of crisis-hit countries across the world in the past two decades, is the threat that instead of overseas investment giving governments the resources they need to improve the livelihoods of their population, politicians are left with little or no control over their own economies. Increasing domestic interest rates to control an unsustainable boom has little impact if cut-price capital keeps flooding in. Not surprisingly, large developing countries have long been suspicious of the west&apos;s insistence that its banks and corporations must be allowed to bestride the world, unrestrained by government interference. The World Trade Organisation summit in Canc\u00fan in 2003, part of the now dormant Doha round, collapsed because the rich world insisted that the so-called Singapore issues, which included removing restrictions on foreign investment, must be part of any bargain. Developing countries objected so vehemently they walked out. Since the onset of the credit crunch in 2007, those countries \u2013 including China and India \u2013 that have kept tight control over financial inflows have fared better than those that have thrown open their borders. And in recent years, several countries have quietly begun erecting breakwaters against the latest tidal wave of capital, driven by low interest rates in the west. Brazil, Argentina and Costa Rica have used various measures, including taxes on purchases of shares and bonds and insisting that short-term investors deposit funds with the central bank for a year, to dampen the stop-go cycle. It doesn&apos;t mean no investment; just trying to discriminate between long-term capital that will help to deliver jobs and sustainable growth and the short-term whims of the herd. The International Monetary Fund responded to growing pressure for a rethink last year and issued two papers acknowledging that regulations on capital flows could be useful. But it suggested their use should be restricted to crises and governed by a strict code of conduct. That idea was rejected by emerging economies, which are wielding growing influence at the Washington-based lender. The G20, a forum in which China, India and Brazil have a strong voice, issued its own far more radical study in October. The tide is turning. One unlikely recent champion of the reintroduction of regulations on capital flows is the Bank of England. The shock of being caught unawares by the vulnerability of the UK&apos;s financial system in 2007 and 2008 caused soul-searching in Threadneedle Street, and recent papers and speeches have helped build the case for new thinking. Two research studies in particular, released last month, suggested cross-border flows of capital will increase radically in the coming years as developing countries grow in size; that the UK will be particularly vulnerable to future sudden reversals in these flows, because of its vast external balance sheet; and that the international community should consider drawing up a set of rules governing how and when countries can act to protect themselves. If there&apos;s one thing policymakers should have learned over the past four years, it&apos;s that financial markets can&apos;t be left to run the world themselves."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/08/qpr-neil-warnock", "sentences": ["With Kia Joorabchian, Hughes&apos;s representative, returning from Brazil on Monday and Fernandes in Singapore, the midweek board meeting may be when the Welshman is handed the challenge of maintaining QPR&apos;s status."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-09T00:32:00Z", "title": "QPR's sacking of Neil Warnock had been increasingly on the cards", "tags": ["QPR", "Neil Warnock", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "After Neil Warnock watched Queens Park Rangers steal a draw at MK\u00a0Dons in the FA\u00a0Cup on Saturday his relaxed demeanour was initially surprising. His dismissal, announced yesterday, may explain it. Sources at the club have suggested the 63-year-old was thinking of retiring at the end of the season anyway. If this was the case, it was bound to compound the QPR board&apos;s two main concerns: the side&apos;s relegation form of two points from the last eight Premier League outings and, related to it, investment from a sizeable war chest by a man shortly to leave. With QPR &quot;willing to go for it&quot;, according to one club insider, there were serious reservations regarding Warnock&apos;s ability to attract the calibre of player required to lift the club from 17th and stay away from danger. This is why Tony Fernandes, the owner, showed his ruthless streak on Sunday. With Mark Hughes, his favoured replacement, available and interested, Fernandes decided he had witnessed enough drift. The Malaysian was at stadium:mk on Saturday to see another disjointed display that required a late Heidar Helguson equaliser to avert a spirit\u2011sapping defeat to a League One club. This came after, on Friday, Fernandes tweeting pointedly &quot;it is important to note no one&apos;s job is safe&quot;. Yet when asked on Saturday evening if his chairman&apos;s outburst concerned him, Warnock&apos;s blas\u00e9 response was: &quot;I know what Tony is like. It would be something out of nothing. Everybody tweets him. Joe Bloggs off the corner-shop and everybody else tweets him and he replies to everybody. I&apos;m concentrating on trying to get players in and he&apos;s very supportive. I can only tell you he&apos;s been 100% supportive.&quot; Warnock had been much the same following the 2-1 defeat by Norwich City at Loftus Road last Monday. Lost in the uproar over Joey Barton&apos;s red card for moving his head towards Norwich&apos;s Bradley Johnson was the fact that QPR had been defeated again. The last time QPR won was on 19\u00a0November when Stoke City were beaten 3-2, a dire record observed by Fernandes and Amit Bhatia, the vice\u2011chairman, as they plotted their winter transfer window strategy. While Warnock&apos;s outrage at Barton&apos;s sending off was understandable, when quizzed about the defeat by Norwich he fell back on the old managerial standby of bad luck and other dodgy refereeing decisions he believed have peppered their season. Then he spent the rest of the week railing at the match officials and the Football Association when his captain&apos;s red card was not rescinded. Here was a deepening sense of a manager losing his focus and forgetting the only real measure of his stock: results. On Thursday, before the trip to Milton Keynes, Warnock failed to send the correct message to his players, again pointing his energies at the failed appeal against Barton&apos;s red card describing the FA&apos;s decision as &quot;scandalous&quot;. He may well have had a point, but Warnock was missing the main one: the need to inform his players in strident terms of the requirement to return to winning ways at MK Dons ahead of league outings against Newcastle United and Wigan Athletic. Regarding the board&apos;s concerns over Warnock&apos;s recruitment policy a glance at his business in the last window suggests their genesis. Joey Barton is the headline case: he may be the captain and the club&apos;s highest earner but the scouser has yet to win a game for QPR and his preoccupation with Twitter should have become an embarrassment to him when the team&apos;s results started going south. Of the rest of Warnock&apos;s summer shopping spree, Kieron Dyer is injured (yet again), Shaun Wright-Phillips is inconsistent, Jay Bothoyd overtaken by the 33-year-old Helguson, Danny Gabbidon sluggish, DJ\u00a0Campbell unconvincing and Armand Traor\u00e9 has faded, while Anton Ferdinand is steady enough and Bruno Perone and Brian Murphy have madetwo appearances between them. Warnock also said on Saturday: &quot;This next seven days are vital because we need two or three players in by the Newcastle game. I spoke to Tony and the rest of the owners six or seven weeks ago and told them exactly why we needed players and where we needed them. Our main aim is to stay up, and &quot; Except that now Warnock will not pilot this drive for survival. With Kia Joorabchian, Hughes&apos;s representative, returning from Brazil on Monday and Fernandes in Singapore, the midweek board meeting may be when the Welshman is handed the challenge of maintaining QPR&apos;s status."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/09/anwar-ibrahim-sodomy-dismissed-malaysian", "sentences": ["But for a coalition that has long considered itself &quot;martyred&quot; by Malaysian politics, the true test will be its ability to create a viable alternative for the future, says Bridget Welsh, Malaysia specialist at Singapore Management University."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-09T09:27:00Z", "title": "Anwar Ibrahim sodomy charge dismissed by Malaysian judge", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Human rights", "Law", "Anwar Ibrahim"], "article": "     A Malaysian court has acquitted the country&apos;s opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, of sodomy charges in a shock ruling that could fast-forward the former deputy prime minister&apos;s political comeback ahead of an expected election this year. Anwar, 64, was charged in 2008 with having sex with a male former aide, and could have faced whipping and up to 20 years in jail if found guilty. Under Malaysian law sex between males is a punishable offence even if consensual. The case rested primarily on testimony by Anwar&apos;s 26-year-old accuser, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, as well as semen samples found on Saiful&apos;s body that investigators said matched Anwar&apos;s DNA. Defence lawyers contended that Saiful&apos;s testimony about the alleged sodomy, at a Kuala Lumpur apartment in 2008, was riddled with inconsistencies and the DNA evidence mishandled by investigators. In his ruling, judge Mohamad Zabidin Diah expressed concern that the submitted evidence was tainted and told a packed Kuala Lumpur courtroom: &quot;The court at this stage could not with 100% certainty exclude the possibility that the [DNA] sample is not compromised. Therefore it is not safe to rely on the sample. &quot;There is no evidence to corroborate&quot; the charge, he added. As his family burst into tears at the verdict, a jubilant Anwar greeted reporters. &quot;Thank God justice has prevailed,&quot; Anwar said. &quot;I have been vindicated. To be honest I am a little surprised.&quot; Some 5,000 opposition supporters had gathered outside the court chanting &quot;reform&quot; as a police helicopter flew overhead and riot police, backed by a truck mounted with a water cannon, watched the crowd. Three explosions were reported outside the courthouse, with a preliminary investigation finding two explosive devices underneath police cones. Two people were injured and taken to hospital, but it is unclear who was responsible. Monday&apos;s judgment is seen as a positive step forward for Malaysia&apos;s judicial system and could have a major impact on upcoming general elections, which the prime minister, Najib Razak, is widely expected to call this year. Najib hopes to regain a strong mandate after suffering in recent popularity polls and has promised economic and civil liberty reforms. Anwar and his supporters long contested the sodomy allegations as a government plot to weaken his three-party coalition. The charges emerged after the coalition made unprecedented gains in the 2008 general elections against the ruling National Front alliance, which has ruled Malaysia for more than 50 years. The opposition controls more than one-third of parliament&apos;s seats and analysts say that Anwar, who has pledged to scale back Malaysia&apos;s most draconian laws and reunify the racially divided nation if elected, could potentially knock out the incumbent government entirely. This trial was the second time in 14 years that Anwar has faced the courts. Anwar served as both deputy prime minister and finance minister in the incumbent Umno party before falling out with his then premier, Mahathir Mohamad, in 1998. He was then jailed for six years on sodomy and corruption charges in what was widely seen as a politically motivated prosecution. The sodomy charged was overturned in 2004. Anwar has since become the glue binding together the three very ideologically different parties in his opposition alliance, which includes Islamists and an ethnic Chinese party. But for a coalition that has long considered itself &quot;martyred&quot; by Malaysian politics, the true test will be its ability to create a viable alternative for the future, says Bridget Welsh, Malaysia specialist at Singapore Management University. &quot;Charges against opposition figures don&apos;t really help Malaysia. This [verdict] gives Malaysia an opportunity to move out of dirty politics - for the [National Front] to get out of gutter politics, and for the opposition to\u00a0\u2026 move on and change its tactic from being the &apos;martyr&apos; and &apos;target&apos; to one that promotes a positive alternative for voters,&quot; she said. In a statement released after the verdict, the government said Monday&apos;s ruling proved that &quot;Malaysia has an independent judiciary and this verdict proves that the government does not hold sway over judges&apos; decisions. The current wave of bold democratic reforms introduced by [Najib] will help extend this transparency to all areas of Malaysian life.&quot; Such reforms, coupled with Monday&apos;s acquittal, could be seen by voters as positive steps and translate into votes for the National Front in the upcoming elections, said Malaysian political analyst Ong Kian Ming. &quot;Had [Anwar] been convicted, he could have garnered more public sympathy that now won&apos;t be as strong. [PM] Najib can now try to capitalise on this by continuing on with his political reforms, saying that the judiciary system is free and fair, and \u2026 gaining some momentum by leading up to the next election.&quot; Anwar&apos;s accuser Saiful, who did not attend the hearing, wrote on Twitter after the verdict that he would &quot;remain calm, continue praying and be patient&quot;.

Timeline 1993: Anwar Ibrahim, then 46, becomes deputy to premier Mahathir Mohamad. They have a very close working relationship and Anwar is seen as the heir apparent. 1998: Despite being named Asian of the year by Newsweek, Anwar sacked after falling out with Mahathir over calls for reform and an end to cronyism. He is soon charged with corruption and sodomy (the latter based on accusations by his family&apos;s former driver), charges he dismisses as politically motivated. 1999: Jailed for six years for corruption. 2000: Nine year sentence for sodomy. 2004: Anwar freed after Malaysia&apos;s top court overturns his sodomy conviction. 8 March 2008: Anwar leads an opposition coalition to wrest a third of parliament&apos;s seats and five states from the incumbent National Front coalition, which has ruled Malaysia since it became independent from Britain in 1957. 14 April 2008: A ban against Anwar holding public office, related to his corruption conviction, expires. 29 June 2008: His former aide, Mohd Saiful Bukhari Azlan, then 23, files a police report accusing him of sodomy in a Kuala Lumpur condo. Anwar denies the charges. 31 July 2008: Anwar&apos;s wife resigns her parliamentary seat in Penang, her husband&apos;s home state, to allow Anwar to contest the byelection. 7 August 2008: Anwar is charged with sodomy. 26 August 2008: Anwar wins a landslide victory in the Penang byelection, is sworn into parliament and declared leader of the opposition. 1 February 2010: Second sodomy trial begins. 9 July 2011: Anwar is injured at a rally calling for clean and fair elections after police fire water cannon and teargas at protesters. 10 July 2011: He warns PM Najib Razak&apos;s government that a &quot;hibiscus revolution&quot; may soon occur unless protesters&apos; demands for electoral reform and an &quot;end to dirty politics&quot; are met. 22 August 2011: In a statement to the high court in Kuala Lumpur, Anwar calls the sodomy charge against him &quot;a vile and desperate attempt at character assassination&quot;. 3-8 January 2012: Anwar embarks on a national tour, rallying support before the verdict. 9 January 2012: Anwar is acquitted of sodomy charges.

Attempts to use the Games as a driver to inspire more people to play sport and exercise more have come in for widespread criticism, as have recent cuts to the national school sport budget. The Guardian revealed last year that the government planned to drop an inherited target to use the &quot;inspirational power&quot; of the looming Games to get 1m people playing more sport. The government was also forced into a partial U-turn in its plans to axe the \u00a3162m ring-fenced national budget for school sport after an outcry but has restored only around half the funding as part of a revamped School Games strategy. Hunt said he had been working with Sport England, the funding body for grassroots sport that was able to deliver only an increase of 111,800 against the 1m target, for six months on a new strategy that would focus resources more effectively and halt a slide in young people playing sport. &quot;If we were going to do the blame game, I would say we didn&apos;t inherit any realistic possibility of delivering that target,&quot; Hunt told the Guardian. The new scheme will concentrate the \u00a3450m invested through national governing bodies in the four years from 2013 on youth sport. Of that investment 60% will be targeted at young people from 14 to 25. But overall national targets will be dropped. &quot;We&apos;re going to put in some very wriggle room-free measures. Our definition of sport as a habit for life is someone who plays sport once a week at 16, 18 and 24,&quot; said Hunt. The strategy will see new school-based sports clubs established, with links to one or more sports&apos; national governing bodies. There will be additional investment to open up school facilities to the community. Coaches will run sessions designed to build links between schools and local sports clubs already in existence in their area. Football has pledged that 2,000 of their clubs will be linked to secondary schools by 2017, rugby union 1,300 clubs, cricket 1,250 clubs and rugby league and tennis 1,000 clubs each. Hunt said he trusted the governing bodies to deliver even though 17 sports have recorded a decline in the number of people playing once a week since 2007\u201108 and only four \u2013 mountaineering, athletics, netball and table tennis \u2013 have recorded a statistically significant increase. &quot;They want to do more. They are really interested in youth sport participation. They feel much more confident they can deliver for us.&quot; However, Hunt said the government and Sport England would be far tougher on sports that failed to deliver against agreed targets, using the &quot;no compromise&quot; creed adopted by UK Sport in elite Olympic sport. &quot;This is payment by results. If they don&apos;t deliver, the money gets taken away and given to someone else \u2013 local sports groups, sports charities. We want the NGBs to be in the driving seat but they have to step up to the plate. &quot;The thing that people have always talked about being the big missing piece of the jigsaw is how you address the drop-off rate, the fact a third fewer people play sport after their 16th birthday.&quot; He denied that the plan effectively abandoned the aim of getting older\u00a0adults to play more sport. &quot;We don&apos;t want\u00a0to stop them where there are good\u00a0programmes.&quot; Hunt said the new strategy was a &quot;radical change in policy&quot; and that local authority cuts to sports facilities in the face of severe funding cuts would not impact on his ability to deliver. &quot;My impression is that leisure centres are not closing up and down the land and local authorities are finding ways, despite their 28% cut in funding, to keep them open\u00a0because they recognise how important they are.&quot; A key part of the legacy vision espoused by Lord Coe that helped to win the Games was the promise to use the 2012 Olympics to inspire more young people to play sport. &quot;London&apos;s vision is to reach young people around the world. To connect them with the inspirational power of the Games. So they are inspired to choose sport,&quot; he said in his 2005 Singapore speech. The culture secretary, who on Monday attended a cabinet meeting at the Olympic Park, also denied that the focus on youth sport for those as young as 14 was an attempt to fill the hole created when the education secretary, Michael Gove, resolved to cut the budget for national school sport. &quot;We would want to do this completely regardless of what was happening with the school sport budget. This was the right thing to do,&quot; he said. He said the School Games project, a series of inter- and intra-school competitions that climax in events on the Olympic Park, had reached just over half of all schools. &quot;There were lots of excellent schools sports partnerships but despite that huge investment, youth participation among those who had left school fell over the same period. It just isn&apos;t right to say everything was rosy in the garden. There were some very serious structural problems we had to face. We want to develop a sports-mad culture in schools driven by heads who understand the power of sport.&quot; At the weekend, the shadow Olympics secretary, Tessa Jowell, said it was &quot;incomprehensible&quot; to &quot;dismantle&quot; the national programmes for school sport that had been on course to deliver the legacy. Over eight years, the number of children playing two hours or more of sport a week had increased from 20% to 85%. Jowell said the decision in 2010 of the education secretary, Gove, to withdraw funding for the programme of schools sports partnerships had &quot;undone eight years of work at a stroke&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jan/10/jumbo-stay-stockholm-hostel-sweden", "sentences": ["&quot;It had been in service for Pan Am, Singapore Airlines and many others."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-10T06:50:00Z", "title": "747 jumbo hostel in Stockholm", "tags": ["Hotels", "Stockholm holidays", "Travel", "Sweden holidays", "Short breaks", "City breaks"], "article": "     Few of us can afford to turn left on an aircraft. The most we get to see how the other half live, at least when it comes to flying, is a quick, envious glimpse of flat beds and smiling air stewards offering glasses of champagne, before accepting our lot and turning right into cattle class. But there is one aircraft where the pleasures of first and business class \u2013 flat beds, drinks on demand, good food \u2013 can be enjoyed at the cost of a night in an average mid-price chain hotel. The catch? The plane isn&apos;t going anywhere. Jumbo Stay \u2013 the world&apos;s only 747 jet to be converted into a hostel \u2013 sits on a disused runway at Stockholm airport. Accessed via a 15-minute walk from the main terminal or via a five-minute shuttle bus, it&apos;s arguably the only way that most of us will ever enjoy a good night&apos;s sleep on a plane. For Oscar Dios, the man who had the vision and, crucially, funds to make this dream a reality, the idea seemed blindingly obvious. Given the number of decommissioned planes lying around in various states of decay across the world, plus the lack of cheap, convenient hotel rooms in major cities, it&apos;s a wonder someone didn&apos;t do it sooner. &quot;I saw this plane and I instantly knew it would be perfect for a hotel,&quot; he says. &quot;It had been in service for Pan Am, Singapore Airlines and many others. I knew I could give it a new lease of life.&quot; As we stroll around the plane, shadowed by a film crew from Expedia.co.uk&apos;s People-Shaped Travel video series, which reveals unique experiences in cities around the world, Dios points out some elegant touches. The renovation saw flat-screen TVs and Wi-Fi access added to each room, with some spaces becoming multi-occupancy dorms and others, like the flight deck and the &quot;black box&quot; room at the back, transformed into en-suite double bedrooms. The essential elements of aviation remain, though. From signs next to sinks advising users to wipe down the surfaces for the next passenger to warning notices around emergency exit hatches and, in the flight deck, the pilot&apos;s original controls (now inoperable, obviously), you&apos;ll find history in every corner. Upstairs, the first class cabin has been converted into a funky 24-hour cafe and, says Dios, there is still potential for further expansion. &quot;The wings are the next project,&quot; he reveals. &quot;We&apos;re going to put a glass shelter over them so people can sit out there and relax, even in the depths of winter.&quot; Eventually, each engine will also house a capsule-style double bedroom. These will be dubbed, naturally, the Engine Rooms. The whole place is a combination of the unique and the convenient. In practical terms, you can use it as an overnight stop before a flight, as the hotel is just a short walk from the airport. For visitor Pawel Witkiewicz and his sons Alek and Erik, though, Jumbo Stay is simply a brilliant theme hotel. &quot;My boys love aircraft,&quot; he laughs. &quot;So this is like a dream come true.&quot; And only the most serious of grown-ups will be able to suppress a child-like sense of glee at the quirkiness of the hostel.  &quot;We had a couple of people pop in, just to take a look. They were supposed to be staying in a hotel nearby but once they saw what we had to offer they immediately cancelled their reservation and stayed here,&quot; says duty manager Sebastian Sandler. Eco-friendly, unusual and, crucially, unabashed fun \u2013 the Jumbo Stay hostel is the only aircraft that offers a guaranteed turbulence-free first-class night&apos;s sleep, whatever your budget. \u2022 Two nights&apos; room-only at the Jumbo Stay hostel (jumbostay.com) from \u00a3189pp, based on two sharing a standard room.

Singapore to scrap language test for foreign maids English language tests for foreign maids seeking work in Singapore will be scrapped from June, authorities announced last month. Mandatory testing of domestic staff, introduced in 2005, will be replaced by a &quot;settling-in programme&quot;, including training in stress management and adapting to life abroad. The test was blamed for putting job seekers, coming mainly from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Burma, under undue stress, with many candidates failing to meet required standards. &quot;While the entry test was introduced with good intentions \u2026 it is not a meaningful measure of quality and does not guarantee that the worker understands the English language,&quot; Tan Chuang-Jin of Singapore&apos;s manpower ministry said. Insider trading charges in schools sale The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sued four Chinese citizens on charges of insider dealing for allegedly making more than $2.7m in profits by buying shares in the Chinese English language schools chain Global Education and Technology shortly before it was sold to Pearson last November for $155m. According to the SEC complaint one of the individuals, Lili Wang, a 45-year-old Beijing resident, was allegedly &quot;tipped about the Global Education acquisition prior to its public announcement given her connection to Xiaodong Zhang&quot;, Global Education&apos;s co-founder and chairman. Rwanda &apos;failing&apos; to lure mentors from Kenya A plan to attract experienced English language teachers to Rwanda from Kenya to help local teachers switch from French to English as the medium of instruction has failed because of low pay on offer, according to press reports. The Rwanda Education Board (REB) will not achieve its target to recruit 4,000 out-of-work Kenyan teachers to work as trainers because the pay on offer is not a sufficient incentive, the Rwanda Focus newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted unconfirmed reports that the REB was offering $700 a month, but Kenyan staff expected more than double that. British Council&apos;s return to\u00a0Libya announced The British Council will resume in March its English language teaching operation in Libya, suspended after the outbreak of civil war last February, according to the UK minister, Alistair Burt. The Council had a staff of 50 teachers in the country in 2011.

I&apos;m delighted to be here at BETT today. And I have to start by congratulating all the companies in this Hall. British companies are world-leaders in the field of educational technology, and going from strength to strength \u2013 the members of Besa, for example, increased exports by 12% in 2010. Crick Software, which has worked in the USA, Chile and Qatar and which already supplies 90% of UK primary schools, recently secured their biggest single order ever, supplying half of all schools in Moscow with Clicker 5 literacy software (fully translated into Russian). Promethean, which makes interactive whiteboards and educational software, signed a memorandum of collaboration with the Mexican Ministry of Education last June to work in primary and secondary education throughout Mexico. These are just a few of the hugely impressive achievements of British companies \u2013 and there are many more all around us. I&apos;d also like to mention particularly all those shortlisted for the BETT awards tonight. Good luck to all nominees, and congratulations (in advance) to the winners\u2026 How technology has changed the world, and the workplace All around us, the world has changed in previously unimaginable and impossible ways. Most of us carry more advanced technology in the smartphone in our pocket than Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin used to reach the Moon. Every day we work in environments which are completely different to those of twenty-five or a hundred years ago. Where once clerks scribbled on card indexes and lived by the Dewey Decimal system, now thousands of office workers roam the world from their desktop. Where once car manufacturing plants housed lines of workers hammering and soldering and drilling, now a technician controls the delicate operations of a whole series of robots. When I started out as a journalist in the 1980s, it was a case of typewriters and telexes in smoky newsrooms, surrounded by the distant clatter of hot metal. Now newsrooms \u2013 and journalists \u2013 are almost unrecognisable, as are the daily tools of the trade. The telex machine became a fax, then a pager, then email. A desktop computer became a laptop computer. My pockets were filled with huge mobile phones, then smaller mobile phones, a Blackberry, and now an e-reader and iPad. And with each new gadget, each huge leap forward, technology has expanded into new intellectual and commercial fields. Twenty years ago, medicine was not an information technology. Now, genomes have been decoded and the technologies of biological engineering and synthetic biology are transforming medicine. The boundary between biology and IT is already blurring into whole new fields, like bio-informatics. Twenty years ago, science journals were full of articles about the &apos;AI Winter&apos; \u2013 the fear that post-war hopes for Artificial Intelligence had stalled. Now, detailed computer models show us more than we ever imagined about the geography of our minds. Amazing brain-computer-interfaces allow us to control our physical environment by the power of thought \u2013 truly an example of Arthur C. Clarke&apos;s comment that any sufficiently advanced technology can seem like magic. Twenty years ago, only a tiny number of specialists knew what the internet was and what it might shortly become. Now, billions of people and trillions of cheap sensors are connecting to each other, all over the world \u2013 and more come online every minute of every day. Almost every field of employment now depends on technology. From radio, to television, computers and the internet, each new technological advance has changed our world and changed us too. But there is one notable exception. Education has barely changed The fundamental model of school education is still a teacher talking to a group of pupils. It has barely changed over the centuries, even since Plato established the earliest &quot;akademia&quot; in a shady olive grove in ancient Athens. A Victorian schoolteacher could enter a 21st century classroom and feel completely at home. Whiteboards may have eliminated chalk dust, chairs may have migrated from rows to groups, but a teacher still stands in front of the class, talking, testing and questioning. But that model won&apos;t be the same in twenty years&apos; time. It may well be extinct in ten. Technology is already bringing about a profound transformation in education, in ways that we can see before our very eyes and in others that we haven&apos;t even dreamt of yet. Now, as we all know, confident predictions of the technological future have a habit of embarrassing the predictor. As early as 1899, the director of the U.S. Patent Office, Charles H. Duell, blithely asserted that &quot;everything that can be invented has already been invented.&quot; In 1943, the chairman of IBM guessed that &quot;there is a world market for maybe five computers&quot;. The editor of the Radio Times said in 1936, &quot;television won&apos;t matter in your lifetime or mine&quot;. Most impressively of all, Lord Kelvin, President of the Royal Society, scored a hat-trick of embarrassing predictions between 1897-9, declaring, &quot;radio has no future&quot;, &quot;X-rays are clearly a hoax&quot; and &quot;the aeroplane is scientifically impossible&quot;. A new approach to technology policy I don&apos;t aspire to join that illustrious company by stating on record that this technology or that gadget is going to change the world. Nothing has a shorter shelf-life than the cutting edge. But we in Britain should never forget that one of our great heroes, Alan Turing, laid the foundation stones on which all modern computing rests. His pioneering work on theoretical computation in the 1930s laid the way for Turing himself, von Neumann and others to create the computer industry as we know it. Another generation&apos;s pioneer, Bill Gates, warned that the need for children to understand computer programming is much more acute now than when he was growing up. Yet as the chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, recently lamented, we in England have allowed our education system to ignore our great heritage and we are paying the price for it. Our school system has not prepared children for this new world. Millions have left school over the past decade without even the basics they need for a decent job. And the current curriculum cannot prepare British students to work at the very forefront of technological change. Last year&apos;s superb Livingstone \u2013Hope Review \u2013 for which I would like to thank both authors \u2013 said that the slump in UK&apos;s video games development sector is partly the result of a lack of suitably-qualified graduates. The review, commissioned by Ed Vaizey who has championed the Computer Science cause in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, found that the UK had been let down by an ICT curriculum that neglects the rigorous computer science and programming skills which high-tech industries need. It&apos;s clear that technology is going to bring profound changes to how and what we teach. But it&apos;s equally clear that we have not yet managed to make the most of it. Governments are notoriously flat-footed when it comes to anticipating and facilitating technical change. Too often, in the past, administrations have been seduced into spending huge sums on hardware which is obsolete before the ink is dry on the contract. Or invested vast amounts of time and money in drawing up new curricula, painstakingly detailing specific skills and techniques which are superseded almost immediately. I believe that we need to take a step back. Already, technology is helping us to understand the process of learning. Brain scans and scientific studies are now showing us how we understand the structure of language, how we remember and forget, the benefits of properly designed and delivered testing and the importance of working memory. As science advances, our understanding of the brain will grow \u2013 and as it grows, it will teach us more about the process of education. What can technology do for learning? Rather than rushing pell-mell after any particular technology, filling school cupboards with today&apos;s answer to Betamaxes and floppy discs, we need to ask ourselves a fundamental question. What can technology do for learning? Three points immediately: \u00b7 First, technology has the potential to disseminate learning much more widely than ever before. Subjects, classes and concepts that were previously limited to a privileged few are now freely available to any child or adult with an internet connection, all over the world. Look at 02 learn, a free online library of lesson videos developed and uploaded by teachers. It has already delivered around 25,000 hours of teaching via 1000 lessons from every type of school and college, right across the country: science lessons from The Bishop Wand Church of England Comprehensive School, music lessons from Eton. What about iTunes U, where lectures from the world&apos;s top universities are available at the touch of a button, and where the Independent Schools Council, Teaching Leaders and some of the best Academy Chains are working to put materials and lesson videos online? Or the hugely successful Khan Academy: more than 3.5 million students watch its educational videos every month and Google has donated $2 million for its materials to be translated into 10 languages. I&apos;ve been lucky enough to see first hand in Singapore how brilliant lessons can be delivered through a mixture of online and teacher-led instruction. And in areas of specialist teacher shortage, specialist teaching could be provided for groups of schools online, giving more children the opportunity to learn subjects that were previously closed to them. The Further Maths Support Programme, for example, is using the internet to give poorer families access to specialist help for the STEP papers, which dominate the best universities&apos; selection process for Maths degree courses. As online materials grow and flourish, we all need to think about how we can guide students through the wealth of information and techniques freely available and accessible online. And, of course, I&apos;m not just talking about opportunities for pupils to learn. The Royal Shakespeare Company is working with the University of Warwick on an online professional development learning platform to transform the teaching of Shakespeare in schools. Launching next month, the &quot;rehearsal room&quot; teaching resources will give teachers all over the world access to the insights and working practices of internationally-renowned actors, artists and directors, as well as specialist academics and teachers. The programme will even offer the chance to study for a Post Graduate qualification in the Teaching of Shakespeare. The Knowledge is Power Programme, one of the most successful and widely-studied charter school chains in America, is already using ubiquitous, cheap digital technology to share lessons from its most proficient teachers. Even the best teachers can hone their skills by watching their peers in action. \u00b7 Second, just as technology raises profound questions about how we learn, it also prompts us to think about how we teach. Games and interactive software can help pupils acquire complicated skills and rigorous knowledge in an engaging and enjoyable way. Adaptive software has the ability to recognise and respond to different abilities, personalising teaching for every pupil. With the expert help of a teacher, students can progress at different rates through lessons calibrated to stretch them just the right amount. Britain has an incredibly strong games industry, with vast potential to engage with education both in this country and all over the world. We&apos;re already seeing these technologies being used in imaginative ways. Games developed by Marcus Du Sautoy, Professor of Mathematics at Oxford, are introducing children to advanced, complicated maths problems \u2013 and are producing great results. Before Christmas I visited Kingsford School in Newham, where the Department for Education is working with the Li Ka Shing Foundation and the highly respected Stanford Research Institute. Their pilot scheme uses computer programmes to teach maths interactively \u2013 for example, showing a race between two people on screen and inviting pupils to plot their time and distance on a graph, then adjust it for variables. Again, this pilot hasn&apos;t been dictated by central government, and we haven&apos;t developed the programme. But Stanford already says it is one of the most successful educational projects they have seen and I am looking forward to seeing the results. \u00b7 Third, technology brings unprecedented opportunities for assessment. Teachers can now support pupils&apos; learning by assessing their progress in a much more sophisticated way, and sharing assessments with pupils and parents. Each pupil&apos;s strengths and weaknesses can be closely monitored without stigmatising those who are struggling or embarrassing those are streaking ahead. Teachers can adjust lesson plans to target areas where pupils are weakest, and identify gaps in knowledge quickly and reliably. Sophisticated assessment like this is already being used in schools around the country. Brailes Primary School, for example, a small rural school on the border of Warwickshire and Oxfordshire, uses online tools enabling teachers to use pre-assembled tests, or design tests of their own. One of the teachers, Deborah Smith, has praised the system, saying, &quot;it has enabled me to differentiate my teaching to meet the needs of different groups. The assessments are quick and simple to prepare\u2026leaving more time for planning and teaching.&quot; In Chichester School for Boys, electronic voting pads provide students with instant feedback during classes. Teachers get real-time feedback on how well their material is being understood \u2013 even on a question by question basis. These are just three ways in which technology is profoundly changing education today \u2013 and I am sure that there will be more. We&apos;re not going to tell you what to do While things are changing so rapidly, while the technology is unpredictable and the future is unknowable, Government must not wade in from the centre to prescribe to schools exactly what they should be doing and how they should be doing it. We must work with these developments as they arise: supporting, facilitating and encouraging change, rather than dictating it. By its very nature, new technology is a disruptive force. It innovates, and invents; it flattens hierarchies, and encourages creativity and fresh thinking. I could say the same of our whole school reform programme. In fact, I&apos;m fairly sure I have said the same. Just as we&apos;ve devolved greater autonomy to schools, and put our trust in the professionalism of teachers; just as we&apos;ve lifted the burden of central prescription, and given heads and schools power over their own destiny; just as the internet has made information more democratic, and given every single user the chance to talk to the world; so technology will bring more autonomy to each of us here in this room. This is a huge opportunity. But it&apos;s also a responsibility. We want to focus on training teachers That&apos;s why, rather than focusing on hardware or procurement, we are investing in training individuals. We need to improve the training of teachers so that they have the skills and knowledge they need to make the most of the opportunities ahead. It is vital that teachers can feel confident using technological tools and resources for their own and their pupils&apos; benefit, both within and beyond the classroom, and can adapt to new technologies as they emerge. That means ensuring that teachers receive the best possible ITT and CPD in the use of educational technology. Working with the TDA, we will be looking at initial teacher training courses carefully in the coming year so that teachers get the skills and experience they need to use technology confidently. And we&apos;re working with Nesta who, supported by Nominet Trust and others, are today announcing a \u00a32m programme to fund and research innovative technology projects in schools. We must also encourage teachers to learn from other schools which are doing this particularly well. Some ICT teaching in schools is already excellent - as reported in the most recent Ofsted report on ICT education and last year&apos;s Naace report, &quot;The Importance of Technology&quot;. Sharing that excellence will help all schools to drive up standards. We are already working with the Open University on Vital, a programme encouraging teachers to share ICT expertise between schools. High-performing academy chains will also play a huge role in spreading existing best practice and innovation between schools. And Teaching Schools across the country are already forming networks to help other schools develop and improve their use of technology. The Department for Education is going to provide dedicated funding to Teaching Schools to support this work. The current, flawed ICT curriculum The disruptive, innovative, creative force of new technology also pushes us to think about the curriculum. And one area exemplifies, more than any other, the perils of the centre seeking to capture in leaden prose the restless spirit of technological innovation. I refer, of course, to the current ICT curriculum. The best degrees in computer science are among the most rigorous and respected qualifications in the world. They&apos;re based on one of the most formidable intellectual fields \u2013 logic and set theory \u2013 and prepare students for immensely rewarding careers and world-changing innovations. But you&apos;d never know that from the current ICT curriculum. Schools, teachers and industry leaders have all told us that the current curriculum is too off-putting, too demotivating, too dull. Submissions to the National Curriculum Review Call for Evidence from organisations including the British Computer Society, Computing at School, eSkills UK, Naace and the Royal Society, all called the current National Curriculum for ICT unsatisfactory. They&apos;re worried that it doesn&apos;t stretch pupils enough or allow enough opportunities for innovation and experimentation \u2013 and they&apos;re telling me the curriculum has to change radically. Some respondents in a 2009 research study by e-Skills said that ICT GCSE was &quot;so harmful, boring and / or irrelevant it should simply be scrapped&quot;. The Royal Society is so concerned that it has spent two years researching the problem with universities, employers, teachers and professional bodies \u2013 so I&apos;m looking forward to its report, due to be published on Friday. And while ICT is so unpopular, there are grave doubts about existing Computer Science 16-18 courses. In short, just at the time when technology is bursting with potential, teachers, professionals, employers, universities, parents and pupils are all telling us the same thing. ICT in schools is a mess. Disapplying the Programme of Study That&apos;s why I am announcing today that the Department for Education is opening a consultation on withdrawing the existing National Curriculum Programme of Study for ICT from September this year. The traditional approach would have been to keep the Programme of Study in place for the next four years while we assembled a panel of experts, wrote a new ICT curriculum, spent a fortune on new teacher training, and engaged with exam boards for new ICT GCSES that would become obsolete almost immediately. We will not be doing that. Technology in schools will no longer be micromanaged by Whitehall. By withdrawing the Programme of Study, we&apos;re giving schools and teachers freedom over what and how to teach; revolutionising ICT as we know it. Let me stress - ICT will remain compulsory at all key stages, and will still be taught at every stage of the curriculum. The existing Programme of Study will remain on the web for reference. But no English school will be forced to follow it any more. From this September, all schools will be free to use the amazing resources that already exist on the web. Universities, businesses and others will have the opportunity to devise new courses and exams. In particular, we want to see universities and businesses create new high quality Computer Science GCSEs, and develop curricula encouraging schools to make use of the brilliant Computer Science content available on the web. I am pleased that OCR is pioneering work in this field, and that IBM and others are already working on a pilot. Facebook has teamed up with UK-based organisation Apps for Good to offer young people the chance to learn how to design, code and build social applications for use on social networks, via a unique new training course which they aim to make freely available online this year to potential users all over the world. And other specialist groups have published or are about to publish detailed ICT curricula and programmes of study, including Computing At School (led by the British Computer Society and the Institute of IT), Behind the Screens (led by eSkills UK), Naace and others, with considerable support from industry leaders. Imagine the dramatic change which could be possible in just a few years, once we remove the roadblock of the existing ICT curriculum. Instead of children bored out of their minds being taught how to use Word and Excel by bored teachers, we could have 11 year-olds able to write simple 2D computer animations using an MIT tool called Scratch. By 16, they could have an understanding of formal logic previously covered only in University courses and be writing their own Apps for smartphones. This is not an airy promise from an MP \u2013 this is the prediction of people like Ian Livingstone who have built world-class companies from computer science. And we&apos;re encouraging rigorous Computer Science courses The new Computer Science courses will reflect what you all know: that Computer Science is a rigorous, fascinating and intellectually challenging subject. After all, the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, is one of the most innovative and successful proponents of Computer Science today. But his computing skills are just as rigorous as the rest of his talents \u2013 which include Maths, Science, French, Hebrew, Latin and Ancient Greek. Computer Science requires a thorough grounding in logic and set theory, and is merging with other scientific fields into new hybrid research subjects like computational biology. So I am also announcing today that, if new Computer Science GCSEs are developed that meet high standards of intellectual depth and practical value, we will certainly consider including Computer Science as an option in the English Baccalaureate. Although individual technologies change day by day, they are underpinned by foundational concepts and principles that have endured for decades. Long after today&apos;s pupils leave school and enter the workplace \u2013 long after the technologies they used at school are obsolete \u2013 the principles learnt in Computer Science will still hold true. An open-source curriculum Advances in technology should also make us think about the broader school curriculum in a new way. In an open-source world, why should we accept that a curriculum is a single, static document? A statement of priorities frozen in time; a blunt instrument landing with a thunk on teachers&apos; desks and updated only centrally and only infrequently? In ICT, for example, schools are already leading the way when it comes to using educational technology in new and exciting ways \u2013 and they&apos;re doing it in spite of the existing ICT curriculum, not because of it. The essential requirements of the National Curriculum need to be specified in law, but perhaps we could use technology creatively to help us develop that content. And beyond the new, slimmed down National Curriculum, we need to consider how we can take a wiki, collaborative approach to developing new curriculum materials; using technological platforms to their full advantage in creating something far more sophisticated than anything previously available. This means freedom and autonomy Disapplying the ICT programme of study is about freedom. It will mean that, for the first time, teachers will be allowed to cover truly innovative, specialist and challenging topics. And whether they choose a premade curriculum, or whether they design their own programme of study specifically for their school, they will have the freedom and flexibility to decide what is best for their pupils. Teachers will now be allowed to focus more sharply on the subjects they think matter \u2013 for example, teaching exactly how computers work, studying the basics of programming and coding and encouraging pupils to have a go themselves. Initiatives like the Raspberry Pi scheme will give children the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of programming with their own credit card sized, single-board computers. With minimal memory and no disk drives, the Raspberry Pi computer can operate basic programming languages, handle tasks like spread sheets, word-processing and games, and connect to wifi via a dongle \u2013 all for between \u00a316 and \u00a322. This is a great example of the cutting edge of education technology happening right here in the UK. It could bring the same excitement as the BBC Micro did in the 1980s, and I know that it&apos;s being carefully watched by education and technology experts all over the world. As well as choosing what to study, schools can also choose how. Technology can be integrated and embedded across the whole curriculum. In geography lessons, for example, pupils could access the specialised software and tools used by professional geographers, allowing them to tackle more challenging and interesting work. Molecular modelling software could bring huge advantages for science students. The Abbey School in Reading has already been piloting 3D technologies for teaching Biology, showing 3D images of the heart pumping blood through valves, and manipulating, rotating and tilting the heart in real time. As Abbey School Biology teacher Ros Johnson said, the 3D technology &quot;has made me realise what they weren&apos;t understanding...what I can&apos;t believe is how much difference it has made to the girls&apos; understanding&quot;. This isn&apos;t a finished strategy \u2013 but it shows our ambition The use of technology in schools is a subject that will keep growing and changing, just as technology keeps growing and changing. But we can be confident about one thing. Demand for high-level skills will only grow in the years ahead. In work, academia and their personal lives, young people will depend upon their technological literacy and knowledge. And this doesn&apos;t just affect our country. Every nation in the world will be changed by the growth of technology and we in Britain must ensure that we can make the most of our incredible assets to become world-leaders in educational technology. Today has seen the conclusion of the Education World Forum here in London. I cannot emphasise enough how important it is for me, personally, that we learn from the highest performing education systems \u2013 some of whom I am delighted to see represented here \u2013 and I am very grateful to everyone who has taken the time and trouble to come to London for this event. I&apos;m not here today to announce our final, inflexible, immutable technology strategy. There&apos;s no blueprint to follow \u2013 and we don&apos;t know what our destination will look like. I&apos;m setting out our direction of travel, and taking the first few steps. There is lots more to come, and we will have more to say over the course of the year. I&apos;d also like to welcome the online discussion launched today at schoolstech.org.uk and using the twitter hashtag #schoolstech. We need a serious, intelligent conversation about how technology will transform education \u2013 and I look forward to finding out what everyone has to say. We want a modern education system which exploits the best that technology can offer to schools, teachers and pupils. Where schools use technology in imaginative and effective ways to build the knowledge, understanding and skills that young people need for the future. And where we can adapt to and welcome every new technological advance that comes along to change everything, all over again, in ways we never expected. Events like the BETT show are crucial in showcasing the best and brightest of the technology industry, showing what can be done \u2013 and what is already being achieved. We will depend upon your insight and ideas, your expertise and experience, as you take these technologies into your schools and try them with your students. Thank you again to BETT for inviting me, and I wish you all good exploring today."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jan/11/tefl-update-january-2012", "sentences": ["News: Rupert Murdoch &apos;denied&apos; in Asia ELT broadcast contract Catch up with the latest global developments with ELT diary: Singapore to scrap language test for foreign maids; Insider trading charges in Global Education schools sale; Rwanda &apos;failing&apos; to lure ELT mentors from Kenya; British Council&apos;s return to Libya announced."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-11T12:15:01Z", "title": "Tefl Update for January", "tags": [], "article": "Welcome to TEFL Update for January, a roundup of the latest ELT related news and views to appear in Learning English, the special section of the Guardian Weekly for English language teaching professionals worldwide.

Quite different from the one we live in now, according to research from Karen Ward. The HSBC economist produced a global league table a year ago and the updated version has some interesting findings. China is the biggest economy, with the US sandwiched between it and India in third place, but both the big developing countries remain poor when allowance is made for population, with neither in the top 50 in terms of income per capita.

Most of the countries in the stable category are from the developed world, forecast to grow by less than 3% a year. Some of these countries are on course to see quite dramatic falls in their population: in Japan&apos;s case from 127 million to 102 million and in Germany&apos;s from 82 million to 71 million. Britain, with 72 million, will by 2050 have more people than Germany, despite being only two-thirds as big in terms of land mass. Many European countries will see their working populations shrink drastically, suggesting that the current fiscal problems in the eurozone will persist. By contrast, Nigeria is on course to see its population more than double from 158 million to 390 million, leaving it the fourth most populous country in the world, just behind the US at 404 million. These are, of course, only projections based on current income per capita, rule of law, democracy, education levels and demographic change. &quot;We assume,&quot; Ward admits &quot;that policymakers will continue to make progress in addressing economic flaws and that they avoid wars and remain open to global trade and capital.&quot; While the HSBC economist freely accepts that some of her assumptions might not prove to be accurate, it might be worth tossing a couple of other assumptions into the mix. Global growth on this scale is going to require a lot of fuel, and it is going to be one heck of a challenge to find alternative sources of energy as supplies of fossil fuels are used up.

The government this week unveiled a new strategy to address declining participation figures among young people and stalled progress in the plan to use the 2012 Games to inspire the population to get fit. Hunt said that the \u00a3450m earmarked for sports governing bodies over four years to develop links between schools and clubs and drive grassroots sport could be diverted elsewhere if they failed to deliver. As well as charities and community sport organisations that could include Premier League clubs, he said, despite the potential perception issues around handing public money to clubs with large TV deals that fund huge wage bills. &quot;We want to spend our money in the way that gets the biggest boost in participation. Our starting point is going to be to work with sports governing bodies but I made it very clear that if they fail to deliver we&apos;ll take this money away,&quot; he said. Hunt was speaking at a Premier League event to promote a scheme in which it and the government invested \u00a33.8m in using clubs to act as hubs to host sports clubs and encourage participation in badminton, judo, table tennis and volleyball. It claimed the scheme had reached 39,000 people in its first two years. It said it was to invest another \u00a32m to add four new sports \u2014 basketball, handball, hockey and netball \u2014 to the Premier League for Sport programme. Hunt said the scheme could act as a model for the thousands of programmes he hopes governing bodies will promote in schools. He hopes that by employing a tougher approach with the governing bodies that only increased participation numbers by a 10th of the 1m target promised by the last government, an aspiration that has now been ditched, he will have more success. &quot;We&apos;re not ring-fencing the money for them. We will start off with the whole sport plans but we will put in much tighter performance measures, much more closely modelled on the elite sport funding model where money is withdrawn pretty quickly if people fail to deliver,&quot; he said. The government would not hesitate to withdraw money from governing bodies and give it to charities and, potentially, Premier League clubs. &quot;I made it very clear. There are some very good charities, voluntary organisations, Premier League clubs. There are lots of different avenues and ways to get involved. We want to harness anyone who&apos;s got a good idea of how to make this work,&quot; he said. The Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, said: &quot;If public money makes these schemes go further and wider I don&apos;t see why they shouldn&apos;t qualify. Our clubs have the name, the brand, the cachet but they also have the hugely talented coaches who are on top of their game in engaging with young people.&quot; Hunt said it was &quot;too early to say&quot; whether the legacy aspirations promised by Lord Coe in Singapore in 2005 that helped secure the Games would be delivered. &quot;We&apos;ll have a fantastic physical legacy in terms of sporting facilities we didn&apos;t have before. But in terms of sports participation in a school in Manchester or Leicester or Cornwall or Cardiff, that is the real test of whether we are successful or not,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve got a lot of initiatives that we now need to deliver on.

This represents a 20% increase on the \u00a3152,257 notched up in the same period in 2010, according to a BBC filing made public on Thursday. It is almost 12% more than the \u00a3164,335 that was spent in the previous quarter. While senior BBC executives have become increasingly careful about what they claim since the corporation started publicly publishing expenses in 2009, there are still some interesting filings. Jessica Cecil, the \u00a3130,000-a-year head of the director general&apos;s office, spent almost \u00a31,000 on a series of dinners with senior executives to discuss how to implement director general Mark Thompson&apos;s Delivering Quality First proposals to cut spending by 20%. The series of meetings about the cuts, which include the loss of thousands of jobs, ran to \u00a3832 in &quot;business entertainment&quot; claims in the expenses report. Thompson is likely to have attended all three of the dinner meetings \u2013 one with TV controllers cost \u00a3172 and one with radio controllers cost \u00a3282.90 \u2013 although he is only specifically named in the third claim for a &quot;leads dinner&quot; costing \u00a3377.10. One of the most sizeable single claims was from Zai Bennett, the controller of BBC3, who spent \u00a31,300 on seven nights in the Mosaic Hotel in Beverly Hills during the LA Screenings. BBC chiefs showed their appreciation for key staff delivering on big stories in Libya and covering the Japanese tsunami. Francesca Unsworth, head of newsgathering at the BBC, spent a total of \u00a3365.92 on three &quot;de-briefs&quot; and &quot;thanks&quot;. The BBC said they involved four people excluding Unsworth. She also spent \u00a36,450 on a single trip taking in Tokyo, Korea and Singapore. In Japan as part of a &quot;bureaux visit&quot; she spent \u00a3320 to thank staff for &quot;coverage of the Japanese tsunami&quot;. Arguably the best free hospitality during the period went to Dominic Coles, chief operating officer for the BBC News group, who accepted an invite to last year&apos;s Uefa Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona. He also accepted two days at last summer&apos;s Wimbledon \u2013 once in the &quot;Royal Box&quot; and the other time in a &quot;marquee and centre court&quot;. Roger Wright, controller of BBC Radio 3, claimed \u00a3567.30 for a &quot;leaving party&quot;.

A spokesman for the BBC said that increase in expenses was a short-term consequence of the move to Salford, and was expected to come down in the long run. &quot;These expenses cover the period when the BBC&apos;s new HQ at MediaCityUK opened and executives needed to split their time between London and Salford,&quot; said the spokesman. &quot;With BBC North now fully operational we expect travel and accommodation costs will come down.&quot; BBC North, now home to previously London-based services including BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sport and BBC Children, will employ a total of 2,300 staff.

After decades in which the west isolated Burma, the recent visits represent a warming of relations, as the country&apos;s government has introduced democratic reforms, allowed the formation of trade unions, released political prisoners, and eased restrictions on access to information. The World Bank is being urged to resume work in the country. And new groups of investors are waiting in the wings to enter as soon as possible. We can hope that the west&apos;s sudden enthusiasm stems from genuine support for peace and the rights of the population. But in reality, the change in stance probably has at least as much to do with pursuit of their own national interests. For several decades, US and European sanctions have kept western businesses out of Burma, while firms from Thailand, Singapore, India and especially China eagerly exploited the country&apos;s natural gas, hydropower potential and gemstones. History has shown time and again that popular movements for civil liberties, democracy and human rights are often hijacked by a drive to introduce neoliberal capitalism or prise open a country to foreign investors. For example, countries in eastern and central Europe are still reeling from the adverse effects of indiscriminate privatisation and deregulation, around 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The governments and people of these countries were told the only way to address Soviet-era oppression, corruption and inefficiency was to dismantle public services in health and education, deflate pension payments and hollow out public administration. The conventional wisdom was to curtail public services and institutions rather than reform and enhance them. Burma, endowed with valuable resources, is in a position to avoid this trap. As the head of the country&apos;s new economic advisory board, Dr U Myint, put it, Burma is a rich country, albeit with poor people. It can use its resources to build an innovative and democratic welfare state in pursuit of equity and social inclusion. Burma could create decent work by investing in health, education, social services and civil administration. It could build infrastructure in rural areas and upgrade public transport. It could finance innovation in the rural economy. All these areas have been neglected for decades, as the government invested instead in military campaigns, the police apparatus, and prestige projects like the new capital city. Burma could also consider a strategy to strengthen the economy, drawing on the economic development experiences of India, Brazil, Singapore or South Korea. For example, the government could promote selected sectors for domestic and international investment while requiring that they ensure decent wages and working conditions, and technological innovation. The recent introduction of labour standards is a step in the right direction. Burma also has the means to extend social protection programmes to cover the entire population. Currently, only 1% of the population are covered by social security. Social security benefits for the government sector have increased recently, but only a few other groups receive any social assistance. There is no systematic health insurance or poverty response. It could choose to adopt the UN&apos;s social protection floor initiative guaranteeing basic income plus access to high-quality, inclusive social services. A combination of policies promoting decent work and social protection, and an industrial strategy, could allow the country to reduce poverty, income inequality and disparities between rural and urban areas. Burma has the option to create a democratic welfare state. This approach would help its citizens to emerge from poverty and political oppression and might even inspire other low-income countries emerging from oppression. \u2022 Gabriele K\u00f6hler is a development economist and visiting fellow at the Institute of Development Studies "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/13/south-african-police-419-scam", "sentences": ["The suspects demanded a $10m ransom from the 65-year-old man&apos;s wife (who was back in South Korea), to be deposited into an account in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-13T15:04:11Z", "title": "South African police rescue Asian pair kidnapped in 419 scam", "tags": ["South Africa", "Africa", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Scams", "Consumer affairs", "Money"], "article": "The bigger the lie, the more it will be believed, to paraphrase the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. So when a South Korean man received an email promising him tens of millions of dollars in a lottery scheme if he travelled to South Africa, he fell for it. The offer turned out to be a so-called 419 scam on an epic scale. South African police say the credulous man arrived with his daughter only for both to be taken hostage in a township for four days. The kidnappers, a mainly Nigerian gang, demanded a ransom of $10m (\u00a36.5m) but were thwarted by police who raided the house and freed the pair. The term 419 scam to describe a confidence trick refers to section 419 of the Nigerian criminal code for obtaining property through fraud. Few users of email worldwide have been spared messages, often badly spelled, offering to deposit huge sums of money in their account for tenuous reasons. While most instantly hit the delete button, the unnamed 65-year-old from South Korea and his daughter, in her 30s, evidently had a trusting nature. They landed at OR Tambo international airport in Johannesburg last week. Col McIntosh Polela of the South African police service (Saps) said: &quot;The suspects allegedly tasked a driver to fetch the victims from OR Tambo airport. The driver and the two Korean nationals were kidnapped and kept at a house in Meadowlands, Soweto. &quot;The driver managed to escape and alert the police. The suspects demanded a $10m ransom from the 65-year-old man&apos;s wife (who was back in South Korea), to be deposited into an account in Singapore. The amount was eventually negotiated down to $120,000 (\u00a378,000). &quot;While the negotiations were ongoing, the wife alerted the South Korean embassy in South Africa. Members of the Saps rescued the captives, before the ransom money was deposited.&quot; Six suspects, five Nigerians and a South African, were arrested during the early-morning rescue and charged with kidnapping. The South Koreans, tearful but grateful, left the country as soon as they could, without waiting to give evidence in court. &quot;They declined to testify because they were traumatised,&quot; Polela added. &quot;They were also embarrassed at being lured to South Africa.

Now the Soho House group has taken the most significant step yet in its seemingly unstoppable march across the globe, agreeing a \u00a3250m deal with a US billionaire to fund its expansion into subcontinental Asia and the Far East. The deal, which will earn founder Nick Jones \u00a325m for half his 20% share, will make Soho House the most valuable private members&apos; club in the world. Jones, who is married to the broadcaster Kirsty Young, sold 80% of the business to the British high-street tycoon Richard Caring in 2008, in a deal that valued the company at just over \u00a3130m. Caring will pocket around \u00a3125m in exchange for 50% of the group. The new controlling partner is Ron Burkle, a retail magnate who began his career bagging groceries at his father&apos;s supermarket and rose to become ranked 297 on the Forbes 400 richest list in 2010. A prominent political donor and Democrat supporter, he is a close friend and former business partner of Bill Clinton and reportedly raised more than $1m (\u00a3653,000) for Hillary Clinton&apos;s presidential campaign. Jones and Caring have been looking for a major investor for some months to fund expansion. As well as its original home in Soho, the group owns three other members&apos; clubs in London, opening further &quot;houses&quot; in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Berlin. It also operates 11 restaurants in London, Los Angeles and Miami beach, seven hotels, including Babington House in Somerset, as well as London&apos;s oldest cinema, the Electric in Notting Hill. The rooftop pool of the New York club, situated in the once shabby, now stylish Meatpacking district, was featured in an episode of Sex and the City, and the clubs have attracted an exclusive membership particularly in the media and film worlds. Some 26,000 people are now members worldwide, with 11,000 on waiting lists. New sites in Mumbai and Chicago have reportedly been agreed, while Jones and Caring have been eager to expand to San Francisco and Washington as well as exploring sites in Shanghai and other Asian cities such as Singapore, potentially on a franchise model. &quot;Ron believes in the way we do things and the resilience of our membership offering,&quot; Jones said.&quot; &quot;Though we&apos;ve had a number of interested parties table offers for Soho House in the last few years, I believe that Ron shares our vision, and provides us with the backing to expand and improve our clubs whilst remaining true to our original ethos.&quot; Burkle also owns stakes in bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble, American Apparel and the Pathmark grocery chain and invested $100m in rapper P Diddy&apos;s clothing line Sean John. In 2009 his investment vehicle Yucaipa took a $75m stake in the Morgans Hotel Group.

Just a day after being endorsed by the largest newspaper in South Carolina, Jon Huntsman announced he was withdrawing from the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Less than \u00a0a week before, Huntsman elatedly told a crowd of &quot;ladies and gentlemen&quot; backing his candidacy that his third place showing in New Hampshire was a &quot;ticket to ride&quot; to South Carolina&apos;s pivotal primary. If he had a ticket to ride, wags joked, he don&apos;t care. In reality, few observers thought Huntsman&apos;s nearly 17% of the vote in New Hampshire \u2013 roughly six percentage points behind Ron Paul \u2013 would help him much in South Carolina or beyond. Even after the best showing of his campaign, Huntsman remained mired in the single digits in most states and national polls of Republican voters. Huntsman was a popular former governor of Utah. He had served President George HW Bush as ambassador to Singapore and deputy US trade representative. Yet, the most recent line in his resume was, in the eyes of many Republicans, disqualifying: ambassador to China under President Barack Obama. In theory, serving under Obama gave Huntsman a unique vantage point from which to challenge him. It also created a narrative for his candidacy that proved attractive to Huntsman chief strategist, and former John McCain adviser, John Weaver: &quot;Country first.&quot; Many conservatives didn&apos;t see working for Obama, even in a traditionally nonpartisan role, as putting country above party. They saw it as an act of disloyalty, or worse, putting power before principle. That wasn&apos;t the last time Huntsman misread the GOP electorate: he clearly took the view, popular in the aftermath of Obama&apos;s election, that the GOP needed to tone down its rhetoric to regain the White House. Huntsman failed to predict that Democratic government would nudge the country back to the right on its own, giving rise to the Tea Party. Huntsman was the subject of several flattering profiles in the mainstream media that portrayed him as a voice of sanity that would deliver his party from rightwing crazies. In his own campaign announcement, he emphasised civility, which many conservatives regard as a moderate Republican code word for &quot;surrender&quot;. Although it is possible this positioning was an accident, Huntsman&apos;s connection to Weaver gave credence to the idea that this was a deliberate campaign strategy. Weaver ran McCain&apos;s 2000 campaign, in which the candidate attacked large parts of the Republican base, \u00a0most notably denouncing two prominent religious right leaders as &quot;agents of intolerance&quot;. McCain didn&apos;t win the nomination that year, in no small part because such rhetoric doomed him in closed primaries where independents couldn&apos;t vote. So, Huntsman casually tweeted about his belief in evolution and climate change. &quot;Call me crazy,&quot; he quipped. Many conservatives felt that Huntsman was actually calling them crazy. Many of his campaign&apos;s obituaries will read, in effect, &quot;Weaver defeats Huntsman.&quot; (Weaver rejects this interpretation of events.) But instead of having a former Utah governor&apos;s standing to distance himself from the base, as an ex-Obama appointee, Huntsman actually had a greater obligation to demonstrate his conservative bona fides. Those conservative credentials were not insubstantial. As a pro-life governor, he signed a law that would immediately ban abortion in Utah if Roe v Wade was ever overturned. He was a second amendment supporter. He cut taxes. And in his campaign, he was the only Republican presidential candidate to enthusiastically support House budget committee chairman Paul Ryan&apos;s controversial plan to transform Medicare and rein in entitlement spending. Huntsman did make some effort to reach out to the conservative movement. He appeared at center-right think tanks and spoke to conservative journalists. Michael Brendan Dougherty penned a long profile emphasising Huntsman&apos;s conservatism. Activist conservative blogger Erick Erickson gave him a well-publicised second look. But the &quot;Huntsman daughters&quot; ended up being a much bigger part of the candidate&apos;s marketing. There was one other area where Huntsman tried to distinguish himself from the rest of the GOP field: foreign policy. He opposed the Libya war, called for a US withdrawal from Afghanistan, and courageously spoke out against torture. But he also refused to call the Iraq war a mistake and said repeatedly he was open to another preventive war against Iran. Huntsman&apos;s attempt to be a more moderate critic of foreign adventurism than Paul ended up just muddying the waters. The Huntsman candidacy did start an interesting debate about whether conservatives prioritised red-state identity politics over policy proposals in choosing their candidates. The Atlantic&apos;s Conor Friedersdorf dubbed it &quot;frivolity&quot; that Huntsman&apos;s jokes and tweets were considered more important than his free-market policies. If Mitt Romney \u2013 the man Huntsman is now endorsing \u2013 goes down in flames, it is possible this smart candidate will get another chance. Huntsman would become a much smarter candidate if he heeded a tweet, of all things, from political consultant Jon Henke:    Lesson of the Huntsman campaign: Join the tribe before you go off the reservation.&mdash; Jon Henke (@JonHenke) January 16, 2012  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/16/george-osborne-china-currency-trading", "sentences": ["Britain is certainly right to want to take up such an offer \u2013 if not, China would merely use Frankfurt, Dubai, Singapore or some other centre to complement Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-16T21:02:02Z", "title": "George Osborne courts China \u2013 but does he have enough to offer? | John Ross", "tags": ["China", "Currencies", "George Osborne", "Asia Pacific", "UK news", "World news", "Foreign currency", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Business", "Politics"], "article": "     George Osborne&apos;s deal to make the UK a major trading centre for China&apos;s currency, the renminbi, demonstrates that the City of London is trying to retain its role as the offshore base for the world&apos;s reserve currency. The City rebuilt itself in the 1970s primarily to be the non-US trading centre for the Eurodollar market but, as this market declines, it wants to become the offshore centre for the rising reserve currency \u2013 the renminbi. The British economy urgently needs this. Contrary to the chancellor&apos;s bluster about the UK now being a relative success, only held down by eurozone infection, no other economy in the world has suffered as great a decline as the UK during the financial crisis \u2013 a reality only masked by the government declining to state the effects of a huge sterling devaluation. Gauged by actual international money \u2013 that is, the dollar in current market prices \u2013 no other national economy has shrunk even remotely as much as the UK. The fall in UK GDP from 2007-10 was $562bn, compared to the next worst-performing national economy, Italy, with a decline of $65bn. In other words, in real international terms the fall in UK GDP was more than eight times that of the next worst-performing economy. When 2011&apos;s figures are published they will show no significant recovery. Germany recovered from the international financial crisis in significant part through its orientation to China \u2013 Germany now exports more to China than to the US. In the last four years, China&apos;s economy grew by 42.2%, and the US by 0%, so Germany&apos;s reorientation away from a stagnant US economy, and towards the rapidly growing Asian ones, was a move that paid off handsomely. Osborne clearly hopes to replicate in financial services what Germany achieved in manufacturing. The problem is that the instrument Osborne is using to spearhead this reorientation, the City of London, is the one that caused the UK&apos;s economy to fall deeper than any other. Germany has something serious to sell China \u2013 its high-quality machine tools are exchanged for China&apos;s medium technology consumer goods to the mutual benefit of both. China&apos;s gain from the new agreement with London on the renminbi is evident \u2013 it has no intention of engaging in a Thatcheresque rapid removal of exchange controls, and therefore requires one or, ever better, several offshore bases, to conduct its increasing overseas renminbi operations. Britain is certainly right to want to take up such an offer \u2013 if not, China would merely use Frankfurt, Dubai, Singapore or some other centre to complement Hong Kong. The problem is that while London may have applied to become the European version of Hong Kong, China sees a more integrated Europe as its key partner \u2013 the UK is too small an economy to be an adequate counterpart for China, only the US and the EU are on a scale that can fulfill that role. Therefore China has repeatedly made clear it supports greater EU integration \u2013 which, unfortunately for any UK strategy, is something David Cameron has just opted out of. The UK has just taken a tactical step forward in a necessary reorientation towards China. But unless it can combine this with reintegrating itself in the EU it will not be able to turn this into a coherent strategy towards what, in about five years, will be the world&apos;s largest economy \u2013 and soon afterwards the world&apos;s reserve currency."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/jan/18/boris-island-airport-seatbelt", "sentences": ["Singapore (excellent) and Hong Kong (a Foster island-project built in four years) \u2013 they are more top-down societies than our own stroppy one \u2013 both built marine airports at great speed."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-18T13:03:14Z", "title": "Boris Island airport: don't fasten your seatbelt yet", "tags": ["Air transport", "Boris Johnson", "London politics", "Transport policy", "Politics", "London", "Transport", "UK news"], "article": "Steady on, ministers. We are all still absorbing the arguments for and against the HS2 high-speed train link from London to (eventually) Scotland. Yet some bright spark has briefed the Daily Telegraph that David Cameron and George Osborne are edging towards endorsement of the mayor of London&apos;s grandiose plan to replace Heathrow airport with a &quot;Boris Island&quot; job in the misty Thames estuary. What on earth is going on? A cunning wheeze to help Boris Johnson get re-elected as London&apos;s mayor on 3 May? That seems a bit extravagant, not to say unwise, given Boris&apos;s political appetite. A thoughtful strategic contribution to maintaining the UK&apos;s business and tourism potential in the coming Asian century? Maybe, if you say so. A device to annoy the Lib Dems, who oppose all further expansion in the south-east, putting Nick Clegg on the spot? A mischievous thought. A grandiose bit of monumentalism by legacy-conscious politicians in search of a big project instead of a &quot;big society&quot; because they&apos;re not sure what to do next? Hmm. We&apos;re getting warmer. A quick flick through the cuttings confirms that many people who should know what they&apos;re talking about routinely dismiss such chatter as pie in the sky \u2013 Lord Foster&apos;s rival model was thus described here \u2013 on grounds of cost (up to \u00a350bn), safety, the environment and the probability that it would take decades to build. Not so long ago Cameron seemed to be against it, even though he&apos;d cancelled Heathrow&apos;s mooted third runway, the quickie option for easing hub congestion in the south-east. Boris&apos;s ideas were being shrugged off. On the radio today, Colin Matthews, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) chief executive, sounded polite but less than persuaded. So does British Airways&apos;s Willie Walsh. Boris persisted and produced two reports, proper bits of work, albeit only ever likely to reach the &quot;right&quot; conclusion. We shouldn&apos;t laugh at grandiose ideas just because they&apos;re a bit mad. Foster, who has built his share of big projects, likens such schemes to Paxton&apos;s Crystal Palace or Joseph Bazelgette&apos;s brilliant network of Victorian London sewers. They take confidence, something we have lost and which our leaders are always seeking to re-discover \u2013 hence the Millennium Dome, which came good in the end as the O2, and hence the Olympic regeneration scheme in east London (touch wood). In the here and now, Heathrow runs at 98% capacity \u2013 as does much of London&apos;s transport network, which is why employers want staff to work from home during the Olympics and overload the internet instead \u2013 and is losing trade, especially east Asian trade, to EU rivals. &quot;Where will London&apos;s next runway be built?&quot; I once asked an aviation chief. &quot;Schipol,&quot; he replied. As Gwyn Topham reports, Boris himself made light of difficulties. Singapore (excellent) and Hong Kong (a Foster island-project built in four years) \u2013 they are more top-down societies than our own stroppy one \u2013 both built marine airports at great speed. And there are plenty of sovereign wealth funds eager to help build ours, knowing that airports provide a strong, secure revenue stream, the mayor explained in a Boris-ish way on Radio 4. Ever since the decline of the London docks the estuary has been in need of rejuvenation, he reminded listeners all over the country who may feel their own infrastructure needs a bit of attention too. The CAA makes its case for urgent action here. A third runway at Heathrow? That&apos;s what the Heathrow recidivists would prefer, but it&apos;s a temporary solution that would prove a disaster, says the mayor. A quarter of all Europeans suffering from aircraft noise (I love statistics like this) do so around Heathrow. It&apos;s an important point: an east-west pair of runways that require many planes a day to fly over a major world city is not ideally situated. The Daily Mail was among those who spotted that George Osborne was shifting Boris&apos;s way last November, taking with him Justine Greening, his protege, now transport secretary, and \u2013 significantly - Cameron&apos;s in-house ideas boffin, Steve Hilton. Greening got a bit snooty with MPs on the Commons transport select committee when they tried to pin her down. She won&apos;t do that again. Under the memorable headline BoJo has mojo, the influential website ConservativeHome is also onside. Rodney Chambers, leader of Medway council, whom you might expect to endorse such a powerful economic boost to his neighbourhood \u2013 times have been tough in the Medway towns since the navy left \u2013 raises a powerful point. The nearby Isle of Grain contains one of the world&apos;s largest liquefied natural gas terminals, not an ideal spot either. Then there&apos;s the little matter of sinking Britain and the need for another Thames barrier. It would be part of the airport project, explain the boosters. On Today, the mayor casually dismissed two more challenges: birdlife and the SS Montgomery, which \u2013 he did not explain \u2013 lies buried in the Thames mud loaded with 1,400 tonnes of second world war explosives. At this point I would normally refer you to Wikipedia for further detail, but it is on strike in protest against the short sighted folly of the US Congress&apos;s new anti-piracy law. Fair enough. I&apos;m sure the SS Montgomery&apos;s timebomb can be avoided during construction or deactivated if necessary, though the birds may be a bigger problem \u2013 the mayor has always had difficulty with them. But you do have to wonder about the cost-benefits of all this \u2013 and the technical and travelling trends. The HS2 calculations are not wholly persuasive. All that time saved for business travellers? All that extra business generated in the regions? Oh really? What is the true economic benefit of all those transit passengers using Heathrow (or Charles de Gaulle) to fly on elsewhere? And these huge new jets (are they really made of plastic?), how will they change demand? The good news \u2013 and the bad \u2013 is that, for all today&apos;s chatter and George Osborne&apos;s curiously tactless observation that the savings of &quot;hard-working Chinese&quot; can be deployed on UK infrastructure projects, cautious governments will take their time. Labour tilted towards greater car use \u2013 and Livingstone-style congestion charges \u2013 only to tilt back again in the face of car-loving consumer resistance. It fretted over cheap flights and taxed them, but didn&apos;t check them. In the end Gordon Brown finally endorsed the third Heathrow runway, only to see George and Dave \u2013 as the mayor calls them on the radio \u2013 cancel it during their own (brief) green phase. Last March, the Department for Transport published a consultation paper on sustainability (pdf). Consulations are under way for a draft \u2013 yes, draft \u2013 aviation white paper, now due in 2013. Don&apos;t book your flight out of Boris International yet and certainly don&apos;t fasten your seatbelt. And that&apos;s even without getting into the triangular coalition politics between the Cameroons, the greenish Lib Dems and the very blue mayor."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jan/19/how-to-cook-perfect-egg-fried-rice", "sentences": ["Sylvia Tan&apos;s Singapore Heritage Food, which has a helpful section on the traditional snacks of the country&apos;s Chinese community, also cooks the egg in the centre of the pan, in extra oil this time, and then piles the rice on top and leaves it to steam."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-19T00:10:00Z", "title": "How to cook perfect egg fried rice", "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "Chinese new year", "Vegetarian food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Rice"], "article": "There&apos;s something suspicious about egg fried rice. Like garlic naan, or sausage pasta bake, it seems too perfectly tailored to British tastes to have ever seen the light of day in its alleged homeland. But, if the living legend that is Ken Hom is to be believed, I malign it falsely: he claims to have &quot;grown up&quot; on the stuff at Chinese banquets \u2013 no one, apparently, actually eats the dishes of fried rice which herald the end of festivities, but their belated arrival hammers home the host&apos;s generosity in allowing you to fill your boots with pricey meat and fish first. Personally, I&apos;d rather eat a vat of fried rice than a plate of cold jellyfish or a tureen of shark fin soup any day, but then my tastes are not exactly refined.The other major market for fried rice is as a snack food \u2013 it&apos;s the ideal way to use up your leftovers, and this time, there&apos;s the distinct advantage of actually getting to eat it. So, even if you&apos;re not sitting down to an eight-course banquet for Chinese new year this week, you can have a little taste of one of the best parts of the menu, with the distinct advantage of no jellyfish as a distraction.  Although in British restaurants, we tend to hoof down fried rice as a side dish, it can comfortably serve as dinner itself, especially if you throw in a few extra vegetables or some chopped up meat or seafood. Rose Prince puts it perfectly in The New English Kitchen when she says that &quot;an enormous bowl ... on the knee \u2013 a big cup of jasmine tea beside \u2013 makes an immaculate dinner on its own&quot;. The only thing I&apos;d add is that a big glass of cold beer is an excellent substitute. If, you know, you&apos;ve had a bad day. The rice     Ching-He Huang recipe egg fried rice. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    The consensus is that egg fried rice should be made with long grain rice, as is commonly eaten in south and eastern China, where such dishes originate. Most recipes are no more specific than this, although Delia Smith calls for basmati, and Ching-He Huang jasmine which, although long-grained, is slightly stickier than most varieties.  Obviously, as fried rice is generally made with leftovers, the type of rice will depend on what you&apos;ve been cooking the night before, but I think basmati is wasted here \u2013 the delicate aromas are lost in the brutally hot wok. Simple long grain is fine, but jasmine is even better \u2013 its slight stickiness keeps it feeling moist, which contrasts pleasingly with the crunch of the toasted bits from the bottom of the pan.  Pre-cooking?     Good Food recipe egg fried rice. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    Delia echoes popular opinion when she says that &quot;the golden rule of stir-frying rice successfully is to always make sure the cooked rice is absolutely cold&quot;. If you try and make it with freshly cooked rice, she says &quot;it goes all sticky&quot;. This makes sense \u2013 freshly cooked rice is necessarily moist, which is not ideal for throwing into a hot wok, but it&apos;s frustrating if you fancy fried rice on a whim, and the cupboard is bare.  BBC Good Food has made a brave stab at a &quot;fast and easy&quot; version, where the rice is boiled and drained, then added straight to the wok. It&apos;s tasty (frying generally has that effect on food, I find), but although it doesn&apos;t quite go as &quot;soggy and oily&quot; as predicted by rice expert Sri Owen, author of the indispensable Rice Book, it also doesn&apos;t quite come together in the way I expect. Damp, is the word. And damp is not what I&apos;m after.  I also try using rice that&apos;s cooled, but not fridge cold, and, although the difference isn&apos;t huge, it does seem slightly mushier. The rice doesn&apos;t need to be left overnight, as some suggest, but for best results, it should definitely be refrigerated before use. Egg     Rose Prince recipe egg fried rice. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    One of the beauties of fried rice is that it will gratefully embrace just about any old leftovers you throw at it (hunks of stilton excepted) but whatever you put in, egg should be mandatory. Not only does it add protein, but a delicious richness too. When you add it, however, is up for debate.  Ching-He Huang scrambles the eggs first, then removes them from the pan while she cooks the rice, before combining the two. Allegra McEvedy &quot;half scrambles&quot; them in the hot wok for 20 seconds before adding the rice. Rose Prince stir-fries the rice first, then pushes it back and scrambles the egg in the centre of the pan before mixing the two together, while Ken Hom adds the beaten egg to the rice and stirs it all together so the egg is absorbed by the rice.      Ken Hom recipe egg fried rice. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    I like Ken&apos;s method best \u2013 the others seem to give large, dryish flakes of egg, which remain quite separate from the rice, while his rice is richly golden all the way through. Sylvia Tan&apos;s Singapore Heritage Food, which has a helpful section on the traditional snacks of the country&apos;s Chinese community, also cooks the egg in the centre of the pan, in extra oil this time, and then piles the rice on top and leaves it to steam. This is very curious indeed \u2013 I end up with a chewy base of singed rice and rubbery egg, and it&apos;s difficult to see how this method would ever work, unless something vital is missing from the recipe. The heat is on     Allegra McEvedy recipe egg fried rice. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    It&apos;s important, as Ken Hom explains, to make sure that the wok is very hot when the rice hits it, but Sri Owen recommends then turning down the heat low to cook the egg more gently. I prefer Allegra&apos;s method of stir-frying on a high heat until the rice &quot;smells good and is beginning to get nice little brown crunchy bits&quot; \u2013 a description mouthwatering enough to have me reaching for the chopsticks. Extras     Sylvia Tam recipe egg fried rice. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    Rose Prince suggests cooking the rice in a mixture of groundnut and sesame oils, while Ken Hom adds a little sesame oil to the beaten egg. I&apos;m not keen on either approach however \u2013 like soy sauce, or fish sauce (which I see recommended as a magic secret ingredient on an American cookery forum) the nutty flavour of sesame overpowers the toasted rice. Both should, in my opinion, be added at the table if desired.  Fried garlic, as suggested by Good Food and Sylvia Tam, is just unpleasant in my opinion \u2013 this is one of the few places where it&apos;s not welcome. The fresh greenness of a few finely chopped spring onions complements the rich rice far better. They also add a dash of Chinese five spice, which I quite like, but again, less is more when it comes to such simple pleasures. Let the rice do the talking.

European safety regulators ordered the checks for a flaw that first emerged in the wake of an A380 engine blowout in 2010, when a Qantas-owned jet suffered a serious engine failure over Indonesia. Subsequent inspections of the Airbus aircraft revealed hairline cracks in a rib-foot \u2013 part of the metal frame of a wing. Further cracks were then found on other A380s, but in the latest development the European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) said a &quot;new form of cracking&quot; had now been found that was more significant than previous flaws. Easa said in a statement on Friday: &quot;This condition, if not detected and corrected, could potentially affect the structural integrity of the aeroplane.&quot; It added that further mandatory actions might be considered as the investigation continues. It has ordered inspections for A380s that have flown more than 1,300 flight cycles \u2013 where an outbound and return flight count as one cycle \u2013 over the next six weeks. Some of the 525-seat planes, those which have flown more than 1,800 cycles, will have to be checked by next Friday. &quot;It has been determined that the \u2026 cracks may develop on other aeroplanes after a period of time in service,&quot; said Airbus. According to the Flightglobal website, the order affects at least 20 A380s: 10 owned by Singapore Airlines, seven owned by Emirates, one owned by Air France and two Airbus test planes. There are 68 A380s in service worldwide. The problem relates to brackets that attach A380 ribs - elongated, oval-shaped frames which run along the width of the wing - to the wing material. There are more than 2,000 of these brackets per A380 wing but it is understood that cracks have been discovered on only a few of them. The flaw is caused by the pressure exerted on bolt holes when the brackets are attached to the ribs. Airbus has already adjusted the manufacturing process for its A380s, with the cracks occurring on planes that were among the first to roll off Airbus production lines. Airbus said the additional cracks had been found on a &quot;limited number of non-critical&quot; rib-feet brackets. The European aerospace group added: &quot;Airbus emphasises that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft. Airbus is working closely with the airworthiness authorities and its customers as we proceed.&quot; The A380 wings are made at the Airbus plant in Broughton, Wales. An Australian engineering union accused Airbus of playing down the problem. &quot;They [Airbus] have described these as tiny cracks, but every crack starts off as a tiny crack and they can grow very quickly,&quot; said Stephen Purvinas, federal secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association. &quot;I would be worried that Airbus aren&apos;t taking seriously the ever-increasing number of cracks being found in the wings of their A380 aircraft. Put it this way: I wouldn&apos;t put my family on an A380 at the moment,&quot; he said. Qantas said the latest cracks had not been found on its planes."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/20/pineapple-roast-recipes-dan-lepard", "sentences": ["My friend Jiong Wah Foo in Singapore told me that creaming the butter and sugar first makes the pastry much lighter."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-20T22:59:02Z", "title": "Recipes for roast pineapple, coconut meringues and rum cream, plus pineapple tarts | Dan Lepard", "tags": ["Fruit", "Spirits", "Baking", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "Slow baking brings out a beautiful, calm, sweet flavour in pineapple, similar to the effect caramel has on banana.

We snooped around until, sure enough, we spotted a handwritten menu hanging on the wall of one of the blocks. Inside, two scruffy rooms were crammed with people guzzling boiled dumplings with sides of boiled cabbage and spicy rice jelly, while the chef worked in the steamy kitchen and members of his family handed out food and barked orders at the guests. Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, is a city obsessed with eating. According to Wang Xudong, editor of Sichuan Cuisine magazine, it has the highest density of restaurants and teahouses of any city in the world \u2013 some 40,000 at the latest estimate. Food crazes tear across the culinary landscape like prairie fires; local radio hosts recite news of the latest restaurant openings in drooling tones. In 2010 Unesco designated Chengdu the first City of Gastronomy in Asia, ahead of Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. To win this accolade, local officials and food historians had to demonstrate the city&apos;s distinctive culinary culture, including special ingredients, dishes and cooking methods; its vibrant restaurant scene and traditional food industry; and its commitment to environmental sustainability and gastronomic education. &quot;Apart from the panda,&quot; says Professor Du Li of the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine, &quot;nothing is more important to the Sichuanese than food. People here love to search out small restaurants in out-of-the-way places that may just specialise in a couple of dishes.&quot; The Sichuanese is undoubtedly one of China&apos;s great cuisines, thrilling in its flavours, diverse in its ingredients and encompassing everything from refined banquet dishes to the most scrumptious street snacks. Though often known by outsiders simply as &quot;hot and spicy&quot;, it is better characterised by its startling range of flavours, from the infamous &quot;numbing and hot&quot; combination of chillies and Sichuan pepper through to understated dishes in which the essential tastes of prime ingredients shine through. The past decade has seen the disappearance of most of the city&apos;s old lanes, with their street vendors, markets and artisanal food producers; a kitchen invasion by Cantonese bottled sauces and chicken-stock powder, and the arrival of a plethora of new influences, including Japanese-style sashimi and western fast food. So where, in this city of dizzying gastronomic choice, should a visitor eat?     A street stall, Chengdu Photograph: Peter Adams/Getty Images    It would be a shame not to sample the street food that gave the world such delights as dan dan noodles and man-and-wife offal slices (a\u00a0potent appetiser of tripe and other titbits tossed with chilli oil, Sichuan pepper and crushed nuts and seeds). Real street traders are increasingly hard to find, but look out for those offering custardy &quot;flower&quot; bean curd (dou hua) scattered with fragrant oils and crunchy pickles. The vendors can be recognised by their red-and-black wooden barrels. Many old-fashioned snacks have migrated indoors into little restaurants, such as Granny Wang&apos;s, which serves buckwheat noodles made on the spot with a\u00a0huge press. Ideally one would buy each snack from a specialist vendor, but for an overview it&apos;s worth visiting the opulent Shunxing Teahouse in Hong Kong-style Century City, where you can order a set menu of a dozen or more &quot;small eats&quot; while watching a show of face-changing and other local performing arts. One of Sichuan&apos;s most notorious delicacies is the &quot;ox-tripe hotpot&quot;, originally a speciality of the great Yangtze metropolis of Chongqing but now popular across the region. It&apos;s an eating ritual best enjoyed at night, when you have hours to fritter away over a seething cauldron of chillies and Sichuan pepper, cooking your own choice of ingredients in the fiery broth and dipping them in sesame oil and crushed garlic to eat. The squeamish should be warned that the most prized hotpot ingredients include not only tripe but other rubbery and slithery ingredients, such as goose intestines and cartilage; there are also fresh mushrooms and vegetables, however, as well as sliced meats and seafood, and a divided hotpot containing a mild stock alongside the traditional brew can be provided for those who&apos;d prefer a\u00a0choice of hot or not. Feverish competition in the catering industry means restaurants are under constant pressure to innovate. Fashions come and go, and businesses often try to sell themselves with a particular gimmick or an unusual regional slant, such as the Wuling Mountain Delicacies chain, which specialises in the mushroom cookery of the Tujia ethnic group (dinner here might include a mushroom hotpot and smoky bacon stir-fried with preserved chillies). &quot;A\u00a0Chinese restaurant in the west might be able to get away with serving gong bao chicken for its whole life, but here they have to change their menus all the time,&quot; says Wang Xudong. Older Sichuan food aficionados often hanker after the flavours of their childhoods and the old mom-and-pop restaurants that have been swept away by the redevelopment of the city. One restaurateur who satisfies the craving for nostalgic flavours is Liu Shaokun, whose establishment in the suburb of Shuangliu is well worth the tedious drive from the city centre. Liu makes his own pickles and cures his own winter meats. House specialities include stewed turtle with potatoes, cold spicy noodles with shredded chicken and peasant soups made with seasonal vegetables. For banquet cookery Yu&apos;s Cuisine, run by maverick chef Yu Bo and his wife Dai Shuang, remains extraordinary. The restaurant has only six private rooms and no \u00e0 la carte menu. A typical feast for a\u00a0group here consists of dozens of dishes, including dazzling vegetarian starters, slow-cooked meats, little buns in the shape of hedgehogs and the odd modernist surprise, such as spherified jasmine tea inspired by a visit to El Bulli. Another original talent is chef Zhang Yuanfu of the Wu Yuan, who offers grand banquets in surroundings inspired by the Qing dynasty. Like Yu Bo&apos;s, his food has an intimacy that is missing amid the rampant commercialisation of the mainstream catering scene. Aside from the food, one of the great pleasures of Chengdu life is the teahouse. A couple of decades ago, there was a teahouse on every back street where people gathered to play cards or mah jong, parade their pet birds or listen to Sichuan opera. Small teahouses can still be found tucked away beside the waterways in quiet corners of the city; easier to find are the larger but equally charming teahouses in the parks. One favourite is the sprawling riverside teahouse in Wangjiang Park, where you can have your ears cleaned with goose feathers as you nibble watermelon seeds and sip your jasmine-blossom tea. If by any chance you overeat and feel a little delicate, a medicinal meal might be in order. The Qin Shan Zhai, close to the Temple of Marquis Wu and the city&apos;s Tibetan quarter, specialises in tonic soups. Every dish on the menu is accompanied by a description of its curative properties: tea-smoked goose, for example &quot;eliminates wind-damp and strengthens the bones&quot;, while chicken soup &quot;enriches the blood and body&quot;. Order according to your ailments, or if you prefer, make up a\u00a0few as an excuse for eating the dishes you fancy.

The business, which was founded by entrepreneur Mike Balfour as a single gym in Bournemouth 19 years ago, employs about 10,000 staff largely in the UK, Australia and Germany. Owners BC Partners had hoped to float Fitness First on the Singapore stock exchange, appointing advisers including Credit Suisse and JP Morgan last year. That plan was ditched last autumn and subsequent efforts to sell the business have proved fruitless. The last published accounts showed the group had net liabilities \u2013 the sum of its assets minus liabilities \u2013 of \u00a3612m in October 2010. A string of acquisitions and a debt-fuelled private equity structure had left the business, which has 1.2 million gym members, with borrowings of \u00a31.48bn. Much of that debt is held by BC Partners and smaller shareholders \u2013 \u00a3490m in the form of controversial high-interest bearing preference shares. Despite the tough economic climate, under a structure set up in 2005, these preference shares are entitled to an annual dividend of 15%, although payouts are deferred until 2015. The interest bill on similarly onerous preference shares at Peacocks was blamed by some for fatally weakening the Cardiff-based fashion retailer, which fell into administration last week. Administrators from KPMG are looking to sell the business as a going concern. Despite many expressions of interest long-time Peacocks observers feel a piecemeal sell-off is more probable. Fitness First was floated on the junior AIM stock market in 1997 by Balfour, who went on to lead the business through a management buyout backed by Cinven in 2003. At the time his stake in the business was worth \u00a311m \u2014 half of which he is said to have reinvested alongside the new owners. Two years later, Balfour persuaded rival buyout group BC Partners to pay \u00a3835m for the business, funded by about \u00a3500m in borrowing. Balfour left the business in September 2009, several months after Tony de Leede, founder of the group&apos;s Australian business. Both still own significant amounts of shares \u2013 though the value of these is now unclear. BC Partners and others had injected \u00a350m worth of bonds into the business in the autumn of 2010 to help keep it in financial health. A month later, Fitness First&apos;s banks agreed to ease lending terms in exchange for higher interest rates. A more fundamental restructuring of the group&apos;s balance sheet is now required ahead of the loan maturing dates next year. Fitness First has sold its poor-performing Benelux business for \u00a324m \u2013 well below book value \u2013 to help cut borrowings. Stripping out debt owed to BC and other shareholders, Fitness First is now said to have net borrowings of \u00a3550m. Official accounts list its banks as Royal Bank of Scotland and Mizuho, although it is thought neither is among the many lenders with an exposure to the company.

When the company&apos;s reputedly frugal chief executive Tim Cook announces first quarter results on Tuesday, he will be under pressure to start spending some of the estimated $90bn (\u00a358bn) amassed by the maker of the world&apos;s most desirable consumer electronics. It is a huge sum. Last summer, when the US government was debating how to balance its books, Apple held more cash than the US Treasury&apos;s daily operating balance. The world&apos;s largest company by market capitalisation, Apple&apos;s masters of the universe scale can be difficult to comprehend.  As the website Things Apple is Worth More Than points out, the company&apos;s market capitalisation exceeds the gross domestic product of Singapore, the value of gold held at the New York Federal Reserve, the largest bullion store in the world, and the value of the worldwide illegal drugs trade. Investors&apos; favoured option for Apple&apos;s cash mountain would naturally be to resume paying a dividend, something Steve Jobs was vehemently opposed to. The last dividend was paid in 1995, before Jobs returned. Around two thirds of Apple&apos;s cash is held outside the US, and cannot be repatriated without a hefty tax bill \u2013 which limits the amount that can be returned to shareholders. Tavis McCourt at US broker Morgan Keegan believes the company could afford up to $10 or $11 a share.A share buyback could also boost the price, although not as much as turning Apple into a dividend stock, say financial analysts. What Wall Street fears most is that Apple could be tempted to blow billions on a foolish acquisition. Fading technology giants have occasionally resorted to retail therapy in search of a quick fix. Microsoft spent $8.5bn on loss-making internet calls group Skype last year, and Hewlett-Packard, the world&apos;s largest PC maker, spent \u00a37bn acquiring British corporate search software group Autonomy a few months later in a muddled bid to turn itself into a software and services supplier. But Cook is not known for splashing the cash. He slimmed Apple operationally, pulling out of the costly business of making its own hardware, closing factories and warehouses around the world. The company has tended to favour small acquisitions of highly focussed teams of developers and designers. Like the team who developed the iPhone&apos;s Siri voice recognition technology.  Some would like Apple to buy a mobile phone network. Even with its cash hoard, the money would only stretch to masts in the US plus other countries, leaving a subscale operation compared to multinationals like Vodafone. Anyway, Apple is moving on from telecoms. Nothing has been confirmed, but an internet connected television set is expected to be unveiled later this year. The iTV will be more than a screen. If it works in the way the iPod and iPhone worked, it will light a fire under Hollywood&apos;s mighty film and cable TV conglomerates in the way its predecessors disrupted the giants of music and mobile telephony. Consumate Apple watcher and Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi believes the iTV will, like a mobile phone, be based on the subscription model. In the same way that iPhone buyers subsidise the cost of the handset by signing a two-year calls contract with a network, customers will take a subscription for content from the iTunes store. Instead of selling films and TV shows, iTunes will rent them. To take on the broadcasting industry, Apple will need cash. The content will need to be compelling to convince users to sign a subscription, and exclusive first-run pay TV rights do not come cheaply. Bereft of interesting things to watch, Apple&apos;s current TV product \u2013 a box that connects your existing set to the internet \u2013 has been a rare misfire. Adding a very expensive screen will not generate the level of sales that the company needs to continue growing at its current break-neck speed. The iTV will need to convince people to spend more on TV content, perhaps even swap out of their Sky or Virgin Media channels subscription. Does Apple want to become a media company? I would argue that it already is. Gross revenues from iTunes, which totalled $5bn (\u00a33.2bn) in 2011, are greater than ITV&apos;s \u00a32bn turnover and on a par with the BBC&apos;s annual budget of \u00a33.5bn. They are already a third of Amazon&apos;s $15bn takings in 2010 for media sales worldwide. Of course, Apple may prefer to let others do the work. Online TV and film rental services such as Netflix and LoveFilm have financial firepower and are already snapping up the rights to top-flight content. Foreseeing the threat, incumbent pay TV operators like America&apos;s cable companies or the UK&apos;s BSkyB are more likely to hamper than promote their growth. What they need to achieve lift-off is the kind of user-friendly, elegant interface that Apple excels at creating. Whether or not Apple decides its future lies in selling pay-TV, Cook will find it increasingly hard to resist sharing the spoils with shareholders."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/25/florida-primary-candidates-drug-policy", "sentences": ["In an interview with Yahoo News last November, Gingrich noted how &quot;successful&quot; Singapore has been in its response to drug trafficking.", "&quot;Singapore routinely executes people for drug trafficking.", "&quot;It&apos;s not something to be emulated.&quot; Following in Singapore&apos;s footsteps, he pointed out, would require the US to send, &quot;thousands and thousands of people to death sentences annually.&quot; In addition to importing authoritarian models of criminal justice, Gingrich is an outspoken advocate of making it &quot;expensive to be a drug user&quot; by requiring federal aid applicants to submit to drug tests."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-25T19:34:00Z", "title": "Florida primary: where the Republican candidates stand on drugs", "tags": ["Republican presidential nomination 2012", "Drugs policy", "Drugs", "US politics", "US elections 2012", "Mitt Romney", "Newt Gingrich", "Ron Paul", "Rick Santorum", "US news"], "article": "The battle for the Republican nomination has moved to Florida this week, which also happens to be a key battleground in an entirely different fight: the $15bn federally-waged war on drugs. Passed in July of last year, a controversial law requires the state&apos;s welfare recipients to submit to drug testing \u2013 and to pay for the costs of the screening. Nearly 1,600 applicants refused to submit to the testing last year, while over 7,000 took the test and passed. Thirty-two of the applicants failed, the majority of whom tested positive for marijuana.  The law was temporarily blocked in October, but required testing for federal aid has become a hot-button issue in drug policy debates, and has received the explicit endorsement of Newt Gingrich. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of a 35-year-old single father who objected to the legislation, arguing the law violated his 4th amendment rights With more than 100,000 inmates, the Sunshine State&apos;s prison system is the third largest in the country, and costs $2.1bn a year to maintain, according to Julie Ebenstein, policy and advocacy counsel with Florida&apos;s chapter of the ACLU. Ebenstein believes that inmates serving time for drug charges would be better \u2013 and more affordably \u2013 served by treatment rather than spending time behind bars. In addition to devastating countless families, Ebenstein argues the drug war in Florida has amounted to a massive misappropriation of taxpayer dollars \u2013 an injustice that often resonates among conservative voters. &quot;The tough on crime policies have neither abated crime nor abated drug use,&quot; Ebenstein argues. They have instead, &quot;burdened the state with these huge increasing costs of prisons.&quot; The issue of drug policy has not come up much in the debates so far, but each of the four remaining Republican candidates \u2013 Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul \u2013 has addressed it in some form in the past. A primer on where they stand: Newt Gingrich     Newt Gingrich / Reuters    As House Speaker, Gingrich introduced the Drug Importer Death Penalty Act of 1996, which would have legalized the execution of any person caught smuggling drugs into the US more than once, so long as the individual carried 100 or more doses (an ounce of high-grade marijuana could conceivably qualify). First time offenders would have faced life in prison and defendants would have a window of just 18 months to file their one and only appeal. While the law did not pass, Gingrich expressed his support for, in his own words, &quot;very draconian&quot; measures as recently as last year. In an interview with Yahoo News last November, Gingrich noted how &quot;successful&quot; Singapore has been in its response to drug trafficking. &quot;They&apos;ve communicated with great intention that they intend to stop drugs from coming into their countries,&quot; Gingrich explained. Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch Asia Division, has a different take. &quot;Singapore routinely executes people for drug trafficking. They consider themselves as having about the harshest drug laws in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not something to be emulated.&quot; Following in Singapore&apos;s footsteps, he pointed out, would require the US to send, &quot;thousands and thousands of people to death sentences annually.&quot; In addition to importing authoritarian models of criminal justice, Gingrich is an outspoken advocate of making it &quot;expensive to be a drug user&quot; by requiring federal aid applicants to submit to drug tests. Of last year&apos;s major drug war initiatives, drug testing is &quot;the principle issue,&quot; said Ethan Nadlemann, the executive director of Drug Policy Action, an organization that works across party lines to advocate for alternatives to the drug war. &quot;It&apos;s a remarkably invasive and ugly policy,&quot; he argued, adding that, &quot;There&apos;s lots of evidence that it&apos;s ineffective and costly.&quot; Nadlemann called Gingrich &quot;basically a nightmare&quot; when it comes to issues of drug policy. &quot;For a guy who&apos;s supposed to be an intellectual and intelligent, the quality of the argumentation on his part is embarrassing&quot;. Mitt Romney     Mitt RomneyAFP/Getty Images    While Mitt Romney has been less vocal in his views on drug policy, his record as governor of Massachusetts and his interaction with potential voters suggests a deep reluctance to reform. In one 2007 video a medical marijuana user asks if the former Massachusetts governor would have him arrested for his choice of medication. After saying that he is opposed to medical marijuana, Romney turns his back on the wheelchair-bound young man, leaving his question unanswered. &quot;Even apart from the medical marijuana,&quot; Nadlemann says, &quot;he has been just terrible on this issue.&quot; Nadlemann refers back to 2006, when then-governor Romney vetoed a bill allowing pharmacies to provide individuals clean hypodermic needles without a prescription. The measure would have cost the state nothing, and health experts argued it would help curb the spread of infectious disease. In addition, proponents noted, it would have saved funds otherwise spent on emergency medical care. Romney argued the program would have &quot;unintended consequences&quot; and encourage the use of heroin. The Massachusetts legislature ultimately overturned Romney&apos;s veto, joining 47 other states that allow access to clean needles. Rick Santorum     Rick Santorum/Getty Images    Like Romney, Rick Santorum has been relatively quiet on the issue of drug policy. Also like Romney, a videotaped encounter has provided insight into what the former Pennsylvania senator knows \u2013 or chooses to ignore \u2013 about drug policy. Earlier this month Santorum was confronted by a member of the group Students for Sensible Drug Policy. The candidate, who has framed himself as a champion of family values, was asked whether he would continue to send non-violent drug offenders to prison as president, a punishment that routinely tears families apart. Santorum responded, &quot;Wow \u2026 the federal government doesn&apos;t do that.&quot; In fact, drug offenders make up nearly half of the federal prison population, almost 100,000 people. According to the US department of justice, in 2009 the most serious crime committed by over 95,000 prisoners was a drug charge. In a second video posted by the group this year, Santorum cops to being uninformed. When asked about states&apos; rights and the federal government&apos;s role in enforcing medical marijuana laws, the presidential hopeful says, &quot;I don&apos;t know my medical marijuana laws very well.&quot; He then goes on to say, &quot;they are a hazardous thing for society.&quot; Ron Paul     Ron Paul/Getty Images    An ardent libertarian, Ron Paul stands apart from his competitors. Paul has explicitly called for an end to the war on drugs, arguing the effort amounts to a colossal waste of money. He did not mince words speaking during a November presidential debate when he said flatly, &quot;I think the federal war on drugs is a total failure.&quot;  Paul points to the disproportionate impact drug laws have had on communities of color resulting in the ballooning prison population. Running for president in 1988, he made a stop at the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. It was the same period in which a series of racist newsletters bearing his name were being circulated. Still, the congressman from Texas noted discrepancies in the persecution of ethnic groups based on the substances they were believed to enjoy. Paul pointed out that while ethnic groups were persecuted for their association with certain substances, the abuse of alcohol, which he argued was the preferred intoxicant of congressmen, was not used as pretext for targeting people.  More recently Paul has said that the prohibition of drugs in the United States directly contributes to Mexico&apos;s soaring death toll \u2013 now estimated at least 50,000 \u2013 by bankrolling ultra-violent cartels. Like alcoholism, Paul claims, drug abuse should be treated as a medical issue. He has co-sponsored legislation in favor of medical marijuana and believes that Drug Enforcement Agency raids on medical marijuana clinics are unconstitutional. At its core, Paul believes the drug war represents an unjustifiable assault on individual liberty. &quot;Ron Paul has been excellent,&quot; Nadlemann remarks. Nadlemann describes Paul&apos;s presence in the ongoing race as &quot;refreshing&quot; and says comments regarding the drug war have been spot-on. &quot;They&apos;re strong, they&apos;re smart and it&apos;s encouraging the way they&apos;re getting substantial applause in the primary debates.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/25/kim-dotcom-jetset-image-megaupload-fortune", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;ve seen him driving around with his &apos;GUILTY&apos; number plate.&quot; But regardless of this lower profile, the FBI indictment of Dotcom and four others calls for the forfeiture of cash worth \u00a3175m and listed 57 bank accounts in Australia, Slovakia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Singapore, China, Germany and New Zealand."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-25T19:44:07Z", "title": "Kim Dotcom's brash jetset image 'hid sharp business mind'", "tags": ["Kim Dotcom", "Megaupload", "New Zealand", "US news", "Germany", "Technology", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Filesharing", "Internet", "Computing", "Film", "Music", "Netherlands"], "article": "He lived a life dominated by fast cars, holidays on $10m super-yachts and an obsession with shoot &apos;em up computer games. But on Wednesday associates of Kim Dotcom, the former hacker wanted by the FBI over download sites allegedly costing copyright holders at least $500m (\u00a3320m), claimed his cartoon-like image was carefully calculated to help earn him a fortune. In fact, they said, it obscured a sharp and decisive business intelligence. Dotcom, the 38-year-old German founder of Megaupload.com formerly known as Kim Schmitz, was on Wednesday refused bail by a New Zealand judge who warned he may try to flee the country if he were released from jail pending an extradition hearing on 22 February concerning online piracy charges in the US. Citing the discovery of unlicensed and illegal guns at Dotcom&apos;s rented mansion north of Auckland, where he was arrested with three others on Saturday, David McNaughton said &quot;flight risk remains a real and significant possibility, which I cannot discount&quot;. Dotcom appeared at North Shore district court wearing an all-black outfit. Speaking afterwards his lawyer, Paul Davison, said he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; and that Dotcom &quot;has no intention whatsoever of endeavouring to leave New Zealand&quot;. He said his client would appeal against the decision. Public fascination with the Megaupload case has been fuelled this week by details of Dotcom&apos;s flamboyant lifestyle, conducted under a variety of aliases, including Kimble, King Kimble and Kim Tim Jim Vestor. In 2001, for example, he embarked on a lavish trip to Monaco involving a fleet of supercars, a huge yacht and helicopters. Dotcom also commissioned a documentary for the occasion, which was fronted by a riotous shockhaired German TV comedian, Frank L\u00e4mmermann. The real purpose, a former associate who organised the holiday told the Guardian, was to create a sense of greater wealth than Dotcom actually had while he was raising finance for new businesses. &quot;The parties were in part advertising and PR,&quot; said the associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity. &quot;He wanted to show how he was the biggest and greatest and how he had money. Back in 2000 he didn&apos;t have as much money as he showed the world he did.&quot; The film Kimble Does Monaco shows his entourage on board the Golden Odyssey with bikini-clad women, including Playboy model Gitta Saxx. In one scene a group of semi-naked women is sprayed with champagne by the yacht&apos;s pool while &quot;Captain Kim&quot; looks on, decked out in black suit and polo neck and black and white shoes. In another scene he is serenaded by his cronies around a grand piano, before they decamp to watch the Monte Carlo grand prix from a party room directly above the starting grid. The flamboyance and cult of personality masked not only his intelligence, but also his background and true personality, the associate said. &quot;I was close to him, but I never really know what he was thinking about. Sometimes he was a really nice guy and at other times he was awful. But he was really good at bringing people around him and getting them to do their best for him. He was able to talk to them and motivate them to do what he wanted. &quot;He never talked about his childhood, though I believe he had no contact with his father. He was a bit like the fat boy with no friends who only had his computer.&quot; Indeed, even as the FBI was finalising a charge sheet over Christmas, accusing him of racketeering and money\u00a0laundering in one of the largest criminal copyright cases ever brought by the US, Dotcom posted a video of himself becoming the world&apos;s leading player of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, a computer game which he spent dozens of hours playing. His colleagues marked the achievement of the best &quot;kill to death ratio&quot; by whooping and firing confetti over him and preparing a celebratory cake in the shape of a number 1. Another former business colleague, again speaking anonymously, said Dotcom was &quot;a very smart guy, very clever, very quick on the uptake, very driven, very pedantic&quot;. While he was trustworthy \u2013 &quot;within reason&quot; \u2013 he at times showed symptoms of &quot;anger issues&quot;, and too often &quot;thought money could fix everything&quot;, she said. &quot;He likes playing God.&quot; Dotcom grew up in Kiel, near Hamburg. Having started as a hacker, he then helped firms with IT security. By 2000 he had founded a venture capital firm, Kimvestor, began to make his fortune and became a fixture on Munich&apos;s party scene. As the dotcom bubble burst in early 2001, he bought shares in a struggling website and promised to invest more before cashing-in as the share price rose. Then things went wrong. He was arrested in Thailand in January 2002 and spent five months in jail before being convicted in Munich of insider trading. He was sentenced to 20 months&apos; probation and fined \u20ac100,000. He recently said he had come to regret flaunting his wealth, and defended his conduct during the dotcom high. &quot;My mistake was that I embraced the media and gave them the stories they wanted,&quot; he wrote on the website Torrent Freak in December. &quot;Let&apos;s just put this into the category &apos;young and stupid&apos;. I was giving them a glimpse into my exclusive lifestyle. For this openness I was turned into the scapegoat when the German new economy bubble popped in 2000. &quot;I was convicted for insider trading (actually saving a company and over 120 jobs) and got a probation sentence because the judge and prosecutor offered a deal to my lawyers. My criminal record has been cleared under Germany&apos;s clean slate legislation. Officially I can say I am without convictions. I made mistakes when I was young and I paid the price. I am 37 years old now, I am married, I have three adorable children with two more on the way (twin girls \u2013 yeah) and I know that I am not a bad person. I have grown and I have learned.&quot; Neighbours close to Dotcom&apos;s rented 12-hectare property near Auckland have confirmed he had adopted a relatively low profile before his arrest. &quot;We see him driving around, but he keeps to himself and we&apos;re quite close neighbours,&quot; said Libbi Darroch, as she groomed her 7-year-old showjumper Muffy at the Coatesville pony club. &quot;I&apos;ve seen him driving around with his &apos;GUILTY&apos; number plate.&quot; But regardless of this lower profile, the FBI indictment of Dotcom and four others calls for the forfeiture of cash worth \u00a3175m and listed 57 bank accounts in Australia, Slovakia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Singapore, China, Germany and New Zealand. The list of assets included 15 Mercedes cars with number plates including STONED, MAFIA and POLICE, as well as Maserati, a Rolls-Royce Phantom with the number plate GOD, and a Lamborghini, along with 60 computer servers and various sculptures and artworks. The indictment also alleges that between April and June last year, Dotcom&apos;s companies paid almost $8m to rent yachts in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile in the Netherlands, the prosecutor&apos;s office said Dutch police had arrested a fifth suspect in the alleged conspiracy, identified in the US as Andrus Nomm, a 32-year-old Estonian.

The group, chaired by Pauline Latham, the Conservative MP for Mid Derbyshire, is being set up in the wake of a survey showing that the use of anti-personnel mines in 2011 was the highest for seven years. &quot;This danger must far outweigh their military effectiveness,&quot; Latham said. &quot;Through this new all-party parliamentary group on landmines and unexploded weapons of conflict, we will be holding a number of investigations into their current use, the efforts of agencies to clear existing mines, and the ways we can provide them with every support.&quot; The latest report from Landmine and Cluster Bomb Monitor identifies a growing use of landmines and highlights new laying of mines by Israel, Libya and Burma. Use by non-government armed groups was confirmed in four countries: Afghanistan, Colombia, Burma and Pakistan. The report identified 12 producers of antipersonnel mines - China, Cuba, India, Iran, Burma, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, the US and Vietnam. The UN estimates more than 110m active landmines are scattered in 70 countries around the world. The parliamentary initiative is backed by the Mines Advisory Group a leading mine clearance organisation and co-laureate of the Nobel peace prize. Nick Roseveare, the group&apos;s chief executive, said: &quot;Landmines are often called the sleeping enemy. They are patient and indiscriminate, remaining in the ground long after the conflict is over. And, as with cluster munitions and other unexploded ordnance, inquisitive children and innocent civilians are often the most vulnerable.&quot; He said the group had always acknowledged that the legacy of landmines was more than just the threat of maiming and killing people. &quot;Contaminated land is a physical obstacle to economic development, trapping families in poverty,&quot; he said.

The fall in sales of handsets running Nokia&apos;s Symbian operating system, which the company is phasing out in favour of Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone software, has come harder and faster than the company originally anticipated. But investors took heart from chief executive Stephen Elop&apos;s forecast that the company would reverse a \u20ac954m loss in the fourth quarter of 2011 to reach break-even during the first quarter of 2012, and shares rose in morning trading. Sales of Nokia&apos;s Windows handsets, launched under the Lumia brand last October, have reached &quot;well over 1 million&quot;, the company confirmed. But revenues were down 9% for the full year, to \u20ac39m, and 21% year on year for the final three months of 2011. Fourth quarter performance has slumped from an \u20ac884m profit in 2010 to a loss of \u20ac954m in the same period of 2011. Elop said that Nokia had progressed in the right direction, but added &quot;we are in the heart of our transition&quot;. The Lumia phones, which Elop said had established a &quot;beach-head&quot; for Nokia in the smartphone market, are now on sale in Europe, Hong Kong, India, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. They have also just come out in the United States, and a version capable of running on America&apos;s 4G superfast broadband networks has now launched. &quot;In the war of ecosystems, clearly there are some strong contenders already on the field,&quot; said Elop. &quot;And with Lumia, we have demonstrated we belong on the field.&quot; Income from phones is falling faster than the volume of handsets sold, and Nokia confirmed that competition, which is coming primarily from cheaper Android handsets, had forced it to slash prices. The average price of a smartphone fell from \u20ac154 in the fourth quarter of 2010 to \u20ac140 in 2011, and basic phones dropped from \u20ac42 to \u20ac32. Elop warned his company would sell fewer Symbian devices than previously anticipated, blaming &quot;an acceleration of the anticipated trend towards lower-priced smartphones with specifications that are different from Symbian&apos;s traditional strengths&quot;. He said Nokia&apos;s operating margin in the first quarter of 2012 would be around break-even, give or take 2%, and scrapped annual guidance targets, saying 2012 would be a year of transition, and that the macroeconomic climate made predictions difficult. Revenue from sales of Nokia smart devices fell 27% during 2011 to \u20ac10.8bn, although they rose 25% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. The company sold 19.6m smartphones in the Christmas quarter, up 2.8m on the third quarter. Mobile phone volumes were flat at 93.9m in the Christmas quarter. &quot;Overall, Nokia seems to be tiding over its difficult transition period between Symbian and Windows Phone without too much of downside,&quot; said analyst Janardan Menon at broker Liberum. &quot;We are optimistic about the longer term success of Nokia&apos;s Windows-based Lumia range.&quot; Nokia has cash reserves of \u20ac5.6bn, down from nearly \u20ac7bn last year, but its balance sheet improved during the fourth quarter by \u20ac515m, thanks in large part to a $250m support payment from Microsoft intended to help market the Windows phones."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/26/cameron-davos-germany-eurozone-crisis", "sentences": ["&quot;Let&apos;s get free trade agreements with India, Canada and Singapore finalised by the end of the year,&quot; he said."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-26T19:54:45Z", "title": "Cameron tells Davos: Germany must be bold over eurozone crisis", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Eurozone crisis", "Davos", "Germany", "European banks", "European Union", "Europe", "Politics", "Business", "World news", "UK news", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Davos 2012"], "article": "David Cameron has risked souring Britain&apos;s relations with Berlin in the runup to next week&apos;s crucial European summit by calling on Germany to play a larger role in safeguarding the single currency. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, the prime minister said resolving the ongoing crisis was not just the job of indebted countries such as Greece and Italy, which have been forced to adopt punishing austerity measures; &quot;surplus&quot; countries, such as Germany, should also have to play their part. Picking up an argument made by the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, the prime minister said: &quot;The flip side of austerity in the deficit countries must be action to put the weight of the surplus countries behind the euro.&quot; He added: &quot;I&apos;m not pretending any of this is easy. These are radical, difficult steps for any country to take. Tough fiscal discipline is essential. But this is a problem of trade deficits, not just budget\u00a0deficits.&quot; Britain would like to see Germany boost domestic demand and help to generate growth across the crisis-hit single currency area, but the prime minister&apos;s intervention is likely to infuriate Berlin, as Europe&apos;s leaders prepare to gather for their latest make-or-break summit. Cameron urged all the eurozone&apos;s leaders to follow Britain&apos;s &quot;bold and decisive&quot; action in dealing with its debt crisis as he warned that the continent was facing a &quot;perilous&quot; moment. He argued that three things needed to be done urgently in 2012: &quot;Greece, banks and firewall.&quot; He said the Greek situation needed to be resolved, banks recapitalised and an agreement reached on a new bailout fund for troubled eurozone countries. Despite fresh criticism from the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, over his handling of a domestic economy on the brink of plunging back into recession, Cameron set out a stinging critique of the eurozone&apos;s response to the crisis, and its long-term failure to make itself more competitive. &quot;In Britain, we are taking bold steps necessary to get our economy back on track, but my argument today is that the need for bold action at European level is equally great,&quot; he said. &quot;Europe&apos;s lack of competitiveness remains its achilles heel.&quot; Cameron set out a defence of his own tough stance on cutting spending, saying &quot;to be cautious would have been catastrophic&quot;. Even so, on Wednesday, data showed the UK economy contracted by 0.2% in the final quarter of 2011. Miliband, who is also in Davos, again called for a reversal of austerity measures. &quot;What David Cameron should be doing is taking action at home to get our economy moving and working with other world leaders to get the global economy going. But he is not doing that. He is standing by his policy of collective austerity all round the world. Rather than being so complacent about what is happening in Britain, he needs to wake up and realise that it&apos;s not working.&quot; Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the prime minister of Denmark, promised that Europe&apos;s leaders would do &quot;everything we can to restore Europe and get it back on track and restore discipline&quot; when they meet next week. She argued that the &quot;core problem is not Europe but bad discipline in budgets among some member states&quot;. Enda Kenny, Ireland&apos;s prime minister blamed the crisis on &quot;incompetence of some governments, a lack of trust and internal wrangling&quot;. Cameron launched a fresh assault on the proposed financial transaction tax as &quot;madness&quot;, saying the levy \u2013 also known as a Robin Hood tax \u2013 would cost 500,000 jobs in the EU and cut GDP by up to \u20ac200bn (\u00a3167bn). &quot;Even to be considering this at a time when we are struggling to get our economies growing is quite simply madness,&quot; he said. A spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which wants some of the proceeds of such a tax to be spent on development, said: &quot;Cameron has confused the interests of the Square Mile with the interests of Britain as a whole and is turning down billions that could protect schools, hospitals and jobs.&quot; The former prime minister Gordon Brown said there was a need to boost Africa&apos;s growth prospects. Brown said Africa had 15% of the world&apos;s population for only 1% of world manufacturing and 1% of inward investment, despite growing rapidly in recent years. Cameron also issued a call to arms for trade negotiators, urging them to reach bilateral trade agreements \u2013 a stark contrast to his appearance in Davos last year, when he had regarded 2011 as a key year for the Doha trade round. &quot;Last year, at this very forum, world leaders called for an all-out effort to conclude the Doha round in 2011,&quot; said Cameron. &quot;We said it was the make-or-break year. It was. And we have to be frank about it. It didn&apos;t work.&quot; He said countries should press ahead with &quot;coalitions of the willing&quot;. &quot;Let&apos;s get free trade agreements with India, Canada and Singapore finalised by the end of the year,&quot; he said. Pascal Lamy, the director general of the World Trade Organisation, said there was no &quot;magic wand&quot; that could be waved to break down trade barriers. &quot;It is understandable if people want to open trade, and if they can&apos;t do it multilaterally to do it bilaterally. I am not saying it makes no sense but its marginal and it&apos;s not that\u00a0easy.&quot; Lamy said he was concerned that bilateral trade deals would leave smaller, weaker countries at a disadvantage in negotiations with large countries. Europe had been trying to secure a transatlantic trade deal for 20 years, he added. Cameron was also insistent that the veto he used before Christmas was not a sign that Britain wanted to leave Europe. &quot;Let me tell you, nothing could be further from the truth. Britain is part of the EU, not by default but by choice.&quot; Cameron listed statistics to demonstrate the lack of competitiveness in the eurozone. Half of EU countries were less competitive than they were a year ago and five were less competitive than Iran. Since the start of the crisis, the level of government debt per head of Europe&apos;s population had risen by \u20ac4,500 (\u00a33,750), foreign direct investment had fallen by two-thirds, and nearly half of EU member states had nearly one-fifth, or more, of their young people out of work. Despite Cameron&apos;s words of alarm, Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays, reckoned bankers were less anxious about the eurozone than a year ago. &quot;2011 was a year of great fear around [sovereign debt risk]. Going into 2012 we feel somewhat more comfortable because progress has been made,&quot; Diamond said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/27/grant-holt-norwich-city-captain", "sentences": ["A yeoman centre-forward at his ninth club, Holt is a former tyre fitter who used to motor from Norfolk to Carlisle and back in a Mazda RX-8 to see his family \u2013 part of a footballing odyssey that has taken in Workington, Halifax, Australia, Barrow, Singapore, Sheffield Wednesday, Rochdale, Nottingham Forest, Blackpool and Shrewsbury Town.", "There were three loan moves, to Sorrento in Perth, Barrow, and Sengkang Marine in Singapore, before he joined the Cumbrian club permanently.", "How was the standard in the Singapore S-League?", "&quot;It was a bit of blow as I&apos;d been enjoying my football in Singapore.", "But I returned from Singapore, and Carlisle did what they did, and I thought: &apos;That&apos;s it, I&apos;m going to have to get a job now.&apos; It probably let me enjoy Barrow because all the pressure was off."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-27T13:48:25Z", "title": "Much-travelled Grant Holt has finally found a home at Norwich City", "tags": ["Norwich City", "FA Cup 2011-12", "FA Cup", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Grant Holt&apos;s rise offers heart to any lower-league struggler who still eyes the big time. A trail of clubs, trials, false starts, loans, disenchantment, manual labour jobs and middling success was the tale before he joined Norwich City in July 2009, aged 28. Successive promotions under Paul Lambert took Holt into the Premier League, where his seven goals and solid 6ft frame now have him touted as a potential target man for Fabio Capello&apos;s England. A yeoman centre-forward at his ninth club, Holt is a former tyre fitter who used to motor from Norfolk to Carlisle and back in a Mazda RX-8 to see his family \u2013 part of a footballing odyssey that has taken in Workington, Halifax, Australia, Barrow, Singapore, Sheffield Wednesday, Rochdale, Nottingham Forest, Blackpool and Shrewsbury Town. Now, he is the thriving Canaries captain whose goals have helped fire Lambert&apos;s team to a dizzying ninth in the Premier League. &quot;The team is in a position where it needs to be,&quot; he says. &quot;Hopefully we can get a few more points and get safe as a soon as possible. We didn&apos;t start off too great but we&apos;ve got belief that we&apos;ve kept from last year, and we&apos;re going in the right direction.&quot; Modestly, he says of the prospect of being scouted by Capello: &quot;If 10 English forwards get injured this week I might get a call-up. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be the first one on anyone&apos;s lips. But if he sticks by his rule, if he goes with people on form and I score a few goals in the next few months, you never know. Football&apos;s a funny game isn&apos;t it?&quot; His peripatetic career has taught him that. Even he struggles to precisely recall dates. Holt began at Workington after being released by his hometown club at 15. &quot;I left Carlisle United and there was a physio there called Peter Hampton,&quot; he says. &quot;I went to my local side and we played against Workington&apos;s under-18s and Peter was now the manager. He knew a little bit about us and it worked out well.&quot; Holt&apos;s goal-a-game record at Workington prompted a \u00a310,000 move to Halifax Town in October 1999 that lasted two years, featured no league starts and no goals. There were three loan moves, to Sorrento in Perth, Barrow, and Sengkang Marine in Singapore, before he joined the Cumbrian club permanently. How did Holt end up playing in Perth? &quot;When I was at Halifax the assistant manager, Peter Butler, got sacked,&quot; he says. &quot;He went to Australia and was working with a local team and said: &apos;If you want to have a look come on over.&apos; So I played for Sorrento for a month and thought: &apos;Well, I either stay here and the football isn&apos;t at a standard where I want to be at or I go back and have a gamble.&apos; I\u00a0came back and went to Barrow.&quot; The first period at the shipyard town&apos;s club ended in 2000 with the move to Sengkang Marine, where Holt travelled knowing he had been promised a return to Carlisle when funds were available. How was the standard in the Singapore S-League? &quot;You&apos;re looking at the Conference probably. We had a couple of foreigners and a lot of local young lads and it was starting to get off the ground. I was there a couple of months.&quot; Did Holt have work to support himself? &quot;No. I had a flat that came with a gym, a pool, a Jacuzzi. Everything was on site, and we were paid enough to live and eat and enjoy yourself. It was a great time \u2013 the language was English and Malayan, so the barrier was quite easy.&quot; But when Carlisle called disappointment ensued. &quot;I flew back, trained for about two weeks and they decided the deal wasn&apos;t there,&quot; Holt says. &quot;It was a bit of blow as I&apos;d been enjoying my football in Singapore. I went back to Barrow and a few months later I got a move to Sheffield Wednesday, so there was a bit of fate in\u00a0there.&quot; Before moving to Hillsborough, though, reality had bit. &quot;When I was at Barrow the first time, I never worked. But I returned from Singapore, and Carlisle did what they did, and I thought: &apos;That&apos;s it, I&apos;m going to have to get a job now.&apos; It probably let me enjoy Barrow because all the pressure was off. I was working in some stores and with friends in a factory.&quot; Holt had not worked since his Workington days. &quot;When I was younger I did the tyre fitting,&quot; he says. &quot;I was living in Carlisle then, at me mam&apos;s. To keep fit while also working it was about getting in as many runs as you can. I&apos;d run round the streets, train with my local team, go for a run at the weekend. In the week I would go to work in the morning \u2013 we used to play Tuesdays and Saturdays \u2013 and Wednesday, Thursday I&apos;d go for a run after work for a couple of miles.&quot; The lowest point of Holt&apos;s career came during his first year at Barrow, in 2001. &quot;I went for a trial at Exeter,&quot; he says. &quot;I drove all the way down there, did well in the game, drove back, only to sit in the house the next morning after a 10-hour round trip to see that the manager had got sacked. At that point I thought: &apos;I&apos;ve had enough now really, I&apos;m not going to any more trials.&apos; &quot;But the following February I went in the office one day and the manager, Kenny Lowe, said: &apos;Somebody wants to take you.&apos; I said: &apos;I&apos;ve already told you I&apos;ve had enough. I&apos;m just happy I&apos;m enjoying my football again.&apos; And he said: &apos;No you&apos;ve got to go for this one, it&apos;s Sheffield Wednesday.&apos; &quot;When someone says that to you, you&apos;ve got to go for it. Thankfully I did. I did well in the trials and got signed up. And it was a good time as well. Although I didn&apos;t play much, it gave me that desire to earn a living out of the game again, and there were some fantastic pros who taught me good things.&quot; He joined Chris Turner&apos;s Wednesday in March 2003 for a nominal fee and after three goals in 12 league starts left the following January for Rochdale, also for a nominal price. This was &quot;one of the best moves I&apos;ve made. I was playing week in and week out,&quot; he says of his 75 league starts and 34 goals for Steve Parkin. Holt departed on a \u00a3300,000 transfer in January 2006 for a difficult two and a half seasons at Nottingham Forest. Holt scored 20 league goals in 74 starts but &quot;I didn&apos;t really get on with the manager,&quot; he says of Colin Calderwood, who took over after he joined. There was a brief loan spell at Blackpool, where he did not play, and then the cut-price \u00a3170,000 fee paid by Shrewsbury Town in June 2008. This proved a bargain for Paul Simpson when Holt returned 20 strikes in 46 starts. The following summer Bryan Gunn signed him for \u00a3400,000. Lambert soon took over and the goals began flowing for Norwich and did not stop. He will hope to add to his tally of 52 goals for the club in Saturday&apos;s FA Cup fourth-round tie at West Bromwich Albion. &quot;I&apos;m very lucky that for the last two years I&apos;ve had a team that creates a chance,&quot; he says. &quot;I told them if they do the same for me in the Prem I&apos;ll score.&quot; Now there are no more long hours driving home. &quot;I had a Mazda R-X8 and put 5,000 miles on it in a month and a half. I thought: &apos;That&apos;s not going to work.&apos; So I got a Peugeot 307 to bang the miles and I put 45,000 in one year,&quot; Holt says. &quot;When we decided to have another baby I moved the family down, and we&apos;re all happy in\u00a0Norwich.&quot; So, too, was last season&apos;s final-day draw with Coventry City, which was marked by Holt celebrating promotion his own way. &quot;I wrote on a T-shirt: &apos;From Unibond Premier to the Premier League.&apos; If someone had said to me when I was knocking around at Barrow I&apos;d be in the Prem scoring goals you&apos;d just laugh. It was an achievement I&apos;d been waiting for for a long time.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/29/sharing-obsession-revealing-every-detail", "sentences": ["Imagine if they flew to Singapore and started\u00a0selfishly hoarding things over there instead."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-29T20:00:00Z", "title": "I'm all for sharing, but why the online obsession with revealing every detail of your life? | Charlie Brooker", "tags": ["Social networking", "Technology", "Twitter", "Blogging", "Spotify", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Business", "Facebook", "Media", "Internet", "Digital music and audio"], "article": "Sharing. Now there&apos;s a basic social concept that has somehow got all out of whack. The idea behind sharing is simple. Let&apos;s\u00a0say I&apos;m a caveman. I hunt and slaughter a bison, but I can&apos;t eat it all myself, so I\u00a0share the carcass with others, many of\u00a0whom really appreciate it, such as my infirm 86-year-old neighbour who hasn&apos;t had a proper meal in weeks because he is incapable of killing anything larger than a woodlouse. Have you tried\u00a0grilling a woodlouse? It&apos;s scarcely worth the\u00a0effort. But it&apos;s not all bison meat. Let&apos;s say I am still a caveman. The other thing I share is information: the thoughts inside my head or stirring tales of the things I have done. I grunt a hilarious anecdote about the time I dropped a huge rock on a duck and an egg popped out, and mime scandalous gossip about well-known tribesmen. I&apos;m the life and soul of the cave-party. All this sharing served a purpose. It kept the\u00a0community fed, as well as entertained and informed. Now zip forward to the present day and,\u00a0like I say, sharing has somehow got all out of\u00a0whack. A small percentage of the population hoards more bison meat than it could eat in 2,000 lifetimes, awarding itself huge bison meat bonuses on top of its base-rate bison meat &quot;salary&quot;. I say &quot;bison meat&quot;. In case you hadn&apos;t noticed, I&apos;m using it as a clever metaphor for money. The huge salaries and bonuses, we are told, are\u00a0essential if we are to prevent this tiny percentage of selfish, hoarding arseholes from moving overseas. Imagine if they flew to Singapore and started\u00a0selfishly hoarding things over there instead. Drained of their expertise and reassuring presence,\u00a0how would Britain cope? Within days we&apos;d\u00a0be walking on all fours and devouring our\u00a0offspring for food. I don&apos;t want to panic you, but that&apos;s the reality. Never mind weeping over the size of their bonuses: we should be dropping to our knees and giving them blowjobs, tearfully imploring them to remain seated each time we come up for air. Treble their wages. Form a human ring around Britain&apos;s airports to prevent them from leaving. And for God&apos;s sake don&apos;t ask them to share anything. That kind of talk merely angers them. Sharing is for the rest of us. Not sharing money or bison meat, but personal information. Where we are. What we&apos;re doing. Share it! Make it public! Go on! It&apos;s fun! Increasingly, I stumble across apps and services that expect me to automatically share my every waking action on Facebook and Twitter. The key word here is &quot;automatically&quot;. Take Spotify, the streaming music service. I have written before about my admiration for Spotify, about what a technical marvel it is. A world of music at your fingertips! Incredible! The love affair was doomed. Spotify recently reinvented itself as a kind of adjunct to Facebook and has subsequently adopted some truly hideous &quot;social features&quot;. For instance: it will tell other people what you&apos;re listening to, live. Yes, you can switch this feature off. That&apos;s not the point. The point is that it does it by default. By default. IT\u00a0DOES IT BY DEFAULT. When Sony launched the Walkman back in the\u00a0late 70s, its main appeal was that for the first time in history you could stroll down the high street listening to Neil Diamond belting out Sweet\u00a0Caroline and no one could judge you for it.\u00a0It made you the master of a private world of music. If the Walkman had, by default, silently contacted your friends and told them what you\u00a0were listening to, not only would no one have\u00a0bought a Walkman in the first place, its designers would have been viewed with the utmost suspicion. Don&apos;t get me wrong. I&apos;m all for sharing thoughts, no matter how banal (as every column I have ever\u00a0written rather sadly proves). Humans will always babble. If someone wants to tweet that they can&apos;t\u00a0decide whether to wear blue socks or brown socks, then fair enough. But when sharing becomes automated, I get the heebie-jeebies. People already create exaggerated versions of themselves for online consumption: snarkier tweets, more outraged reactions. Online, you play at being yourself. Apply that pressure of public performance to private, inconsequential actions \u2013 such as listening to songs in the comfort of your own room \u2013 and what happens, exactly? It&apos;ll only get worse. Here&apos;s what I am listening to on Spotify. This is the page of the book I am reading. I am currently watching the 43rd minute of a Will Ferrell movie. And I&apos;m not telling you this stuff. The software is. I am a character in The Sims. Hover the cursor over my head and watch that stat feed scroll. You know how annoying it is when you&apos;re sitting on the train with a magazine and the person sitting beside you starts reading over your shoulder? Welcome to every single moment of your future. Might as well get used to it. It&apos;s an experience we&apos;ll all be sharing. Yes, sharing.

Hugely popular among the near-destitute labourers and their families, and played between neighbours on the flattened earth, it offers the prospect of a square meal rather than immediate life-changing wealth. Stakes are small but wins are big, enough to feed a family for a day or so. &quot;If I win then we get fish or even chicken,&quot; said Myat Soe, a 50-year-old labourer who lives with seven relatives in a makeshift bamboo house without power or sanitation. &quot;If I win 100 times maybe I&apos;ll get rich.&quot; Myat Soe is not the only one thinking about making large amounts of money in Burma. Hundreds of the world&apos;s biggest companies are making plans to move into the country if political progress towards democracy continues. They hope to make millions as the repressive regime seeks to reintegrate in the international community. The EU, the US and Canada are considering how and when they will ease sanctions imposed over the past 20 years on the brutal military authorities that ruled \u2013 and some say still rule \u2013 the country. Any change will send a signal to potential investors that Burma is no longer considered a pariah state. A week ago, travel restrictions on senior Burmese officials were lifted by the EU. A full review of the sanctions is scheduled for April. One businessman staying at a five-star hotel in Rangoon spoke this month of a &quot;gold rush&quot; in Asia&apos;s second-poorest country. &quot;It is when, not if, for most of us. I think there&apos;s a bit of a Klondike feel,&quot; said the businessman, who did not want to be named, said. Prompting the change has been a series of reforms implemented by the nominally civilian government that took power last year. President Thein Sein has met key opposition leaders including the democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, eased censorship, legalised trade unions and released hundreds of political prisoners. Senior European politicians including William Hague, the British foreign secretary, and Alain Jupp\u00e9, his French counterpart, have visited Burma in recent months to &quot;encourage&quot; the changes. Hillary Clinton came late last year, the first US secretary of state to travel to Burma for more than 50 years. All the visitors have made clear that further reforms will be rewarded. Since the sanctions were imposed after the bloody repression of protests in the late 1980s and a cancelled election in 1990, Burma has been isolated economically. In recent years Chinese companies, many state-backed, have established a large presence, investing in all sectors from infrastructure and natural gas to timber and precious gems. One reason for the authorities&apos; attempt to &quot;democratise&quot; may be a fear of over-dependence on Beijing. Another may be a simple desire to catch up with countries such as Thailand or Singapore. There is no shortage of interest from global and regional businesses. Burma has more than 60 million inhabitants and a key coastal location between India, China and the &quot;tiger&quot; economies of south-east Asia, making it an attractive market. It also has vast mineral, metal and other resources. The longest queue at Rangoon airport these days is not for check-in, taxis or cappuccinos costing $4 each but for mobile phone connections. As things stand, no overseas network can be used in Burma. Hotels are full as business delegations arrive. The mood is dominated by a certain degree of hysteria \u2013 a rumour that Bill Gates would be arriving within weeks proved to be unfounded \u2013 but the enthusiasm for investment is undeniable. &quot;If you can find ways to invest in Myanmar [Burma] you will be very, very rich over the next 20, 30, 40 years,&quot; Jim Rogers, the chairman of Rogers Holdings of Singapore, told Bloomberg TV recently. Shipra Tripathi, vice president of an Indian firm specialising in pumps, travelled from Delhi to Burma with a trade delegation. &quot;I wanted to see the opportunities that are opening up. I was pleasantly surprised by the pro-activeness of the government. We have already got teams in the country and are looking at a pilot project,&quot; Tripathi said. A recent Japanese delegation included officials from Hitachi and Toshiba. Senior executives at Standard Chartered bank have said they are &quot;looking at the changes [in Burma] very closely&quot;. India&apos;s Tata Motors car and truck manufacturer is keen too. Another key area is tourism. Burma&apos;s unspoilt beaches and mountains and rich cultural heritage could make it a leading destination, tour operators believe, and luxury hotel chains such as Marriot have said they are keen to establish a presence. There is also the growing demand from an emerging Burmese middle class. Upmarket shopping malls in the centre of Rangoon cater to a new elite, often connected to the powerful clique of top military officers who still dominate the economy. In one, brands from Guess to Versace fill shop windows. Than Than U, a civil engineer, had come with his daughter to buy sunglasses. &quot;We like it here. We come about once a month and spend $500,&quot; he said. Though senior British officials describe President Thein Sein as &quot;sincere&quot;, Burma&apos;s generals in effect still control parliament after a deeply flawed 2010 election. Western diplomats in Rangoon say much depends on whether byelections in April, which will be contested by Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, are free and fair. Removing sanctions is a complex and lengthy process. &quot;Even with the best of political will ... it will take a long time,&quot; said Frances Zwenig, counsellor with the US-Asean Business Council, a trade group whose members include Google and Coca-Cola. In the narrow, mosquito-infested lanes of Bothun San, no one is expecting miracles soon. There is no sanitation in the illegal settlement and haphazard electricity \u2013 a situation unlikely to improve for the foreseeable future. &quot;The rulers don&apos;t come here. No one comes here and nothing changes,&quot; said 48-year-old Myan Maun, a vegetable hawker, before putting down another stake for the lottery."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jan/31/facebook-stock-market-listing-imminent", "sentences": ["Bankers, bloggers, stock market traders and internet entrepreneurs from Singapore to Silicon Valley are holding their collective breath."], "publicationDate": "2012-01-31T18:05:11Z", "title": "Facebook's market listing is imminent \u2013 but does it have Google's potential?", "tags": ["Facebook", "Technology", "Media", "Internet", "Social networking", "Stock markets", "Business", "IPOs", "Google", "Google+", "Social media", "Digital media"], "article": "Bankers, bloggers, stock market traders and internet entrepreneurs from Singapore to Silicon Valley are holding their collective breath. Facebook&apos;s record-breaking stock market listing, the largest ever for a technology company, is imminent. Papers must be filed soon if Facebook wishes to press ahead with plans for a May public offering. The world&apos;s leading social site, with 800 million members worldwide, is expected to sell off a 10% stake for between $7.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) and $10bn, implying an overall value of $75bn to $100bn. The multiples are on a par with those achieved by Google when it joined the Nasdaq in 2004. By then, Google&apos;s superior engineering had allowed it to secure an unassailable position in search, a utility without which the web would be impossible to navigate. Seven years on, and Google is making more than $10bn a quarter with a market capitalisation of $188bn. Does Facebook have the same potential? The bulk of Facebook&apos;s income will be from advertisers. WPP, the world&apos;s biggest marketing services group, already spends $200m a year with Facebook, an eighth of the $1.6bn it pays to Google. A vote of confidence, but WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell has &quot;fundamental doubts&quot; about the extent to which social platforms can be monetised. &quot;The point is that Facebook is a social medium, not an advertising one, like search or display,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;It certainly is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful branding medium. It is, however, a word of mouth or PR medium. You interrupt social conversations with commercial messages at your peril.&quot; Mark Zuckerberg was initially cautious about foisting advertising on his followers, to the extent that it led to a parting of ways with his co-founder and Harvard friend Eduardo Saverin. The commercial coyness is long gone, and moves to monetise the audience with new forms of advertising have often provoked backlashes. Facebook&apos;s Beacon ad system, which monitored members&apos; activity on partner websites and then publicised these movements on their Facebook news feeds, so outraged users it led to a class action lawsuit. Beacon was shut down in 2009. Another legal claim was given the go-ahead in California in December, from users unhappy that if they clicked the &apos;like&apos; button on a company&apos;s page, Facebook could use that member&apos;s image and name in an advert endorsing the same company. The experience of Myspace, Britain&apos;s Bebo and Friends Reunited would suggest these forums can be passing fads, whose users are quickly drawn to other novelties. The social network founded eight years ago in Zuckerberg&apos;s Harvard dorm room has soared in membership while rivals melted away, but Google is biting at its heels. The search giant recently pegged staff bonuses to the success of its own social offering, Google+, and the effect has been dramatic. Its membership ramped up to 90m users in January, having doubled in three months. There are signs that Facebook&apos;s membership is reaching saturation point in its biggest markets. The number of UK monthly visitors fell 2.2% to 32m from November to December, while US visitors declined 2.1% to 166m, says web measurement firm ComScore. Its worldwide audience is still growing, however, adding 1.4m visitors from November to December, boosted by rapid growth in Brazil and India. The deep level of penetration in small or remote nations like the Falkland Islands (75% of inhabitants are users according to research site Socialbakers) and Iceland (68%) suggests that in some communities Facebook has become not just a pastime but a social service, integrated into the fabric of everyday life. &quot;For some users Facebook is the internet,&quot; says ComScore European managing director Mike Read. He identifies two trends that point to success for Zuckerberg. &quot;Facebook&apos;s user base is growing and the amount of time people are spending online individually is growing. Not only is the audience maturing, the way in which people use Facebook in a commercial sense is maturing.&quot; Once membership stops growing in mature markets, increasing the amount of time each user spends on Facebook will become a crucial measure of its success. In October 2010, the average user idled away 4.5 hours a month on Facebook. This rose to 6.5 hours in December 2011. If Facebook can imitate Google by becoming a landing page from which users access games, video, music or online shops, the advertising money should follow. It is already the largest internet display \u2013 as opposed to search \u2013 medium in the UK, with 18bn ads seen on the site in December compared to 4bn for its next largest rival, Yahoo. But online display is still embryonic compared with the millions once poured into newspaper and magazine advertising. Facebook has not shared its numbers for 2011, but the most recent leak suggests earnings of $1.5bn on revenues of $3.8bn. A $100bn valuation would equal 66 times earnings and 26 times revenues. In 2004, Google was valued at $23bn, around 67 times its 2003 earnings and 24 times its revenues. After disappointing performances from games group Zynga and coupon network Groupon, Facebook may prefer to avoid a fall in the weeks after it goes public by pricing at the lower end of expectations. Trades in the firm&apos;s privately held equity, through services like SharesPost, imply a $83.5bn valuation. Guessing is a dangerous game. &quot;Perhaps it is worth $100bn, who knows,&quot; says Sorrell. &quot;I thought $15bn was too much. More fool me.&quot; Facebook&apos;s roster of celebrity backers, which ranges from Bono and Microsoft to Russian billionaire Yuri Milner would suggest something of a bubble, but its ability to attract investors has continually defied expectations."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/01/losing-genitals-mating-male-spiders", "sentences": ["But an answer may now be at hand following a series of meticulous experiments by Daiqin Li, a behavioural ecologist at the National University of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-01T00:01:00Z", "title": "Male spiders sacrifice their genitals to fertilise big hungry females", "tags": ["Reproduction", "Animal behaviour", "Zoology", "Biology", "Science", "World news", "Wildlife"], "article": "There comes a time in a male spider&apos;s life when amorous behaviour leads to sexual intercouse and perhaps the ripping off of genitals. Scientists have long wondered why some males evolved to sacrifice their genitals in the act of reproduction, given that the injuries could leave them sterile. But an answer may now be at hand following a series of meticulous experiments by Daiqin Li, a behavioural ecologist at the National University of Singapore. Researchers led by Dr Li studied a species of orb-web spider called Nephilengys malabarensis. The males are much smaller than the females and more often than not are eaten by their partners during copulation. Before the act of cannibalism, which some spiders escape, the male&apos;s sexual organ, known as a palp, is broken off inside the female. Sometimes the female breaks off the palp, but males engage in the behaviour too. Male spiders are usually born with two palps. Li&apos;s team took 25 virgin males and put them on webs where females lay waiting. All of the spiders mated, leaving 22 males with completely severed palps and three with partially damaged genitals. The scientists then dissected the creatures to trace what happened to the spiders&apos; sperm. Only a third had entered the females, with the rest still lurking in the broken-off palps. Further tests, described in the journal Biology Letters, revealed that the longer a male&apos;s palp remained lodged in a female, the more sperm was transferred into her, increasing the chances of fertilisation. The broken palp also served as an effective plug, putting the female out of action for other males. Dr Li told the Guardian that it was unclear how the broken palps continued to inseminate the female after being severed from the male, but said such &quot;remote copulation&quot; was more than a simple draining of sperm into the female. Li believes that males evolved to lose their palps because the strategy allowed them to fertilise females even if the organ was broken off in seconds or the female ate the male alive. &quot;Remote copulation probably evolved from the conflict of interest between males and females, as a counter-adaptation to female aggression towards males, the female-enforced short copulation times, and the high rate of cannibalism,&quot; he said. The injuries the males sustain make them more aggressive, with eunuch spiders more aggressive than those with one working palp, and those with two palps the least aggressive. This might also work in their favour, as they are more able to fight off other males who approach the female."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/feb/01/top-10-video-games-shops-tokyo", "sentences": ["Be aware that the &quot;Asian versions&quot; of Xbox 360 games (intended for South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) are priced slightly lower than US imports."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-01T10:00:00Z", "title": "10 of the best games shops in Tokyo", "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "City breaks", "Top 10s", "Shopping trips", "Game culture", "Arcade games", "Games", "Asia", "Travel", "Technology", "Culture"], "article": "Super Potato Super Potato isn&apos;t really a shop, it&apos;s more like a video game museum where you can buy stuff.

Wang Lijun became famous nationwide after leading a crackdown against organised crime in Chongqing launched by the region&apos;s high-profile party secretary, Bo Xilai. His move from police to more general duties has sparked particular interest because he is seen as such a close ally of Bo, who is expected to rise still further when the next generation of leaders takes power this autumn. Their controversial anti-gang campaign led to more than 1,500 arrests and culminated in the execution of the city&apos;s former deputy police chief and top justice official, Wen Qiang, for corruption, rape and shielding organised crime. But on Thursday, Chongqing&apos;s information office said on its blog the party committee had given Wang a new portfolio in charge of economic affairs in place of his public security post, the South China Morning Post reported. A few hours later, the office revised its message to say the 52-year-old would be in charge of issues including education, the environment and industrial and commercial management. &quot;A hero who fought as a triad-buster has been pushed aside to a vice-mayor position without real power \u2026 it is not only sadness for Chongqing but the whole of China,&quot; said one of many bloggers speculating that Wang was being sidelined because the portfolio was relatively junior. But Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore, suggested the move was designed to prepare Wang \u2013 who became vice-mayor last spring \u2013 for higher office. &quot;I think this is actually career enhancement ... To be promoted along the political path, to a mayor or provincial governor, he has to learn to deal with different issues,&quot; he said. Lin Zhe, a professor with the party school of the CPC central committee, told the state-run Global Times newspaper: &quot;Chongqing&apos;s work in cracking down on criminal gangs was called to an end early in 2010, when a meeting in the city was held to summarise the achievements of cracking down on gangs. &quot;So Wang has fulfilled his task as an anti-gang hero, and it is time for him to explore new spaces in other fields.&quot; Chongqing officials have reportedly commissioned a four-volume history of the anti-triad campaign, with a film and television series to follow. Wang&apos;s career seems made for the movies; according to the South China Morning Post, he has 20 scars from knife and bullet wounds and was once in a coma for 10 days due to his longterm battle with the triads. The crackdown proved hugely popular with many residents \u2013 &quot;If Wang is not in charge of the PSB, is Chongqing still going to be safe?&quot; one commentator asked \u2013 although critics were alarmed by its methods. There was particular concern at the jailing of a lawyer for his defence of an alleged gang boss.

All British life is here \u2013 or a decent chunk of it anyway. This journey, I had to remind myself as its lunacy dawned on me, was my idea.

Soon she will give way to the new order, represented by power couple William and Kate.

Where possible, I tried to engage people in a proper conversation. Some encounters lasted a few minutes; others half an hour or more; one ended in a pub with a man telling me his life story and coming close to tears as he recounted his struggles. Though a few people I approached thought I was mad to be asking questions about their identity \u2013 or, worse, thought I was a chugger \u2013 most were willing to engage. On the whole, their answers were intelligent and thoughtful. I was left with a warm feeling about my fellow citizens who, despite a failing economy, remain remarkably resilient. I was also impressed by the trains, ferries and planes, which were surprisingly punctual. Despite all you read in our mordant media, ours is a society that more or less works. The initial reason for undertaking the journey was the jubilee, but that was quickly overtaken by the Scottish question. The storm produced by David Cameron&apos;s attempt to bounce Alex Salmond into an early referendum broke when I was in Edinburgh, and gave an urgency to the inquiries I was making. The issue was on the front of every paper; people were discussing it in pubs; it mattered. If Scotland went, the game would be up for the UK. The disintegration predicted by Tom Nairn in his book The Break-Up of Britain almost 40 years ago \u2013 he called Britain &quot;a basically indefensible and unadaptable relic, not a modern state form&quot; \u2013 would have come to pass. Three hundred years of history would have to be unwound. Warring partners usually argue over the CD collection; this separation would see disputes over nuclear weapons and oil revenues. I began my journey with a mission to stand up for Britain. I was born in Wales and have a bit of Irish on my mother&apos;s side, so am drawn to mongrelism. I have lived in England for almost 40 years without ever much liking or understanding the English. At heart, I remain Welsh, vague, mystical, verbose, a devotee of hwyl, that curious mixture of\u00a0passion and inspiration with which Welshmen seek to play their rugby and lead their lives. But do not take my paean to Welshness as a plea for a Welsh state. I despise nationalism, embrace the idea of the &quot;melting pot&quot; that is the UK (a description much favoured by pro-Britishers I encountered), like the tensions that animate the union. I can happily cheer on England at cricket and Wales at rugby. Indeed, when it comes to rugby, I will support anyone but mechanical England. These confusions are vivifying. A country, so I thought, was like the human body \u2013 the more mixed the gene pool, the better.     A car park picnic on Derby day at Epsom, Surrey. Photograph: Peter Dench/In Pictures/Corbis    Initially, my theory held up. In Stratford, east London, where I began \u2013 the conceit underlying the journey was that I would start in cosmopolitan, Olympic Stratford and end in heart-of-England, Shakespearean Stratford \u2013 people born to parents who had migrated to the UK seemed much happier to be called British rather than English. Britishness felt inclusive; Englishness conjured up bulldogs, union flag underpants, riotous football supporters and sometimes racism. But elsewhere I began to wonder about my easy assumption that British was best. For many people, Britishness meant little or nothing. The trip from prosperous, flag-waving, jubilee-supporting Ottery St Mary, a small town in Devon, to recession-hit Caernarfon in north Wales, where Welsh speakers easily outnumber those for whom English is the mother tongue, was especially telling. Britishness was a hazy notion here. Their horizons were narrower; their world defined by the language they were proud to speak and\u00a0nurture. The Scots are Scottish, the Welsh are Welsh, the Northern Irish Catholics mostly look south. Only the Northern Irish Protestants wear their Britishness on their sleeves, and on some public buildings too \u2013 a vast union flag flies above Belfast town hall, a shock after union flag-less Wales. So gradually I began to wonder about the thesis I was so sure of as I began \u2013 that Britishness should be protected at all costs. If it was already largely moribund, what was there to protect? As one man in Stratford-upon-Avon said, what would really change if the constituent parts went their own way? Hadrian&apos;s wall wouldn&apos;t be rebuilt. All the old links, of culture and family and business, would remain. Only the political settlement would change. And what, in the end, is\u00a0politics when set against life? Much of this was anticipated by historians and cultural commentators in the 1980s and 90s. Raphael Samuel, in Island Stories, argued that the redundancy of the post-imperial state made the idea of Britain problematic, and explored how British history was being replaced by Four Nations history, pointing out that 1066 was a great date for the English but barely registered for the Scots, Irish or\u00a0Welsh.     Morris dancing in Cerne Abbas, Dorset Photograph: Alamy    In reality, as the discussions I had on\u00a0my journey show, to break Britain down into four constituent parts is hopelessly simplistic. There are several Englands: urban and rural, northern and southern, the east, the west and the usually ignored Midlands. In Hastings, I found a society of misfits who had gone as far away from mainstream English society as they could without falling into the sea. There are at least three Scotlands: lowlands, highlands and islands. Salmond should\u00a0beware secessionism. Might not\u00a0Shetland want to go its own way, linking up with Norway in a Scandinavian &quot;arc of prosperity&quot;? In Caernarfon, it was clear that north and\u00a0south Wales \u2013 rural v urban, Welsh-speaking v English-speaking, post-agricultural v\u00a0post-industrial \u2013 loathe each other. There aren&apos;t four Britains. There are 40. In Coventry alone there must be a dozen ethnic groups living in largely segregated communities. I had to change trains at Smethwick, near Birmingham, on the way to Coventry and had 40 minutes to kill, so went looking for a pub. There were none, because this was an almost entirely Sikh community. Or rather, there was one tatty building called the Old Comrades Club, which was shut. It was flying a ragged union flag on a pole in the car park. The flag was at half mast. Britain no doubt means a lot to the men who drink in the Old Comrades Club. It means quite a lot to me, brought up on the Victor comic with its tales of wartime derring-do. I also think it means a lot to Jeremy Paxman, author of a recent book on the British empire. His interviews with Salmond are sparky even by his incendiary standards, and my guess is that his distress at the idea of Britain breaking up adds fuel to his interviewing fire. We have lived with Britain all our lives, and thought we would die with it too. But now the old comrades&apos; voice is growing fainter. It is\u00a0not the British state that people care passionately about, but the British state of mind, the values that Britishness is thought to encapsulate. When I\u00a0asked people what mattered to them, few mentioned the monarchy, the army, the BBC, parliament or any of the\u00a0organs of state; they eulogised our values \u2013 democracy, freedom, equality before the law, openness, tolerance, fairness, justice. These were referred to repeatedly as the essence of Britishness, or perhaps of the New Britain, because some of those qualities were certainly not in evidence in the class-bound realm which Queen Elizabeth II took possession of in 1952. Tolerance, openness and diversity have all emerged in the past quarter-century, and now define our society. The young \u2013 those under 35, let&apos;s say \u2013 have embraced the virtues of a tolerant, easy-going, multicultural society; many of those over 65, especially in the big cities, feel dispossessed, their old cultural certainties shattered; those in between \u2013 me and Paxman aside, perhaps \u2013 are just about swimming with the tide, or at least keeping our thoughts to ourselves. What matters for the post-1970 generation is not the protection of institutions but of values. They would accept a new political settlement \u2013 &quot;If the Scots want to break away, that&apos;s up\u00a0to them&quot; is the prevailing view in England \u2013 but they would fight to keep their freedoms and the anything-goes view of society we have come to take for granted in the past couple of decades.

Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images    I started my journey at the gleaming Westfield shopping centre in Stratford which, as one visitor said to me, could easily be Singapore. Hastings I chose for its historical associations, but it was a washout \u2013 the Normans landed 15 miles down the coast, the great battle was fought six miles to the north (the precise spot is disputed), and I got soaked. Then I headed north to Bradford, to explore an archetypally multicultural \u2013 and economically depressed \u2013 city, filled with wonderful 19th-century buildings and horrible 21st-century pawn shops and amusement arcades. I chose two locations in Scotland: Edinburgh, inevitably, where I paraded up and down the Royal Mile and buttonholed people outside the parliament building, which looks like the sort of elaborate home an Arab sheikh might build; and Pitlochry on the edge of the Highlands in Perth and Kinross, where I had haggis for every meal, including breakfast. From Scotland, I travelled to Ottery St Mary in Devon, birthplace of Coleridge and what I hoped might be a typical West Country village. The locals, however, berated me for calling it a village, insisted it was a town (population about 4,000) and introduced me to the mayor. I fear I failed in Ottery, because I spoke almost exclusively to the bourgeoisie, most of whom were involved in amateur dramatics. Farmers and the rural poor passed me by completely, but I do now know a\u00a0great\u00a0deal about the Mikado. I took three trains from Devon to north Wales \u2013 a journey that took seven hours \u2013 and stayed in a hotel in Bangor run by a Chinese family. I did my interviews in Caernarfon, in the shadow of the castle, where Prince Charles had his bizarre investiture in 1969 \u2013 look at the TV coverage on YouTube and marvel at the absurdity of the occasion. Caernarfon is desperately poor, yet the love of the language was palpable. Whereas Scotland defines itself by the separateness of its institutions, Wales relies on\u00a0Welsh. Then came Northern Ireland, probably the most eye-opening part of\u00a0the journey, and the two Midlands towns: Coventry, chosen because it symbolised post-war reconstruction, but vying with Caernarfon as the most dismal of the places I visited, and a city clearly rebuilt for the convenience of the car rather than pleasure of its people; and finally Stratford-upon-Avon, heart of England and home of the bard, where I was pleased to discover children still danced around maypoles, and I talked to a beggar who told me the police wouldn&apos;t let him beg\u00a0in the town centre because it made a bad impression on tourists. I was left with misgivings about the future of the UK, but no doubts about the capacity of the people who live in these islands. The young, for all the talk of a lost generation, have buoyancy and self-belief, while the old have their gripes and prejudices to sustain them. I\u00a0had an epiphany early in the trip when I watched dozens of young people skating on an ice-rink as darkness fell at a wintry Westfield in east London. Plenty of the skaters fell, too, but they quickly bounced back up and made their way across the ice, laughing and clutching on to friends, fearless and eager to learn. People are remarkable in a way that countries can never be."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/05/what-does-britishness-mean", "sentences": ["My eldest daughter lives in Singapore, and is married to a guy who was brought up in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-05T22:00:00Z", "title": "What does Britishness mean to you?", "tags": ["British identity and society", "Society", "UK news", "Communities"], "article": "Stratford, East London Nadia Hussain, 32, biomedical scientist My parents came here from Pakistan in 1974. I\u00a0was born in Forest Gate,\u00a0east London, in 1979, and have four brothers and sisters. I experienced\u00a0a lot\u00a0of racism growing up. The\u00a0racial groups \u2013 white, black, Asian\u00a0\u2013\u00a0tended to\u00a0keep in their own groups. It was really weird. But I\u00a0love the East End, and wouldn&apos;t change it\u00a0for the world. Our neighbours\u00a0are white, and we love\u00a0them to\u00a0bits. I\u00a0still\u00a0live with my parents, and because\u00a0of our cultural background I\u00a0can only break away when I\u00a0get married. I&apos;m not a strict Muslim,\u00a0but I\u00a0do carry my faith close\u00a0to\u00a0my heart, and I&apos;d be unlikely to\u00a0marry outside it;\u00a0the culture clash would be too great.\u00a0Britain is moving too fast and has lost its sense of Britishness. It&apos;s obsessed by\u00a0money, and social bonds\u00a0are breaking down. My parents\u00a0always make us have a meal together in\u00a0the evening. That has been\u00a0lost in this generation. Respect for teachers has also been lost. I&apos;m\u00a0proud to be British, but the country\u00a0isn&apos;t as strong as it was. Our educational\u00a0system is deteriorating, unemployment is rising,\u00a0and I worry about the future. The Olympics will\u00a0be\u00a0great, but what\u00a0happens afterwards? MC Cursor (AKA Marcus Myers), 36, hip-hop musician I was born here and grew\u00a0up in Stepney, east\u00a0London. My parents had come over from Jamaica in the 1960s. I&apos;m\u00a0British rather than Jamaican. Whenever I&apos;ve been to Jamaica, I\u00a0can&apos;t\u00a0feel completely Jamaican. I&apos;m\u00a0a\u00a0foreigner there. I can put on a\u00a0Jamaican accent, but they can always\u00a0tell. Growing up was tough. I\u00a0got a fair\u00a0bit of racial abuse, but I&apos;m\u00a0the sort\u00a0of person who has always\u00a0defended myself if I&apos;ve been attacked or bullied. The police have given me a\u00a0hard time all my life. I&apos;ve\u00a0had them making monkey noises at me as they&apos;ve\u00a0gone past in their cars.\u00a0They\u00a0nearly ran me over once. But\u00a0despite all that I&apos;m proud to be\u00a0British,\u00a0and have got friends of\u00a0every colour \u2013 white, black, Asian.\u00a0The\u00a0music business is colour-blind. You&apos;re either talented or\u00a0you&apos;re\u00a0rubbish. That&apos;s the bottom\u00a0line. David Sinclair-Benstead, 67, retired hospital chef I was born in Scotland, but have lived most of my life in England. I have never lost my Scottishness, but feel British and wouldn&apos;t support Scottish independence. It&apos;s possible to be four separate countries, but also to come together as Britain. For me, Britishness means the royal family and tradition. The jubilee is a big moment. It&apos;s important because of what the Queen has given to the country, but also what she stands for \u2013 stopping dictatorship. She is only a figurehead, but she still, theoretically, has the power to veto any Acts of Parliament and is our defence against anyone who wants to wield excessive power. Britishness also means quirky things such as morris dancing and cheese rolling. Stupid things like that are essentially British, and I hope we never lose them. I don&apos;t think they ever will die out. Mark Francis, 54, office cleaning supervisor I was born in Sri Lanka, but have lived in the UK since 1970. My father worked for a bank and brought his family here. I remember how cold it was when we first came. I had never seen snow before. I feel British rather than Sri Lankan, and no longer have a Sri Lankan passport. To me, Britishness means you have to obey the law and be polite to people. If an old lady is trying to cross the road, I look at her and say, &quot;Come on, darling, I&apos;ll help you across.&quot; A lot of people don&apos;t do that. Britishness means a lot to me. I respect other people, and expect that respect back. Things are changing; it&apos;s more dangerous now, especially at night, but\u00a0I still love the country. Annie Kaucher, 75, pensioner I feel English rather than British. I live right next to the Olympic site, and am not very pleased they&apos;re coming here. I\u00a0don&apos;t think we can afford them. I was born and bred in Stratford and have lived here all my life, but the East End and the England I knew have gone. The lovely people and the lovely way of life are all lost now. You could leave your front doors open, but now you&apos;re frightened. There&apos;s too much crime. As I&apos;ve got older, I&apos;ve got more frightened. No one looks after elderly people now, especially in the hospitals. They&apos;re just chucked on the rubbish heap. We&apos;ve lost the ability to care. I feel sorry for the older generation who made England England. If Hitler had won the war, it would have been a different country, wouldn&apos;t it? Hasting, East Sussex Tom Stinchcombe, 23, student I&apos;m originally from Bristol, but am now at the University of Brighton studying media and sociology. I consider myself British rather than English. Scotland, England and Wales need to stick together. We&apos;re not a big country. I don&apos;t relate much to the Queen and her jubilee. Britishness means living under a democracy and having the freedom to do what you want with your life. The Queen may not embody Britishness, but parliament does. It&apos;s a unique institution. The way they debate must look out of control when people in other countries see it, but it&apos;s all part of how we run our country. The economic situation worries me and capitalism as we know it isn&apos;t working to everybody&apos;s benefit, so business as usual is no longer acceptable. But there is still much to admire in this country. We are more questioning and more secular than the US, and have true freedom of speech. It&apos;s important for my generation not to buy into the Britain-in-decline idea. Instead of waging wars, we should be in the forefront of things such as finding alternative fuels. We should be an ideas bank for the world. Michael Hill, 50, showman I was born in Godalming, and have been a market trader and showman all my life. I travel with funfairs for most of the year, and have a static pitch in Hastings operating a roundabout during children&apos;s holidays. I feel English rather than British. Every time someone blinks, I understand what they mean, which I don&apos;t in Scotland and Wales. The English are rather a depressed bunch at the moment, but underneath that are the same values and morals that people have had for a very long time. I&apos;m not against people coming into the country, but the level of immigration is making people feel very insecure. It makes me feel insecure sometimes when I walk round the streets and don&apos;t hear my own language being spoken. It doesn&apos;t bother me as long as they are friendly towards us, but I don&apos;t feel that many of those people are. I don&apos;t feel they respect us or our culture or our history. Many of them see us as the enemy, especially people like myself who aren&apos;t mainstream. We&apos;re seen as some lower order of being. I&apos;ve got a beautiful daughter of 25 who is treated badly on the street by people like that because of the way she dresses. When my daughter went to India, she covered herself up, because that&apos;s what people do over there. So when people come over here I think they should accept that we&apos;re a free-and-easy culture. Amy Hemmings, 31, pattern cutter I&apos;ve lived in other countries and always wanted to come back to Britain because I feel I understand society here and can interact with people in a way that you&apos;re sure about, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s unique to Britain. That&apos;s true of whichever country you grow up in. I&apos;m also suspicious of the idea that there is a &quot;British character&quot;, though I\u00a0suppose British people are quite tolerant and generally open-minded \u2013 at least the kind of people I encounter are. I don&apos;t think we are moving in a bad direction as a society. In some ways, we&apos;re much better off than we were 50 years ago, and in other ways we&apos;re not. There aren&apos;t very many people who don&apos;t have enough to eat these days, whereas 50 years ago a lot of people didn&apos;t have enough to eat. There are a lot of less fortunate people in the world than us, and even if things\u00a0get worse it&apos;s going to take a lot for it to get that bad. We still live in relative luxury. James Adams, 22, fisherman I started as a fisherman when I was 16, and got into it because my boss is\u00a0friends with my dad. I&apos;d always wanted to do it \u2013 it&apos;s exciting. I like the\u00a0fact that Britain has always been a\u00a0fishing nation. I&apos;m not interested in Europe \u2013 it&apos;s a pile of crap. They&apos;re in trouble financially, but we&apos;re already in\u00a0enough debt, and we shouldn&apos;t be working our balls off to pay for other countries. I don&apos;t bother to vote. Politicians say one thing to get elected and then it&apos;s, &quot;See you next Tuesday&quot; when they get power. Claire Doolan, 53, alternative clothes shop\u00a0owner Britain is quite welcoming and inclusive as a nation, which I appreciate. I want Britishness to mean eccentricity, inclusiveness and not being judgmental, and I think that&apos;s what I&apos;ve found in Hastings. It&apos;s a curious town. Lots of\u00a0people come here to escape. We\u00a0have festivals that no one else has, and we have a lot of anarchy in our own little way. But that&apos;s very British \u2013 pram races, sea-boot races and a Jack in\u00a0the Green festival that has very ancient roots. Bradford, West Yorkshire Alan Ward, 65, retired engineer I consider myself to be English and a Yorkshireman. The Yorkshire identity is important to older people, but not to the young ones. Bradford is full of foreigners, and the communities live separately. They&apos;ve come into this country and turned it into a third-world country like their own. I might be cynical, but you see the prices of houses collapsing when they move into the same street as you. The community falls apart. These foreigners come in, they all have six or seven kids, and they&apos;re outbreeding the British people. My grandson goes to the school I went to when it first opened, and he&apos;s\u00a0the only white person in the class. They&apos;re just going to take over. We&apos;re a\u00a0third-world country now, and it&apos;s going to get worse. Sarah Guttman, 29, lawyer Britishness means being proud of the country that\u00a0we have, and it upsets me when people are here but\u00a0dissociate themselves from the country. My best friend is Muslim, and\u00a0she will sit &apos;til the cows come home and say Britain shouldn&apos;t be doing this or that. And I think, well you&apos;re part of this country; if you don&apos;t\u00a0like it, go and protest and change\u00a0it, but also realise that there\u00a0are\u00a0a lot of good things in this country\u00a0that if you were in Iraq you wouldn&apos;t have. There are white areas and Muslim areas in Bradford, but they\u00a0generally get along. Most of the\u00a0crime in Bradford isn&apos;t racially aggravated. Where people live is segregated, but they interact well at work. I don&apos;t think you need to push integration as long as people respect each other and get along when they need to. You&apos;re never going to get Muslim girls in headscarves going to\u00a0the local pub and mixing with white\u00a0girls who want to go out and have a good time. Muslims are more\u00a0family-oriented, and do better financially because they live together. It&apos;s difficult to mix that with people who don&apos;t have a lot of contact with their families. Sagir Ahmed, 41, careers\u00a0adviser My parents are from Kashmir, and I see myself as a British Kashmiri. My dad had an uncle who drove trolley-buses in Bradford, and he joined him here in 1962 to work in the mills. I am a\u00a0Kashmiri nationalist, and belong to the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). I have been involved since I\u00a0was 18 or 19. I&apos;ve only been to Kashmir once, but the heritage is very important to me. I&apos;m proud of being British, but my roots are in Kashmir. Culturally, my ideas are partly British and partly Kashmiri. I like to think I\u00a0balance the two. Anne McNeill, 51, gallery\u00a0director I&apos;m Scottish, and when I travel abroad and people ask, &quot;What nationality are you?&quot;, I always say, &quot;I&apos;m Scottish&quot; before I&apos;d ever say &quot;I&apos;m British&quot;, even though I&apos;ve lived in England for more than 30 years. But when talking about the island that we live in, I always call it Britain. So our identity is a dual one. I\u00a0also think it has changed in recent years. Our multicultural society is now what makes up Britain. It is a projection of all the cultures in it. Last year, the English Defence League tried to stir up trouble here, and all the cultures within the city stood together as one to\u00a0fight against the idea of Britishness and Englishness as something that is monocultural. Bradford is always cited in the media as a fractured city, but if you live and work in this city you see that it works. James Wilkinson, 18, student Not a lot of people move around here, and there&apos;s quite a lot of hatred towards foreigners. Down south, it&apos;s a lot more culturally open. As a society we want multiculturalism, but you can&apos;t force it down people&apos;s throats. In\u00a0Bradford, the Asian and the white groups keep themselves to themselves. That doesn&apos;t bother me. If\u00a0people don&apos;t want to talk to me, they\u00a0don&apos;t have to. If they do, they can. I&apos;m quite approachable. But I sense they don&apos;t want to. Edinburgh, Scotland Billy Mills, 67, retired\u00a0engineer I&apos;m Scottish, end of story. I don&apos;t see why we shouldn&apos;t be a nation of our own. I&apos;ve nothing against the English and have worked with a lot of nice English people, but I&apos;d prefer to have my own country. What annoys me is the money I&apos;ve seen being spent down south over the years. I think Scotland will vote for independence. We&apos;ve got to take a chance. The English say we gain financially from the relationship, but if it&apos;s costing them money why do they want to hang on to us so much? Nicola Butler, 27, shop assistant I would say I was Scottish first, but I don&apos;t think we should be independent. I\u00a0just don&apos;t think it would work. We don&apos;t have enough money and we&apos;d end up like Ireland, skint. We&apos;ve been OK so far \u2013 being proudly Scottish but also part of the UK. Scotland is different from the other countries in the UK, and we&apos;ve always managed to avoid being overwhelmed by England. If it&apos;s not broke, why fix it? David Singh, 43, souvenir shop owner I was born in Scotland, have lived here all my life and have the accent to prove it. My parents are from India, and I travel back there every year on holiday. The Scottish people are very welcoming. There is racism in any part of the world you go, but generally Edinburgh has been very good to immigrants. I get more racism from American visitors than from native Scots. I see myself as a British Sikh, and that&apos;s what it says on the census. I&apos;m not a very religious man, but you mustn&apos;t forget your roots. My family comes from the Punjab, and I go back there regularly. I speak Punjabi and a bit of Hindi, but in India they just see you as Babuji \u2013 Mr Rich \u2013 because you come from the UK. Kerri Stanton, 22, educational administrator I&apos;m from Glasgow and went to Edinburgh University, but would describe myself as British rather than Scottish. I&apos;ll vote against independence \u2013 I don&apos;t think Scotland has that much to stand on on its own. I&apos;m not the usual Scottish person who hates England and hates everything else. I&apos;m not keen on that side of nationalism. My dad&apos;s English, so maybe that sways me. Ali Celik, 38, assistant manager of cafe I&apos;m from Turkey, came to\u00a0the UK 10 years ago to study social science in London and became a British citizen five years ago. My wife was born in Turkey, and we have two twin daughters. Edinburgh is\u00a0very multicultural, and the Scots understand the immigrant experience more than anybody else \u2013 if you go anywhere in the world, you will find Scots. I never felt foreign here. It felt like home. I used to live in north London and there it was more separate. I never want to live anywhere else now. The only problem for immigrants is that it&apos;s hard to get a job related to your degree. It will be easier for the second generation because they&apos;ve been educated here. I go back to Turkey for holidays, but by the second week I am missing Edinburgh. I\u00a0also find it too hot in Turkey now in the summer. Pitlochry, Perth &amp; Kinross Will Robertson, 40, barber I was born on a plane. My father was in the RAF and stationed in Germany, but he didn&apos;t want me born there so he got us on board a flight and I was born somewhere between Lockerbie and Carlisle. I lived in London for about 10 years, but came back for the countryside and the fresh air up here. I don&apos;t want to sound racist, but I also found there were so many foreigners in London that they were taking over. I wanted somewhere that was a bit like Britain used to be, and Pitlochry is like going back to the 1950s. I would probably vote for independence to see if it would work. We&apos;re the poor relation at the moment. Scotland has always had the bum deal \u2013 look at the way the poll tax was trialled here. If we were independent, maybe we would be able to protect our identity, Scottish as well as\u00a0British Rory Macdonald, 38, butcher I&apos;m 100% against independence. It would be hugely damaging for the country, we&apos;d be weakened on our own, and it would be a disaster for the whole of Britain. Alex Salmond is a buffoon who&apos;s just looking for his own title as prime minister. He knows he&apos;s going to lose the referendum, and that would be the end of his career. He&apos;s got nowhere to go after that, which is why he&apos;s frightened of it. That&apos;s why he wants the devo-max option included: if that was accepted, he could claim it as a victory and have a little bit more power. Devolution is all very well, but we&apos;ve got that and we don&apos;t need to go any further. Alan Maxwell, 78, retired banker I put my Scottishness before my Britishness, and I think it&apos;s an affront to the Scottish nation that we have been subjugated for 300 years while countries in Africa and Asia have been given their independence. Why Westminster wants to hold on to Scotland is beyond me. Westminster is a little enclave of people who look after themselves. We should have had our independence long ago. It will be an uphill struggle to win a referendum, and events between now and autumn 2014 would have to go in favour of the Scottish Nationalists. If a poll was done tomorrow, it would be a simple victory for the unionists. The average Scot is scared of what the future might hold \u2013 like the north of England, we&apos;ve lost all our staple industries, and North Sea oil is past its peak. But I&apos;m hoping against hope we will vote for independence. Andrew Easton, 20, bakery worker I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll vote in the referendum. What difference would my one vote make? England is going to run Scotland for as long as it likes. We&apos;re too used to bending over to everyone else. If we were going to separate from England, we should have done it a long time ago, when the oil came along. We had the means to do it then. I don&apos;t think the referendum can be won now. Heather Forehand, 71, retired teacher I was born in Africa, have lived in the Borders, in Edinburgh, in Perthshire, in Orkney and in Skye, so while I wouldn&apos;t say I belong anywhere, I am Scottish. There is a Scottish identity, but there are also marked regional variations. Orkney is quite different from the Western Isles, and the cities are much more British than the country areas. I wouldn&apos;t vote for independence \u2013 we&apos;re too small to go it alone. But I am very Scottish, and get very angry when foreign countries talk about England winning the war. There are lots of little niggly things like that, yet I\u00a0still have this gut feeling we&apos;re better all together. I have a son in the deep south \u2013 he lives in Henley \u2013 and when I\u00a0go down there I feel completely alien. It&apos;s a totally different culture. It&apos;s so materialistic, whereas here people care\u00a0more about each other. When I go down there, I just feel, &quot;I\u00a0want to get home&quot;. Do you know &quot;couthy&quot;? It means people embracing each other. There&apos;s such a feeling for your neighbour here Ottery St Mary, Devon Percy Franks, 80, pensioner I was a greengrocer in Ottery for 49 years, but also ran a coal business and a wood business. I was born in the town and have lived here all my life. We used to play football and cricket in the street as children, and perhaps move in the afternoon for a fellow to come up with his horse and cart. It was a closer community then than it is today. If anyone was taken ill, their neighbours would take their children to school. A\u00a0lot of outsiders have moved in now. People come here on holiday and then decide to move here. I think of myself as a Devonian and an Englishman. England means more to me than Britain. England means justice. You don&apos;t even get the same justice in Wales. Three year ago I was doing 35 miles per hour, I didn&apos;t see the sign for 30, and I had a\u00a0\u00a360 fine, the first one in my life. I didn&apos;t go much on that. Honesty is the great strength of the Englishman. You get a true Englishman, and you&apos;ve got an honest man. If they promise you something, you get it. Unfortunately, that&apos;s not always the case today. Adam Blackwell, 29, company director I did my apprenticeship at the old Ottermill Switchgear factory here then, when that closed, set up my own company. I\u00a0was born in Ottery, but moved to Exeter about four years ago. I wouldn&apos;t say I was proud to come from the West Country, but I do think it&apos;s the nicest part of England. The older generation tend to identify more with the area. It&apos;s an easy way of life, there&apos;s not much crime, everyone knows everyone else, and you certainly can&apos;t get away with doing anything without someone else knowing. Glyn Dobson, 69, mayor of Ottery I come from Wiltshire and moved to Devon when I got married in 1963. A lot of my relations, as you can tell from my name, come from Wales, but I haven&apos;t been to Wales for a long time, and I feel English. What defines England for me is our freedom. I suppose that&apos;s why I joined the council. We can say what we want to say and to a certain extent do what we want to do. In general we have a good life as a country. We&apos;re a tight-knit community here. The pace of life is a bit slower than in other areas. I could walk down the town with you now, and 60-70% of the people that we walk past would speak. My wife tells me off sometimes when I go down for the paper first thing in the morning, and I get back an hour later. Phyllis Baxter, 66, manager of tourist information centre The jubilee will be very big here. We&apos;ll have a street party, jubilee proms and a fun day on the Monday when we light a beacon in the evening. For the golden jubilee I dressed up as Britannia in the parade. I was an unusual Britannia because I was actually born in Ireland, 20 miles north of Dublin, but left in 1966 to live in London and moved here 23 years ago. I love England and always have, and I feel British now. My parents always used to take the English papers, and we were Church of Ireland Protestants, so we felt we had as many links with England as we had with Ireland. Caernarfon, Gwynedd Selwyn Jones, 57, architect and bookseller I&apos;m a republican, so the big question for me will be how to avoid the jubilee. There are a lot of events being arranged. I remember for the silver jubilee in 1977 people went over to Ireland and climbed up mountains. I don&apos;t like the term &quot;United Kingdom&quot;. I would prefer it to be the &quot;countries of Britain&quot; rather than a kingdom. I would support an independent Wales, and hope it would be socialist. Everyone talks about the recession, but the reality is that this part of the world never had the boom. We compare to Slovenia in terms of our wealth, which makes us eligible for EU money. The boom and bust, to a great extent, exists only within the M25, but the media focus is always on London. I like the quote from a woman from Aberdaron on the Llyn peninsula when someone asked her if she had ever been to London. &quot;Oh actually,&quot; she said, &quot;I find it&apos;s a bit far from everywhere.&quot; Alicia Jones, 16, student It&apos;s language not politics that mainly identifies us here. I can write English, but find it a bit difficult to\u00a0speak it. I would like there to be a separate Wales so that we could be our own country. At least then we would be more in control. It would just be about Wales, and we could generate our own jobs. I don&apos;t know if we could do it, but we should give it a go. Basil Thomas, 70, retired local government officer I was born into an English family in Caernarfon. When I went to school, all our lessons were through the medium of English. They were trying to force people not to speak Welsh then. I married a farmer&apos;s daughter who was pure Welsh and quickly gave me the basics in the language. I have supported Plaid Cymru in the past, but would not support complete separation from England. We&apos;re not strong enough. United we stand, divided we fall \u2013 I firmly believe that. I&apos;m proud to be Welsh, but I don&apos;t think we&apos;re strong enough to say goodbye to England. I&apos;m also proud to be British and am a great supporter of the monarchy. I sat on my backside on a pillar in the square here for hours to see the investiture in 1969. Annwen Owen, 46, unemployed We&apos;re the poor relation in Wales. All the money goes to Cardiff rather than Caernarfon. There&apos;s very little work here and a lot of the shops are closing. All that&apos;s left are charity shops and cafes. Prince Charles was crowned Prince of Wales at the castle here in 1969, and the Welsh government ought to be here. We deserve more respect. Frances Lewis, 57, seamstress I&apos;m from Birmingham and came here with my partner 12 years ago. It didn&apos;t work out for him, so he left and I\u00a0stayed. I had two sons at school and didn&apos;t want to move them. They were settled and learned the language. I tried to learn it, but just didn&apos;t have time. People were very friendly, and hardly anyone resented the fact I didn&apos;t speak Welsh. It felt like living in a foreign country, but I&apos;m used to it now. I still feel English, but don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll go back. Birmingham is so depressing. I\u00a0think the only place I&apos;d go is Spain. Gwion Thomas, 27 accounts assistant I&apos;m definitely more Welsh than British, but\u00a0I&apos;m not sure about separation. That would depend on economics and whether the benefits outweighed the disadvantages. I&apos;m a\u00a0Welsh speaker and so is my wife, though we talk English to each other. She&apos;s from an English-speaking area, and when I first got to know her we spoke English. When you start a relationship speaking one language, you can&apos;t really switch to another one later. My mum tells us we should switch, but we just can&apos;t. I think we have a different identity to English people, and even if I move away I think I&apos;d come back and settle down here. I&apos;d want my kids to go to a\u00a0Welsh school. It&apos;s important the language continues and grows. Belfast, Northern Ireland Amanda Thompson, 32, income recovery officer I don&apos;t see myself as British or Irish. I&apos;m from a mixed marriage. My mum is a Protestant and sees herself as British; my dad is Catholic and sees himself as Irish; I see myself as Northern Irish because this is where I&apos;m from. I was brought up Catholic, but when I was younger I was never actually taught the difference. My mum and dad didn&apos;t like the Troubles and the problems here, and they brought me up never to identify with all the sectarianism. I have also married a Protestant, which is more acceptable now. It used to be taboo. When my mum was pregnant with my brother, my dad had a gun held to his head and they were given five minutes to get out\u00a0of the house because they lived on\u00a0a Protestant estate. She was eight months pregnant. Now it&apos;s completely different, except in the really hardcore areas. Most people don&apos;t want their children to experience what they went\u00a0through. Scott Johnson, 23, sales\u00a0assistant The school I went to was very Protestant. It had real loyalist leanings and everyone loved the monarchy. But even there we felt that Northern Ireland had a bit-part in Britain, and if they could get rid of us they&apos;d be quite happy to. We need to get past traditional points of view when it comes to loyalism and republicanism, and really do what&apos;s best economically for us as a country. And whether that&apos;s creating a unified Ireland, or remaining part of the UK, or Northern Ireland moving more towards home rule in a real, dedicated sense, should be an economic judgment. Politics shouldn&apos;t play a part of it. Sectarianism is much reduced now, but there are still enclaves. There&apos;s still a culture of sectarian violence in some places. Everyone knows the areas. I was dating a girl from the Falls not so long ago, and that was a huge issue. I couldn&apos;t open my mouth at times, because people in the Falls would have known I\u00a0was from a Protestant area. Male chef, 34, name and photograph withheld I wouldn&apos;t see us as being\u00a0part of Britain; I see us as being occupied by Britain. There was a referendum on the\u00a0island of Ireland in 1921, and the majority of people voted for independence. I would see us as being occupied by Britain since then. I see myself as an\u00a0Irish citizen. I carry an Irish passport\u00a0rather than a British passport. I\u00a0would never hold a British passport, and my children wouldn&apos;t have one either. I would hope to see a united Ireland, but I can&apos;t see it happening any\u00a0time soon, especially as some politicians have accepted British rule here and are sitting in a partitionist assembly. I am pleased the violence stopped, but I&apos;m not happy with the settlement up at Stormont. We&apos;re still\u00a0occupied by Britain; for us, nothing has changed as far as I can see.\u00a0I&apos;m a Catholic, but it&apos;s not a Catholic-Protestant issue; it&apos;s a British-Irish issue. I know Protestants who would like to see a united Ireland too. I accept that they&apos;d be very few, but it&apos;s not a religious issue, it&apos;s a nationalist issue. Sajeen Rasalingam, 29, catering supervisor I&apos;ve been in Belfast for two and half years. I came from Sri Lanka to study in the UK and am married to an EU citizen. I have permanent residence at the moment, and should get citizenship in the next 18 months. I studied in London first, but prefer it here. There is no rush. They&apos;ve been pretty welcoming. I\u00a0lived in Cyprus before, and there was more racism there. I studied information technology and hope to do\u00a0a PhD. For the moment, because I\u00a0am a family man and have a young child, I have to work in KFC to earn some money. Coventry, West Midlands Clinton Ford, 45, unemployed carpenter My parents come from Jamaica, but I&apos;ve lived in Coventry all my life. I feel British rather than English. &quot;English&quot; puts you in a narrow little bracket, whereas &quot;British&quot; is everybody. I&apos;ve experienced a lot of racism in my life. When Coventry won the FA Cup [in 1987], I went into town and got chased by six white dudes. That&apos;s the kind of experience I&apos;ve had. I&apos;ve been jumped with baseball bats and all sorts. But it&apos;s improving. Areas are less segregated than they used to be, and younger kids don&apos;t really care about colour. Paramdeep Singh Gill, 64, retired car worker My wife was born in Britain and I came here from the Punjab in the mid-60s. I&apos;ve got two sons. One is a barrister working as a legal adviser in Saudi Arabia. The other has a master&apos;s degree in computing, and works for IBM. I worked really hard for more than 40 years and made sure they got a\u00a0good education. I feel British now, though India is still important to me and I still go back to see my old school friends. Coventry people have treated me well, and I haven&apos;t experienced racism here. We all go to the pub together and have a pint. John Shorney, 72, former garage owner Coventry used to be the car-making capital of the country, but they shut down Triumph, which had 12,000 men working for it, and then Massey Ferguson, which had 3,000 men working for it. Everything goes abroad. There&apos;s nothing here now. I&apos;ve lived here all my life, but the town has gone down the nick. It&apos;s the same with the football team. We&apos;re bottom of the Championship, and so is the town. Jay Thapar, 18, sales assistant and part-time model My parents are from India. They came here in their teens, got married and I was born here. I see myself as a British Asian, but a lot of other people just see you as Indian. You get judged by your skin colour. With modelling work, you don&apos;t really see Asian faces on mainstream British campaigns. If you read a magazine like GQ, you&apos;ll never see an Asian face. It&apos;s always Italian, black or white. Asian faces tend to be restricted to Asian magazines. I&apos;m one of the only Asians at my agency. They were shocked that I even applied, because Asians just don&apos;t get booked. Christine Fish, 67, former nurse I come from Porthcawl and my heart is still in Wales, but I&apos;ve lived in England for most of my life so consider myself British. I would be sad if Scotland broke away \u2013 we need to be together. I&apos;ve lived in Coventry for 46 years, but\u00a0find now that there are too many foreigners here. Sometimes you can be in a queue, and you&apos;re the only white person. We&apos;ve gone mad with immigration, and the laws are so lax that virtually anyone can get in. We&apos;ve lost our Britishness. We are now multi-faith, and the tragedy is that the people coming in don&apos;t respect our culture. Hilda Nenohwe, 19, student My parents are from Zimbabwe \u2013 my father&apos;s an accountant and my mother&apos;s a nurse \u2013 but I was born in London. I&apos;m studying biomedical science here and hope to do medicine eventually. I feel British rather than English. If you say English, you really segregate to the white, English people. Britain is more inclusive. Coventry is very multicultural compared with where I grew up \u2013 that&apos;s one reason I chose to study here. I was at school in Kent. When we first moved there, we were the only black family in the area, and there was a lot of racism. I was picked on at school. They thought I was very posh. Even the teachers were surprised at how conservative I was; they seemed to think black people should be rowdy. That was quite racist, and made me feel I didn&apos;t belong there. Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire Mike Wilkes, 56, market\u00a0gardener I&apos;d call myself British, not English. I used to sell to greengrocers before the supermarkets took over, and lots of our customers suddenly were West Indians, Pakistanis, Indians, because they were taking over the shops. And they&apos;re British too. They&apos;re workers, we&apos;re workers. They work hard, we work hard. Then my children grew up and went into the big wide world. My eldest daughter lives in Singapore, and is married to a guy who was brought up in Singapore. My other daughter lives in Barnes, south-west London, and is marrying a Scot. My daughters have opened our life up. But though I feel British, it wouldn&apos;t be the end of Britain if the Scots chose independence. They are not suddenly going to put borders up where we can&apos;t go in. They consider themselves independent from us already. It&apos;s a piece of paper at the end of the day. Quentin Richards, 60, antiques dealer I&apos;m pessimistic about the future of Britain. What worries me is the way manufacturing has collapsed. How are they going to create all these new jobs to get the unemployed back to work? There&apos;s no industry. It&apos;s all IT and shopkeeping. There&apos;s no shipbuilding, there&apos;s no coalmining, there&apos;s nothing being built that I can think of. What hope is there for young people? Moses Gittens, 48, cook and stallholder I was born in Moseley in Birmingham, to parents who came to Britain from the Caribbean in the early 1950s. I went to Leicester University, travelled in the Middle East afterwards and learned to cook there. I sell Middle Eastern-inspired food at farmers&apos; markets in Stratford and elsewhere, and it goes really well. I was the first black person on this market. There were barriers when I started, but you can break them down. Britishness is about finding common denominators, and once you find them people link with you. I do the RHS [Royal Horticultural Society] and the Malvern County Show. I&apos;m usually the only black stallholder, so I&apos;m the only person that gets stopped at the gate and asked for ID. It&apos;s hilarious. Sometimes, when I approach organisers at farmers&apos; markets, there can be a subtle form of racism going on. They look at me and say: &quot;Your food is too spicy for our market.&quot; And I say: &quot;That&apos;s fantastic, madam, you can look at my food and see that it&apos;s spicy without even tasting it!&quot; They tell me I won&apos;t do well, but I\u00a0sell out. The people who come to the markets want to embrace difference. Beryl French, 88, pensioner Stratford has so many visitors you could almost call it multicultural. I get stopped by tourists and asked directions all the time. I ought to wear a badge. Mostly they&apos;re looking for toilets; Stratford is terribly short of public toilets. But it&apos;s a delightful place to live and people here are very friendly. I feel very English. As far as the Scots and the Welsh are concerned, they can get on with it. I don&apos;t mind what they do. I&apos;m proud of being English."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/07/ahmad-bradshaw-touchdown-super-bowl-2012-gisele", "sentences": ["It did them little good: Indonesia were beaten by Singapore in the next round instead, they were fined $40,000 for &quot;violating the spirit of the game&quot; and captain-keeper Mursyid Effendi was banned for life."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-07T09:00:00Z", "title": "5 things we learned in Super Bowl 2012 | Steve Busfield", "tags": ["Super Bowl XLVI", "Super Bowl", "NFL", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "Ahmad Bradshaw&apos;s reluctant touchdown, Mario Manningham&apos;s catch and Gisele&apos;s support for Tom Brady are among the topics we discuss in our final Five Things We Learned In The NFL of the season: To score or not to score? With a minute of Super Bowl XLVI left, New York Giants running back Ahmad Bradshaw scored the game-winning touchdown. Except it may well be remembered as the most reluctant game-winner ever.  Bradshaw slowed as he approached the line, paused and then fell into the endzone backwards in rather comical fashion. Indeed, the New England Patriot defensive line had parted specifically to allow him to score.  Afterwards Bradshaw admitted: &quot;I thought I heard Eli [Manning] yelling at me to fall down. I tried, but I couldn&apos;t do it.&quot; Giants quarterback Manning added: &quot;I had a feeling that under the circumstance they&apos;re going to let us score...I think you have to score a touchdown, that&apos;s the goal. The ultimate goal is to score a touchdown...I saw that their defensive line was just standing up and not rushing and I start yelling not to score. Maybe you can get down to the six-inch line, make them use their last time out and then try to score on third down, hopefully score a touchdown to give yourself a bigger lead \u2013 a four-point lead. And take it from there.&quot; The Patriots, who were winning at the time, decided that a New York score was inevitable but allowing the TD would give themselves the maximum amount of time to reply.            .Such actions are far from unheard of in the NFL: At Super Bowl XXXII the Green Bay Packers allowed Terrell Davis to score a touchdown for the Denver Broncos with 1:45 left for exactly the same reason.  On neither occasion did the team allowing the score benefit from their decision, with the Giants and the Broncos emerging as Super Bowl champions. While time management and ball possession are absolutely crucial in the NFL, other sports have seen similarly counterintuitive play - and it is rarely rewarded. Cricket teams have been known to spurn scoring opportunities for possible gains. In 1950 England had scored 68 for 7 on a Brisbane sticky wicket when they ended their innings in order to bowl at Australia rather than try to score more runs themselves. They still lost. In a Shell Caribbean Cup soccer match between Barbados and Grenada in 1994, Barbados scored a deliberate last minute own-goal to force the game into extra time due to bizarre overtime rules. In a 1998 Tiger Cup game between Indonesia scored a deliberate own-goal to lose against Thailand and thus avoid playing the tournament favourites Vietnam in the next round. It did them little good: Indonesia were beaten by Singapore in the next round instead, they were fined $40,000 for &quot;violating the spirit of the game&quot; and captain-keeper Mursyid Effendi was banned for life. But, for all the further examples we might find, none will probably be replayed as often or to such bewilderment, as the winning score in Super Bowl XLVI. Possession wins matches In an exceptionally tight game - which almost everyone predicted and then surprised us with its tautness - the Giants will have been kicking themselves at half-time for being behind. And when New York were 17-9 down shortly after Madonna, it looked as though Belichick and the Brady Bunch would assert what some had feared. This was the Patriots who the New York Times&apos;s Mike Tanier described before the game as a &quot;mix of arrogant excellence and excellent arrogance&quot;. But the Patriots did not score again. What was the difference between the teams? Was it those second-half catches that went to hand or didn&apos;t? (More of that in a moment) Was it luck? Or actually, was it really something much simpler and more central to winning football: possession. This NYT graphic portrays the game starkly: the Giants had 37 minutes of possession to 23 for the Patriots. Tom Brady &amp; Co can&apos;t score if they don&apos;t have the ball. Catches win (and lose) matches I could watch this Mario Manningham catch all day and still be marvelling at every aspect of it:            .Wes Welker was not so fortunate:            . Okay, I know I just said that possession wins matches, but if just those two catches had gone the other way, the result would almost certainly have been different. And, anyway, those catches lead me nicely into this... Supermodel prayers go unanswered Tom Brady&apos;s wife may want to schedule a soiree for her husband&apos;s teammates sometime during the offseason. Ahead of the game Gisele was all about the &quot;positive chain&quot; and praying for the team. But after tasting defeat it was a different story:   &quot;I can&apos;t believe they dropped the ball so many times. My husband cannot fucking throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time.&quot;  Although, as my colleague Michael Solomon pointed out: &quot;Why would Gisele defend her husband after his team lost the Super Bowl? That&apos;s crazy. What kind of wife is supportive like that?&quot; Followed by: &quot;Victoria Beckham defends David: &quot;My husband cannot fucking wear the underwear and shoot the commercial at the same time!&quot;&quot; Which leads me to... More than just football This talk of supermodels, combined with the hoopla surrounding Madonna, and the obsession with Super Bowl commercials, is questioned by some. What&apos;s that got to do with football? Well, that would be to miss half the point of Super Bowl. The half of America that cares not about the NFL for 51 weeks of the year do not suddenly become football fans one Sunday in February.  Madonna&apos;s not my thing (although Bruce was - Best. Knee. Slide. Ever) but it&apos;s the part of Super Bowl that resonates for many who find themselves watching a sporting event for four hours when they normally wouldn&apos;t do so. And, while the whole advertising thing is the pinnacle of capitalism, give it its due, it is the creative height of capitalism. You&apos;ve got to love at least some of these. .Before we leave, here&apos;s a message from the man who made that magnificent catch:            .There will be a special end-of-season Talkboard on Friday.

The British authorities believe he has had links with Ayman al-Zawahiri, the former leader of Egytian Islamic Jihad, who effectively became Osama bin Laden&apos;s deputy. They also say he was a significant spiritual leader to the al-Tawhid movement, whose leader was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and whose Iraq-based terrorist group beheaded the British man Kenneth Bigley. The UK government says Qatada has raised funds for terrorist groups, and gives religious legitimacy to suicide bombers. Based in the UK for the last 19 years, he has spent almost all of the time since 9/11 in jail without charge. In a 2005 summation of its case for his deportation to Jordan, the Home Office wrote: &quot;The presence of Abu Qatada in the UK poses a continuing threat to national security and a significant terrorism-related risk to the public.&quot; It said he had engaged in conduct that &quot;facilitates and gives encouragement to the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism&quot;. The security case stated: &quot;He provides advice which gives religious legitimacy to those who wish to further the aims of extreme Islamism and to engage in terrorist attacks, including suicide bombings. A number of individuals arrested or detained in connection with terrorism have acknowledged his influence upon them.&quot; But the UK authorities accept his role as an al-Qaida organiser was limited. &quot;We accept that [Qatada] encouraged and raised funds for individuals to go to Afghanistan; he may not have gone further as an organiser,&quot; the Home Office said in 2005. Qatada has said he has used his influence to curb extremist activities, and appealed for Bigley&apos;s release. He also offered to make an appeal for the release of Alan Johnson, the BBC reporter who was seized in Gaza in 2007. Qatada has already been convicted twice in his absence by Jordan of conspiring in terror plots. He says these convictions were underpinned by evidence obtained through torture, a claim that has led the British authorities to exclude the allegations from their own case against him. In 1999, he was sentenced in Jordon to life imprisonment with hard labour for conspiracy to carry out terror attacks, and in 2000 he was sentenced to a further 15 years&apos; hard labour for conspiring in the &quot;millennium plot&quot; to attack western and Israeli targets in Jordan on New Year&apos;s Eve. Qatada was born in 1960 near Bethlehem, which was then in territory claimed (and controlled) by Jordan. He arrived in the UK on 16 September 1993 on a forged United Arab Emirates passport. He claimed asylum on arrival for himself, his wife and his three children, and was recognised as a refugee the following year, with leave to remain for four years. He had been living in Peshawar, Pakistan, for two years but was forced to leave and travelled via the Maldives and Singapore to London. He said he feared he would be tortured if he returned to Jordan because the Amman government objected to his Islamist political activities and his ideological leadership of an Islamist reform group that looked to install in Jordan an Islamic government, controlled by Islamic law, and to depose the monarchy. In the UK, he was the imam at the Four Feathers mosque, in north London, and preached at other venues in the London area, including Stowe Club and the Fatima Centre. He also disseminated advice by personal contact, telephone and letter, and online. According to the British case against him, in October 1999 he made a speech in which &quot;he effectively issued a fatwa authorising the killing of Jews, including Jewish children&quot;. He told his congregation that Americans should be attacked, wherever they were; that in his view they were no better than Jews; and that there was no difference between English, Jewish and American people. He is also accused of guiding other terror groups besides al-Qaida, including the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, and Egyptian Islamic Jihad. He has provided advice to individuals such as Rachid Ramda, the former leader of the GIA in the UK, who was arrested for his involvement in the 1995 Paris Metro bombings. After the 9/11 attacks, Qatada went into hiding. Videos of his sermons were found in Atta&apos;s flat in Hamburg, according to reports accepted as true by the British authorities. In a sermon on 14 September 2001, he said the attacks were part of a wider battle between Christendom and Islam, and were a response to America&apos;s unjust policies. In autumn 2002, a poem attributed to Qatada appeared online praising Bin Laden and glorifying the attacks, while in a sermon he stated that it was not a sin for a Muslim to kill a non-believer for the sake of Islam. In October 2002, he was picked up under emergency terrorism laws that allowed indefinite detention without trial, and was held in Belmarsh jail. When the House of Lords quashed that power of detention in 2005 he was held under immigration law pending deportation. He was freed on bail for six months in 2008, under conditions that demanded he stay inside his west London home for 22 hours a day. But then his bail was revoked for unspecified reasons, and he was returned to jail. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 February 2012 to clarify the status of Bethlehem in 1960.

The year of the dragon, just begun, may mark the moment when the aura of inevitability surrounding China&apos;s rise as leading global superpower is punctured, if not wholly dispelled. A range of factors, including adverse economic trends, internal challenges to Communist party control and increasing American re-assertiveness suggests an unexpectedly rough ride ahead for Beijing&apos;s would-be masters of the universe. The furious row over China&apos;s veto of the proposed UN resolution on Syria is a taste of things to come. Barack Obama&apos;s state of the union address vividly illustrated the more combative mood in the US towards a China that is daily accused by Republican presidential candidates of wilfully undermining American jobs and businesses and scheming to supplant the US as world No\u202f1. &quot;I will not stand by when our competitors don&apos;t play by the rules. We&apos;ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration \u2013 and it&apos;s made a difference,&quot; Obama said to applause. &quot;But we need to do more. It&apos;s not right when another country lets our movies, music and software be pirated. It&apos;s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg-up on ours only because they&apos;re heavily subsidised.&quot; Obama said he would create a trade enforcement unit specifically tasked with investigating unfair Chinese trade practices. Falling demand in the US and recession-hit Europe has already had a seriously dampening effect on China&apos;s export-led economy and, despite a recent uptick in US performance, the outlook remains deeply uncertain. Analysts often suggest China&apos;s massive foreign exchange reserves give it a huge potential cushion. It owns about $2tn (\u00a31.25tn) in US treasury and mortgage-backed debt and $800bn in European bonds. But these holdings are a double-edged sword, as Minxin Pei, author of China&apos;s Trapped Transition: the Limits of Developmental Autocracy, noted. &quot;If China threatens to reduce its investment in US debt, it will either have to find alternative investments (not an easy task these days) or export less to the US (not a good idea for Chinese manufacturers). &quot;With so much invested in western debt, China would suffer disastrous capital losses if it spooked financial markets,&quot; Minxin wrote. This year is one of significant political transition in China as well as the US, with President Hu Jintao expected to step down early next year \u2013 and signs of Communist party nervousness abound. The latest in a series of trials of dissidents charged with subversion took place in Hangzhou, eastern China. Veteran rights activist Zhu Yufu was accused of undermining state power by sending a poem and messages on Skype. Such proceedings appear designed to pre-empt any political challenges as the Communist party changes guard. Likewise, police forces in the restive western Xinjiang region, the scene of repeated violent ethnic strife involving the local Muslim population, are to be boosted by several thousand this year. A renewed crackdown on Tibetan activists has been underway for some time. More mainstream challenges to Communist party hegemony stemming from China&apos;s 300 million-strong middle class may be brewing, Minxin suggested. &quot;At most, the Chinese middle class tolerates the status quo because it is a vast improvement over the totalitarian rule of the past, and because there is no practical or immediate alternative. But as the Arab spring shows, a single event or a misstep by authoritarian rulers can transform apathetic middle-class citizens into radical revolutionaries \u2026 &quot;Today, China&apos;s middle class is becoming more dissatisfied with inequality, corruption, unaffordable housing, pollution and poor services \u2026 the party knows it cannot bank on middle-class support.&quot; Ironically, China&apos;s decision to allow uncensored coverage of January&apos;s Taiwan presidential poll, won by the pro-Beijing incumbent, may have backfired by sparking an impassioned mainland online debate about the advantages of democratic elections. This highlighted another uncomfortable reality for the Chinese leadership: more than 500 million Chinese have access to the internet and technologically evolving social media. Government controls cannot keep up and censorship is said to be increasingly ineffective. Xi may have obliquely reflected ruling clique concerns about negative internal and external trends in a recent, remarkably conciliatory speech ahead of his meeting with Obama. &quot;No matter what changes affect the international situation, our commitment to developing the Sino-US co-operative partnership should never waver in the face of passing developments,&quot; Xi said. &quot;In dealing with major and sensitive issues that concern each side&apos;s core interests, we must certainly abide by a spirit of mutual respect and handle them prudently, and by no means can we let relations again suffer major interference and ructions.&quot; But the US is piling geopolitical on top of economic pressure: by exploring new or expanded military partnerships with the Philippines, Japan, Australia and Singapore; by reviving ties with Burma, China&apos;s long-time satellite; and by pressing for more responsible Chinese policy on North Korea, Syria and Iran. All this is part of what Obama calls a &quot;strategic shift&quot; to the Asia-Pacific region after a decade of Middle Eastern preoccupations. What the Chinese military sees is a blatant attempt to encircle and contain China. &quot;We&apos;ve made it clear that America is a Pacific power \u2026 America is back. Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn&apos;t know what they are talking about,&quot; Obama said. This is fighting talk. Obama, his heart set on a second term, has thrown down the gauntlet to China, which (Iran notwithstanding) is in danger of becoming the new US bogeyman. This is the backdrop to Xi&apos;s uncertain inheritance. Despite his conciliatory words, his Washington debut could produce fireworks."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/feb/08/school-legacy-olympics-london-2012", "sentences": ["The finals, which will take place in the Olympic Park between 6 and 9 May, are the climax of four levels of intra- and inter-school competition that Hunt insists will help deliver on the legacy promises made by Lord Coe in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-08T09:00:00Z", "title": "School sports legacy increasingly at risk as Olympics draw near | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Education", "Sport", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Around two and a half months before the cream of the world&apos;s athletes parade around the track at the opening ceremony of the London Games, a rather more low-key event will mark a new phase in the battle to secure an Olympic legacy \u2013 or at least the perception of one. The School Games, the brainchild of the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is \u2013 depending on who you ask and their political persuasion \u2013 either a bold attempt to reinvigorate competitive school sport using London 2012 as a catalyst or a desperate attempt to distract from deep spending cuts that risk putting any hope for a meaningful legacy at risk. The finals, which will take place in the Olympic Park between 6 and 9 May, are the climax of four levels of intra- and inter-school competition that Hunt insists will help deliver on the legacy promises made by Lord Coe in Singapore. Then, Coe vowed: &quot;We can no longer take it for granted that young people will choose sport. Some may lack the facilities. Or the coaches and role models to teach them. Others, in an age of 24-hour entertainment and instant fame, may simply lack the desire. We are determined a London Games will address that challenge. So London&apos;s vision is to reach young people around the world. To connect them with the inspirational power of the Games. So they are inspired to choose sport.&quot; As Guardian education editor Jeevan Vasagar writes today, there are now very real fears that Coe&apos;s electrifying words will result in little meaningful change. The background is complex and controversial, marked by political and ideological rows and turf wars. In 2010 the education secretary, Michael Gove, resolved to remove the \u00a3162m ringfenced funding for a network of school sports partnerships that had raised the number of schoolchildren engaged in two hours or more of sport per week from 25% in 2002 to more than 90% by 2010. Following a feisty debate in the Commons (during which the shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, suggested the cuts were Gove&apos;s revenge for years of misery on the playing fields) and a furious rearguard action from teachers, pupils and athletes, some of the money was reinstated. But it was less a U-turn and more a 90-degree turn. Sue Campbell, the redoubtable chair of the Youth Sport Trust, and her new chief executive, John Steele, are putting a brave face on the new strategy. Campbell says it can be the start of a renaissance for competitive school sport. But while a total of \u00a3153m will be going into the School Games over the next four years \u2013 gathered from a variety of sources and including \u00a310m of sponsorship from Sainsbury&apos;s \u2013 it doesn&apos;t make up for what has been lost. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, there was also a pitched battle for control of the School Games themselves. Lord Moynihan, the British Olympic Association chairman, thought that its remit after the Games could usefully extend to running a school Olympics. But Hunt said on Monday that the BOA wanted complete control, which wasn&apos;t on the table. So the name was changed to the School Games and the BOA sidelined. Hunt also lauded the fact that half of all schools had signed up. By the same token, that means that half of schools haven&apos;t \u2013 in London the total is only 42%. The risk is that we will be left with a patchwork of provision between those schools that understand the wider value of sport and those that don&apos;t \u2013 exactly what the original strategy was introduced to combat. There is no such hesitation at private schools which pour their considerable funds into top-class sporting facilities and as a result have punched well above their weight at recent Games, supplying half of all Britain&apos;s medallists. Hunt deserves praise for doing what he can with limited resources to try to minimise the effect of the cuts imposed by Gove and he loyally defends the actions of his colleague. But it is hard to see how sacking 450 people, then re-employing the majority of them on fewer hours with a re-badged job title and simultaneously cutting the primary school provision that could instil the very &quot;sport for life&quot; attitude that Hunt&apos;s rhetoric promises can be seen as a step forward. For all the economic gloom, and the inevitable cuts, the London Games should have been a moment to definitively rebalance Britain&apos;s relationship with sport and exercise \u2013 beginning in schools, and particularly in primary schools. Ministers from all departments are keen to pay lip service to sport&apos;s role as a social tool \u2013 inspiring otherwise hard to reach children, raising academic achievement and self-esteem. But not enough of them are willing to find the means. This is difficult stuff and the societal and cultural barriers are immense. But that does not mean the original aim \u2013 to use the Olympics to catalyse a lasting change in sports policy and the amount we invest in it \u2013 was wrong. For all the money poured into school sport by the last Labour government when times were good, they arguably didn&apos;t do enough to hardwire investment in sport and exercise into bigger Whitehall departments such as health, education and the Home Office. Now the money they did provide is leaking away. Nor does there seem much clarity on how progress will be measured \u2013 Hunt talks vaguely of instilling the habit of &quot;sport for life&quot; and measuring progress at 16, 18 and 21. Which means it will be years before we know if the strategy works. There are other pressing concerns. Cuts to local authority budgets will inevitably impact on facilities, and the effects are just starting to be felt. Meanwhile, planning laws are being changed in a way that has raised fears about the impact on playing fields. Hunt spoke at a briefing this week of wanting to follow the example of continental Europe and create community sports clubs of the kind that will be familiar to anyone who has spent time in the Netherlands, Germany or France. That is a laudable aim, but is hard to see how the mishmash of policies and initiatives \u2013 individually impressive as some of them are \u2013 that has been cobbled together to assuage concerns over the Olympic legacy can achieve it. Hunt&apos;s enthusiasm seems genuine, but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that the government as a whole increasingly views the Games as a month-long morale-boosting advert for Britain rather than a driver of lasting change. Coe, loyally, insists that the coalition is delivering on his promises by reinvigorating competitive sport. But others are less sure \u2013 from opposite sides of the political divide both Tessa Jowell and Moynihan have expressed confidence in the regeneration vision for east London and Team GB&apos;s medal hopes but flagged up school sport as an area of grave concern. The danger is that after the Games, Britain&apos;s attitude to sport will remain broadly unchanged \u2013 world-class at watching it, and sometimes at practising it at the elite end, but with a population largely happy to take part from the comfort of their sofa with a big bowl of crisps. Stadium wrap leaves a little to be designed  London 2012 organisers are close to unveiling the design for the contentious wrap that will surround the stadium at Games-time, but Damien Hirst and other big-name British artists who were initially approached will not be involved. The \u00a37m wrap that will surround the main stadium during the Games is at the centre of protests from MPs and human rights groups over the fact it is being paid for by Dow, the chemicals giant which they claim still has outstanding liabilities relating to the 1984 Bhopal disaster in India. Initial plans for the 1km wrap were scrapped during the government&apos;s comprehensive spending review as the \u00a39.3bn Olympics project shared some of the pain of widespread spending cuts, but revived when a commercial sponsor was found. However, the original designs for the wrap were abandoned and a push to find a new designer was launched. Hirst and other British artists were approached but it is understood that talks went no further than preliminary conversations. Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP who has called for a parliamentary review of the decision to back Dow, told the Guardian that any prominent British artists would be damaged by their association with the wrap. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine the artistic community of the UK feeling that Dow Chemical, with all its history, is a sponsor they particularly want to associate themselves with. I would be gobsmacked if any eminent British artist decided that what they wanted to do was associate themselves with the Bhopal tragedy.&quot; Sir Humphrey doesn&apos;t take the train Harassed civil servants across Whitehall were this week expected to &quot;reroute and remode&quot; their journeys to work in order to practise for Games-time. The transport secretary, Justine Greening, has already promised that her department will achieve a decrease of 50% in normal traffic by working from home and travelling at different times. Games organisers are relying on an average reduction of 30% among London commuters to avoid transport chaos. Posters pinned up around the DCMS building urged staff to partake in the week-long rehearsal. And Ian Watmore, the former FA chief executive who is now leading a Whitehall cost-cutting drive, tweeted: &quot;This week we are practising for the Olympics by working out of London or on flexible shifts. Today I&apos;m heading to Norwich from Manchester.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/08/a380-superjumbo-checks-wing-cracks", "sentences": ["It added: &quot;This condition, if not detected and corrected, may lead to reduction of the structural integrity of the aeroplane.&quot; The A380&apos;s biggest customer is Dubai-based Emirates, which operates 20 of the 525-seater jets, followed by Singapore Airlines with 15, Qantas with 12, Lufthansa eight, Air France six, Korean Air five and China Southern two.", "It may be a meaningful amount, given the impact it will have on airline operations.&quot; Qantas also announced, hours before the new EASA directive, that it had temporarily grounded an A380 after discovering 36 new cracks, which were found during a mandatory safety check after the jet suffered severe turbulence on a flight between London and Singapore last month."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-08T12:14:34Z", "title": "All A380 superjumbos to be checked for wing cracks", "tags": ["Airbus", "Airline industry", "Air transport", "Business", "World news"], "article": "Airbus faces the prospect of a multimillion-pound compensation payout to airlines including Emirates and Qantas after the European aviation safety body ordered safety checks for the entire global fleet of A380 superjumbos. Europe&apos;s largest aerospace company has been dogged by the discovery of hairline cracks inside the British-made wings of its flagship aircraft, whose history has been beset by production delays and a near-disastrous engine blowout on a passenger flight in 2010. Airbus has maintained that flaws do not endanger the safe operation of the world&apos;s most advanced commercial aircraft, but the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) deepened its embarrassment on Wednesday by ordering the extension of an inspection regime to cover all 67 of the planes currently in service. Last month, it demanded checks for 20 of the longest-serving aircraft after discovering a &quot;new form of cracking&quot; inside A380 wings.     An A380 superjumbo belonging to Qantas. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images    EASA said on Wednesday that the problem could spread to all superjumbos delivered over the past four years, warning that these cracks &quot;may develop on other aeroplanes, after a period of service&quot;. It added: &quot;This condition, if not detected and corrected, may lead to reduction of the structural integrity of the aeroplane.&quot; The A380&apos;s biggest customer is Dubai-based Emirates, which operates 20 of the 525-seater jets, followed by Singapore Airlines with 15, Qantas with 12, Lufthansa eight, Air France six, Korean Air five and China Southern two. Airbus admitted that it will pick up the bill, which includes the cost of the checks and compensation for removing aircraft from service and, if necessary, replacing cracked parts with new fittings. The problem relates to brackets that attach the A380&apos;s wing ribs \u2013 the elongated, oval-shaped frames that run along the width of the wing \u2013 to the wing&apos;s metal skin. There are more than 2,000 of these brackets per wing on an A380 and sources said the hairline cracks were created during the manufacturing process at the Airbus wing plant in Broughton, Wales. The first cracks were found inside a Qantas-owned A380 that suffered a serious engine failure over Indonesia in 2010 and has yet to be returned to service. Those cracks originated in bolt-holes that held the feet of the L-shaped brackets to the wing&apos;s covering. However, EASA announced last month that a &quot;new form of cracking&quot; had been discovered in other aircraft, this time on the vertical part of the bracket. EASA said on Wednesday that these cracks could spread to the entire fleet. Faced with the threat of a customer backlash of the kind that carmaker Toyota suffered in its 2009-11 recall crisis, Airbus said the problem had occurred on a &quot;handful&quot; of brackets per aircraft. &quot;These brackets are located on wing ribs which are not main load bearing structure, and, thus, the safe operation of the aircraft is not affected. Nearly 4,000 such brackets are used on the A380 to join the wing-skin to the ribs. Only a handful of brackets per aircraft have been found to have been affected,&quot; the manufacturer said. Although Airbus reported record orders in 2011, driven by demand for the A320neo jet, the A380 is key to its long-term future, with 253 sold so far. Chris Tarry, an aviation industry analyst, said: &quot;Most new aircraft encounter challenges after their entry into service but the most important thing is that the problem has been identified and is being fixed. The issue now is how much cash compensation will need to be paid by Airbus. It may be a meaningful amount, given the impact it will have on airline operations.&quot; Qantas also announced, hours before the new EASA directive, that it had temporarily grounded an A380 after discovering 36 new cracks, which were found during a mandatory safety check after the jet suffered severe turbulence on a flight between London and Singapore last month. Airbus said the cracks were not related to the turbulence. The previous EASA directive referred to aircraft that had flown more than 1,300 flight cycles \u2013 counted as one take-off and landing \u2013 but has been expanded to all aircraft in operation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-24-interactive-event-business-sustainability", "sentences": ["A twelve hour interactive online global broadcast connected three live events, taking place in Rio, Singapore and London, as well as other individual keynote speakers and panel discussions, with live chats, webinars, industry-focused debates and question and answer sessions with guest speakers from across the globe."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-08T13:00:00Z", "title": "Sustainability 24: one day to set the agenda for business", "tags": ["Partner zone Accenture", "Guardian sustainable business"], "article": "On 23 May 2012, Accenture focused the attention on business sustainability, by advancing global debate and discussion with clients, business leaders, local government leaders and other stakeholders.

Gatz sees a cast of 13 perform every word of F Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s The Great Gatsby \u2013 a premise that sounds indigestible on paper yet has performed around the world to sellout audiences and ecstatic reviews. The New York Times&apos;s chief theatre critic, Ben Brantley, described it as &quot;the most remarkable achievement in theatre not only of this year but the decade&quot;. &quot;We&apos;ve always had an interest in creating shows that weren&apos;t meant for the theatre,&quot; said John Collins, director of New York-based theatre company Elevator Repair Service, who first had the idea for the Gatz in the late 90s. &quot;We thought late-90s New York resembled late-20s New York \u2013 reckless exuberance and new wealth. But I also got interested in the problem of putting a novel on-stage and I didn&apos;t want to bring in a playwright to recraft it because the writing seemed perfect to me.&quot; Instead, Collins decided to set the play in a drab office, where the main character, Nick, finds a copy of The Great Gatsby and starts reading it out, his co-workers slowly turning into Fitzgerald&apos;s characters as he becomes increasingly wrapped up in the book&apos;s 49,000 words. Collins has read \u2013 or heard \u2013 the book over 150 times, while Scott Shepherd, who plays Nick, has committed the entire thing to memory. &quot;There&apos;s always a bit more to discover in it,&quot; said Collins. &quot;The perspective in the novel has been finessed so beautifully that I still find little literary and poetic gems peep out.&quot; Sarah Churchwell, professor of American literature at the University of East Anglia, who is writing a book called Careless People about the events that inspired The Great Gatsby, agrees. &quot;It is intensely lyrical and poetic, imagistic and synesthetic in its language, which means that even when the plot isn&apos;t carrying the story along, there is a richness and rhythm in the language that is immersive,&quot; she said. &quot;Its fundamental subject - Gatsby&apos;s fatal error in accepting America&apos;s message that life&apos;s potential can be realised by chasing material success could not be more timely.&quot; Collins&apos;s company was &quot;nervous&quot; about the play&apos;s length \u2013 &quot;before that we hadn&apos;t made anything longer than an hour and 15 minutes,&quot; he said \u2013 and experimented with performing it in two halves on consecutive nights, before realising that audiences were thinner on the second night. &quot;What&apos;s rewarding is the totality of the experience,&quot; says Collins. &quot;When we do it all in one night we lose nobody.&quot; In London, where it will play as part of the London International Festival of Theatre, Gatz will start at 2pm and finish at 10pm with a 90-minute break for dinner. &quot;The most commitment is in the first 30 minutes, because that&apos;s when we&apos;re asking people to slow down their clocks a little bit,&quot; said Collins. &quot;Once they do that there&apos;s a huge reward in getting to the last chapter, which is where some of the most beautiful writing is.&quot; Though Gatz was initially blocked by the Fitzgerald estate \u2013 which, said Collins, had &quot;an arrangement&quot; with another production \u2013 it has now given the show its blessing. The delay, which initially prevented the show from being performed in London or New York, meant it gathered momentum as it travelled to other US cities and countries around the world, including Australia and Singapore. &quot;It backfired in a wonderful way. But we have a great relationship with [the Fitzgerald estate] now and we&apos;re proud to have their support,&quot; said Collins. This year will see a rash of adaptations of The Great Gatsby, with an &quot;immersive&quot; production opening in Wilton&apos;s Music Hall in London in April, and a musical following at the King&apos;s Head in August. Baz Luhrmann is also making a 3D film of the book starring Carey Mulligan and Leonardo DiCaprio. &quot;Filming Gatsby is an exercise in futility,&quot; said Churchwell. &quot;Language can intimate, and leave multiple possibilities open. Film must choose one. Gatsby will either be gauche, or classy; Daisy will be charming, or repellant; Nick will be dishonest, or honest. And Baz Luhrmann isn&apos;t exactly known for his subtlety. 3D cocktails? I think not.&quot; Collins added: &quot;He&apos;s known for his lavish productions, but I don&apos;t think period detail is what&apos;s great about the book.&quot; Though Gatz&apos;s production is far from opulent, some tickets are expensive even by West End standards. Prices start at \u00a327.50, with &quot;premiere seats&quot; at \u00a3117.50. Yet even at this price, Collins said Gatz is value for money. &quot;Your normal West End price might only get you a show that&apos;s an hour and 20 minutes long.

Omar al-Bashir, Sudan&apos;s president, warned the dispute could spark another war. &quot;We will go to war if we are forced to go to war,&quot; he said on national television. Trafigura, which is run from Switzerland by billionaire Claude Dauphin, confirmed that the oil it bought from Sudan is subject to a legal claim from South Sudan, the world&apos;s youngest country, created after it broke away from Sudan last year. &quot;The government of South Sudan was asked to provide further information to support its claim to ownership of the oil in which Trafigura has an interest. Some information has been provided which we are reviewing,&quot; Trafigura said in a statement. Trafigura said it had made &quot;significant efforts&quot; to confirm ownership of the oil it bought three weeks ago. &quot;In relation to our interests in recent shipments, given the ongoing political discussions with respect to Sudanese oil ownership, significant efforts have been made to confirm legal title, and that confirmation has been provided.&quot; South Sudan, which is landlocked and exports its oil via a pipeline through Sudan, stopped all oil production last week as the dispute escalated. Last month Sudan admitted to holding tankers carrying South Sudan&apos;s oil, claiming that the south had failed to pay a multimillion-dollar transit fee for the use of the north&apos;s pipeline to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. Trafigura bought the oil in an Indian-flagged tanker called Ratna Shradha three weeks ago. The ship, which is believed to be heading for port in Malaysia, was last seen on 5 February near Singapore, according to Reuters. South Sudan has warned that it may take legal action against any parties that buy the disputed cargo. Oil accounts for 98% of South Sudan&apos;s annual income.This is not the first time Trafigura has been involved in legally suspect oil deals. In 2001 the trader was allegedly involved in smuggling 500,000 barrels out of Saddam Hussein&apos;s Iraq. Trafigura insists it handled the deal via third parties in good faith. Trafigura said its profits in its last financial year were boosted to more than $1.1bn following &quot;prolonged volatility&quot; created by the Arab spring uprisings and the Japanese tsunami, according to a letter Dauphin sent to bondholders seen by the Financial Times. &quot;Social upheaval in Libya and Egypt led to a restriction in North African crude supply. In Japan, the catastrophic earthquake and resulting tsunami had a profound effect on global industrial production, the most important determinant of commodities markets,&quot; the letter said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/09/sheffield-meadowhall-shopping-centre-for-sale", "sentences": ["The sale is likely to generate a lot of interest from companies such as Capital Shopping Centres (CSC), Hammerson, and Australia&apos;s Westfield, as well as sovereign wealth funds from Singapore, Canada, Norway and the Middle East.", "The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation&apos;s real estate arm bought a 40% stake in Britain&apos;s biggest mall, MetroCentre in Gateshead, in 2007."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-09T20:22:23Z", "title": "Sheffield's Meadowhall shopping centre comes on the market at \u00a31.4bn", "tags": ["Business", "Retail industry", "British Land", "UK news", "Sheffield"], "article": "A majority stake in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield is for sale, at a price likely to value the whole mall at \u00a31.4bn or more.

I head up the team that develops and manages QAA&apos;s national and international partnerships and participation in quality assurance networks. We protect the interests of everyone working towards a UK higher education qualification \u2013 however and wherever they study. I started my career in higher education as a committee administrator at what is now Glasgow Caledonian, before moving south to work at CNAA then onwards to Brussels to work on the European Credit Transfer System. While I was there I joined the Higher Education Quality Council (one of the forerunners to QAA). I started at the QAA as an international consultant to the reviews department, working one day a week at the agency and the rest of the time at a university and on international projects including some in South East Europe. I once heard a colleague of yours refer to you as the &apos;James Bond&apos; of the education sector, she was referring to the work you do tracking down people who sell bogus degrees \u2013 can you tell me a bit about that? I head a team of very experienced bogus degree mill hunters who gather evidence about this extremely lucrative \u2013 some of these rackets are making millions of pounds each year\u2013 illicit activity and we pass it on to relevant authorities in the hope that they will prosecute. People running diploma mills are often involved in money laundering and other activities. These are serious criminal gangs, one of the most infamous being the group that ran the St Regis university operation. One of the worst things about diploma mills (and their emerging partner accreditation mills) is the negative impact on the reputation of online education and validation arrangements. Online education can be the only option that students in some places have - for example, millions of students in India study online, but concerns about diploma mills often mean that valid and reputable qualifications gained through online study are treated with suspicion and not recognised. Whenever a scandal about validation hits the papers, people say &apos;we told you this was dodgy&apos;, but there is a long and honourable history of validation that has brought access to education to people who wouldn&apos;t otherwise have had it. It has developed institutions with limited experience of delivering degree programmes into institutions that now have degree awarding powers and university title in the UK. It has been an apprenticeship model, if you like, and it has been a vehicle for internationalisation. There are lots of good things about validation so it should not be dismissed because there&apos;s been one scandal. What do you anticipate will be the major challenges and developments in your role in the coming years? Trans-national education (TNE) is growing exponentially. In the coming years we will need to engage with an ever wider range of institutions, inside and outside the UK, to provide reassurance about quality and academic standards. It&apos;s our job to affirm public confidence in UK quality and standards. In total, we have around 700,000 international students in the UK and abroad studying for UK degrees. Just factoring in their parents and funders means there are a lot people who want to be confident that the students are getting a decent quality educational experience, and a qualification that&apos;s going to recognised in ongoing study and employment. The current major locations for UK TNE in terms of student numbers are Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and mainland China. But many other locations are coming up and, in some cases, present new challenges in terms of delivery and management of quality. What works in one national and regulatory context is not always transferable to another. As universities around the world improve, UK higher education will have to work harder to attract students. It would be good to see greater collaboration between UK universities in international activities to boost individual and collective competitiveness. If you look at Australian universities, they are all competitive but they have co-operation factored into their international strategy \u2013 and maybe that&apos;s something we should emulate.

Although they all give detailed descriptions of how you back up, none of them describes how to restore. If you lose your hard drive suddenly, but are backed up in a cloud application, can you restore the whole hard disk, applications and data in one operation?RL SymondsIf you are using cloud storage, then a server keeps copies of your hard drive somewhere on the internet, probably encrypted for security reasons. You can&apos;t access those files unless you have an internet connection and perhaps a copy of the cloud service&apos;s client (PC) software as well. I don&apos;t see how all that can be done in one restore operation. It&apos;s certainly not as simple as restoring a disk image from a local drive, as discussed here in January. If you suddenly lost your hard drive, you would normally use a restore partition, if available, or a drive image, after booting Windows from a recovery CD, DVD or thumb drive. Third-party boot-and-restore utilities are often based on a small version of Linux, but you could also use any Live Linux CD to get online. So, if you have a recovery CD or a Live Linux CD, plus any software that your online backup service requires, then you can indeed restore your PC from the cloud. With Carbonite and probably some other services, you can restore a complete backup if you can get to the site in a web browser. This is useful, but I would not recommend it as your primary backup strategy. Things are different with mobile phones and other devices where the operating system is stored on a Rom chip, and where &quot;restore from cloud&quot; may be a simple menu option. Phones have built-in connectivity, and there is relatively little data to back up. PCs are not designed to work like that, and it&apos;s not unusual for people to have 500GB or even a terabyte (1TB) of data. Size matters, for two reasons. First, it can take a long time to upload and then download 500GB or 1TB of data. It&apos;s much quicker to restore from an external hard drive (EHD), as mentioned, or from a local fileserver such as a Windows Home Server or Apple Time Machine. Second, it costs a lot of money to keep data in the cloud. Cloud services typically offer 2GB to 5GB of free storage to get you going, but after that, they charge a monthly fee. If you want to back up a whole PC, you could end up paying \u00a310-\u00a320 per month for storage, which is \u00a3120-\u00a3240 per year, or \u00a3600-\u00a31,200 over five years. You can buy several terabytes of fast, local storage for that sort of money. Memopal, which was founded in Italy, is a cheap option, and offers good discounts for signing multi-year deals. Storing 300GB (the highest amount offered to personal users) costs \u20ac69 for one year and \u20ac213.90 (rather than \u20ac345) for five years. You could buy a 500GB or larger hard drive for the first year&apos;s cost (\u00a357) and several terabytes for the five-year cost (\u00a3178). Cloud storage does have some advantages. You get an off-site backup that will still be there if your house is burgled or burns to the ground, and you can access your files from different PCs or even from smartphones and tablets. This also makes it simpler to share files with other people. Against that, cloud storage brings some significant risks. You can lose access to your account, your data can become corrupted, or the cloud service provider can delete it either by accident or deliberately because you haven&apos;t paid your bills. Worse, web-based companies frequently go bust. I experienced these problems after uploading some files to Streamload, an award-winning service launched in 1998. The company lost a lot of data transitioning to new software, got taken over, and then closed down. It didn&apos;t matter because I had everything backed up locally, but Streamload had 20,000 paying customers (as well as countless freeloaders), and I don&apos;t think everyone did.  I&apos;m not suggesting that you should never use cloud services. I use Dropbox and Microsoft&apos;s SkyDrive (25GB free) to back up and share photos and Office documents from smartphones: it&apos;s very handy to have photos automatically uploaded and/or automatically copied to a PC. It means I&apos;m less likely to lose valuable files. Nonetheless, I still back them up to one or more EHDs, and sometimes to CD-R discs. The cloud isn&apos;t my primary backup, and only a small proportion of my files are in the cloud, but it&apos;s still useful. Not all cloud services are the same, but there are two basic approaches. Some provide a sort of &quot;magic folder&quot; or virtual online drive where you can put files that you want to back up. This is the idea behind Dropbox. With other services, you select one or more existing folders and have them backed up on a continuous basis. For example, you could have the service monitor directories of My Documents and My Photos, knowing that whenever you changed files in those folders, the changes would be backed up online. Mozy and SugarSync are popular examples of this kind of service, and Memopal works in the same way. (This partly answers a separate query from Andrew White.) Which you prefer is, of course, a matter of taste. However, the continuous backup approach tends to consume more resources, so you should use the service&apos;s trial period to make sure the cloud&apos;s constant monitoring software doesn&apos;t slow your PC. Cloud services should be smart enough to back up the changes to a file without uploading the whole file again. The &quot;diff&quot; approach makes it easy to keep backups of many different versions of a file. Services should also be smart enough not to back up files they have already uploaded from someone else. Even Streamload did that. There are plenty of files \u2013 such as operating system files and iTunes and Amazon downloads \u2013 that are identical on millions of different hard drives. Indeed, charging thousands of users for the same small bit of storage is where cloud services should be able to make money. In his query, Andrew White also asked for a cloud storage service that was &quot;preferably based in the UK&quot;. There may be some but, sorry, I can&apos;t think of one.  Large cloud services providers, such as Microsoft, typically have large data centres on different continents. The best Microsoft will do with its Office 365 service is keep your data in Europe, in Dublin and/or Amsterdam, rather than (say) Chicago, San Antonio, Singapore or Hong Kong. Smaller cloud service providers, including Dropbox, often use Amazon&apos;s very reasonably priced Simple Storage Service (S3) , so data is probably held in the US: Amazon has data centres in northern California (us-west-1), North Virginia (us-east-1), Ireland (eu-west-1) and Singapore (ap-southeast-1). However, Amazon caches data in many other places, including London and Tokyo. I&apos;m not sure it makes any practical difference where data is stored. The US government can get it under the terms of the Patriot Act if it&apos;s kept by an American company or one that does business in the US, even if it&apos;s a European company. You might find cloud storage in a country that won&apos;t give your data to US or European government agents on request, such as Russia or China, but would that be a satisfactory solution? With cloud services, you really don&apos;t have much protection unless you pay business prices and sign an SLA (Service Level Agreement). Even then, it would be wise to read the fine print very carefully."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/feb/16/reasons-cheerful-economy-cautious", "sentences": ["Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore&apos;s economy shrank for the second time in three quarters at the end of 2011."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-16T15:50:00Z", "title": "Reasons to be cheerful about the economy \u2013 but more to be cautious", "tags": ["Global economy", "Economic recovery", "US economic growth and recession", "Economics", "Business"], "article": "Since late last year, a series of positive developments has boosted investor confidence and led to a sharp rally in risky assets, starting with global equities and commodities. Macroeconomic data from the United States improved; blue-chip companies in advanced economies remained highly profitable; China and emerging markets slowed only moderately; and the risk of a disorderly default and/or exit by some members of the eurozone declined. Moreover, under its new president, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank appears willing to do anything necessary to reduce stress on the eurozone&apos;s banking system and governments, as well as to lower interest rates. Central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have provided massive injections of liquidity. Volatility is down, confidence is up and risk aversion is much lower \u2013 for now. But at least four downside risks are likely to materialise this year, undermining global growth and eventually negatively affecting investor confidence and market valuations of risky assets. First, the eurozone is in deep recession, especially in the periphery, but now also in the core economies, as the latest data shows an output contraction in Germany and France. The credit crunch in the banking system is becoming more severe as banks deleverage by selling assets and rationing credit, exacerbating the downturn. Meanwhile, not only is fiscal austerity pushing the eurozone periphery into economic freefall, but the loss of competitiveness there will persist as relief at the waning prospect of disorderly defaults strengthens the euro&apos;s value. To restore competitiveness and growth in these countries, the euro needs to fall towards parity with the US dollar. And, while the risk of a disorderly Greek collapse is now receding, it will re-emerge this year as political instability, civil unrest and more fiscal austerity turn the Greek recession into a depression. Second, there is now evidence of weakening performance in China and the rest of Asia. In China, the economic slowdown under way is unmistakable. Export growth is down sharply, turning negative vis-\u00e0-vis the eurozone&apos;s periphery. Import growth, a sign of future exports, has also fallen. Similarly, Chinese residential investment and commercial real-estate activity are slowing sharply as home prices start to fall. Infrastructure investment is down as well, with many high-speed railway projects on hold and local governments and special-purpose vehicles struggling to obtain financing amid tightening credit conditions and lower revenues from land sales. Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore&apos;s economy shrank for the second time in three quarters at the end of 2011. India&apos;s government predicts 6.9% annual GDP growth in 2012, which would be the lowest rate since 2009. Taiwan&apos;s economy fell into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2011. South Korea&apos;s economy grew at a mere 0.4% in the same period \u2013 the slowest pace in two years \u2013 while Japan&apos;s GDP contracted at a larger-than-expected 2.3%, as the yen&apos;s strength weighed down exports. Third, while US data has been surprisingly encouraging, America&apos;s growth momentum appears to be peaking. Fiscal tightening will escalate in 2012 and 2013, contributing to a slowdown, as will the expiration of tax benefits that boosted capital spending in 2011. Moreover, given continuing malaise in credit and housing markets, private consumption will remain subdued; indeed, two percentage points of the 2.8% expansion in the last quarter of 2011 reflected rising inventories rather than final sales. And, as for external demand, the generally strong dollar, together with the global and eurozone slowdown, will weaken US exports, while still-elevated oil prices will increase the energy import bill, further impeding growth. Finally, geopolitical risks in the Middle East are rising, owing to the possibility of an Israeli military response to Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions. While the risk of armed conflict remains low, the current war of words is escalating, as is the covert war in which Israel and the US are engaged with Iran; and now Iran is lashing back with terrorist attacks against Israeli diplomats. The Islamic Republic, with its back to the wall as sanctions bite, could also react by sinking a few ships to block the Strait of Hormuz, or by unleashing its proxies in the region \u2013 the pro-Iranian Shia in Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Moreover, there are broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that will not ease \u2013 and that might intensify. The Arab spring has produced a relatively favourable outcome in Tunisia, where it started, but developments in Egypt, Libya and Yemen remain far more uncertain, while Syria is on the brink of civil war. In addition, there are substantial concerns about political stability in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia&apos;s oil-rich eastern province, and potentially even in Kuwait and Jordan \u2013 all areas with substantial Shia or other restless populations. Beyond the countries affected by the Arab spring, rising tensions between Shia, Kurdish and Sunni factions in Iraq since the US withdrawal do not bode well for a boost in oil production. There is also the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, as well as strains between Israel and Turkey. In other words, there are many things that could go wrong in the Middle East, any combination of which might stoke fear in markets and lead to much higher oil prices. Despite weak economic growth in advanced economies and a slowdown in many emerging markets, oil is already at around $100 per barrel. But the fear premium could push it significantly higher, with predictably negative effects on the global economy. With so many risks in so many places, investors, not surprisingly, will eventually prize liquidity in their portfolios, while shunning riskier fixed assets again when these tail risks materialise.

And I&apos;m sure more people associate the term with him than have read &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, the story in which it first appeared in 1981. It&apos;s a great word, so it&apos;s hardly surprising it was taken up to describe the virtual space of computer networks outside science fiction, a space now so real that the Pentagon recognises it as a fifth military domain (the other four being land, sea, air and outer space). In many ways, cyberspace as we know it isn&apos;t much like cyberspace as Gibson imagined it 30 years ago, but the resemblance is close enough for him to have acquired a reputation as a prophet of the information age. As the pieces gathered in Distrust That Particular Flavor make clear, it&apos;s not a reputation he&apos;s entirely comfortable with. In a talk he gave at Book Expo in New York in 2010, published here for the first time, he joked that Neuromancer has &quot;a complete absence of cellphones, which I&apos;m sure young readers assume must be a key plot point&quot; and pointed out that &quot;imaginary futures are always, regardless of what the author might think, about the day in which they&apos;re written. Orwell knew it, writing Nineteen Eighty-Four in 1948&quot; \u2013 the year, as it happens, that Gibson was born \u2013 &quot;and I knew it writing Neuromancer&quot;. Orwell is one of the acknowledged influences Gibson returns to repeatedly here. Others include HG Wells, Jorge Luis Borges and William Burroughs. There are also pieces on musicians (Steely Dan are described, not entirely convincingly, as &quot;among the most genuinely subversive oeuvres in late-20th-century pop&quot;) and visual artists, including Greg Girard, whose photographs of the demolition of old Shanghai and the &quot;shoals of cheap-ass concrete thunderheads&quot; being built in its place are &quot;almost more than I can bear to contemplate&quot;. &quot;I know little more about Shanghai than these images,&quot; Gibson writes, but there are other pieces here on cities he knows better: the ones he loves \u2013 Tokyo, London, New York \u2013 and one he loathes, Singapore, which he calls &quot;Disneyland with the death penalty&quot;. After Wired ran this article in 1993, the magazine joined the ranks of those banned by the Singaporean government, Gibson says in a short postscript. These brief afterwords \u2013 conversational, self-deprecating and no less thoughtful than the writing they comment on \u2013 are one of the collection&apos;s principal pleasures; many of the individual pieces, after all, are already available online. In 1989, Gibson wrote an article for Rolling Stone on the subject of &quot;the net&quot;: &quot;As a science-fiction writer, I&apos;m sometimes asked whether or not I think the net is a good thing.&quot; In the postscript to the piece in this volume, he writes: &quot;What I don&apos;t recall, quite, is what I would have imagined &apos;the net&apos; to be, at that point, however freely I tossed the term around for Rolling Stone.&quot; The piece includes two vivid memories from Gibson&apos;s childhood and youth: one of listening to Chubby Checker on a crystal &quot;Rocket Radio&quot;, which &quot;requires no battery at all&quot;, using &quot;a quarter mile of neighbour&apos;s rusting fence for an antenna&quot;; the other of finding &quot;60 feet of weirdly skinny magnetic tape snarled in roadside Ontario brush&quot;. He says more than once in the collection that he believes &quot;that all cultural change is essentially technology-driven&quot;. But as well as the pieces here on new technology \u2013 the internet, digital film \u2013 Gibson shows an abiding interest in old, obsolete or obsolescent technology (though it isn&apos;t true, he says, despite the many newspaper articles that repeat the assertion, that he still writes on a manual typewriter). The longest essay in the book, &quot;My Obsession&quot;, written for Wired in 1999, describes a year he spent in the late 1990s collecting mechanical watches, compulsively bidding for them on eBay. Part of their appeal lay in their being &quot;so brilliantly unnecessary. Any Swatch or Casio keeps better time,&quot; he writes. But &quot;the idea of the Collectible&quot;, he suggests, is a &quot;basic mammalian response to the bewildering flood of sheer stuff we\u00a0produce&quot;. A semi-autobiographical character in one of his early stories, &quot;The Winter Market&quot;, is an artist who works in &quot;garbage, kipple, refuse, the sea of cast-off goods our century floats on&quot;. The tension between the urge to accumulate stuff and the desire to escape from it is everywhere in Gibson&apos;s writing, fiction and non-fiction. He&apos;s given up on eBay these days; he&apos;s a must-follow presence on Twitter instead. And last September, he tweeted: &quot;Saw my first discarded flatscreen TV, put out to be collected as\u00a0trash.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/17/novikov-london-w1-restaurant-review", "sentences": ["Singapore noodles?"], "publicationDate": "2012-02-17T22:59:59Z", "title": "Restaurant: Novikov, London W1 | John Lanchester", "tags": ["London holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Europe holidays", "Travel", "Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "England holidays"], "article": "If you&apos;re old enough to have vivid memories of the Soviet Union, the idea of a\u00a0hip Russian restaurant entrepreneur opening flash new eateries in London \u2013 this hurts your brain. Can the world really have changed so much, so fast? Answer: yes, and we have the proof in the form of a new Mayfair restaurant, Novikov. It&apos;s owned by Arkady Novikov, the undisputed heavyweight champion of the Moscow restaurant business, with 20-odd high-end restaurants in the capital, as well as a chain of budget restaurants, as well as lots of other stuff (Gianni Versace&apos;s \u00a326m former villa on Lake Como, for instance). The stereotype about Russian food used to be that it featured depressed people toying with pickled things while power-drinking vodka. That may once have been accurate \u2013 Novikov himself has spoken of the fact that when he opened his first restaurant in 1992, one of the main problems was the difficulty in getting hold of any meat \u2013 but it isn&apos;t now. There&apos;s nothing like scarcity to make people appreciate the value of something. Every Russian I&apos;ve ever met is interested in food; no one needs to tell them the virtues of the local, the seasonal and the foraged. The cold war-era Soviet Union was a perfect training in the food values of the 2010s. It follows that there is nothing inherently ridiculous about the idea of a Moscow restaurateur opening in London; indeed, we already have the highly successful example of Goodman&apos;s steak restaurants. It was not written in the heavens that Novikov&apos;s new place would be a dog. It is, though \u2013 a howling dog. At least, the Asian part of it is. Novikov is three restaurants in one: Asian, Italian and Lounge. (This last is an idea that has worked well for the owner in Moscow, some of them themed with brand names from the Cond\u00e9 Nast empire, such as the GQ Bar.) I tried the Asian restaurant, and maybe I just had back luck. Lots of bad luck. I certainly had lots of ordinary food. The simplest way to describe what&apos;s wrong is to say you can get most of what&apos;s on the menu better and cheaper elsewhere. Kimchi, for instance: you can find superb versions of these famous fermented vegetables wherever there&apos;s a decent Korean deli, and they cost only a few quid. Here, we were given two sorts, one featuring spinach rolls with sweet chilli sauce poured over them. Very poor. Seaweed salad? Three different seaweeds, prettily served in three piles on a long dish, with two dipping sauces, one of them nastily sweet, the other nastily salty. Ceviche? Big, underseasoned chunks of fish with equivalent-sized pieces of mango. No. Singapore noodles? These were OK, up to Chinatown standard, though with too much cumin. But for \u00a312? I said you can get most of the menu somewhere else, but not all of it. Unfortunately, the things you can&apos;t get anywhere else are things you don&apos;t want to eat. Pork siu mai, a\u00a0classic squidgy dim sum, are a\u00a0happy-making thing that don&apos;t need to be improved or rarefied, just executed in the version all siu mai lovers already love. The addition of truffle is a subtraction \u2013 a costly subtraction, at \u00a39 for four small dumplings. Robata-grilled king crab leg was deeply strange, two decent pieces of crab meat with a &quot;wasabi mayonnaise&quot; on top. The bizarre, faintly sweet, faintly cheesy sauce, which was finished off under the grill, tasted like a mutant b\u00e9chamel; a really peculiar dish. It was \u00a337. At that price, just be grateful you won&apos;t be tempted to order seconds. There&apos;s a food counter where you can pick up stuff to take home and cook for yourself, if so moved, but be warned that a single scallop retails for \u00a39.50. There are aspects of Novikov where you can see real professionalism at work: the room is understatedly dark and soothing; the waiters are amiable and efficient (and quite a\u00a0few of them are Russian, which may say something about the clientele, too). By concentrating and cross-checking the prices, you can get out for less than \u00a3200 for two. On a bitterly cold midweek lunchtime, the restaurant was full.

On our most popular programme, graduates spend time in different areas before settling into one that suits them best. As a result, being able to fit in with new teams and roles is important. &quot;Allianz has offices across the world and some graduates have the opportunity to work internationally, so being willing to travel to experience different working cultures sends a powerful message to employers that a candidate is willing, literally, to go the extra mile.&quot; View from the inside Annelie Noble, Aon graduate scheme &quot;People always ask: why insurance?

Question: This Malaysian mystery bird&apos;s common name is misleading and further, it&apos;s not known at this time who its close relatives are. What am I talking about? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Response: This is a black magpie, Platysmurus leucopterus, a basal member of the corvid family (probably). If you are interested in common names, then you will be interested to learn that this bird is neither a magpie, as its common name indicates, nor is it a jay, as was long believed. In fact, this bird is a treepie, which is a distinct group of corvids that resemble magpies. Treepies are highly arboreal long-tailed birds and rarely (almost never?) come to the ground to feed, unlike magpies. The black magpie is the only member of its genus, although its two subspecies are quite distinct and could very well be separate species.  Black magpies are insectivorous birds that inhabit subtropical or tropical moist lowland evergreen forests and mangroves in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand. They are gregarious and active. The black magpie has black plumage with small areas of white on the terminal half of its upper wing-coverts and a large white patch on the exterior webs of some of the outer secondaries; the forehead crested and the feathers stiff. Its bill, legs, and feet are black; irides vary between red and crimson.  You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

Steve Hilton&apos;s description of Virgin as an &quot;upstart&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;fat cat&quot; British Airways, relayed in a piece in Standpoint magazine this week, has caused some eyebrows to be raised. Virgin Atlantic had a turnover of \u00a32.4bn in its last financial year. It is 51% owned by the Virgin Group, with the remaining 49% being in the hands of that other minnow, Singapore Airlines. The prime minister&apos;s policy guru has fallen into the trap that lies in wait for all PR executives \u2013 believing the hype. But the faux humility of Sir Richard Branson has lured many of his competitors into ill-advised complacency. Lord King, the former BA boss, admitted that he failed to take Branson as seriously as he should have done. It was those jumpers. Had he\u00a0shown up in a suit he would obviously have meant business. Branson&apos;s triumph has been to preserve the image of being a maverick, and an underdog, even while he has been sitting on top of a gigantic international business. We must hope the PM is getting rather more acute advice in regard to the other senior figures he has\u00a0to deal with. This is an era of brands, labels and image. It should not be surprising if a multibillion-pound business can still portray itself \u2013 and be seen as \u2013 edgy, or\u00a0&quot;insurgent&quot;. There is also perhaps some &quot;motivated perception&quot; going on\u00a0here. Psychologists tell us that humans can form &quot;in groups&quot; and &quot;out groups&quot; very quickly, sometimes wanting to be seen as belonging to one group and definitely not to another. Yuppies were always that awful group of people over there. It was never a label\u00a0that could possibly have been applied to oneself. David Cameron once staked his claim for membership of the &quot;sharp-elbowed middle classes&quot;, which was pushing it a bit (I am referring to his\u00a0alleged &quot;middle-class&quot; status. I make \u00a0no comment on the sharpness or otherwise of his elbows.) Likewise, when Tony Blair once said\u00a0that he didn&apos;t like to see himself as a politician, it wasn&apos;t just a clever bit of spin. It was rather something bordering perhaps on self-delusion: he really did not want to be seen as being part of that game, and felt that he was somehow separate from it. Bless. The Brits, it is said, love an underdog. And commercially it could be quite a clever strategy to mark your business out as hungrier and more eager to please than a complacent market leader. Avis cars, acknowledging that Hertz was the market leader in car rentals, made a virtue out of this by claiming that &quot;We try harder&quot;. On the other hand, there was a time when British Airways was only too keen to declare itself &quot;the world&apos;s favourite airline&quot; \u2013 thereby creating an opening for cheeky Mr Branson and his scarlet-clad cabin crew, an image and market positioning that seems to have endured, in the minds of some people in Downing Street, at least. Is BA really &quot;fat&quot;, and is Virgin Atlantic really, after all these years, still an upstart? Airlines have good days and bad days. They are all capable of getting it right, or wrong. A lot of customers, you expect, would struggle to tell the difference between them. Had he become a travel writer, George Orwell might have described the scenes at Heathrow like this: &quot;The passengers looked from upstart to fat cat, and from fat cat to upstart, and from upstart to fat cat again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.&quot;  \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/21/manchester-united-revenue-bank-balance", "sentences": ["Detailed plans to float a stake of up to 30% on the Singapore stock exchange in a bid to realise $1bn in value have been put on indefinite hold due, according to club insiders, to the global economic uncertainty."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-21T14:50:17Z", "title": "Manchester United bank balance falls by \u00a3100m in six months", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Business", "The Glazer family", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Manchester United&apos;s bank balance has fallen by almost \u00a3100m in six months, according to the club&apos;s quarterly accounts, as a result of buying back bonds, player arrivals and stadium improvements. The latest accounts show that while revenues continued to rise as a result of increased TV income and corporate hospitality revenue, plus new commercial contracts, higher wages contributed to sharply increased operating costs. Overall revenues in the six months to the end of 2011 increased to \u00a3175m from \u00a3156.5m a year earlier, driven largely by rises in media and commercial income, including a new training kit deal with DHL. But operating costs rose to \u00a3110m from \u00a396.9m. The club will point to investment in refurbishing hospitality boxes, which has led to an increase in income, as evidence it can go on squaring the circle of shouldering debt interest repayments while continuing to invest in the squad and facilities. The sharp fall in United&apos;s bank balance, from \u00a3150.6m to \u00a350.9m, over the space of six months was largely a result of the \u00a347m net outlay on transfers in the summer and \u00a35.3m in the most recent quarter alone spent on buying back bonds. Protesters against the Glazers have long feared that the money in the account would be spent on further financial engineering rather than players. The club, owned by Malcolm Glazer and his family, has now spent a total of \u00a392.8m buying back bonds originally released as part of a contentious \u00a3512m bond issue in 2010. Even though most of the repurchased bonds have been at a higher price than the initial sale value, it makes financial sense because it reduces the interest burden on the club. Despite the buybacks, the net interest paid during the last half of the year went up slightly to \u00a324.5m but the club said this was due to when certain payments fell due compared with the previous year. But supporters&apos; groups, who have long protested against the Glazer model, will argue that money invested in buying back bonds is not being spent on the playing squad. Since the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 and a sponsorship deal with Aon that involved a substantial upfront payment, the Glazers have been able to point to United&apos;s healthy bank balance. But the purchases of Ashley Young, David de Gea and Phil Jones have substantially reduced that cash pile, which stood at \u00a3164m at its height in June 2010. The signings and new deals for existing players, together with an expansion in the club&apos;s commercial operation off the pitch, drove a sharp rise in staff costs. Wages rose to \u00a338.7m during the final quarter of 2011, an increase of 17.3% compared with the previous year. Despite the strong revenue growth, results in the second half of the year are likely to be affected by the club&apos;s elimination from the Champions League after the group stages. As a result, all of its Champions League income for the season has been booked in the first-half accounts and revenue from the Europa League will not compensate. Detailed plans to float a stake of up to 30% on the Singapore stock exchange in a bid to realise $1bn in value have been put on indefinite hold due, according to club insiders, to the global economic uncertainty. Manchester United Supporters&apos; Trust said: &quot;Manchester United revenues continue to grow strongly although costs are increasing just as quickly so pretty much negating that growth. However the key figures of interest to supporters show the Glazers have now spent every penny of the money received from the sale of Ronaldo, and more. That&apos;s now \u00a392.8m spent on buying back their own bond debt that they loaded on to our club. So statements at the time that all of the Ronaldo money would be made available for reinvestment were clearly just spin.&quot; &quot;Since the sale of Ronaldo [in June 2009] net transfers [not including Ronaldo] have totalled just \u00a390m while they have taken out of the club \u00a3225m to cover their debt payments and interest. What could the club have done with that extra \u00a3225m? Cheaper tickets for loyal fans, investing massively in the squad and stadium, developing and retaining the best youth players, competing on an equal basis with the very best teams in Europe. This is the true cost to Manchester United of the Glazers&apos; ownership.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/22/acta-stalled-european-commission", "sentences": ["Others include Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-22T16:24:19Z", "title": "Acta approval stalled by European commission", "tags": ["Acta", "Internet", "World news", "Intellectual property", "Technology", "Europe", "Piracy"], "article": "Approval of the controversial international anti-counterfeiting treaty Acta has been stalled by the European commission, which is to ask Europe&apos;s highest court whether implementing it would violate any fundamental EU rights. The decision comes as the treaty faces growing opposition in parliaments, city streets and the internet, with some countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Poland declaring they would not approve the agreement in its current form \u2013 a stance that would make it impossible to ratify, because it requires every European country to sign up and approve it. EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht said on Wednesday that an opinion from the European court of justice would clear what he called the &quot;fog of misinformation&quot; surrounding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. &quot;This debate must be based upon facts and not upon the misinformation or rumour that has dominated social media sites and blogs in recent weeks,&quot; De Gucht told reporters in Brussels. &quot;Acta will not censor websites or shut them down; Acta will not hinder freedom of the internet or freedom of speech.&quot; The ECJ will assess Acta&apos;s compatibility with the EU&apos;s fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of expression and information or that of protection, he said. The decision to refer the treaty to the ECJ appears to reflect recognition by EU officials of the political obstacles Acta faces. Earlier this month protesters marched against the agreement in several European capitals including London, Berlin, Helsinki, Paris and Vienna. Internet lobbyists and health campaigners have rallied against it, saying that overly strict controls of copyright would exclude people from the internet and prevent developing countries from accessing generic medicines. The agreement asks internet providers to co-operate with national authorities to crack down on online piracy, for example by cutting off internet access to users who illegally download music or films if that is part of the legal framework in that country. &quot;Intellectual property is Europe&apos;s main raw material, but the problem is that we currently struggle to protect it outside the EU. This hurts our companies, destroys jobs and harms our economies,&quot; De Gucht said. At the same time MPs in a number of countries have said they will not sign it. Although the EU and 22 EU member states signed the treaty on 26 January 2012 in Tokyo, and the European council unanimously approved Acta in December, all 27 member countries have to formally ratify it for the EU to be a party to the treaty. The US has signed the agreement. Others include Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. Mexico and Switzerland participated in the negotiations but have not yet signed. However Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia, Cyrus, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands have all refused to sign the agreement on the grounds that it endangered freedom of speech and privacy The hacking group Anonymous claimed responsibility last week for a series of hacks against the US Federal Trade Commission and consumer rights websites, whose front pages were replaced with a violent German-language video satirising Acta. Acta has been under negotiation \u2013 almost all in secret \u2013 since June 2008. Its drafters say it is needed to harmonise international standards to protect the rights of those who produce music, movies, pharmaceuticals, fashion goods, and a range of other products that often fall victim to piracy and intellectual property theft. The treaty has been questioned by members of the European parliament. In a statement Wednesday, David Martin, a spokesman on the issue for the Socialists and Democrats, the second-largest bloc in the parliament, welcomed the decision to get the court&apos;s opinion. &quot;Trade commissioner Karel de Gucht today admitted that there are still many question marks about Acta and what the implementation of the agreement, as it stands, would mean for citizens and for the freedom of the internet,&quot; Martin said. &quot;The parliament has been calling for more clarity for a long time, and we already requested legal opinions from several committees in the European parliament. Now this ruling will be a good guarantee for the impact on fundamental rights. EU officials say the agreement will not change EU law. They insist what was legal pre-treaty would remain legal the day after, and what was illegal would remain illegal.

In much of southern England and the Midlands, 20-45% of all rainfall is already abstracted, making it one of Europe&apos;s most water stressed areas. Further population growth is set to exacerbate this while climate change models point to failing rainfall and evapotranspiration rising in the coming decades. It is time to acknowledge that these regions face a fundamental water shortage and we have to take these threats seriously. Here are some suggestions that will not solve the current drought, but will go a long way towards making episodes such as this a thing of the past. The first response ought to be to change the way we look at water management. We need to move from a supply-led model to a demand-led one. Currently, water companies get a return on new fixed assets they develop (reservoirs, pipes and desalination plants, for example) but there is no similar incentive to push leakage levels down other than the targets set by Ofwat. This in turn means that Ofwat needs to be mandated to explicitly encourage efficiency, innovation and sustainability in their economic determinations. One way of achieving this is through smart metering and water management. These have a potential to deliver on demand management. With smart metering (two way meters that provide real time data to utilities and customers), customers can appreciate when they are using water and how it is costing them. They can be used to enable utilities to charge differential tariffs to encourage more efficient water usage. If tariffs can be made flexible both during the day (higher at times of peak demand, usually in the early evening, so that the flow of water is smoothed across the day) and between seasons (to encourage conservation during drier periods) metering has the potential to push water demand down. Likewise, the Environment Agency can encourage efficiency across all sectors through a rethink of abstracting licensing and charging so that major users are obliged to recognise water as a scarce resource that carries a value. This ought not to be a revenue raising exercise, but one where funds are made available through increased abstraction charges to assist in water efficiency and reuse. The idea of a transfer of water from Scotland would be costly both in terms of operating and capital expenditure and because of the pumping needed, would boost the sector&apos;s carbon footprint. A transfer from Wales makes more sense because of the potential for linkages. It is a limited option and we would have to recognise the value of the water transferred and for that money to be made available to the Welsh government. The historic expropriation of water from Wales is no longer politically acceptable. Despite all the talk about &quot;eco-cities&quot; only one housing project (Beddington&apos;s BedZed, completed in 2002) has sought to make full use of the potential resource that grey water and rainwater offers. Water efficiency and reuse needs to be hardwired into the planning process. Housing developments in water scarce regions ought to be conditional on such measures. In Copenhagen and Singapore, rainwater collected from the storm sewerage system is subjected to tertiary treatment and reused. Also in Singapore, consumer goods have been subject to increasingly stringent efficiency standards. We need to look at wastewater as a resource rather than something to dispose. Wastewater reuse and recovery remain exceptions rather than the rule. In Singapore&apos;s New Water project sewage, is fully treated and then used by industry as non-potable water or returned to the catchment system, where it is abstracted and treated again for indirect potable use. Windhoek&apos;s direct potable reuse facility has resulted in no cases of illness during the first decade of its operation. These show that once the populists are weaned away from the shock and awe of waste water reuse, it is too precious a source of water, energy and nutrients to ignore. Addressing the long term impacts of dwindling water resources is a task for all concerned. Given the right regulatory encouragement, innovative companies are ready and willing to play their part.

The cost of Brent crude hit $121.92 a barrel, or \u00a377.77, beating a sterling record set last year at the height of the Libyan war. US crude hit a nine-month high of $106 (\u00a367.62) a barrel this week, though it slipped slightly in trading on Wednesday night. The highest price recorded in dollars was $147 in July 2008, when the pound was stronger against the greenback. Analysts said a growing boycott of supplies from Iran, which is Opec&apos;s second largest producer, had encouraged traders to hoard oil contracts at higher prices. Prices have risen steadily over the last fortnight after a growing dispute between Iran and the UN over allegations that the Middle Eastern state is close to developing nuclear weapons. The UN&apos;s nuclear watchdog was forced to quit Iran earlier this month after talks on Tehran&apos;s atomic research broke down. Russia warned Israel not to attack Iran over its nuclear programme, saying on Wednesday that military action would have catastrophic consequences. Unable to act through the UN in the face of Russian resistance, the US has encouraged a worldwide boycott of Iranian oil and sanctions against its banks, but has stopped short of backing military action. &quot;Iran is still the main issue; it&apos;s keeping prices very well supported,&quot; said Andy Sommer, an analyst at EGL in Dietikon, Switzerland. The jump in the oil market comes after the UK price of diesel reached a record 143p a litre last week and amid accusations in Europe and the US that high fuel prices are the result of a dysfunctional market. UK refiners have come under fire for pushing up the price of fuel to maintain margins squeezed by falling demand. Most UK refiners are debt-laden independent operators struggling to repay debts in a period of declining sales. Coryton, the Thames estuary refinery owned by Swiss oil group Petroplus, recently went bankrupt after it was unable to run at full capacity. Coryton is expected to return to capacity after a rescue bid, but could still struggle. Demand has fallen across Europe and Asia following a slowdown in economic growth. Figures showing China&apos;s manufacturing sector contracted in February for a fourth straight month added to the gloom in the euro area, and stirred fears about fuel demand in the world&apos;s second-largest oil user. Evidence that the poor economic situation is having a direct impact on the fuel market came from Singapore Airlines, which cut its cargo capacity by 20% as persistent weakness in demand and high jet fuel prices piled pressure on its profitability. A high oil price was behind the sharp jump in UK inflation last year to above 5%. A rise this year could undermine George Osborne&apos;s hopes of a recovery. Officials in Spain, Italy and Greece are also watching the oil price closely because they are major importers, especially of Iranian crude, and are vulnerable to increased costs. Several analysts have argued the deal struck between Brussels and Athens could be endangered by a further slump in Greek economic output following a sharp rise in oil prices. The eurozone&apos;s service sector shrank unexpectedly this month, reviving fears that the economy could sink into recession, Markit&apos;s Eurozone Services Purchasing Managers&apos; Index showed on Wednesday."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/22/hays-loss-bank-recruiting", "sentences": ["Some bankers are still leaving the UK and heading overseas, but the job situation in the financial sector has also worsened sharply around the world, from Singapore and Hong Kong to Sao Paulo, according to Hays&apos;s chief executive, Alistair Cox."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-22T17:49:18Z", "title": "Hays records \u00a33m loss in UK as bank recruiting slows down", "tags": ["Hays", "Banking", "Business"], "article": "The recruitment squeeze in banking, along with cuts in the public sector, have pushed recruitment company Hays&apos;s UK division to a \u00a33m loss. Some bankers are still leaving the UK and heading overseas, but the job situation in the financial sector has also worsened sharply around the world, from Singapore and Hong Kong to Sao Paulo, according to Hays&apos;s chief executive, Alistair Cox. &quot;A year ago we said that a lot of bankers were looking for jobs out in Asia. We still see that, but the banking sector has slowed down globally,&quot; he said. &quot;Banking started to get worse four to five months ago.

With 5.5 million staff, the public sector remains the UK&apos;s biggest employer. Since 2008, Hays has laid off about 1,000 of its staff in Britain, where it now employs 2,100 consultants out of a total UK headcount of 3,500. Each of its 113 offices is now profitable, but there is still scope to cut back office and other costs by up to \u00a312m, Cox said. Collins Stewart analyst James Gilbert said: &quot;It is clear that in the absence of a pick-up in demand, there is no magic bullet for the UK.&quot; The German and Australian recruitment markets, by contrast, are booming. Hays, which employs 8,000 people across 31 countries and will open up in Chile and Malaysia in the next few weeks, now generates nearly 70% of its fees outside the UK. It is sending engineers to Australia, Canada, the US, the Middle East and east Asia, while IT and pharmaceuticals professionals are also in demand. Hays posted a 24% rise in pre-tax profit to \u00a360m for the six months to the end of December, but, like many of its rivals, has seen growth slow rapidly as confidence among clients to hire, and candidates to consider moving jobs, is dampened by economic uncertainty.

Tens of thousands of 360-degree, high-definition panoramas of underwater forests, grasslands and crags will be taken by robot cameras, mapped and made available on the internet as a result of the collaboration, which will seek help from a global audience to assess the health and composition of the 2,300km-long reef. The scientists and conservationists behind the Catlin Seaview Survey hope the attraction of &quot;virtual diving&quot; will also raise awareness about climate change, coral bleaching, deepwater ecology and the breeding habits of invertebrates that may only be able to spawn once a month by the light of the full moon. The survey, which is sponsored by the UK-based insurance company Catlin and backed by NGOs, research institutes and the University of Queensland, was unveiled at the World Ocean Summit in Singapore. The expedition will start in September, with images expected to be available soon after on a dedicated YouTube channel as well as Panoramio, Google Earth, Google Maps and a custom-made 360-degree viewer. Images are already online from a six-day pilot mission, when scientists said they found a new species of pygmy seahorse and four types of coral that had never been seen in the region. Many more discoveries are likely as 93% of the reef is unexplored because it is too deep for scuba divers. The chief scientist for the project, Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, said the survey would reveal one of the last frontiers of the Earth to the public. &quot;This is like going to the Amazon in 1800,&quot; said Hoegh-Guldberg. &quot;Millions of people will be able to experience the life, the science and the magic that exists under the surface of our oceans.&quot; The study will focus on three areas: shallow reefs will be captured in colourful 360-degree panoramas, deep reefs will be shown in more limited detail due to the lack of light, and there will also be an effort to track the migration and breeding patterns of manta rays, tiger sharks and green turtles. The research will also include findings on sea temperatures, calcification rates, reef bleaching and whether deep coral \u2013 which is relatively well protected \u2013 can provide the spores needed to rebuild damaged coral near the surface. It is hoped that this will provide a baseline for follow-up studies in the future that will allow for more precise analysis of the impacts of climate change. As well as clicking on maps to &quot;dive&quot; and look around, the public can participate by helping to sift through the tens of thousands of images and measuring the size of the coral and the numbers of fish in each place. &quot;The key is to bridge the gap between scientific understanding and public awareness. That&apos;s where the role of Google Ocean is crucial,&quot; said Richard Vevers of Underwater Earth, one of the partners in the project. &quot;Normal scientific papers may be read by 1,000 people and then left on a dusty shelf and forgotten. The opportunity for millions to see this is enormous.&quot; Google has been trying to incorporate more information about the oceans on Google Earth by using terrain studies, surface simulations and photographs uploaded by the public. The new study of the Great Barrier Reef will go much further. &quot;We are working to create a canvas and are now looking for scientists and others to tell the story,&quot; said Jenifer Austin Foulkes, head of Google Ocean. The cost of the project has not been disclosed, but its backers hope that it can be expanded to underwater environments elsewhere in the world. Efforts to address the deterioration of the world&apos;s marine ecosystems is expected to feature prominently at this summer&apos;s Rio+20 summit in Brazil.

A mere 12 years into the 21st century, we have already witnessed some truly momentous events: the global economic downturn; Barack Obama becoming the first black president of the United States; the Arab spring; the tsunamis of 2004 and 2011; and conflicts in the Middle East. These events have taken place against a backdrop of rapid technological change, with the internet maturing to include social networking and cloud computing \u2013 both of which are changing the way we work and cultivate business relationships and are helping to foster a culture of sharing information and ideas. As technology continues to rapidly evolve, it has a major role to play in helping businesses to create a more sustainable future. In the face of such rapid evolution, envisaging what might happen in the next 13 years requires practical foresight, as well as brilliant imagination \u2013 and this is exactly the task of the FutureScapes project. Convened by Sony and leading sustainability non-profit organisation Forum for the Future, FutureScapes is bringing together business leaders, thinkers, designers, futurologists, writers and the public to explore the potential of technology to create a better, more sustainable world, by imagining and discussing life in 2025. Will advances in sustainable energy challenge nuclear and fossil fuels? How will the economic might of China and India change the balance of geopolitical power? How will technological innovations come to affect daily lives and how businesses operate? FutureScapes has conceived four possible scenarios around what life might be like in the year 2025. These are not predictions, but rather thought-starters to explore these ideas further. Scenario 1: Hyper innovation A vibrant, innovative economy is providing solutions to keep the world&apos;s problems in check, from solar-power initiatives to augmented-reality interfaces and biotechnology. But can all this technology address economic inequality and is there a danger that it might induce digital fatigue in society? Scenario 2: Shared ownership High carbon prices have made many forms of ownership too expensive and many people are opting for alternative forms of ownership such as collaborative consumption. One consequence for everyday life is that overseas holidays are prohibitively expensive, leading to a switch to hyperlocal and virtual holidays. What will this future hold for business and how can commerce adapt to, and influence, what is now primarily a service-oriented, not product-oriented, economy? Scenario 3: Centralised survival The environmental challenges posed by dramatic climate change, food shortages and freak weather conditions have led to the need for strong government intervention. Strict carbon quotas have been brought in, which impinge on travel and rein in wasteful excesses. However, the need for universal action has given society a common focus and there is increased political consensus. Will this 21st-century &quot;Blitz spirit&quot; extend to business and how will companies achieve sustainability within the global market? Scenario 4: Prosperity redefined Ten years of global downturn have led to a profound shift in values concerning social inequality. Productivity is down, but quality of life is up, with less time spent in the office. The mantra of &quot;growth&quot; has been replaced by a focus on happiness and wellbeing. But what role does business and technology have in supporting healthier, low-carbon lifestyles? The discussion, in association with Sony and Forum for the Future, will address what life might be like in 2025 and ask what role technology will play in meeting the challenges that may face us in the future. Where are the opportunities for commerce to drive sustainable change and what examples are there already out there? How can we ensure technology is accessible to all? What new business models will be required? We have brought together a panel of experts in this space to tackle these questions and explore what the future holds. The discussion will take place on Wednesday 29 February 2pm-4pm (GMT).

The Micronesian and Polynesian nations are implementing the network in conjunction with environmentalists to ease the impacts of overfishing, pollution, acidification and climate change that are threatening their economic and social systems. The project - which aims to cover an area bigger than the combined territories of the US and Canada - was outlined during a World Oceans summit in Singapore that brought together scientists, politicians, NGOs and representatives from the fishing and shipping industries. It comes amid a raft of new moves to reduce the alarming deterioration of the world&apos;s marine environment even as governments and businesses push ahead with ever more development of coastlines, industrial fishing and deep-sea mining. To counter these threats, Kiribati is positioning itself as a pioneer of ocean sustainability and a model for the &quot;Blue Economy&quot;. Having already created a vast nature reserve around the Pheonix Islands - which is now Unesco&apos;s biggest natural heritage site - it signed up last September with 14 neighbouring island states to the Pacific Oceanscape Framework drawn up in conjunction with the US-based NGO, Conservation International. In the coming years, the signatories aim to cooperatively manage their marine resources and design policies that improve ocean health, increase resources, share expertise, and factor ocean issues into decisions about economic and sustainable development. Kiribati is the first state to try to put this scheme into practice. As an incentive - and to compensate for the loss of fisheries affected by the program - it will receive $5m from an endowment fund set up by Conservation International and the Global Environment Facility of the World Bank. It will be followed in August by Tokelau Island and Cook Island, which will add their combined sea area of 1.4m square kilometers - about three times the size of California - into the Pacific Oceanscape network. The president of Kiribati, Anote Tong, said his nation had learned that individual marine parks are not sufficient. &quot;We have to connect them together,&quot; he told delegates at the summit. &quot;Political commitment at the highest level, with support from financial community, is essential.&quot; Money remains a challenge. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be needed for the scheme to expand across all 15 states, which together account for about 40m square kilometres of ocean and a third of the world&apos;s tuna stocks. Enforcement is another problem. Kiribati has only one coastguard boat to police an area the size of California. To bolster its capacity, the US coastguard has sent ships on &quot;training missions&quot; with Kiribati representatives on board. They have reportedly intercepted two poaching ships, which were fined several million dollars. This is a worldwide concern. Illegal and unreported fishing gobbles up $22bn of resources a year, almost 50% more than illegal logging, according to Malcolm Preston, global head of sustainability and climate change of PricewaterhouseCoopers. The search for solutions to this and other threats to the marine environment are belatedly picking up pace. The World Bank president, Robert Zoellick, will call on Friday for a new International Partnership for Oceans. Next week, the Antarctic Ocean Alliance - comprising conservation NGOs such as WWF, International Fund for Animal Welfare, Greenpeace and groups from China and South Korea - will launch a campaign to link 19 areas around Antarctica into what would be the world&apos;s biggest nature reserve by an order of magnitude. The development of the &quot;blue economy&quot; is also expected to feature prominently at the Rio+20 meeting in Brazil in June. The former UK foreign secretary David Miliband said initiatives, such as that in South Pacific, showed that regional and international co-operation can promote economic growth and protect the marine environment. &quot;The fact that we&apos;re a terrestrial species on a marine planet has led to a real neglect of our oceans,&quot; Miliband said. &quot;In an interdependent world, you need to share sovereignty.&quot; The extent to which Kiribati and its neighbours can influence the international debate remains to be seen. But Peter Seligmann of Conservation International, said these countries are playing a role that shows their true colours as &quot;giant ocean states&quot;. &quot;In my 36 years of experience in conservation, I&apos;ve never been involved in anything at this scale,&quot; said Seligmann. &quot;They are not saying they won&apos;t have growth. But they want to manage their resources in a way that sustains culture and resources \u2026 This is the beacon on the hill.

In addition, one of the UK-published nominees concerns the tale of a Japanese fellow who trained Yorkshiremen in the art of chicken sexing,&quot; he said. The award was dreamed up during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978 as a way to avoid boredom, with Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice its inaugural winner. Votes can be cast at the Bookseller and at the magazine&apos;s sister site, We Love This Book, with the winner to be revealed on 30 March.

The Global Partnership for Oceans, a coalition of governments, NGOs, scientists and businesses, is a political boost for the world&apos;s overfished, heavily polluted and increasingly warming oceans.            More controversially it proposes the expansion of aquaculture (farmed fish) to provide two-thirds of the world&apos;s fish, up from half today, to alleviate pressure on wild fish as a growing human population increasingly looks to the sea for protein. Unveiling the plan, the World Bank president, Robert Zoellick, warned that marine ecosystems, which cover more than 70% of the surface of the planet, have deteriorated to a perilous level. &quot;The world&apos;s oceans are in danger, and the enormity of the challenge is bigger than one country or organisation. We need co-ordinated global action to restore our oceans to health,&quot; he told the Economist&apos;s World Ocean Summit in Singapore. The alliance brings together many nations and organisations that are already attempting to alleviate what is, after the climate, the ultimate &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; \u2013 the running down of resources that are largely owned by no one, exploited by anyone and woefully unregulated. Among the confirmed backers are small island states, many leading conservation organisations \u2013 including Conservation International, WWF, the Nature Conservancy, and business groups commited to sustainable practices. The World Bank is also in discussion with with other potential supporters, including the Prince&apos;s Trust and the governments of Australia, Monaco, New Zealand, and Norway. But the success or failure of the partnership is likely to be determined by its ability to find funding and reach out to leading economies in Europe, North American and big developing nations, such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil, where increasingly affluent and large populations are looking to the oceans for more protein, energy and minerals. Many are reluctant to accept protection measures that might constrain opportunities to exploit these resources. Zoellick \u2013 who is approaching the end of his tenure at the World Bank \u2013 says the first step is promoting greater awareness of the value of oceans \u2013 for example, in absorbing carbon dioxide and regulating weather patterns \u2013 and then helping governments to incorporate this in their policies. &quot;Oceans are the home of an under-recognised and underappreciated &apos;blue economy&apos;,&quot; he said. But he still needs to find the money to push this initiative. The partnership is committed to mobilising at least $300m in catalytic finance and aims to use that to leverage another $1.2bn from businesses, NGOs and other institutions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/feb/24/water-companies-conserve-supplies-drought", "sentences": ["Paris and New York only lose around 10%; Singapore is below 5%."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-24T14:07:45Z", "title": "Water companies need to do a better job of conserving supplies | Fred Pearce", "tags": ["Water", "Environment", "Drought", "Water bills", "Consumer affairs", "Household bills", "Money"], "article": "Overlooking the cathedral city of Winchester is St Catherine&apos;s Hill, a beauty spot with a dirty secret. Just beyond the hill&apos;s ancient fort, Winchester pours its sewage into the hillside, from where Southern Water eventually supplies it to taps across south Hampshire. It&apos;s quite safe. The chalk cleans the sewage well. There should be more of this. With England facing the worst drought for a generation, we can no longer drink our water only once. Britain is not a wet country. South-east England gets less rain per head than Sudan. And while most of the rain falls in the north and west, the population increasingly congregates in the south and east. That&apos;s why this week there were calls for a national water grid. The first grid link could send Welsh water to London, via the River Severn and massive pumps that would get it over the Cotswolds and into the Thames. Soon, Whitehall may dust off old plans to turn the Wash into a giant freshwater reservoir for the Midlands. But when we build big, we usually build wrong. Our biggest reservoir was opened by the Queen 30 years ago. Kielder Water is a mile from the Scottish border, and was built to supply Teesside steel works and chemicals factories. But by the time it was finished, those industries had all shut down. Today the reservoir sits largely unused. The tunnel dug to take its water from the Tyne to the Tees has only opened its taps twice. We should forget boosting water supply and instead curb demand. Not with pathetic exhortations to consumers, like Thames Water&apos;s call last summer for women to stop shaving their legs in the shower, but with engineering. London doesn&apos;t need Welsh water \u2013 or hairy legs. It needs to cut Thames Water&apos;s obscene leakage rates. The company currently loses 30% of the water it puts into the mains \u2013 200 litres a day for every customer. Paris and New York only lose around 10%; Singapore is below 5%. England and Wales leakage rates, at about 25%, are higher than a decade ago. And the privatised water companies should abandon their scandalous insularity and start sharing water. Last December, the Environment Agency told ministers that the myriad small water companies in south-east England could save half a billion pounds by 2035 if they shared supplies. Instead, the companies were planning to saddle their customers with a bill of \u00a3760bn for unnecessary new reservoirs. Never mind a national grid, a Kent grid would work wonders. We also need household meters. Britain is almost alone in the industrialised world in not having universal water metering. Houses with meters use 15% less water. And we need recycling. Londoners routinely drink water from the Thames that is mostly cleaned-up sewage from upstream. But elsewhere much of our effluent is pumped out to sea. The Environment Agency says &quot;effluent should be valued as a resource for use by abstractors&quot; \u2013 that is, for water supply. It can be expensive to clean sewage enough for drinking. That&apos;s why the best solution could be getting nature to help, by using rocks like chalk to filter out the nasties. Winchester&apos;s sewage never did south Hampshire any harm. \u2022 Fred Pearce is author of When The Rivers Run Dry"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/24/metals-trader-fraudster-extra-seven-years-prison", "sentences": ["In 2008 Rastogi was described by the judge who handed down the original sentence as &quot;the real brains&quot; behind the fraudulent enterprise, which also involved operations in New York, Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-24T17:27:56Z", "title": "Metals trader fraudster given extra seven years", "tags": ["Financial sector", "Business", "Crime", "UK news", "World news", "Serious Fraud Office", "Law"], "article": "Viren Rastogi, the London metals trading tycoon behind one of Britain&apos;s biggest ever frauds, has been ordered to serve seven years behind bars on top of an initial sentence of nine-and-a-half years because he has failed to return millions of pounds defrauded from 20 international banks. The banks \u2013 including West LB, JP Morgan Chase and Dresdner Bank \u2013 lost more than \u00a3400m after they were duped into backing a series of bogus metal shipment trades by Rastogi&apos;s firm RBG Resources and related companies. Liquidators from Grant Thornton have been chasing the assets for a decade since RBG rapidly collapsed in the wake of a 2002 raid by the Serious Fraud Office. A sham international paper trail led them not to warehouses full of metals, but to a long list of addresses that amounted to little more than brass plates, including a cowshed near Delhi. Creditors were quickly told they would not receive a penny. Administrators believe much of the money disappeared to the notoriously secretive British Virgin Islands, as well as to Dubai and India. Investigators have located few assets in Rastogi&apos;s control beyond a Marylebone home, believed to be worth about \u00a36m. However, he has been unable to persuade the court that he does not have at least a further \u00a313m in hidden assets. The true amount he has salted away may be much higher. In 2008 Rastogi was described by the judge who handed down the original sentence as &quot;the real brains&quot; behind the fraudulent enterprise, which also involved operations in New York, Hong Kong and Singapore. Four years earlier, Viren&apos;s brother Narendra Rastogi secured a reduced jail term of seven years in a parallel US prosecution after agreeing to give evidence against his UK sibling. As part of this plea-bargain deal with US prosecutors, Narendra confessed to a US court that: &quot;I agreed with \u2026 Viren Rastogi \u2026 to commit the crime of bank fraud \u2026 Money obtained through fraud \u2026 [was] diverted and transferred through numerous accounts and businesses for the purpose of concealing the true source of the assets.&quot; Two other brothers, Ravindra and Subash Rastogi, were named in UK criminal proceedings among a handful of alleged co-conspirators who are said to have helped to create an elaborate web of 300 bogus metals trading counterparties. Neither have faced prosecution. The new jail sentence extends Viren Rastogi&apos;s total tariff to sixteen and a half years, which is thought to be the second highest ever handed down to defendant in a SFO case. He could be freed from jail and reunited with any assets he may have abroad in five years&apos; time if he demonstrates good behaviour. Handing down the additional jail sentence on Thursday, judge Michael Snow said Rastgoi had demonstrated &quot;wilful refusal or culpable neglect&quot; in not returning the \u00a313m ordered by the court. Oligarch deadline Fugitive oligarch Mukhtar Ablyazov, the former head of BTA Bank who is accused of embezzling $5bn (\u00a33bn) from the Kazakh lender, is under pressure to turn himself in or risk being debarred from defending himself against fraud claims. BTA, which has defaulted on $12bn of debts owed to the likes of RBS and Barclays, told the high court that the banker fled Britain for France last week after being found guilty of contempt of court for hiding his assets. The bank asked judge Nigel Teare to give Ablyazov until 4pm on 2 March to give himself up, or remove his right to defence against the embezzlement claims that rank among the biggest ever heard in Britain. It also asked for Ablyazov to be debarred from offering a defence if he fails to fully divulge his assets by 4pm on 9 March.

Tessa Jowell, the former culture secretary and Olympics minister \u2013 who is now a member of the Olympic Board \u2013 said the Saudis were &quot;clearly breaking the spirit of the Olympic Charter&apos;s pledge to equality&quot; with their attitude to women in sport and the Games. The Saudi government, which closed private gyms for women in 2009 and 2010 and severely limits their ability to undertake physical activity, is under mounting international pressure to adopt a more liberal approach. Jowell spoke out after a report by Human Rights Watch highlighted the way in which Saudi Arabian women and girls are denied the right to sport. The report found that, despite pledges to open up more sporting opportunity to women, &quot;the Saudi government continues to flagrantly deny women and girls their right to practise physical education in schools and to practise recreational and competitive sport more generally&quot;. Based on telephone interviews with Saudi women, the report says that, having introduced schooling for girls in the early 1960s, the country &quot;never added physical education classes to the girls&apos; curriculum&quot;. Those fighting for change have faced opposition at every turn. &quot;Opponents of sports for women and girls put forward the &apos;slippery slope&apos; argument that, once women start to exercise, they will shed modest clothing, spend &apos;unnecessary&apos; time out of the house and have increased possibilities for mingling with men,&quot; the report says. &quot;Others propose endless conditions for women and girls practising sport (for example that they must wear modest clothing and engage in sports away from the prying eyes of men).&quot; Because women are banned from driving in Saudia Arabia, their ability to get to gyms or sports events is further limited. &quot;Saudi Arabia&apos;s strict clothing requirements for women are a further impediment,&quot; it adds. &quot;Outdoors, a woman must wear a black cloak called an abaya, covering her from head to toe.&quot; One woman told Human Rights Watch that a marathon was held a few years ago in which women could participate only if they wore the abaya. The International Olympic Committee reserves a limited number of places for male and female athletes who are not required to meet the qualifying standards in swimming and athletics events. However, despite this concession, Saudi Arabia has never sponsored a female team and its national Olympic committee does not have a women&apos;s section. Jowell stopped short of saying the Saudis should be excluded from this year&apos;s or future Games if they did not improve their record. But she called on them to demonstrate a commitment to change, noting that Afghanistan was banned from the 2000 Sydney Olympics over its attitude to women under Taliban rule. &quot;The London Games would be the perfect opportunity for the Saudis to spell out a way forward,&quot; she said. &quot;I would like to see them set out a clear plan for equal inclusion of women in time for the 2016 games in Rio de Janiero. This has to be a substantive commitment.&quot; Barbara Keeley, a Labour MP who works extensively to promote women&apos;s sport, said female athletes had fought for more than a hundred years to take part in the Olympics on an equal basis with men. &quot;It is time to call a halt to discrimination against women in Olympic events. It seems totally unacceptable for any country competing in the Olympics to be allowed to have a team that is entirely male.&quot; A spokesman for the IOC said some progress was being made. &quot;The IOC strives to ensure the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement are universal and non-discriminatory, in line with the Olympic Charter and our values of respect, friendship and excellence. National Olympic committees are encouraged to uphold that spirit in their delegations. The IOC does not give ultimatums or deadlines, but believes a lot can be achieved through dialogue. &quot;We have been in regular contact with the three national Olympic committees that have yet to send women to the Olympics, ie Qatar, Brunei and Saudi Arabia. As a result of fruitful discussions, the three NOCs included women in their delegations competing at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore last summer. Dalma Rushdi Malas was one of them. She was the first female Saudi athlete to compete in an Olympic competition and claimed a bronze medal in the equestrian jumping event.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/technology-cities-deliver-sustainable-future", "sentences": ["The cities of Singapore, Brisbane and Stockholm are all working to reduce both traffic congestion and air pollution through intelligent transportation solutions, including predictive tools to route vehicles around traffic accidents."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-27T13:43:00Z", "title": "How technology in cities can help deliver a sustainable future", "tags": ["Built Environment", "Guardian sustainable business", "Collaboration", "Smart cities", "Innovation", "Cleantech"], "article": "Our reliance on technology is undeniable. It ensures we have potable water in our taps and that food is available on the supermarket shelves. Technology continues to change our lives and this dependence is only likely to accelerate given that, in 2010, we passed the historic milestone of having the majority of the world&apos;s population live in cities. As we consider the implications, the question of sustainability is often raised. Information technology has the unique capability of being able to capture the ever-increasing amounts of information generated in the world around us \u2013 whether it is sensors that monitor traffic on the roads, the passage of water through pipes or the GPS signals from mobile phones. The instrumentation of the planet is providing us with increasingly detailed information about the services we depend on and advances in data communications are allowing us to combine real-time data with existing information. At the same time recent advances in analytic algorithms mean that, more than ever before, we can gain new insights from this rich data store to help us make smarter decisions. Since we find ourselves with the opportunity to use new technology to make things work better, then at least a significant proportion of our efforts should be directed towards the structures which could have the greatest impact on the most people \u2013 our cities. People want to live in cities where there&apos;s a high quality of life. These demands are placing a huge strain on city infrastructures and the planet&apos;s resources. We need a &quot;smarter&quot; approach to delivering vital services, such as transportation, healthcare, education, public safety, energy and water. It&apos;s estimated that lost productivity and energy use due to traffic congestion alone wastes between 1% and 3% of the world&apos;s gross domestic product. Although addressing sustainability across an entire city can be more rewarding, given the number of stakeholders involved, it will nearly always be more challenging. Strong leadership will be an essential ingredient of any programme. City leaders need to think about three things in order to transform their city: 1. Assemble a team City departmental leaders need to work across their own organisational boundaries and even partner effectively with other levels of government. In addition to formulating new policies themselves, city leaders must be able to articulate their challenges when policies are made elsewhere. 2. Think revolution, not evolution City leaders need to look at systems, most of which are interconnected, and enable people and objects to interact in entirely new ways. Connected systems allow cities to respond quickly and accurately: for example, traffic systems able to automatically re-route vehicles around automobile accidents. 3. Target all city systems, not just one A city should be considered a &quot;system of systems&quot;. A holistic strategy that looks at all of a city&apos;s systems, and builds in system-wide feedback mechanisms, is a better way to deliver sustainable prosperity to its citizens. Work has already begun in cities around the world. The cities of Singapore, Brisbane and Stockholm are all working to reduce both traffic congestion and air pollution through intelligent transportation solutions, including predictive tools to route vehicles around traffic accidents. Several cities in Italy, the island of Malta, as well as the US state of Texas are using smart electric meters and instruments to make their power grids more stable, efficient and ready to integrate renewable energy sources and electric vehicles. In an innovative project in Glasgow, new system insights are helping the council develop strategies to provide affordable warmth to vulnerable citizens while making progress towards the city&apos;s 2020 reduction targets for CO2. Rotterdam is adopting a monitoring and forecasting system to support both its water and energy that uses real-time information to manage infrastructure and operations related to the effects of climate change. China is introducing high-speed trains and expanding its rail network between cities, adding 25,000 miles of track between now and 2020. The goal is to fuel economic development without increasing automobile or truck traffic. Societal changes and mounting pressure on resources will require cities to be increasingly sustainable. These solutions and many more are making a real impact and represent the first steps towards creating smart, sustainable cities. To see more examples we need to encourage stronger collaboration between governments, business, academia and residents. Each offers strengths in solving challenges and recent advances in technology will help us work together as never before.

Six months later Nokia launched its first Windows Phones. Today Elop is here to explain how the world&apos;s largest phone maker is progressing with its plan to catch up with Google, Apple and Samsung in the smartphone race.Elop is on stage.  We introduced three new Lumia devices ahead of schedule, establishing beachheads from which we will continue to grow our smartphone strategy.In North America we have started our reentry into the United States with T-Mobile and sales have exceeded our expectations.In Singapore we&apos;ve had consumers lined up along the street and around the corner.   8.48am: Two new Asha devices announced, the Asha 202 and 302. Aimed at emerging markets, these are keyboard smartphones which can run web apps like Facebook and run on Nokia&apos;s Symbian operating system.A new feature is that the Microsoft Exchange email will work on the Asha 302. Includes synchronisation of calendar, email and contacts. Priced at \u20ac95 at retail.Described as a low cost entry point to data consumption.  8.52am: Elop says Nokia&apos;s smartphones are setting a new pace. The 4G Lumia 900 was launched in the US with AT&amp;T.I&apos;m pleased to share that we are going to extend the Lumia 900 beyond the US. It will be available in Elop&apos;s home country of Canada.Jo Harlow, Nokia&apos;s smartphone lead, takes the stage.  We shouldn&apos;t forget that in many countries around the world LTE networks are not deployed. That shouldn&apos;t stop people from being able to enjoy the superior content experience. I&apos;m pleased to announce that we will be bringing the Lumia 900 to other countries around the world.  The Lumia 900 - photos of a white case, for the first time. Nokia Drive turns any Nokia smartphone into a personal navigation device. You can set speed limit alerts on the latest edition of Nokia Drive. A new feature called Nokia Reading with news stream. A single hub for news, books, audio books. News stream aggregates feeds on favourite topics from favourite sources, which can be pinned to the start screen, with breaking stories appearing in the live tile. Free like Nokia Drive on the 900.  8.58am: The Lumia 900 also allows video calling.Terry Myerson, head of the Windows Phone Division at Microsoft takes the stage. The beta for Windows Phone of Skype will be available from today on Windows Phone.  Since the beginning of our partnership with Nokia, the range of applications to our market place has trippled. Windows Phone has been made compatible with mobile operator networks in China.  Harlow says that means Nokia will bring Lumia to China. In the coming months they will introduce a range of phones to the Chinese market. Myerson says Microsoft has lowered the system requirements for Windows phone, to make it available to lower end, cheaper smartphones. The total addressible market has expanded over 60%. Harlow announces a new device, the Nokia Lumia 610, the fourth in the Lumia range.   The perfect introduction to Windows Phone for a younger audience. The 610 delivers the best mobile gaming device with Xbox Live. Playing on the mobile will increase your console score.   Includes Nokia Transport, with underground and overground transport information, with maps and timetables, in 500 cities in 46 countries. Comes free with the phone.  With four phones delivered within one year we are able to cover a range of needs and a range of price points. Lumia 900 estimated retail price of \u20ac480, expected to start shipping in Q2. The Lumia 610 will ship at around \u20ac189 and is expected to also ship in Q2.  Introduces the Nokia 808 PureView, a Symbian phone that looks like a camera. Harlow says it &quot;ushers in a revolution in smartphone imaging&quot;.Features a 41 Megapixel sensor, with a Carl Zeiss lens to set a new standard in image qulaity. The iPhone 4S, by comparison, has an 8 Megapixel camera, a level of resolution which is common even among lower range digital cameras. Pictures can be saved in compact files sizes for emailing, sharing and uploading to social networks. We intend to introduce these features into other Nokia smartphones in the future. Estimated retail price of \u20ac450, it will start rolling out in May. In white, red and black.  Last year when Stephen and I stood on this stage, we hoped we could deliver one Windows Phone smartphone and we delivered two. We now have four Lumia products ready to roll out around the world. I&apos;m looking forward to bringing you even more in the next year.  Stephen Elop returns to the stage. Says Nokia Maps new edition features 50 times more places.   Nokia Drive turns a Lumia into a fully fledged navigation device. These applications are incredibly powerful but they are just the beginning of what we can unleash with location based services. There are three questions that guide most of us throughout the day - what, who and where. Today the internet provides many answers to the what and the who. We, Nokia, will answer the where, by building a where enabled platform. Nokia Drive and other apps are built on Nokia&apos;s location platform. My commute will let you know if you need to leave home early to get to work on time.   We are happy to announce today that we are entering into a partnership with Groupon, with daily deals to Nokia consumers around the world. Says Nokia on a mission to create a third ecosystem. With the location based where platform that is precisely what we are achieving. Nokia apps have had 65m downloads. There are more than 200,000 app developers for Nokia in India. Have operator billing with 150 opeartors in 40 countries, things like in app purchasing, in app advertising.Data shows purchases increase up to five times with operator billing versus credit card alone. We can offer developers access to consumers in all markets at all price points and we will continue to push this further and faster.  It&apos;s been one year since Nokia said it was embarking on a new journey. Since then we&apos;ve introduced four devices. We are connecting the next people to the internet with Asha, a new cloud based browser. We are differentiating the Nokia experience with great design, new location based services, all of which is providing developers with a new gateway to the world. It has been a very challenging year for Nokia and it has also been an amazing year for Nokia.    9.26am: So, that&apos;s the end of the presentation. To summarise, Nokia will roll out its LTE Lumia 900 in countries outside North America, presumably that includes Europe, and to China. The PureView camera phone, with a 41 Megapixel camera, making it by miles the most powerful smartphone camera in the world. The other European device is the lower price point Lumia 610, aimed at younger users. Elop is asked if these phones will save the company.   We are demonstrating the action necessary to improve the fortunes of Nokia. Identifying strategy and executing very aggressively against that.   2.49pm: Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao has called for an end to European imposed cuts to the price of calls, accusing regulators of running on &quot;autopilot&quot; and endangering jobs.Colao was speaking this morning at the Mobile World Congress ahead of a vote by European ministers this week on a new round of cuts which will set the price of using a phone abroad for the next ten years. The reductions are to the wholesale price operators charge each other, which is intended to flow through into retail price cuts, but the telecoms chief said that previous cuts had not benefited consumers.  People think every time there is a reduction there is more money in the pockets of customers. This is not true.  Over the last year, European operators have seen their revenues decline across the board as regulator imposed cuts begin to impact. Regulators have recently pushed through cuts to mobile termination rates, the wholesale cost of calling a mobile from a landline or another mobile phone.The European Commission, said Colao, estimates that for every \u20ac10 in cuts, only \u20ac2 are passed on to consumers through lower retail prices, with the balance being held back by operators. He said:  We need to stop this autopilot regulation mentality that is still prevailing in many parts of the world. We should stop all these cuts, we shuld stop having this continuous intervention on prices and let the industry reinvest the money.  He said fibre was one of the areas in which operators needed to invest. Vodafone has already acquired and built extensive fibre optic cable networks around Europe, in order to provide faster connections between masts to suport mobile internet. Vodafone and is considering a bid for Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, the UK fixed line business telecoms group whose extensive fibre network would greatly reduce the mobile group&apos;s need to rent cables from other operators.  7.10pm: That&apos;s all from today&apos;s Mobile World Congress, back tomorrow evening for the keynote with Google chairman Eric Schmidt."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/27/vodafone-boss-moratorium-mobile-phone-regulation", "sentences": ["The United States, Sweden, Germany and Singapore already have 4G networks."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-27T18:53:25Z", "title": "Vodafone boss calls for moratorium on mobile phone regulation", "tags": ["Vodafone", "Telecommunications industry", "Business", "Mobile World Congress", "Telecoms", "Technology", "Mobile phones"], "article": "The chief executive of Vodafone, Vittorio Colao, has called for a &quot;moratorium on regulation&quot; in the telecoms industry, warning that unless Europe stops imposing price cuts, mobile companies will slash investment in networks. On the eve of a European vote to cut the cost of using a phone while travelling, Colao told reporters at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona that the move would cost jobs in the wider economy and that lawmakers faced a choice between a &quot;heaven and hell scenario&quot;. &quot;Does Europe need employment or does Europe need rate cuts? We should stop having this continuous intervention on prices and let the industry reinvest the money.&quot; In the last year, operators across Europe have seen revenues fall in line with reductions on the wholesale price of calling a mobile from a landline, so-called mobile termination rates. They are about to pay billions for the spectrum needed to deliver superfast mobile broadband, with the UK&apos;s biggest ever auction of airspace expected to conclude early next year. The new 4G technology will require major investment in masts and fibre cables, but Vodafone believes it may not be able to sustain its \u00a36.2bn annual spend. &quot;Regulators should stop cutting mobile termination rates, pushing down roaming prices, building funny auctions which are designed to extract more money from existing operators, and resisting industry consolidation,&quot; Colao said. &quot;This is not a request for a moratorium on competition but a much stronger request for a moratorium on regulation.&quot; The UK, which will not introduce 4G nationally until the end of 2013, risks slipping further behind other nations in the race to roll out superfast broadband. The United States, Sweden, Germany and Singapore already have 4G networks. &quot;The reality is, we have a heaven scenario or a hell scenario,&quot; said Colao. &quot;The hell scenario is every year we lose hundreds of millions to mobile termination rates and we reduce our investment. Investment means jobs not just in the telecoms sector, but in the media, entertainment and applications developer sectors.&quot; MEPs are expected to vote on Tuesday on a series of price cuts that will fix the wholesale cost of using a mobile abroad while travelling in the European Union for the next decade. This will take the form of a staggered reduction in voice and internet call costs. Consumer group Which?, mobile operator Three and a number of small business trade groups have argued that the cuts do not go far enough, and will leave customers facing &quot;bill shock&quot; when they return from holiday. Last week they wrote to communications minister Ed Vaizey urging him to push for lower prices. Under the current proposals, 1 gigabyte of data (enough to download 200 songs or watch two hours of video) would cost \u00a3400 abroad, when it costs just \u00a310 at home in the UK today. But savings imposed by regulators are not being passed on to customers, said Colao, quoting European Commission research. For every \u20ac10 cut from the wholesale price of calling a mobile from a landline, just \u20ac2 was passed on through lower retail prices. Vodafone argues most of the balance is pocketed by fixed-line operators such as BT Group or Virgin Mobile in the UK. &quot;People think every time there is a reduction there is more money in the pockets of customers. This is not true.&quot; Vodafone believes regulation is out of date and needs revising. It would like to see the European Commission and national regulators back away from intrusive rulemaking such as setting prices. The UK telecommunications watchdog Ofcom should still have a role in regulating fixed-line and fibre-optic broadband access, said Colao, but its remit should be limited to &quot;competition regulation&quot; where mobile operators are concerned. This would still give it a say on mergers and preventing cartels, for example."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/feb/28/espn-soccernet-app", "sentences": ["&quot;We don&apos;t want to dictate though: we have massive audiences in Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, the US, Canada\u2026 And the Premier League is still very important for them."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-28T08:22:17Z", "title": "ESPN Goals app nearing 2m downloads as Soccernet iPhone app goes live", "tags": ["Apps", "ESPN", "Sport", "Media", "Technology", "Premier League"], "article": "Sports broadcaster ESPN has launched a new global football app for its Soccernet brand, offering news, live scores, audio and video content. The ESPNsoccernet app is initially being released for iPhone, with Android, Windows Phone and Symbian versions to follow. Commercial director for ESPN Digital Media Robin Ashton says the app&apos;s launch reflects ESPN&apos;s growing ambitions in mobile. &quot;Of all platforms, mobile is growing the fastest for us. It&apos;s becoming pretty much one of our most important screens,&quot; he says. &quot;Mobile is perfect for our audience, who are more likely to have smartphones and browse the web on them. In the next two years, combined traffic to Soccernet&apos;s mobile website and this app could overtake the main website.&quot; The new app&apos;s global launch follows ESPN&apos;s UK success with its ESPN Goals app, which relaunched at the start of the current football season. It&apos;s a free app offering video clips of every Premiership goal shortly after they&apos;re scored (except for matches kicking off on Saturdays at 3pm, which due to UEFA rules can only be delivered from 5.15pm). The app has been downloaded nearly 2m times in the five months since its relaunch in the UK. &quot;The usage we&apos;re seeing on it is incredible,&quot; says Ashton. &quot;We&apos;re serving around 40m page views a month on ESPN Goals in the UK only, and on the video front we&apos;re serving around 7m match highlight clips every month too.&quot; Ashton also says that there has been a &quot;phenomenal response&quot; from advertisers too. ESPN Goals was a paid service in the 2010/11 season, but switched to free and ad-funded for the current campaign. Brands advertising in the app include Electronic Arts, Continental Tyres and Mentholatum. &quot;It&apos;s working phenomenally well from both an audience and revenue point of view,&quot; says Ashton. &quot;It&apos;s the holy grail for all of us who work in this sector: to create something we can say is a disrupter. It&apos;s changing the way people follow football on a Saturday.&quot; So to the new app, ESPNsoccernet, whose global focus is a big opportunity for ESPN, but also a challenge on the rights side: the broadcaster has rights for mobile video in specific countries for specific leagues. The app will walk the line between localised content and coverage of competitions like the English Premier League with broad global appeal. &quot;We&apos;re very conscious that it cannot be a one-size fits-all approach for any market,&quot; says Ashton. &quot;We don&apos;t want to dictate though: we have massive audiences in Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, the US, Canada\u2026 And the Premier League is still very important for them. If you&apos;re in Nigeria, we&apos;re not going to default you to Nigerian scores. We&apos;ll allow you to set it up and add in the leagues you want.&quot; Where it has video rights and broadcast assets, ESPN will use them. In the UK, that means ESPNsoccernet will get analysis and opinion from its team of pundits \u2013\u00a0Ray Stubbs, Kevin Keegan and John Barnes \u2013 whereas in the US there will be clips from its US sports coverage. Ashton says that mobile is becoming much more integrated into broadcast rights packages, rather than hived off into separate bundles as has been the case in the past. &quot;We would prefer all media for any rights we go after, but it&apos;s not always possible. It&apos;s getting much more difficut for rightsholders to segment those packages.&quot; There are quirks though. ESPN&apos;s deal with the Premier League is based on the capabilities of the devices receiving the content. ESPN Goals is unavailable to Wi-Fi-only iPod touch users as a result. Ashton points to other grey areas, like the way in the UK Yahoo has internet rights to Premier League highlights, but ESPN has mobile rights. &quot;Is a laptop with a 3G dongle stuck in it mobile or not? From our perspective it has to get cleaner, but we&apos;re very happy with the package we have at the moment.&quot; ESPN has been notable in its efforts to go cross-platform with its apps. ESPN Goals is available on iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone and Symbian, while the company has also invested in its mobile websites. In 2011, users spent an average of 158 minutes a month on ESPN mobile sites, generating 63.4m monthly page views. &quot;ESPN has a mission statement about serving the fan wherever they want to consume sports, so we were first on Android \u2013\u00a0we pushed out ESPN Goals on that last year before a lot of more established apps were there,&quot; says Ashton. &quot;We&apos;ve also been working closely with Microsoft on Windows Phone. The usage numbers are not up there with iOS, but I believe they&apos;ll grow.&quot; ESPN is also working with Nokia on its ESPN Hub app, which will be an exclusive preload on that company&apos;s Lumia Windows Phone handsets. Ashton is also keeping tabs on trends including second-screen apps \u2013\u00a0used on a smartphone or tablet to complement watching TV on a bigger screen \u2013 and social networking. &quot;I get an email proposal about second-screen every five minutes, and it&apos;s an area we&apos;re looking at, but we don&apos;t want to do it just for the sake of it,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s got to give fans something useful, and provide extra value. But we do see that something like Twitter is making sport more engaging in many ways. People care about what other fans are saying.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/28/government-must-ban-animal-circuses", "sentences": ["The use of animals in circuses has been abolished in Austria, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Greece, Peru, Singapore, Sweden and many municipalities in Canada, and legislation is pending in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-28T13:13:43Z", "title": "The government must act now to ban wild animals in circuses | Ann Widdecombe", "tags": ["Animal welfare", "Animals", "World news", "Politics", "House of Commons"], "article": "Having served as a member of parliament for more than two decades, I&apos;m well aware that there can be genuine constraints that affect the speed at which certain issues progress. The government&apos;s failure to ban wild animals in circuses, however, has me, along with much of the country, utterly baffled. The British Veterinary Association has stated unequivocally that the complex needs of animals cannot be met in a circus environment. Other highly respected organisations, including Peta, the RSPCA, Born Free and the Captive Animals&apos; Protection Society, have all been calling for a ban, and the vast majority of the British public is also in favour. In a rare show of unity, even parliament went so far as to direct the government to introduce a regulation prohibiting wild-animal acts last June, and yet here we are, eight months on, and no further forward. It&apos;s clear the government was biding its time to see the outcome of Circus Krone&apos;s challenge to Austria&apos;s ban, but the Austrian constitutional court staunchly defended the legality of the ban and, in December, threw out the application to have it overturned. An elephant expert who worked in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) for eight years has called the lack of action on this issue &quot;completely barking mad&quot; and said circuses were &quot;fundamentally unsuited&quot; to keeping elephants, big cats, bears and other wild animals. The European Commission has twice affirmed the validity of national bans on animal circuses. Even Greece introduced its own national ban last month. It&apos;s unconscionable for us to deny wild animals in British circuses their freedom, and while Defra dawdles, these animals continue to endure cramped cages, whips and ankuses. Who could forget the gut-wrenching undercover video footage of Anne, the elephant who was hit with a pitchfork and a club while she was chained up and unable to escape? The abuse of Anne at Bobby Roberts Super Circus is not unique. In December 2009, Peta US released photographs taken by a retired circus employee that showed terrified baby elephants, who were forcibly separated from their mothers, bound with ropes, wrestled, slammed to the ground, shocked with electric prods and gouged with bullhooks (sharp, steel-tipped devices that resemble fireplace pokers), and there are countless more records and accounts of similar treatment of animals in circuses around the world. Anne endured 58 years of being hauled around the country before finally being moved to a better environment, but many lions, tigers, camels, zebras and other wild animals are still being used and abused in British circuses. Treated as little more than replaceable inventory, they are forced to perform the same ridiculous, unnatural and sometimes painful tricks week after week, year after year. Our knowledge of animals and their behaviour has come a long way. We can no longer justify imprisoning them, robbing them of everything that is natural and important to them and turning them into objects of ridicule for our amusement. Stricter licensing cannot and will not alleviate the painful sting of a whip or soothe the welts of animals who have been beaten. Licensing won&apos;t provide a shred of comfort to animals who are jammed into transport vehicles for months on end. Nor will licensing relieve the interminable years of loneliness and boredom or the desperate sadness that animals experience when they lose their young. Many governments around the world have already recognised this. The use of animals in circuses has been abolished in Austria, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Greece, Peru, Singapore, Sweden and many municipalities in Canada, and legislation is pending in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. It appears that only Defra and those who profit from forcing animals to perform are finding ways to procrastinate and prevaricate. But with the groundswell of opposition mounting and Defra&apos;s list of excuses rapidly dwindling, the government would be well-advised to drop its current hesitant and unpopular position, to stop dragging its heels while the rest of the world takes the lead and to implement a ban on wild-animal circuses in Britain. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/28/dignity-care-older-people-nhs-keith-pearson", "sentences": ["In 1993 he was headhunted by Aon, the US-based health insurer, to run its operations in east Asia, based in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-28T23:57:07Z", "title": "Driver to improve the dignity of older people in care", "tags": ["Older people", "Social care", "NHS", "Society", "Health"], "article": "The boss of a trade association can usually be relied upon to defend its members when the going gets tough. However, in exceptional circumstances, the news may be so bad that defence is inappropriate. That is what Sir Keith Pearson decided in February last year when the NHS ombudsman, Ann Abraham, published a devastating report on how the NHS treated older people without compassion or dignity. Pearson was only a few months into his role as chairman of the NHS Confederation, the umbrella body that speaks for the local organisations that run hospitals, mental health, primary care and other health services for NHS patients. Abraham gave a graphic account of the disgraceful treatment given to 10 older people in various NHS facilities across England. She described the stories as &quot;harrowing&quot; and pointed out &quot;the stark contrast between the reality of the care they received and the principles and values of the NHS&quot;. In one case, a &quot;feisty and independent&quot; woman of 88 was transferred from a hospital in Birmingham to a care home on Tyneside, arriving bruised, soaked in urine, dishevelled and wearing someone else&apos;s clothes held up with large paper clips. Deeply shocking Pearson says: &quot;I can remember when the report landed. We could have given a standard response. We could have said: this is really bad, but we must remember it does not reflect what usually happens. But we took the view that this was a hugely important document. It said something about the NHS that was deeply shocking. When you read the report, and then read it for a second time, it resonated with every one of us. It described something we knew was wrong. So we took a decision to do something different. And that meant we had to hold the feet of the NHS to the fire and say: this is not good enough.&quot; The confederation joined forces with the Local Government Association (LGA) and the charity Age UK to set up a commission of inquiry into what could be done to improve the dignity of older people in hospitals and care homes. Since then, poor hospital care for older people has been thrust further into the spotlight with critical reports by the Care Quality Commission and Patients&apos; Association. Nearly half of hospitals were found to be failing to provide good nutrition to elderly patients, while 40% did not offer dignified care, according to the healthcare watchdog. The Commission on Improving Dignity in Care publishes a draft report for consultation on Wednesday, looking at how the NHS and care homes must change if they are to deliver dignity in care. A long list of recommendations amounts to root-and-branch reform of the system. For example, it tells NHS boards to abandon the command-and-control style of management that has disempowered staff on the frontline; to give ward sisters the authority to take whatever action is necessary in the interests of patients; and to require staff to spend time on every shift discussing feedback from older people and their families, reflecting on how care could improve. The report, Delivering Dignity, also calls for the development of national quality standards for dignity and for payments to be withheld from hospitals that fail to deliver. It even recommends that doctors and nurses should be selected for jobs as much on the basis of\u00a0their compassion as on academic prowess. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) last week issued new guidelines intended to improve hospital care by setting standards for delivering dignity. Pearson welcomes the guidance and calls on all NHS organisations to use the standards to measure their performance and to publish the results in annual quality accounts. But he wants a lot more. &quot;The NHS is the largest customer-facing business in the country,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to listen more to the people in our care. We have to understand the passions that may have provoked a complaint, or more often a suggestion. The problem may be a little thing that could have been done better. For example, an older person may not have been able to find spectacles or dentures. If you run a business that puts dignity at its heart, you will organise for these items to be put away carefully in a box in the person&apos;s locker. The spectacles will always be cleaned before they are put away. The\u00a0hearing aid will always be checked before it is fitted to make sure the battery is working.&quot; That&apos;s easy to say, but how does the NHS make good things happen, reliably, across every department in every institution? Pearson suggests that NHS hospitals may need to follow the example of the John Lewis partnership, which recruits staff according to the person&apos;s values and then trains them in the necessary skills. &quot;We might want to consider how psychometric testing could be used to establish whether someone has the kind of personality that puts a high value on providing care with dignity,&quot; he says. Confidence He speaks with the confidence of a self-made man who was wealthy enough by the age of 50 to step off the career ladder. Pearson left school at 18 and found a job in the health and safety sector before moving to Bupa, the private health insurer. He worked there for 17 years, ending up as chief executive for all the Hong Kong-based companies. In 1993 he was headhunted by Aon, the US-based health insurer, to run its operations in east Asia, based in Singapore. He massively increased Aon&apos;s revenue in the region before retiring from the company in 1997, when he returned to Britain and set up an international healthcare consultancy. He does not like being described as rich, but says: &quot;I am sufficiently independent to choose what roles I take on.&quot; Work for the NHS started with the chairmanship of a small primary care group in south Somerset. That led to a series of NHS board appointments. He played a key role in drawing up the NHS constitution. That experience, he says, helped him to understand the NHS. &quot;I work long hours and I do it because I have a passion for healthcare and particularly for the empowerment of patients,&quot; he says. Pearson does not have the authority to instruct hospitals to adopt the policies outlined in today&apos;s report. Neither can the LGA impose the long list of recommendations for care homes on the local authorities that pay for a large slice of residential care. And Age UK can advocate for change, but not command it. Pearson is nonetheless optimistic. He does not accept that the NHS in a time of austerity cannot afford to give a higher priority to dignity. Nor does he think the government&apos;s proposed NHS reforms will make it harder for trusts to respond. In his view, the changes in the health bill are largely irrelevant to the task. Older people make up 60% of the patients on NHS wards. Providing them with dignified care is not an optional extra. It should be the core purpose of the NHS, he insists. Or as Pearson puts it: &quot;For us, this is the day job.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/29/conservatives-holding-back-economic-recovery", "sentences": ["\u2022 Singapore&apos;s Spring agency, which targets help at startup companies.", "Umunna, who has visited all three institutions in Germany, the US and Singapore, will say Britain should follow their example.", "&quot;We have seen on our visits to Singapore, the US and Germany how, where there is market failure, they have a set of public institutions like the Small Business Administration, prepared to step in, fill the gap and adopt active government strategies and solutions,&quot; he will add in his speech."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-29T08:26:29Z", "title": "Conservatives accused of holding back economic recovery", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Economic policy", "Conservatives", "Labour", "Politics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "David Cameron is holding back Britain&apos;s economic recovery because he is wedded to &quot;old orthodoxies&quot; that say the state should &quot;stand aside&quot; and avoid helping to stimulate the economy, the shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, will argue on Wednesday. As the prime minister blames &quot;blockages&quot; on planning and regulation for holding back the recovery, Umunna will say Britain needs more than a &quot;market alone&quot; approach if it is to boost economic growth. In a speech to the CBI, he will say: &quot;Proponents of business as usual \u2013 roadblocks to reform, reluctant to accept the need to change and modernise, wedded to the old orthodoxies \u2013 argue that the best government can do is to stand aside and leave it to the market. &quot;This is the overwhelming view of the Conservative party. But this attitude has held British business back from reaching its full potential for too long \u2013 I know this because you tell me so.&quot; Umunna&apos;s speech follows what Downing Street described as an &quot;unusual&quot; cabinet meeting devoted almost entirely to economic growth. Cameron told ministers that a series of blockages, ranging from restrictive planning laws to the &quot;gold-plating&quot; of EU directives, were holding back economic growth. The meeting showed that ministers are nervous about Britain&apos;s slow rate of economic recovery ahead of the budget on 21 March. Umunna will say the government can and should do more to stimulate growth. He will cite the examples of: \u2022 The car scrappage scheme, introduced by Lord Mandelson during his time as the business secretary, which helped the car industry. \u2022 The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), which helps provide private equity capital for small and medium-sized businesses. \u2022 Germany&apos;s KfW national investment bank, which has almost doubled investment in small and medium-sized enterprises since 2009. \u2022 Singapore&apos;s Spring agency, which targets help at startup companies. Umunna, who has visited all three institutions in Germany, the US and Singapore, will say Britain should follow their example. &quot;We have seen on our visits to Singapore, the US and Germany how, where there is market failure, they have a set of public institutions like the Small Business Administration, prepared to step in, fill the gap and adopt active government strategies and solutions,&quot; he will add in his speech. &quot;In fact, since I got this job I have been struck by how business leader after business leader has told me they want to see an active government working in partnership with business in different sectors to step in and fill the gaps where there is market failure. That is precisely what Ed Miliband, Ed Balls and I will do. &quot;The challenges facing the nation are changing. We need a new set of policies to build a better, more responsible and productive capitalism, fit for our times and for the future \u2013 a new economy to deliver fairer outcomes at home and greater competitiveness abroad for the British people and British business. &quot;As a nation, we have a job of work to do to modernise our economy. The market alone won&apos;t get us there \u2013 government alone can&apos;t do so either. But it must be a national mission where productive business and active government work together in partnership.&quot; The shadow business secretary will criticise the Tory MP David Ruffley, who called on Monday for the abolition of the department for business, innovation and skills to free up \u00a31bn for tax breaks for enterprise. Ruffley was speaking at an event organised by the Free Enterprise Group of Tory MPs, which is supported by George Osborne. Umunna will say: &quot;Unlike today, when senior government backbenchers are arguing for the abolition of the business department \u2013 businesses&apos; voice in government \u2013 when Peter Mandelson was in charge, the department had real clout across government. &quot;I intend to follow Peter&apos;s example and, I should say that as a pro-business party we would not dream of abolishing the business department.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/29/europa-vegas-madrid-barcelona", "sentences": ["&quot;We have to encourage this ... though there are some demands that can be accepted and others that cannot.&quot; Both regions hope Europa Vegas will have the kind of runaway financial success that Adelson&apos;s new outposts in Singapore and Macao are enjoying.", "Income at Las Vegas Sands, which owns the Venetian, the Palazzo and the Sands Expo Center in Las Vegas, leaped 26% in the last quarter \u2013 though 90% of his profits now come from operations in Macao and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-02-29T18:30:47Z", "title": "Europa Vegas draws Madrid and Barcelona into battle over megacasino", "tags": ["Spain", "Europe", "World news", "Gambling", "Business"], "article": "Spain&apos;s two main cities are battling it out for a Vegas-style complex of a dozen casinos, several hotels, shopping malls, conference centres, golf courses and theatres in an attempt to create jobs as the economy slumps back into recession.

Photograph: FCO    My EU career: Alex Walford Employer: European Commission Occupation: Policy officer, Caribbean-EU trade relations Studied: French and European Studies, University of Sussex My degree included a year abroad at Sciences Po in Paris. Then I did an MSc in European Studies at the LSE. I joined the EU civil service out of idealism and exasperation. Idealism because I thought the EU was a good idea, and I knew I wanted to do something involving policy, Europe and making the world a slightly better place. And exasperation because after leaving university I&apos;d spent three years working in marketing in London, had got quite fed up and really wanted a change, but wasn&apos;t sure about leaving London, or how to get into what seemed an impenetrable fortress. I first joined as a so-called &apos;contract agent&apos; in 2003, on rolling one-year contracts. I was in the development aid department, in the part dealing with sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (or ACP). I loved it from the day I started. While doing that, I prepared for and then sat the concours \u2013 the exam to become a permanent staff member or &apos;official&apos;. After passing I did a brief stint in the communication department. Then I moved to overseas trade, where I am now.  Right now I&apos;m helping implement a new trade deal between the EU and the Caribbean. It aims to support the region&apos;s efforts to compete globally, while offering privileged access to EU markets. In terms of what I&apos;ve achieved and what I&apos;m particularly proud of, two things spring to mind. I submitted a report to the European Court of Auditors on \u20ac4bn of annual EU aid spending within the deadline \u2013 a greater feat than it sounds. And I helped draft an internal policy document on explaining what the EU does more effectively, so the woman or man in the street can understand what on earth we&apos;re up to. That&apos;s something I&apos;m passionate about.  In terms of the advice I&apos;d offer anyone taking the concours, the institutions certainly aren&apos;t impenetrable, even if you have no prior EU experience \u2013 I&apos;m living proof of that. Don&apos;t listen to those who say you have to speak seven languages, to have done three Commission traineeships, and so on to stand any chance of getting in.  Read the competition notice forensically: you&apos;ll find it on the European Personnel Selection Office website. Practice answering the kinds of question they ask you in the first round, then keep practising and practising. Form a prep group with other candidates, if you can keep your motivation going.  And if you get to the interview stage, practise again \u2013 consider asking friends of friends whom you don&apos;t know to act as your &apos;panel&apos; and give you feedback. I found this invaluable.  I love working here. So do most of my friends, for many reasons. Interesting, varied work. Intelligent, committed, dare I say idealistic colleagues from across Europe. Job security, generous healthcare and pension schemes (at least for now), and flexible working if you want it. Plus the chance to serve a worthy cause, however imperfect.  So, I&apos;d recommend the EU to anyone considering their career options, for all the reasons above, and especially to Brits, because we&apos;re at a real premium. English has become almost the sole working language. Yet there are fewer Brits relative to the country&apos;s population than people of pretty much any other EU nationality.

Received wisdom at the time was that the Games would provide a &quot;once-in-a-generation&quot; opportunity to showcase Britain to the world, and thus boost tourism, inward investment, and political and cultural capital. Len McCluskey&apos;s suggestion of possible industrial action (Anti-cuts strikes could target Olympics, says union boss, 29 February) has sent a ripple of panic across the Westminster village, not least because such action is seen as a threat to this &quot;PR&quot; legacy of the Games. A London summer rife with demonstrating union members \u2013 or indeed anti-capitalist and anti-war protesters \u2013 is evidently perceived by some, including David Cameron, Tessa Jowell and Nick Clegg, as a major threat to this country&apos;s global image, and therefore national interest. How wrong they are. Recent research has demonstrated that it is in fact very difficult to shape the way your country is perceived around the world, particularly in the case of a highly visible country like Britain. Simon Anholt, former vice-chair of the FCO&apos;s own public diplomacy advisory board, told the foreign affairs select committee in 2010 that &quot;national images are very robust; they really don&apos;t change very much&quot;. In trying so hard to manage the way Britain is perceived this summer, officials and politicians risk wasting their time on an ineffective attempt to make this country look like an Anglo-Saxon Singapore. The once encouraging noises from politicians about showing the world our diversity and creativity have been replaced with a desire to show that our pavements are clean and that we are all in bed on time. Even recognising the limits of public diplomacy, what better message could we send to the world this summer, at this time of anti-authoritarian revolution across the world, than that in the motherland of democracy constructive social protest and political dissent are thriving? Politicians misguidedly fear a commercial opportunity will be spoiled this summer. I fear that a different, much more powerful opportunity will be wasted.Philip Fiske de GouveiaSenior research associate, The Foreign Policy Centre \u2022 Len McCluskey, Unite&apos;s general secretary, points out our way of life is threatened with the Tory attacks on public sector pensions, attempts to privatise the NHS and cuts to public services. The fact that Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have now joined in with the government&apos;s demands for pay restraint and austerity is, as Len says, sending the wrong message to trade unionists and lacks economic credibility. Instead of attacking Unite for seeking to outline how trade unionists can best defend jobs, wages, pensions and public services, they should be standing by our side. The millions who struck on 30 November to defend public services, the thousands of Unite members who last week beat back construction employers&apos; attempts to tear up long-standing agreements with up to 35% wage cuts, or the young campaigners who this week forced the government to rewrite their workfare plans \u2013 these people are an inspiration. This government is weak. We need more strikes to stop employers and the government. Len is correct to start to raise a debate about the type of action we can take inside and, if need be, outside the most restrictive labour legislation in the advanced world. We look forward to Unite members across the public sector joining hundreds of thousands of trade unionists in co-ordinated strike action on and beyond 28 March to defend public services.Ian Allinson Unite executiveSara Bennett Unite executive Phil Entwistle Unite executive Martin Mayer Unite executiveSteve Miller Unite executiveFrank Wood Unite executiveBrett Davies Ministry of Defence and government departments, National industrial sector committeeGill George Unite Health national industrial sector committee Ruth Robinson Unite Health national industrial sector committee Esther O&apos;Hara Unite chair, Speech and language therapy advisory committeeGed Dempsey Unite GPM national sector committeePete Gillard Unite London and eastern regional committeeRaymond Morell Unite London and eastern regional committee \u2022 Len McCluskey&apos;s comments throw a revealing light on the politically motivated and destructive leadership of the Unite union. However, I suspect his idea that the Olympics could be targeted for strike action is not shared by the vast majority of his members. He says it would be wrong to pretend &quot;everything in the garden is rosy&quot;. Who&apos;s suggesting it is? But why destroy the hard work of hundreds of thousands of people in preparing for the Games; the effort athletes have made to compete; or the reputation of the UK? McCluskey harks back to when the country was the sick man of Europe and governments asked &quot;who governs Britain?&quot; I do not believe his members want to drag us back to the past.Andrew Boff Olympic spokesman, London assembly Conservative group \u2022 On Wednesday&apos;s front page we learn that Unite&apos;s leader thinks his members should take advantage of London&apos;s hosting of the 2012 Olympics, and take the opportunity to blackmail \u2013 sorry, &quot;leverage&quot; \u2013 the government. Turning to page 3 we have a half-page photo of some of the people risking their lives, working in heavy protective suits, to dismantle the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant following last year&apos;s catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. It makes me ashamed to be British.Jayne WilkinsonEast Bilney, Norfolk \u2022 Perhaps David Cameron might lead by example (Labour should return Unite cash, says Cameron, 1 March) and return the donations made to his party over the years by Barclays, RBS, Arcadia, Goldman Sachs et al.Cathy WoodChiselborough, Somerset \u2022 Nick Clegg may claim to be appalled at the suggestion of strike action during the Olympics, but I suspect he is overplaying the nationalistic outrage in an attempt to deflect attention away from his government&apos;s attack on the NHS. The Olympics themselves are likely to be a great deal more disruptive to people living and working in London than a few strikes. In fact strikers will probably be doing commuters a favour by giving them the excuse not to go into work on those days. Also, it might be a mistake to overestimate the amount of uncritical support that the Olympic event has from the public. The UK is hosting an extremely commercialised and corporate-friendly event, where everything is being done to satisfy the rapacious needs of business sponsors and corporate hospitality ticket-sellers, while ordinary folk and even some cash-strapped participants are left scrabbling around for a few crumbs dropped from the top table. Basically, the Olympics is a gigantic marketing opportunity where the watchwords are not only the &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;spectacle&quot; of competitive sport, but also the &quot;greed&quot; and &quot;profits&quot; of companies cashing in. Take the 100m final; in a stadium of 80,000 capacity, only 21,000 tickets were available to the public. The rest have gone to sponsors or corporate hospitality ticket-sellers who will sell the tickets on at a massive mark-up (one company JetSet claimed to have made \u00a320m from the Beijing Olympics). With over 200,000 tickets (many focusing on the most popular events) distributed this way, claims by politicians that this is a great event for the &quot;whole nation&quot; could ring extremely hollow.Joe HartneyLondon"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/02/small-talk-christian-horner", "sentences": ["It&apos;s difficult to say, there&apos;s so many places that have got a lot of character and charm and appeal, whether it&apos;s Melbourne or Singapore or Montreal or Budapest \u2013 they&apos;re all great places to visit."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-02T00:06:00Z", "title": "Christian Horner: I doubt I could fix my own car if it broke down", "tags": ["Red Bull", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Hi Christian!

The training&apos;s going ... yeah, it&apos;s going, put it that way. I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s only two weeks away, to be honest with you. I ran further than I&apos;ve ever run before at the weekend, which was 12k, so I&apos;m in with a chance. What of winning? What time are you aiming for? No, I&apos;m not bothered about time. Just as long as I see the chequered flag. Have you had any problems with chafing? [Firmly. Clearly this will be the final word on chafing] No, I haven&apos;t chafed anything yet. Good, good. What&apos;s on the iPod when you&apos;re out for a run? Do you know, I haven&apos;t got one. But you&apos;re at the cutting edge of F1 technology! I&apos;m out there, just running. So you&apos;re more in tune with your surroundings, a natural style? Well, I wouldn&apos;t say natural. When you&apos;re not perched on the pit wall or out for a run what do you do to relax? I just enjoy being at home. We live in the countryside in Oxfordshire. It&apos;s a nice part of the world so it&apos;s just nice to be away from it and at home with the dogs and my girlfriend and so on. That&apos;s the best way of switching off. How many dogs have you got? Three And what are their names? What are their names? We&apos;ve got two west Highland terriers and an Airedale. Fair enough. Most people go for Spot or Fido or, if you&apos;re Doc Brown in Back to the Future, Einstein, but each to their own. When you&apos;re not at home, what&apos;s your favourite city? Crikey. It&apos;s difficult to say, there&apos;s so many places that have got a lot of character and charm and appeal, whether it&apos;s Melbourne or Singapore or Montreal or Budapest \u2013 they&apos;re all great places to visit. Now you&apos;re involved in motor sport, but what&apos;s your level of expertise with your own car? Can you fix it if you break down on the M40? [Chuckling] I doubt it very much. No. I would say I have a rudimentary understanding, let&apos;s leave it at that. But you could change a tyre if need be? If I could find the toolkit. And then work out how the jack works. They&apos;re complicated these days. But obviously driving an Infiniti they never break down. Well, we&apos;re sure. Speaking of the M40, what&apos;s the best thing about coming from Leamington Spa? The best thing about coming from Leamington Spa \u2026 is obviously the spa water. Excuse our ignorance, but you drink that, right? Or do you bathe in it? [Laughs] I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever drunk it or bathed in it. Just knowing it&apos;s there is enough. What was you favourite childhood toy? Childhood toy ... [Small Talk reckons this&apos;ll be a Scalectrix] ... My god ... ummmm [Small Talk is pretty sure this&apos;ll be a Scalectrix] ... I can&apos;t remember. It seems so long ago now ... [Yeah, it&apos;s a Scalectrix] ... for sure it would have had something to do with speed ... [Here we go] ... so probably it would&apos;ve been a Scalectrix. Were you ever any good at other sports? I enjoyed having a go at other sports. I used to play a bit of tennis as a kid. And I was sort of OK. But anything to do with speed fascinated me. Did you pass your driving test first time? Yep. Two weeks after my 17th birthday I was waiting at the end of the drive. I was desperate to get driving as quickly as possible. And when you&apos;re not driving and perhaps celebrating a race win, what&apos;s your poison? [Lengthy pause, before inspiration strikes] Anything with Red Bull, obviously. With vodka? Jagermeister? Oh, you can mix a lot of things with it these days. And when you&apos;re sipping away on your Red Bull and spirit, what bar snack would you most like to be nibbling on? [Chuckles] Oh, you&apos;ve got me now ... favourite bar snack ... well, obviously being an athlete in training I&apos;m avoiding bar snacks. The healthiest ones are Japanese rice crackers. Small Talk tip for you. [In a tone that suggests he will not be keeping it in mind] Right, I&apos;ll keep that in mind. Tea or coffee? Coffee. Milk and sugar please. Kylie or Britney? Erm, Kylie. That&apos;s probably vastly out of date really now. Ah, well it&apos;s a good job you didn&apos;t mention any one more modern, I wouldn&apos;t have known them. What would you put in Room 101? [After a brief explanation of the concept] Speed cameras. A lion and a tiger are going mano a mano \u2013 who comes out on top? The tiger Any particular reason? [Lengthy, increasingly exasperated pause] Not really. Perhaps they eat more Frosties. What about a fight between Martin Brundle and Eddie Irvine? Oh, crikey. That&apos;d be a bit like that fight in Bridget Jones. Martin would be the dark horse actually. But Eddie&apos;s looks like a wiry type, useful in a scrap. Eddie&apos;s got the talk but whether he could pack a punch? I don&apos;t know. Probably. Would you rather be attacked by a horse-sized duck or 20 duck-sized horses? I&apos;d rather not be attacked by either to be honest. Small Talk didn&apos;t push you on the bar snacks. We let you get away without telling us your dog names. But on this we really must insist ... Oh, Christ. Err ... ducks can be fairly vicious ... Yep. Swan&apos;ll break your arm. I&apos;ll go for the duck-sized horses. Who would play you in the film of your life? [With an air that suggests time is running out] I&apos;ve got no idea. And last of all can you tell us a joke? Not any good ones. Not even your dinner party standby?

He is certain that &quot;a huge change&quot; is coming to his country. He is certain, too, that a &quot;revolution&quot; is on its way. And even if he does not state it explicitly, he is certain that he will, within eight months to a year, win a landslide victory in elections to become Pakistan&apos;s prime minister. &quot;When we are in power&quot;, he says these days, not &quot;if we were in power&quot;. When I arrive, Khan is sitting alone at a\u00a0table in the garden of the house where he has lived since 2005. It is mid-afternoon, but the sun is low and the light is already fading. The house, built as a family home when he was still married to Jemima Goldsmith, sits on the crest of a ridge and commands a view of the foothills of the Himalayas, a large shimmering lake and the city of Islamabad. He is dressed entirely in black, working his BlackBerry. The house has become part of Khan&apos;s political persona. There is the short journey through the increasingly scruffy villages and then up to the beautiful hacienda-style house with the dogs, the lawns, the swimming pool and the view. There is the image of the politician who currently leads all polls in the country, looking down from his hilltop on the city and the power that he seems set to seize. The vision of the uncorrupt outsider eyeing the distant den of iniquity that he is set to purge is simply too neat to ignore. Consciously or otherwise, Khan does nothing to undermine the impression. He leads me briskly down to the edge of his land, steps up on to a large boulder overhanging the steep slope and points out the park which he saved from illegal development, and the new houses scattered across the shores of the lakes that are getting closer and closer to where we are standing. &quot;Look at it,&quot; he says angrily. &quot;There is no planning, no planning at all.&quot; He flings an arm out towards the serrated ridge of hills along the horizon. For, along with the certainty, there is righteous anger. This is directed at a\u00a0number of different targets: a &quot;corrupt political elite&quot; who &quot;plunder&quot; Pakistan; strikes by American missile-armed unmanned drones against suspected Islamic militants near the Afghan frontier; the local &quot;liberals&quot; who condone the strikes; the lack of electricity crippling the country&apos;s economy; imperialists of old and neo-imperialists of today; the war on terror and its attendant human-rights abuses; multinational lending organisations; Washington; rich Pakistanis who avoid tax while their countrymen live in &quot;multi-dimensional deprivation&quot;. In Pakistan today, certainty and anger make a\u00a0potent mix. The country, chronically unstable if astonishingly resilient, is not only suffering ongoing extremist violence but also terrible economic problems which are steadily wiping out any gains in prosperity made in previous decades. Over recent months Khan has held a series of huge political rallies, with crowds numbering more than 100,000. In terms of popularity at least, Khan and the party he founded 15 years ago, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Pakistan Union for Justice), have made a\u00a0major breakthrough. In the brutal world of south Asian politics \u2013 where dynasties, patronage and frequently sheer muscle count more than policies or public support \u2013 this is a genuine achievement. In 1999 I spent several days with Khan and his partyworkers on the campaign trail in eastern Pakistan. The headline on my pessimistic piece was: &quot;No Khan Do&quot;. These days few would risk such glib assessments of Khan&apos;s electoral chances. The late 1990s, when Khan was making his political debut, were a raw time. The political scene in Pakistan was dominated by Benazir Bhutto, one of the most celebrated female politicians in the world, and her local rival, Nawaz Sharif. In 1999 the army stepped in through a bloodless and broadly popular coup. I saw Khan on and off occasionally over the subsequent years, but there was little to indicate that my earlier analysis was wrong. He was a legend in sporting terms \u2013 one of the best all-rounders in cricketing history \u2013 and increasingly well-thought of as a philanthropist, without doubt, but not a serious politician. A column in a local English-language political magazine relentlessly satirised the ambitions of &quot;Im the Dim&quot;, and few disagreed. Now Bhutto is dead, assassinated on 27 December 2007 by Islamic militants, and the old guard of politicians who have survived her, including her husband Asif Ali Zardari, president since 2008, are detested. Khan says he could take over \u2013 democratically, of course \u2013 at any moment, but he is biding his time. &quot;We have the power to go out and block the government on any issue. But we will only have one chance and we have to be completely prepared.&quot; Back in the late 1990s, he tells me, politics was &quot;like facing a fast bowler without pads, gloves or a helmet&quot;. Not any longer, he says. Khan was born on 25 November 1952 into a wealthy and well-connected family in Lahore, Pakistan&apos;s eastern city. Ethnically he is a Pashtun, or Pathan, as British imperialists called the peoples concentrated along what once was known as the North-West Frontier. Educated at Lahore&apos;s Aitchison College, one of the most exclusive schools in Pakistan, the Royal Grammar School in Worcester and Oxford University, his early years were typical of Pakistan&apos;s anglicised upper classes. Khan reminisces about how his family home, Zaman Park, was surrounded by fields and woodland where he used to hunt partridge. &quot;Now everything is built up; it&apos;s like living next to a motorway,&quot; he says. &quot;The air pollution, noise pollution\u2026 It is terrible.&quot;     Special delivery: playing at Lord\u2019s in 1987. Khan made his Test debut against England in 1971 aged 18. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    The shy teenager&apos;s precocious sporting talent took him rapidly into the national side: he made his Test debut against England in 1971, aged just 18. Eleven years later, after performances combining tenacity and flair, he was made captain of Pakistan. Khan&apos;s two autobiographies, All Round View (1992) and Pakistan: A Personal History (2010), both tell the story of his years as an international cricketer: the victories against the odds in front of the home crowd, the career-threatening injury overcome, the return from retirement at the age of 37, winning the World Cup \u2013 for the first and only time in Pakistan&apos;s sporting history \u2013 despite a ruined cartilage in his shoulder. It is only when in Pakistan, where the sport is a national passion, that the enormity of his sporting achievement is clear. Neither book is forthcoming about his activities off the pitch, however. A string of rich, well-connected, beautiful women earned him a reputation as a playboy. Then in 1995 he married Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of the late billionaire Sir James Goldsmith. Aged only 21, she converted to Islam and moved to Pakistan. The couple soon had two sons. &quot;I had always wanted to marry a Pakistani, but I realised while I was playing cricket that sport at that level and marriage were not compatible,&quot; he says. &quot;So I decided I&apos;d only get married when I gave up sport.&quot; Khan twice announced his retirement: the first time, General Zia ul-Haq, then military dictator of Pakistan, persuaded him to reconsider, and the second time he returned to the team to help raise funds for Pakistan&apos;s first cancer hospital. His mother, to whom he wad been very close, had died of cancer in 1984 and in her memory he had decided to build a hospital which would offer free treatment to the poor. &quot;The whole board [of the hospital] said I needed to keep playing so they could raise money. So I carried on until I was 39, and by then I was too old for an arranged marriage. I just could no longer trust someone else to find someone for me. &quot;So I found it very difficult,&quot; Khan continues. &quot;The irony was I thought all the 25-year-olds were too young, and I was still looking when I met Jemima \u2013 and she was 21.&quot; The couple married in 1995 and divorced nine years later. &quot;It would have had a greater chance of working if I hadn&apos;t been involved in politics or she had been Pakistani. Or if she could have got involved in the politics with me.&quot; As one of his wife&apos;s grandfathers was Jewish, a noxious storm of abuse and conspiracy theories was unleashed. Pakistan is a country where antisemitism is so deep-rooted as to be remarkable only when absent. Local politicians targeted this &quot;weak spot&quot;: spurious court cases, rabble-rousing editorials, underhand smears all contributed to make Pakistan a hostile environment for the young socialite heiress. The construction of the cancer hospital and the leadership of his party consumed most of Khan&apos;s funds and time. &quot;Because they attacked me and her, calling me part of the Jewish lobby, she couldn&apos;t get involved in politics and that was the beginning of it becoming more and more difficult. And she really gave it her best shot. I look back and think: could my marriage have worked? I think of the words of the prophet [Mohammed]: &apos;Don&apos;t fight destiny because destiny is God.&apos; I believe the past is to learn from, not live in.&quot;     'She really gave it her best shot': with his ex-wife Jemima on their wedding day in 1995. Photograph: Nils Jorgenson/Rex Features    He still gets on well with her family \u2013 when in London he stays with his former mother-in-law Lady Annabel Goldsmith \u2013 and has a\u00a0&quot;fabulous relationship&quot; with his sons. A day or so after we meet, he is flying to London for three days for half term. &quot;It&apos;s very important to spend time together. Children really need a\u00a0mother and a father. They have different roles, but both are very important. This idea of having two men as parents. It&apos;s a nonsense.&quot; Religion became important to Khan relatively late. He grew up, he says, surrounded by faith. His mother read him stories from the life of the Prophet Mohammed and at seven he was taught to read the Koran in Arabic by a visiting scholar. But as a young man, he was not devout. The return to faith came following his mother&apos;s illness and a profound personal interrogation, he says, prompted by the furore after the publication of Salman Rushdie&apos;s Satanic Verses. Wanting to defend Islam from what he saw as ignorant attacks, Khan began to read more widely about the religion. These days his identity as a conservative, but not fundamentalist, Muslim has become part of his political programme and, in a way not often understood in the west, his political persona in Pakistan. Liberals in the country dismiss him as a mullah, literally a low-level cleric but figuratively an ignorant extremist, just, they say, without the beard that is the mark of the pious Muslim man. This, predictably, irritates Khan. His faith, he says, has been influenced primarily by the Sufi strand of Islamic practice, which emphasises a believer&apos;s direct engagement with God without the intercession of a\u00a0cleric or scholar. Another major influence is Allama Iqbal, a poet, political activist and philosopher who died in 1938 and is considered one of the spiritual fathers of Pakistan. &quot;Iqbal, who is my great inspiration, clashes with the mullahs,&quot; says Khan. &quot;The message of all religions is to be just and humane but it is often distorted by the clergy.&quot; For all the talk of tolerance, Khan&apos;s party has been keeping some strange company recently, sharing a platform, for example, with the Difa-e-Pakistan or Pakistan Defence Council. This is a coalition of extremist groups which wants to end any Pakistani alliance with the USA and includes people who not only explicitly support the Afghan Taliban but who are associated with terrorist and sectarian violence. At one recent rally of the council in Islamabad, I met members of Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, a\u00a0Sunni group which has murdered thousands of Shias, while around me hundreds chanted: &quot;Death to America.&quot; Lashkar-e-Toiba, the organisation responsible for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai in India in which 166 died, is also part of the coalition. Mian Mohammed Aslam, the head of the Jamaat-e-Islami, a mass Islamist party similar to the Muslim Brotherhood in the Islamic world and dedicated to a similarly hardline, conservative programme, spoke warmly of &quot;close relations&quot; with Khan, even going as far as raising the prospect of an electoral pact with Khan&apos;s Tehreek-e-Insaf in the coming elections, when I interviewed him. Khan says that as a politician he and his party need to reach out to everybody, but that does not mean that he endorses the views of the Islamists. Undoubtedly a social conservative who is religious in outlook and rhetoric, he does not lapse into simplistic binary analyses of the west (secular or &quot;Crusader Christian&quot; against Islam) like many of his countrymen. He denies being anti-western at all. &quot;How can I be anti-western? How can you be anti-western when [the west] is so varied, so different? It doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot;     Finger on the pulse: speaking at a rally in Lahore last month. 'We only have one chance and we have to be completely prepared,' he says. Photograph: Warrick Page/Getty Images    It is not religion driving Khan&apos;s anger but something else. Take, for example, his analysis of the violent insurgency in the western borders of his country. For most scholars, this is the result of a complex mix of factors: the breakdown of traditional society, war in Afghanistan in the 1980s and the 2000s, the generalised radicalisation of the Islamic world since 2001, al-Qaeda&apos;s presence, the Pakistani army&apos;s operations in the area and the civilian casualties caused by drone strikes. The militants themselves, who behead supposed spies and drive out development workers or teachers, are increasingly unpopular. Yet Khan calls the violence a &quot;fight for Pashtun solidarity against a foreign invader&quot;. He insists &quot;there is not a threat to Pakistan from Taliban ideology&quot;. For Khan this foreign invasion takes various forms. There is dress (he speaks admiringly of how the Pashtuns still shun western clothes) and there is TV (he mentions how his former mother-in-law thought one channel beamed in from India was in fact American, because of all its adverts for consumer goods). His charge against the &quot;liberal elite&quot; is implicitly a charge against the most westernised elements in the country. It is a defence of a vision of the local, the authentic, the familiar, against globalisation. However, with his cultured public-school vowels, his half-British children, his British ex-wife, his success at a game the English invented, it becomes a very personal argument, too. Khan says he first became aware of the effects of colonialism as a teenager. &quot;My first shock was going from Aitchison to play for Lahore. The boys from the Urdu [local language] schools laughed at me\u2026 Then in England we had been trained to be English public schoolboys, which we were not. Hence the inferiority complex. Because we were not and could never be the thing we were trying to be.&quot; Even the memory agitates him. &quot;I saw the elite [in Pakistan] who were superior because they were more westernised. I used to hear that colonialism was about building roads, railways etc\u2026 but that&apos;s all bullshit. It kills your self-esteem. The elite become a cheap imitation of the coloniser.&quot; He says that he recently read that after 200 years of Arab rule in Sicily, the court continued to speak Arabic and wear Arab clothes for 50 years after their former overlords had left. His recent book is full of such references. P34: &quot;Colonialism, for my mother and father, was the ultimate humiliation.&quot; P43: &quot;The more a Pakistani aped the British the higher up the social ladder he was considered to be.&quot; P64: &quot;In today&apos;s Lahore and Karachi rich women go to glitzy parties in western clothes chauffeured by men with entirely different customs and values&quot; \u2013 and so on through the 350 pages. This lays him open to charges of hypocrisy, inconsistency, of being a self-hating &quot;brown sahib&quot; himself, accusations frequently made by the &quot;liberal elite&quot; Khan so detests. Yet Khan&apos;s patriotism, faith and honesty are attractive to many in a chronically unstable country seen as an exporter of extremism and violence, as irremediably corrupt, as &quot;the most dangerous place in the world&quot;. So, what would Khan do in power? At the moment he is thick on aspiration and thin on practical policy. He would, he says, cut government expenditure and raise tax collection. He would turn the mansions and villas of senior officials \u2013 &quot;these colonial symbols&quot; \u2013 into libraries or even museums &quot;like after the Iranian revolution&quot; to show the people how the elite lived. He would solve the &quot;energy and education emergencies&quot; and he would &quot;totally pull out of the war on terror&quot;, withdrawing the army from the western border zone and letting &quot;our people in [these areas] deal with the militants themselves&quot;. Whether he could make the country&apos;s powerful military obey such directives \u2013 his critics allege he is unhealthily close to the army \u2013 is unsure. As for relations with Washington, his position is clear: &quot;We need to be a friend of American, but not a hired gun,&quot; he says. &quot;We will take no aid from them. We will stand on our own feet, with a fully sovereign foreign policy and no terrorism from our soil.&quot; Which political leaders does he admire? Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the moderate Islamist Turkish prime minister, he says; Brazil&apos;s Lula da Silva, who forced a better redistribution of his country&apos;s newly generated wealth; Mahathir Mohamad and Lee Kuan Yew of Malaysia and Singapore, two authoritarians. But it doesn&apos;t really matter. If Khan does end up prime minister he will do things his way. Khan is not &quot;dim&quot;, as the elite who he detests contemptuously say, but is not an intellectual either. He is a politician riding a wave of public disaffection, and that wave might just carry him to power. What he does afterwards is not something he worries about. He will be 60 this autumn. This would only bother him, he says, if he &quot;had nothing to look forward to&quot;. But he is convinced that he does. From his hilltop Khan looks down and says: &quot;This country will go through its biggest change ever. A revolution is coming.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2013.

The tweet reach for this event topped 5 million. The event included more than 50 hosts around the world, including Bollywood stars in India, celebrity chefs in Indonesia, food bloggers in the UK, government ministers and the Asian food channel in Singapore with its 46 million viewers. We also had partner organisations involved and tweeting about the event, including the World Health Organisation and the ONE Campaign. This was an exciting new global online moment but potentially highlights something more significant in the way that international charities need to run their global communications. In the past global charities have been seen as global by default because of where they work and their coverage in traditional media. But are they truly global? The communications operations have traditionally run out of hubs like London and New York but this risks northern perspectives dominating media messaging and can blunt efforts to build global trends and awareness through social media. Often part of a development organisation&apos;s challenge is in raising awareness within developing countries. Organisations need to empower external supporters if they want to enter multiple national markets and get an issue trending globally. The global tweet chat included hosts from around the world and, as organisers, we couldn&apos;t control the message or whether other organisations might overshadow us. We had a mix of participants, including corporates, heads of state and activists with very differing approaches. Sharing hashtags that all can use (in our case #hiddencrisis), empowering social media enthusiasts and creating new innovative partnerships can create an online surge that gives exciting uplift to local events. Despite rapid improvements in usage and coverage, 70% of the world is still not online, so local events and media, especially radio, are still crucial for any global campaign that wants to have local impact and support. Events were planned locally in more than 30 countries where Save the Children supports campaigning, including India, Afghanistan, Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria and Bangladesh. But we also know that government ministers and opinion-formers are increasingly interested in Twitter around the world. The Rwandan minister of health and active tweeter @AgnesBinagwaho hosted the 0830 \u2013 0900 position in our global tweet chat, and President @jmKikwete of Tanzania tweeted his support. This was a positive public engagement by government leaders that should inspire others. Recent analysis of Africa&apos;s Twitter usage also shows 11.5m tweets were generated from the continent over three months, illustrating that the network is fast becoming an effective tool for raising awareness. Recently the Kenyan news anchor @annekiguta was re-tweeting the fact that @jeffsachs was going live on the tweet chat in New York, while Al Jazeera&apos;s @PrernaSuriAJE was sharing her new film from Delhi. Organising the logistics of the tweet chat took quite a bit of preparation. A core team of global campaign staff based in Asia, Europe, Africa and the US was able to host particular sections of the discussion. We also partnered other organisations to promote an hour of the tweet chat so that it reached a new audience. For example, there was a big uplift when the WHO started promoting the discussion because of their global network. Similarly, Save the Children in the UK organised for restaurant critic @jayrayner1 to be in Rwanda for the launch. He joined the chat alongside the minister of health and also wrote about the visit in The Observer. Save the Children in the US worked with celebrity chef @catcora who tweeted about her recent visit to Ethiopia. We used a &apos;twebevent&apos; platform to host the tweet chat as it gave the event an online home beyond Twitter. This site allowed us to live-stream press conferences in Geneva and New York and show other films throughout the day. The site is very straightforward so people not on Twitter could follow the event. This was particularly beneficial to many staff who wanted to follow proceedings. A common challenge for international NGOs running global events is finding the right spokespeople, or tweeters, who are genuinely interesting to the public. There is always a temptation to put forward your own internal experts for any public question-and-answer session. While it is important to have experts supporting the event, it is crucial to engage guests and be ambitious about who to target. Promoting a new issue is hard when there is so much noise out there, but by globalising our social media approach we were seeing individuals, staff, celebrities and other organisations highlight our issue and, in doing so, creating a far bigger reach than trying to do this on our own.

He was in the fields when the Kholpatua river surged over the 30ft-high earthen embankment, sending a wall of water across the fields. &quot;I ran home when I saw the water and grabbed my wife, son and daughter,&quot; he said. &quot;We hung on to a tree for two or three hours during the storm.&quot; No one in Adarsha Gram died in the storm that killed 300 people and destroyed 4,000km of roads and embankments. But the villagers saw their livelihood from shrimp farming wiped out. The river created a lake that cut road access \u2013 the village can only be reached by boat \u2013 and deposited huge amounts of grey sludge around the village \u2013 which sits on land flat as a pancake, destroying the shrimp ponds. &quot;Before Aila, I lived very well from my shrimp pond,&quot; said Dhali. &quot;Now I work as a day labourer and I don&apos;t have enough money to restart the business.&quot; Dhali&apos;s story represents in microcosm the threat from climate change to low-lying Bangladesh. The densely populated country of 164 million is highly vulnerable to the prospect or rising sea levels and melting glaciers. Over the last 20 years, the country has been hit by six major disasters \u2013 four floods and two cyclones \u2013 affecting millions. In 1991 a cyclone killed 138,000 people, and in 2007 a combined flood and cyclone killed up to 10,000 and affected 15 million. About half of the world&apos;s deaths due to tropical cyclones have occurred in Bangladesh. Migration for those living at the edge of the Bay of Bengal \u2013 the world&apos;s largest bay \u2013 area is not feasible as around 15 million Bangladeshis live in areas vulnerable to climate change. Adarsha Gram lies in the Sundarbans, a watery and muddy world of mangrove forests that is home to the famed Bengal tiger, wild boars, macaque monkeys and estuarine crocodiles. With migration not a realistic option for many, adaptation becomes imperative. After Aila, Brac, a Bangladeshi NGO, supported the villagers financially and helped build cyclone-resistant homes. Designed by Brac university in consultation with the villagers and funded by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the 43 cyclone-resistant structures at Adarsha Gram now stand on four concrete pillars, which are 7ft above ground and 6ft below. Besides the houses built of wood and brick roof tiles, the village of 300 households also has a schoolhouse that doubles up as a cyclone shelter for people and livestock \u2013 a concrete staircase for people and an earthen ramp for the cows and other animals. The school&apos;s distinctive wall has gaps between the bricks, allowing wind to pass through the building so that it doesn&apos;t have to absorb the full shock of 240km/h winds. Having cyclone-resistant homes may provide some reassurance for villagers in case a cyclone hits again, but that does not feed them. Apart from destroying homes, flooding also destroys livelihoods. Three years after Aila, the villagers have only now begun to dig shrimp ponds in the expanse of grey earth that blends with grey February skies. They will, however, not be working for themselves, but for a businessman who has leased 850 acres of the communal land for shrimp farming, which is very popular in the Koyra region. But shrimp farming has a downside, explained Mohammed Zahidur Rahman, from Brac&apos;s disaster, environment and climate change programme. &quot;Once land is given over to shrimp farming, it becomes useless to farming after 10-15 years because the land becomes too salty,&quot; he said, &quot;and most of the profits do not go to the farmers but those businessmen who have leased the land.&quot; Yet, whole villages have adopted shrimp farming and the landscape in the area is full of large rectangular ponds that alternate with paddy and maize fields. Brac is promoting alternative activities such as growing salt-tolerant rice and maize, as well as crab-fattening. Crabs, which mature in 15 days, have the advantage of taking up less space and \u2013 provided they are the right size \u2013 find a ready export market in countries such as Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. But there are no simple solutions. Crabs have a tendency to fight. Those that lose a claw in combat are no good for export, although one-limbed crabs do end up in tasty curry dishes that are a welcome source of protein for some families. Crabs can also die from viruses. &quot;I&apos;m earning good money. Crabs are more profitable than shrimp, but sometimes most of my crabs die,&quot; said Jossi Rani, at Deyara village, 23km from Adarsha Gram, as she cuts up talapia fish to feed her crabs. Apart from the threat of cyclones, a more insidious problem for those living in the Sundarbans is increasing water salination, making it hard to grow even salt-resistant rice and maize. Drinking water is also an issue. Even water in a deep aquifer \u2013 700ft \u2013 in the coastal area contains too much salt to drink. Brac has imported two desalination plants from China to provide drinking water, but they have broken down and are awaiting Chinese engineers to come and repair them. Brac&apos;s work in disaster and climate change \u2013 from training tens of thousands of residents in disaster peparedness and response to helping people earn a living \u2013 blurs the line between disaster relief and development. But in areas of high vulnerability to climate change, from Bangladesh to the drought-prone Sahel in west Africa, development and humanitarian organisations increasingly see their work as complementary. Kristalina Georgieva, the EU&apos;s head of humanitarian operations, makes the case that it is no longer affordable to wait for crises to hit when it is cheaper \u2013 and the right thing to do \u2013 is to take pre-emptive action. In the Sahel, where relief groups are working hard to prevent a humanitarian disaster from the recent drought, the EU has agreed \u20ac150m in development funding on top of \u20ac123m in emergency assistance. In Ethiopia, the World Food Programme is increasingly moving into development work, helping farmers to rehabilitate degraded soil. Three years on, the residents of Adarsha Gram have yet to recover from cyclone Aila \u2013 a stark reminder of the enormous challenges in building resilience. Shrimp farming has provided some welcome money, but the soil will get saltier and the embankment risks being weakened as villagers run pipes through it to siphon water from the Kholpatua."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/mar/07/hsbc-insurance-sale-admiral-gains", "sentences": ["HSBC added 4.8p to 553.2p as it agreed to sell its general insurance business in Hong Kong, Singapore, Argentina and Mexico to France&apos;s Axa and Australia&apos;s QBE for $914m in cash."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-07T09:18:11Z", "title": "HSBC rises after $914m insurance sale while Admiral jumps 11% after profits, as FTSE edges higher", "tags": ["Business", "HSBC", "Admiral", "British American Tobacco", "Serco", "Cairn Energy"], "article": "As a measure of calm returned to the market after Tuesday&apos;s sell-off, mining and banking shares were among the leading risers.

The move is part of the bank&apos;s strategy to sell non-core operations. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:  Based on the disclosed net asset value of $237m, the implied exit multiple is 3.9 times, which appears to be a relatively healthy valuation, in our view.  The transaction is not unexpected, having been subject to recent press speculation. Nor is it particularly material to the group finances, in our view. However, it represents a further step in the company&apos;s strategy to build a more focused business, being the 20th such disposal or business closure (by our maths) that the company has announced since its strategy day last May. In addition, HSBC and Hang Seng Bank have agreed to sign 10 year bancassurance distribution deals with Axa and QBE, which will result in commissions on product sales and, potentially, profit-related payments being made to HSBC and Hang Seng.  Still with insurance, motor specialist Admiral has jumped 117p to \u00a311.57 after its profits rose by a better than expected 13%. In November the company warned it had been hit by a rise in personal injury claims, causing analysts to slash their forecasts. Chief executive Henry Engelhardt said:  It has been a disappointing year. Not because it was a bad year, but because so much more was expected.  (It&apos;s worth having a look at his chief executive&apos;s statement in full, by the way, with its references to Dickens, Superman and chameleons among other things.) But a number of analysts are still cautious on the company. Kevin Ryan at Investec said:  As the 2011 results demonstrate, Admiral remains significantly more profitable than the rest of the UK motor market. We believe that as Admiral grows and its competitors take remedial action to address losses, this leadership position will be eroded. We retain our 570p target price and sell recommendation.

After Tuesday&apos;s downbeat note on the cigarette sector from Investec, British American Tobacco is leading the fallers, down 93p at 3098.5p. However the bulk of the decline is due to its shares going ex-dividend. Indeed, the six companies being quoted without the shareholder payout would knock 11 points off the FTSE 100 if they all fell in line with the dividend figure. These include CRH, down 15p to \u00a312.70, and Serco, off 1p at 518p.

A waste-picker in Bangladesh now has regular pay and health coverage for sorting organic waste in a clean factory, rather than toiling on a filthy dump, and that waste will be converted into natural fertiliser, which will generate greater yields for farmers. The same technology will turn waste into biogas, improving a slum dweller&apos;s access to cheaper electricity. And a social entrepreneur will be able to list his business on a new, Singapore-based regional trading platform designed to raise capital to benefit the communities the enterprise is trying to help. These are just a few of the dozens of ventures presented at the recent Asian Development Bank&apos;s (ADB) Philippine Social Enterprise Forum amid an explosion in Asian social enterprises set up to tackle the region&apos;s social and environmental problems. Bart \u00c9des, the ADB official who organised the forum, says: &quot;Social enterprises are building sustainable business models to address poverty, joblessness and a lack of reliable access to basic services like education, energy, health and water. Entrepreneurs have poured into this space, applying their skills to the mission of creating a better world. &quot;At the same time, many NGOs are reducing their dependence on grants by incorporating market-based approaches into their operations in ways that go well beyond the traditional high street Oxfam shop.&quot; Tommy Hutchinson, founder of i-genius, an international community of social entrepreneurs, says the growth of social enterprise in recent years is due to governments and corporations realising the potential of community-based efforts, consumers making more ethical decisions about what they buy, and people wanting more freedom and creativity from their work. Hutchinson says Asian countries have fuelled this growth in different ways. &quot;China is advanced in technology, Thailand has the government that is most switched on, and Indonesia has a strong, rural-based social business,&quot; he says. But the Philippines is in a particularly strong position, not just because the prevalence of so many social and environmental problems makes it the perfect laboratory to test ideas, but because of its people. Hutchinson says: &quot;They know how to make things and are producing real, social-based products which can be sold to earn income, and this is a sign of a healthy foundation. There is a lot of entrepreneurial talent, a lot of knowledge and awareness. And there is a strong sense of community.&quot; Jaime Aristotle Alip, chairman and managing director of Card, a microfinance institution in the Philippines, believes tax breaks and income disturbance insurance \u2013 designed to protect social entrepreneurs from income loss due to natural disasters \u2013 are also vital (south-east Asia is one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world). It took Iftekhar Enayetulah, co-founder of Waste Concern, 18 years to develop his project to the point where it is now being replicated in other Asian countries. But developing new technology to convert agricultural waste into energy (biogas) and resources (organic fertilisers) without emitting greenhouse gases has done more than just provide a safe livelihood for the poorest in Bangladesh. Enayetulah says: &quot;Waste management is a huge problem in Asia and the Pacific. We generate 3m tonnes per day and 60% of it is organic. We usually look at waste as a problem, but if you look at it as a resource, you can convert it into products that have a market value and it can be a more sustainable business.&quot; Meanwhile, projects such as Clean Engines, which supplies kits to convert dirty engines, have taken a more &quot;person by person&quot; approach, selling a product that allows individuals to help themselves while improving air quality by reducing emissions. Motorcycle owners buy the kits to become more fuel-efficient. They receive loans from micro-finance institutions to pay for them, and mechanics in the community are paid to install them. Greg Herman, the Clean Engines CEO, says: &quot;The Philippines is the kind of place where you can make a business like this work. There is an opportunity for raising the economic level of people at the base of the pyramid, and the government seems open to it because they know that the traditional approaches have not worked. They have a transportation crisis here. There can be very expensive solutions to the problem or incremental solutions.&quot; Former investment banker Durreen Shahnaz, the founder of Impact Investment Exchange Asia and Impact Investment Shujog, assists social enterprises to raise capital and in doing so develops &quot;social capital markets&quot; for them to engage with investors through debt or equity financing. Shahnaz says: &quot;Imagine a marketplace where you are coming to show your goods and buyers are coming to buy them. Social enterprises can say, &apos;we are doing XYZ. This is the social and environmental impact we are having, this is the financial return you are going to get \u2013 please invest.&apos; And on the other side, we are bringing in investors ranging from high net-worth individuals to venture funds, who don&apos;t have the ability to find all these organisations or get them ready for investment.&quot; She plans to work with mid-level organisations that have already received some investment and are ready to go to the next level, and with those that need help to get to that stage. Shahnaz, who is from Bangladesh, says she believes Asia is the Silicon Valley of social enterprise. &quot;We have the capital, the enterprises and, best of all, we have the innovation.

The first delivery was spot-on, bang on length and line and, on pitching, it jagged back sharply off the seam and sank into the unprotected inside of the thigh of the batsman pushing forward. The next was all but identical (the pitch marks, scarred on the grass, were within six inches of one another) and again the batsman came forward at it. Only this time he changed his mind midway, shifted his weight on to the back foot, and, clean as you like, thumped it with a vertical bat and high elbow not just over mid-off, or even the boundary rope, but over the corner of what is now the Compton stand and on to the Nursery. It remains the single most devastating shot I have ever seen. And Vivian Richards played a few in his time. What would he be worth today? It is more than a year since last I saw him. Or rather he saw me, across an airport transit lounge, me en route to the Ashes, he for a tour of King and I shows with Rodney Hogg. &quot;Hey Selve, what&apos;s happening, man?&quot; He looked dapper, a porkpie hat perched rakishly in place of the familiar maroon cap, a little thicker round the face but still that Big Bad John &quot;kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip&quot; appearance that made him look as much like a top middleweight as the greatest batsman of the modern era. Even as he reaches three score years on Wednesday, he looks fighting fit. So, from Singapore to Sydney, we supped a little and chewed the fat. There were things I wanted to ask him that I never had. Which of all the great West Indies fast bowlers of his time would he pick for his dream quartet? Andy Roberts, he said, his fellow Antiguan with an astounding cricket brain who was there at the start of it all; and the brilliant, much-lamented Malcolm Marshall. Then came Mikey, the great svelte Holding. And finally not the rumbling faithful Big Bird Joel Garner, but instead the brooding stringbean Curtly Ambrose. But, Richards admitted further, if he wanted someone to blast him a wicket, without fear, favour or consequence, there was none more chilling than Colin Croft. Now tell me, I asked him, since it&apos;s a long time over, how do you think that bowlers \u2013 or specifically, me \u2013 should have approached the task of bowling to you. I had successes, but generally they would have been early on in an innings as he sought the upper hand and took calculated risks. Hard graft after that. You had to be aggressive, he said with some passion, aggressive. It mattered not if fast, slow or medium, spin, swing or seam, you had to demonstrate positive intent or you were shot from the start. When, after he took guard, he wandered down the pitch, tilted his head back and, looking down his aquiline nose to eyeball the bowler, it was almost as if he was sniffing the air through his flared nostrils for the scent of fear. He wanted to feel the ball &quot;sweet&quot; off the bat from the off, and then he knew it was his day. Yeah aggressive, he repeated, he respected that. But this was always easier said than done because of the way he set it up. There is an analogy with the buzz in a theatre before the curtain goes up on a great thespian. The wicket falls, but he allowed things to settle, waiting for the arena to clear, the celebrations (more muted in those days) to die down. The theatre lights dimmed and expectation became electricity. Everyone knew who was coming. And when he finally made his entrance, swaggering down the steps, cudding his gum, and windmilling his bat gently, first one arm then the other, it was a personification of grace and menace combined, the walk as unmistakable as had been that of Garry Sobers, to my mind his only rival as the finest postwar batsman of them all. I put on a performance, he told me, it was part of my act. He wanted to dominate and the genesis of that process happened even before he closed the dressing-room door behind him. His reputation preceded him like an advance guard. It continued with the languid wicketwards saunter, the slow precision with which he took guard, the way he ambled down the pitch to tap down an imaginary mark, all the while looking for, and not always finding, eye contact with his adversary. Then he would smack the end of his bat handle with the palm of his right hand, a final intimidatory gesture. There have been giants of the game contemporary and since, batsmen of vast pedigree and achievement: Greg Chappell, Lara, Tendulkar, Ponting, Dravid, Kallis, Sangakkara, Hayden and others.

Asian countries increased their defence budget by more than 3% in real terms last year, the IISS said. China increased its share of total military expenditure on weapons in the region to more than 30%. Official Chinese military spending totalled nearly $90bn last year, more than two-and-a-half times the 2001 level. Western analysts point to China&apos;s plans for naval &quot;force projection&quot; to defend its growing economic interests in Africa and elsewhere, and secure maritime lanes of communication. Most attention has focused on China&apos;s first aircraft carrier, the former Soviet ship the Varyag, and its new J-20 combat aircraft. &quot;But China&apos;s technological advances are more modest than some alarmist hypotheses of its military development have suggested&quot;, Chipman said. &quot;They represent nascent rather than actual capability. China, for example, does not yet have the capability to operate fixed-wing aircraft from a carrier.&quot; More immediately significant is China&apos;s development of anti-satellite capacities, anti-ship ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and cyber-warfare capabilities. &quot;Managing tensions in the South China Sea will be an increasing challenge,&quot; said the IISS report. Defence analysts also pointed to potential tensions between the US and China being aggravated by Beijing refusing to agree to confidence-building measures along the lines of those between the US and the Soviet Union during the cold war. &quot;China does not want to give a seatbelt to the US,&quot; one defence analyst said. Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are all investing in improving air and naval capacities, as are India, Japan and South Korea. India, for instance, plans to boost maritime capacities with submarines and aircraft carriers, said the IISS. In Europe, defence budgets remain under pressure and cuts to equipment programmes continue. Between 2008 and 2010 there were reductions in defence spending in at least 16 European Nato member states.

The stake is expected to yield a $1.5bn (\u00a3950m) payout to Lehman&apos;s creditors, who are owed $450bn. Lehman&apos;s estate has emerged from bankruptcy protection and confirmed that its first payment to creditors, which include hedge funds, money managers and businesses, will be made in April. It is expected to exceed $10bn and in total creditors will get around $65bn. Other assets that could be sold are a hotel in Hawaii, a Rockies ski resort and a Manhattan boutique hotel. Lehman is the second-biggest shareholder in Formula One&apos;s Jersey-based holding company, Delta Topco, which is majority-owned by private equity firm CVC. Lehman owns a 15.3% stake and a senior Formula One source says that Topco is worth &quot;more than $10bn&quot;. A sale could open the door to new investors in Formula One, which has been a subject of much discussion in the past year. In April, the media group News Corporation said it was considering a bid with the Italian firm Exor. Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and the world&apos;s richest man, Carlos Slim, were also believed to be interested and in November Formula One&apos;s chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, said he had been advised to float the business in Singapore rather than sell it. Lehman&apos;s $639bn bankruptcy remains the largest in US history and marked the demise of a company that had survived the Civil War and the Depression. Lehman said it had already raised $30bn since its 2008 collapse. It has sold its stake in the Manhattan property known as the International Toy Centre, which once housed toy makers from around the world, and Whistler Blackcomb, a Canadian ski resort that was one of the venues for the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010. The bank says it stands to raise $35bn more by selling the rest of its assets, which include the 404-room Ritz Carlton Kapalua in Hawaii and the Moonlight Basin in Montana, a luxurious ski, golf and spa resort. Lehman first became a Formula One shareholder in 2002 when it took over a stake held by German media company Kirch after it defaulted on a loan from the bank. Lehman sold this to CVC in 2006, but then reinvested and provided $550m of a $2.8bn loan which the private equity firm used to buy the sport. When Lehman went bust in September 2008, CVC attempted to seize its Formula One shares, as Topco&apos;s articles of association give it the power to force any shareholder which becomes insolvent to sell for a fair price. Lehman objected on the grounds that its stake would be worth more if it was sold as part of a controlling interest in the sport. CVC agreed and allowed it to move its shares and right to repayment of the debt from its bankrupt arm Lehman Commercial Paper into LBI Group, a new holding company containing valuable assets. LBI&apos;s purpose is to generate cash from these assets and pay Lehman&apos;s creditors. This is continuing and dissolving the firm completely depends on settling the claims from creditors. To ensure that the Formula One stake raises funds for Lehman&apos;s creditors, LBI has committed itself to paying Lehman Commercial Paper an amount equal to the market value of the shares if it has not sold them within two years. The documents state that &quot;if, on June 30, 2014, [LBI Group] has not disposed of all of the Formula One assets, then [Lehman Commercial Paper] may, at any time thereafter demand that [LBI Group] pay to [Lehman Commercial Paper] an amount equal to the fair value of the Formula One assets.&quot; Topco&apos;s shareholders are bound by an agreement which gives CVC a veto over the sale of any stakes in the company. However, when it requested the transfer of the Formula One shares to LBI, Lehman argued that US bankruptcy law would overrule its obligation to CVC. This claim was never tested in court, so unless Lehman uses it again and is successful, it means CVC still holds the keys as to who will be the future owner of Formula One."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/08/airbus-compensation-a380-cracked-wings", "sentences": ["The A380&apos;s biggest customer is Dubai-based airline Emirates, which operates 20 of the 525-seater jets, followed by Singapore Airlines with 15, Qantas with 12, Lufthansa eight, Air France six, Korean Air five and China Southern two."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-08T10:21:42Z", "title": "Airbus faces \u20ac105m repair bill for A380 superjumbos' cracked wings", "tags": ["Airbus", "EADS", "Airline industry", "Air transport", "Business", "World news"], "article": "Airbus faces a repair bill of \u20ac105m (\u00a387m) to fix cracks in the wings of its global fleet of A380 superjumbos. Airbus&apos;s parent, the European aerospace and defence group EADS, revealed the cost at its annual results in Paris on Thursday morning, a month after safety checks for the state-of-the-art aircraft were extended to all 67 in service. The European Aviation Safety Agency has warned that if they are not detected the cracks inside the wings &quot;may lead to reduction of the structural integrity of the aeroplane&quot;. The EASA directives apply to two types of crack. The most serious defect, located in a specific area of the A380 wings, relates to brackets that attach the A380&apos;s wing ribs \u2013 the elongated, oval-shaped frames that run along the width of the wing \u2013 to the wing&apos;s metal skin. The cracks were caused by the stress generated when the brackets were fastened to the skin \u2013 a strain that was exacerbated by the flexing of the wings during flight. A380 wings are built at the Airbus factory in Broughton, Wales, but it is understood that the most serious cracks are a design fault. The main Airbus wing design facility is at Filton near Bristol although the brackets at the centre of the safety scare were not made there. So far 18 planes have been checked for the most serious defect, dubbed a &quot;type two&quot; crack, and every plane must be checked before it reaches 1,300 flights in service. Aviation sources said that type two cracks had not been discovered in every inspection to date, although they had been found in some checks. The A380&apos;s biggest customer is Dubai-based airline Emirates, which operates 20 of the 525-seater jets, followed by Singapore Airlines with 15, Qantas with 12, Lufthansa eight, Air France six, Korean Air five and China Southern two. The repair bill includes covering the cost of the checks and, if necessary, replacing cracked parts with new fittings. If serious cracks are detected, the flawed part is cut out and replaced by engineers. EADS revealed on Thursday that 2011 sales rose 7% to \u20ac49.1bn from \u20ac45.7bn the year before, beating analysts&apos; expectations of around \u20ac47.9bn. Full-year profit at the group, where Airbus is the biggest unit, grew 87% to just over \u20ac1bn. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2012.

Regulators, politicians and shareholders are each stepping up pressure on companies for greater board diversity as part of a drive for better governance. Early this week, European justice commissioner Viviane Reding launched a public consultation to generate proposals \u2013 including possible legislation \u2013 to increase women&apos;s participation at senior levels in companies. It&apos;s just over a year since Lord Davies published a UK government-backed report that set a target for a minimum of 25% female board representation in FTSE-100 companies by 2015, but stopped short of compulsory measures. Since the launch of the Davies report, progress on improving the gender balance on UK boards has been slow. According to the 30% club \u2013 a group of chairmen voluntarily committed to bringing more women onto UK boards \u2013 only 15% of FTSE 100 board directorships are now held by women. While the ratio of female appointments has doubled over the last few years, it is still only 27%. Looking beyond the FTSE 100, there is little evidence of significant progress in closing the gender gap. EIRIS data shows that 46% of UK companies listed on the FTSE All Share Index have no women on the board, whereas 15% of north American companies in the FTSE All World Developed Index have no women on the board, and in the Asia Pacific region the figure is 73%. Gender representation forms part of a wider focus on board effectiveness and diversity, which encompasses other features including age, ethnicity, background, education and experience. Increased diversity (including gender balance) not only better represents the staff in a company but also its clients, customer base, supply chain and potentially the different regions across which it operates. Carrot or stick?  While a growing number of companies and investors acknowledge that greater board diversity is a good thing, opinions differ as to how best to achieve this. Some argue for quotas to force UK companies to put a minimum number of women on boards. They point to the rise in female representation at board level in countries such as Norway and France, which has occurred subsequent to quotas being introduced in these countries. However, others argue that quotas undermine the principle of equality, are patronising to women and can result in situations whereby women are appointed as mere figures-heads who take on multiple boardrooms to fill quotas. Instead, they argue for a more business-led approach whereby directors are appointed on merit and business leaders take affirmative action in moving voluntarily towards a better gender diversity. As the debate continues, attention is focused on whether or not women on boards may create value for shareholders, or put another way, to what extent is gender diversity a financially significant issue? A forthcoming study conducted by academics from the Centre for Responsible Banking &amp; Finance of the University of St Andrews and the Principles for Responsible Investment Academic Network sets out to explore this. Focusing on more than 1,500 companies from 26 developed countries, over a 90-month period, the study combines data from EIRIS that categorises companies according to the percentage of women on their board with financial performance data. At the global level, larger companies are found to have more women on their boards, probably due to their high visibility and consequently outside pressure for greater diversity. Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Spain and Switzerland do not have any companies that have more than 33% women on their boards. Additionally, no Greek, Irish or Portuguese company has more than 20% women on its board of directors. On the other hand, the Scandinavian countries of Finland, Norway and Sweden do not have any listed company belonging to the lower category (ie no female representation at board level). Globally, a value-weighted portfolio of those companies with more than 33% women on boards of directors is found to generate significant positive excess financial returns. In the US, those companies with more than 33% of women on the board are found to outperform market and investment style benchmarks. In Greece and Italy, the situation looks less promising for businesswomen, as those companies with no women on the board perform well. While there are other factors that may account for positive and negative returns, the study&apos;s findings tend to support initiatives that bring women on corporate boards in developed countries. However, it is important to note that female directors are also likely to add value in many qualitative ways, which may not be discernible directly in the short term. It&apos;s clear that a greater impetus is needed if real progress is to be made in tackling gender inequality. Investors are ideally placed to challenge the composition and diversity of boards. Through direct engagement, shareholders can put pressure on companies to take affirmative action in moving towards a better gender balance at all levels in their organisations.

In Istanbul, the Ukrainian women&apos;s rights activists, Femen, staged a topless demonstration in bruise-like makeup to protest against domestic violence hours after a man in the Turkish capital shot dead a female relative because she left home following an argument with her husband. In Cairo, hundreds of women marched for equal rights and a gender balance in Egyptian politics. In France, Nicolas Sarkozy visited female workers at a bra factory whose jobs had been under threat, Carla Bruni was due to appear on a TV current affairs show to discuss women&apos;s rights and the Socialist frontrunner in the presidential race, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, promised feminist activists he would put equal numbers of women in government and improve equality. France suffers from a 25% average male-female pay gap. In Spain, there was controversy over plans by the conservative PP government to strike out the abortion-on-demand law passed by the previous Socialist administration. Justice minister Alberto Ruiz-Gallard\u00f3n who has pledged to change the law, claimed many Spanish women saw their &quot;right to be a mother violated&quot; by social pressure. &quot;We don&apos;t need protectors, saviours or spiritual fathers to tell us what is good or bad for us,&quot; said Socialist spokeswoman Elena Valenciano. A recent study showed Spanish women earn 22% less on average than their male peers. Brazil&apos;s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, announced tougher measures against men responsible for domestic abuse. One report claimed that 10 Brazilian women met violent deaths each day. She is reported to be close to approving a law fining companies that pay female employees less than men. Palestinian human rights groups and activists drew attention to the three-week hunger strike of Hana Shalabi who has been held in an Israeli prison without charge since being arrested on 16 February. Shalabi, 29, claims she was forcibly strip-searched and assaulted by a male Israeli soldier, beaten and blindfolded. Her six-month sentence of &quot;administrative detention&quot; has since been reduced to four months, but she says she will refuse food until freed. Shalabi, who was released from an earlier period of administrative detention last October, is one of seven Palestinian women currently held in Israeli jails. Israeli troops fired teargas at a woman&apos;s protest march over her detention in the West Bank. About 500 women also marched in Gaza. Not even International Women&apos;s Day, normally a maudlin holiday devoted to flowers and chocolates, was safe from the newly politicised atmosphere in Russia, coming just days after Vladimir Putin&apos;s win in the presidential election. Dozens of activists spent the day picketing police headquarters in Moscow, calling for the release of two members of the feminist punk collective Pussy Riot. Maria Alyokhin and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were arrested on the eve of the election for a raucous performance inside Moscow&apos;s main cathedral and could face up to seven years in jail on charges of hooliganism. The two women, both mothers of young children, have started a hunger strike. In Afghanistan, analysts and activists have been preoccupied by a statement issued last week by the country&apos;s council of top clerics, suggesting the implementation of guidelines for women that hark back to Taliban-era restrictions, such as strict segregation of all work and education and a ban on travelling without a male guardian. It heightens worries that, as the west prepares to leave and the government seeks to negotiate some kind of peace deal with insurgents, women&apos;s rights will become a bargaining chip. Women across south-east Asia faced disappointing news. While Thailand and the Philippines tied as holding the highest number of women in senior management positions (at 39%, they rank second in the world behind Russia), the number of women in senior positions across south-east Asia decreased from an average 36% in 2009 to 32% in 2012, according to the latest research from business group Grant Thornton.

I will be open about this. I&apos;m always a little loth to take at face value some of the surveys taken by organisations that have singularly failed in the past to do this.

But the Guardian revealed last year that the coalition government had decided to drop the measure, after only 109,000 people were added to the figures. Coe said that his organising committee was not responsible for delivering the legacy, but that he would keep the pressure on politicians to deliver it after the Games. &quot;I don&apos;t want this to sound like this is not my job, but actually it isn&apos;t.

It will come together in a proper and orderly way but it comes together at the end of the project. I don&apos;t think we should be coy or naive about that. Security is what it needs to be and has to be proportionate,&quot; he said. &quot;The nature of it is that initial work does take place but it takes place when you&apos;re bringing a mass of information to it.&quot; Coe also defended the ticketing system that has come under fire ahead of the final batch of tickets going on sale next month. &quot;Given the extraordinary scale of the project, we&apos;ve had moments when we&apos;re really working hard to make sure it was working as wanted it,&quot; he said. &quot;But on balance when we get remaining 4m tickets across the line it will have been tough exercise but we will have achieved what we set out to in a very sensible way.&quot; Sport England said: &quot;Active People is a robust survey that provides the official statistics for measuring sports participation across the country and in a huge range of sports. The survey is also used by the Department of Health and local authorities to track participation in physical activity at the local level and by the Department for Transport to monitor levels of participation in cycling. We are currently reviewing how we will measure participation under our new strategy, both to capture the number of 14- and 15-year-olds taking part and to ensure that we continue to reflect participation by all sections of society, including those without a landline.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/10/london-2012-20-weeks-to-go", "sentences": ["Coach confident, but Thorpe isn&apos;t Australia&apos;s head swimming coach, Leigh Nugent, has tipped Ian Thorpe, who ended his four-year retirement last February, to cause a shock at the national trials in Adelaide by qualifying for the Games despite a string of poor performances since his comeback in Singapore in November."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-10T22:55:01Z", "title": "London 2012 countdown: 20 weeks to go", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics 2012: swimming", "Olympics 2012: wrestling", "Olympics 2012: rowing", "Rowing", "Sport", "Swimming", "Wrestling", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Coach confident, but Thorpe isn&apos;t Australia&apos;s head swimming coach, Leigh Nugent, has tipped Ian Thorpe, who ended his four-year retirement last February, to cause a shock at the national trials in Adelaide by qualifying for the Games despite a string of poor performances since his comeback in Singapore in November.

My children are my flesh and blood; they are the reason I work so hard, but they are also making a sacrifice because it is hard to grow up without your parents at your side. When they are ill, you want to be there with them, but you can only send money to pay the hospital bills. I first worked as a domestic worker in Singapore, but the salary was very low, so I tried Hong Kong, yet there I had an abusive employer so I returned to the Philippines. I sold food from 4am every day, but it wasn&apos;t enough to meet our needs, so I worked until midnight as a bookkeeper. I never saw my kids, and I couldn&apos;t save any money. When they were ill, I didn&apos;t have the money to pay for their treatment. So I had no choice but to leave them again and find another job abroad to give them a decent life. That is how I ended up going back to Hong Kong. My last employers in Hong Kong moved to London and brought me with them. I didn&apos;t know my rights at that time \u2013 my salary was very low, the hours were long, and my employer was controlling. When I was allowed to have days off, I met other domestic workers who told me that in the UK I have the right to change employer \u2013 and I fled. I now have a supportive and respectful employer whose child I look after. I also chair the self-help union group Justice 4 Domestic Workers (J4DW), in conjunction with the Unite union and NGOs. Yet every Sunday when our members meet I witness the effects of abuse; a domestic worker arrives with bruises and marks looking shy and anxious. We try and make her understand that she is safe and that she can find a new employer who will treat her as human being and pay her a fair salary. I don&apos;t know what we will say to domestic workers who arrive under the new rules. J4DW turns three years old in a few weeks, and the past few months have been incredibly stressful. We know what it is like to work around the clock constantly in fear, humiliated for any little mistake, and for our wages to be withheld so that we cannot even feed our families \u2013 and we do not want others to go through this. We did everything we could to raise our voices to the UK government before it made this decision. We wrote to our MPs and demonstrated in front of the House of Lords. It wasn&apos;t easy: we only have one day off a week, and many of us never had the chance to finish school so, although we are learning English, writing responses and letters is still difficult. The right to change employer is a very important protection for domestic workers, it allows us the chance to say no to abuse. The government says it will make sure our employers sign contracts with us before we come to the UK, but if we lose our visas as soon as we challenge our employers, how will we enforce this? All of us came into the UK with written contracts, but most of us were either never given a copy or we signed it without a chance to read it first. Many of us have had out passports confiscated and held by our employers. Later, when things became too much, many of us fled \u2013 not knowing where we would go \u2013 in fear and without clothes, passports or money. Last year the UK was one of the few countries to abstain from supporting an International Labour Organisation convention on protection for domestic workers, claiming there were already good safeguards in place. Now, six months later, these protections have been removed. This year, as the UK celebrates the Olympics and the Queen&apos;s Jubilee, for us domestic workers it is a return to Victorian-era slavery. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/mar/12/prudential-brazil-reports", "sentences": ["We point to the net fund flows in Prudential&apos;s two largest markets Hong Kong and Singapore, which have been weak, as evidence of this.

Last year was the worst of Hamilton&apos;s five seasons in F1, his wins in China, Germany and Abu Dhabi overshadowed by mistakes in Monaco, Canada, Belgium, Singapore and India. But the 2008 F1 champion prepares for Sunday&apos;s opener in Melbourne having examined in painful detail all his errors of last year, while in the US in the winter. &quot;I did that over there,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;I analysed races and watched some of them, went through different graphs of race traces, tried to see where my strengths were \u2013 the races where I was quite strong and the races where I can improve. &quot;And there&apos;s definitely quite a few where I can improve. It&apos;s more, I guess, all about being in the right place at the right time. In Malaysia, for example, I flat-spotted a tyre which then led to me having to use the wrong set of tyres which then led to me running seventh which then led to me having a penalty with Fernando [Alonso]. It&apos;s just trying to avoid those pitfalls.&quot; There were, of course, more than just driver errors from Hamilton last season. He risked alienating himself from his McLaren team by being too critical of the car and casting covetous eyes in the direction of Red Bull in Montreal. Some were concerned that his celebrity lifestyle, including frequent trips to Los Angeles to see his girlfriend, the pop star Nicole Scherzinger, were distracting him from his work. But the more focused Hamilton will attempt to win a second world title this year \u2013 and if he gets it right he is still Vettel&apos;s most plausible challenger, for he is the most obviously gifted driver on the grid. He said: &quot;I hope that it&apos;s a new phase, a new stage in my life, but the only way to know that is from the results. I really can&apos;t predict what&apos;s going to happen. Every year you prepare yourself in a certain way and then you get to the first race and lots of things happen after that. &quot;I just need to take each race as it comes and keep my head screwed on and my feet on the ground for the whole year. I&apos;d love to be sitting here with three world championships under my belt. But it&apos;s not the case. But I definitely don&apos;t regret what&apos;s happened and the experiences I&apos;ve had. I think I&apos;m better for it and hopefully that will help with future races.&quot; He admits that he had personal issues to deal with when he ran into problems \u2013 first with other drivers and then with stewards \u2013 in Monaco. &quot;I had a lot going on in my life at the time,&quot; he said. &quot;If you aren&apos;t thinking clearly your decisions are overshadowed, you can&apos;t make clear decisions.&quot; Crucially, Hamilton&apos;s challenge also depends on the quality of his car, which has been uneven in recent years. &quot;If I&apos;m really honest I&apos;m pretty sure that if the car was the same as it was in 2007 and 2008 I think you&apos;d be seeing a different person sitting here, but that wasn&apos;t the case. &quot;In 2009 I wasn&apos;t too keen to get into it. But the last couple of years the cars were not too bad \u2013 but this one does feel better than it did this time last year. I hope that counts for something.&quot; Hamilton will be one of six world champions taking part in Sunday&apos;s race. &quot;Winning a world championship like this one, with so many great world champions out there \u2013 it&apos;ll definitely be one of the most valuable,&quot; he said. The enthusiasm of the boy racer is still there, he says \u2013 and he went to some lengths to prove it by taking F1 journalists for a white-knuckle ride in the McLaren MP4-12C GT3 at Dunsfold Aerodrome. &quot;I definitely still have the same excitement as when I started racing. Even today, messing around in that car [the McLaren], I was still very much a kid with a new toy,&quot; Hamilton added. &quot;I can&apos;t wait to get back into the car. I enjoyed all the testing and each day I wanted to do more and more laps, but we ran out of time. I&apos;m really looking forward to getting back out and racing, especially in Australia, which is one of my favourite places.&quot; \u2022 Check out the Guardian&apos;s Formula One season guide here"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/13/wifi-mobile-4g", "sentences": ["Among the major markets, only Japan and Singapore show an even split between networks."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-13T12:35:00Z", "title": "Wi-Fi is drawing power from the mobile phone mast", "tags": ["Technology", "Mobile phones", "Business", "Telecoms", "Telecommunications industry", "Vodafone", "Wi-Fi", "Internet", "Smartphones"], "article": "From Norwich to New York, hotspots are pulsing on every street. A messy urban patchwork of Wi-Fi signals is being gradually woven into a blanket of coverage which may soon be equal to the signals pumped out by mobile phone masts.  Wireless Fidelity (a non-scientific term invented by marketing people) is considered easy to hack, and the signals can often be weak, or password protected. But they are usually free and once in, they work at speeds well above the average mobile connection.  Even for phone users, Wi-Fi has become the most popular way of accessing the internet. So why are mobile phone companies planning to spend billions connecting us to the internet via 4G phone masts?  Vodafone says creating its 4G network in Europe will cost \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn). New evidence has reached my inbox which fuels a growing suspicion that it could be about to waste a lot of money on what may one day become a niche technology. In the UK in January 2012, only 19% of all internet traffic on smartphones was transmitted by a mobile network, according to researchers at Informa. They worked with Mobidia, whose app measures how much of your data allowance your phone has used up. The information was drawn from about a third of Mobidia&apos;s 600,000 users. Globally, Mobidia found 70% of smartphone internet traffic is carried by Wi-Fi. In the US, the total is two thirds. The picture is similar in Hong Kong, Germany and Spain. Among the major markets, only Japan and Singapore show an even split between networks. Informa says this is helped by the fact that they already have superfast mobile broadband, but more importantly because customers are sold generously sized or unlimited data plans at competitive prices. Informa analyst Thomas Wehmeier, author of Understanding Today&apos;s Smartphone User, published in February, said:  The expansion of Wi-Fi into hundreds of millions of private homes and offices around the world, the deployment of more than 1m public Wi-Fi hot spots by the end of 2011 and the growth of a vast and mature ecosystem built of thousands of devices has established Wi-Fi as the most heavily used wireless technology in the world in terms of volume of data transmitted ... Wi-Fi is the primary form of connectivity for the overwhelming majority of users and it is apparent that Wi-Fi has become firmly entrenched in day-to-day usage.  Informa last year forecast 5.8m open to all Wi-Fi hostpots worldwide by 2015, provided by public bodies such as town councils. BT Group&apos;s own network, not strictly public but widely available, now numbers 3.5m. It consists mostly of domestic Wi-Fi signals which home owners have agreed to share with other BT customers who might be passing within range.  Even mobile operators, conscious that their own masts will soon be creaking under the strain of data traffic, are moving into Wi-Fi. At O2, they have promised a network of 15,000 sites, in public places like coffee shops, open to customers and non customers. Analysts Thomas Seitz and Jerry Dellis at Jefferies bank believe Wi-Fi is not as previously billed just a useful offload or back-up technology for mobile networks. Rather, it is threatening to eat their lunch.  We believe evidence continues to mount suggesting Wi-Fi should no longer be viewed solely as a complement to mobile networks, but increasingly should be looked at as a potential disruptive substitute. Wi-Fi is not just an offload avenue for wireless data traffic, but in fact may be the primary means by which wireless data is consumed. Given that the bull case for mobile operators hinges on capturing revenue from the exponential growth in data volumes, we believe these trends need to be monitored closely. In our view, how the relationship between the mobile networks and Wi-Fi evolves could be a key determinant in the investment attractiveness of the wireless services sector.  In the UK and elsewhere, operators have mostly stopped selling unlimited data at a fixed price. We now have allowances. When they are breached, heavy penalty charges kick in. Dellis and Seitz argue this change is driving smartphone users on to Wi-Fi.  It is a grassroots technology, promoted and funded by a ragged coalition of trade bodies, cafe owners, universities, town councils, entrepreneurs and the occasional telecoms company. Despite this, it is gaining ground against lavishly marketed mobile networks. Wi-Fi is triumphing against the odds, suggesting it is the natural choice for carrying most internet traffic, even on mobile devices. How often, outside of a car or a train, do we need an internet connection on the move? It will be Wi-Fi that finally provides a phone signal for passengers on the London Underground, with the service due to be live for the Olympic games. Of course we still need 4G networks. A signal that works without having to fiddle about with passwords is always going to be worth paying more money for. For many rural householders, whose homes are difficult to reach with fibre cables, the technology offers the best chance of a fast internet signal. When it comes to keeping cities connected, however, Wi-Fi is slowly draining the power of the mobile phone mast."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/13/online-teacher-training-distance-learning", "sentences": ["I was living in Singapore at the time and had signed up to do my teaching diploma."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-13T14:00:46Z", "title": "What's on your online training wishlist?", "tags": ["Tefl", "Teacher training"], "article": "My first encounter with online learning, or distance learning as it used to be known, was more than 15 years ago. At the beginning of each month I would wait for a thick brown envelope to arrive with a fat stack of papers to read and at the end of the month I would fax assignments to London to be marked. I was living in Singapore at the time and had signed up to do my teaching diploma. A year after finishing the diploma, I signed up to do an MEd in educational technology and ELT, which took the next five years of my life to complete. The pace of change over that period was dramatic and by the time I started my final module I was downloading my materials, working in groups in an online virtual learning environment and developing multimedia materials to email in for evaluation. The evolution of training has continued to accelerate, and broadband and web 2.0 applications have opened up potential for varied social and computer-mediated interactions based around all kinds of mixed-media content. But is this what teachers want and how do we best structure these into our courses? These are questions I wanted to find some answers to in my role developing online courses at Bell, the UK-based EFL provider, so last month we launched an online research questionnaire to explore perceptions of online teacher development courses. Over a 14-day period we collected 780 responses. One of the first surprises is that, despite the fact that over 70% of respondents had in excess of 10 or even 20 years&apos; teaching experience and most had postgraduate qualifications, many were still keen to do online development courses and around 60% had already done some form of online development and felt that it had been successful for them. It also seems that computers and online courses won&apos;t be putting trainers out of work, as more than 70% of respondents claimed that they would rather pay for a course with a tutor than have a free course without one. In fact more than 30% claimed that they would be willing to pay more for a course with more tutor contact and would be more likely to sign up for a course based on the reputation of the tutor. It was also very heartening to discover that the majority of respondents were motivated to take courses because they wanted new ideas and to develop their teaching rather than for certification or career enhancement opportunities. When it came to looking at the structure of courses and the kinds of interactions teachers want, shorter courses of less than three or even two months seemed by far the most popular with teachers preferring short bursts of learning of not more that 30 to 45 minutes online at any one time. Teachers also want their learning activities to be social, with more than 70% preferring group-orientated tasks rather than tutor-led tasks. Teachers also want tasks to be practical and based around their own classroom practice. Of the different types of activity offered within the questionnaire, the least popular of these was the traditional written assignment. Teachers seem to be much keener to share and discuss elements of their teaching practice together than have the more traditional form of top-down input and assessment. Many teachers also stated that one of the great advantages of online courses was the potential they offered to build online networks with contacts through peer interaction. Again, when it comes to assessment the role of the tutor seems to be paramount and most teachers wanted a course that was continually assessed by the tutor, with only 20% preferring a formal exam. Although certification and examinations don&apos;t seem to be so important for them, it does seem like teachers do want the courses they do to have some form of accreditation or quality control and these were cited as being two of the most important factors they considered when looking for a course. Teachers \u2013 and especially EFL teachers \u2013 come in for a lot of criticism. We are continually hearing stories of teachers stuck to the course book, unwilling to adapt to new ideas, methods or technologies, but what emerges most strongly from this research is the degree of commitment teachers have to their own professional development. Of the teachers who responded to this survey only 4.3% stated that they would not be prepared to pay for an online course. In a profession where higher qualifications and development carry so little financial reward from employers, these results show the dedication and commitment of ELT professionals.

It&apos;s probably the best place in the world to kick off a new season: the people are friendly and passionate, the weather is fantastic and the track always seems to produce eventful racing. The best part of the circuit is probably the S-bend section at the end of the back straight: it&apos;s super-fast and requires real precision to get it just right.  Behind the BBC mic David Coulthard  Not a classic from a driver challenge point of view but it&apos;s a tricky little place and it gets your attention in the middle sector because, if you make a mistake, you&apos;re in a wall. That&apos;s the sort of street part of the track. A nice place to start the season.

It&apos;s hot and rains every day but the question is when and how much? It will be a tricky one. Circuit-wise you&apos;ve got everything in there; Turn 14 requires you to brake the car while you&apos;re still turning into the corner, which makes it quite challenging. Generally the overseas races are special, as you go there a few days earlier than usual, so you get to see different things.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  A great challenge for the drivers \u2013 not only a demanding track with the humidity and temperature but on a par with Barcelona in terms of challenging the car at low, medium and high speed. It&apos;s also right by the airport, so it&apos;s a piece of piss to get in and out on a Sunday.

Shanghai&apos;s a good circuit for racing because there&apos;s a 1km straight followed by a first-gear hairpin, so you can really be late on the brakes and pass somebody; with Kers and now DRS it&apos;s even more exciting. The city itself is pretty incredible, too. It&apos;s huge and pulsating, like something out of a sci-fi movie.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  I think they designed the first corner to show a Chinese character for yin and yang and any circuit that features a corner based on looking like a Chinese character, that&apos;s got to be going at it the wrong way. So the opening corner is not at all in balance, it&apos;s crap.  Bahrain \u25b6 Sakhir \u25b6 22 April \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 57 Lap length 3.36 miles 2010 winner F Alonso \u2022 bahraingp.com \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 5.30pm Expert view Heikki Kovalainen  Bahrain holds great memories for our team as it was our first race back in 2010 where we got both cars across the finish line. The track surface is pretty sandy as it&apos;s not used a lot, so the Friday sessions are always a waiting game while the track is cleaned up. The heat isn&apos;t an issue. I train hard to be able to cope with all the conditions and, as it&apos;s a dry heat, it&apos;s not a tough race physically. But it is one of the longer lap times on the calendar, so you have to make sure you keep pushing the whole way round.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  It&apos;s not a classic grand prix track in terms of any single corners standing out as being a real yahoo for the drivers but unfortunately the Bahrain Grand Prix is now more about the political statement than it is about the race. Personally I think that is a shame.

The last sector used to be very, very quick and now, for the last few years, we&apos;ve had a slow chicane which breaks the rhythm of the lap up a bit, but I enjoy driving the car on this track. It&apos;s one of the best races of the season in terms of atmosphere because of the support Fernando gets. I love the drivers&apos; parade when we see the fireworks in the crowd going off and they sing songs, too. It is always entertaining.   David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Great. Physically demanding and the benchmark in F1 for all-round car and driver performance. But it doesn&apos;t always offer the best racing, for sure, not helped by recent changes when they put a chicane into the last two corners because of the need to slow the cars down.  Monaco \u25b6 Monte Carlo \u25b6 27 May \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 78 Lap length 2.08 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 formula1monaco.com \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Sebastian Vettel  It&apos;s remarkable to drive an F1 car around Monaco. It&apos;s a unique track and a unique challenge for the driver. In Monaco you have to push as hard as you do on a usual race track but the smallest mistake can bring a big penalty. Grid position is very important there and can determine your race as, traditionally, overtaking in Monaco is very tricky. Managing the traffic during qualifying in Monaco is also a big challenge. As an event it&apos;s one of the highlights of the year.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  The ultimate challenge for a grand prix. If you took someone there today and said: &quot;We&apos;d like to do a grand prix around the streets of this principality,&quot; they&apos;d think you&apos;d gone mad. Blink at the wrong time and you crash the car and you&apos;re out. It is fantastic.

Montreal is one of the nicest, most relaxed cities we visit and the early-summer date always seems perfect. The circuit is really old-school \u2013 it&apos;s penned by concrete barriers and there&apos;s little room to make mistakes. The nature of the track really sparks unpredictable and exciting racing, whether it&apos;s wet or dry. Taking the lead on the last lap last year will remain one of the greatest moments of my F1 career.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Another great track because it has a street-circuit feel, with the skyline of Montreal in the background. A unique challenge because of its low downforce, high speeds and tight chicanes. Braking from 200mph gets your attention. Trust me.  Europe \u25b6 Valencia \u25b6 24 June \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 57 Lap length 3.37 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 valenciastreetcircuit.com \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Lewis Hamilton  People tend to overlook Valencia but make no mistake: this is a tough venue. The track itself is one long series of corners \u2013 you never really get a chance for a break \u2013 so it&apos;s extremely tiring in the cockpit. Add in the searing summer temperatures and you have all the ingredients for a really exhausting weekend \u2013 it&apos;s a race that requires special preparation. It&apos;s a difficult place for passing, so qualifying is all-important. Then it&apos;s all about hanging in there on Sunday afternoon.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Valencia is a city leveraging the attraction of F1, its media and positive publicity, as a priority rather than creating a grand prix track that will be challenging or interesting for the drivers and teams. Not an interesting racetrack. Lovely city, though.  Britain \u25b6 Silverstone \u25b6 8 July \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 52 Lap length 3.66 miles 2011 winner F Alonso \u2022 silverstone.co.uk \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Sebastian Vettel  One of my favourite tracks and not just because it&apos;s 30km from our factory. The fans in Britain are special. They support their own people, of course, but they really know so much about our sport and are really fair about acknowledging performance and achievement. The extreme bend combinations on the track make it a real pleasure for the drivers. There are fast corners and often we have to react to the tricky weather conditions. Copse, Maggots, Becketts and Chapel are four of the best corners in Formula One.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Has retained, through all the changes, its high-speed essence. Scored a bit of an own goal by putting in a pitlane that&apos;s lower than the pit wall, so people can&apos;t see in. That said, Silverstone has been created anew and drivers love it because it&apos;s all high-speed, yahoo stuff.  Germany \u25b6 Hockenheim \u25b6 22 July \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 67 Lap length 2.84 miles 2010 winner F Alonso \u2022 hockenheimring.net \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 5.30pm Expert view Heikki Kovalainen  Germany&apos;s always a good race. Hockenheim&apos;s usually hot and the fans make sure there&apos;s a great atmosphere. For the drivers it&apos;s cool; we can see all the fans packed into the stands and it looks pretty hardcore. The circuit itself is good. You can overtake at the end of the long straight at the hairpin but there aren&apos;t many other places where you can get past. It&apos;s relatively hard on tyres and in the past the heat has made the tyres blister but that won&apos;t be an issue this year; it&apos;ll be about managing the degradation.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  A shadow of its former glory \u2013 the old Hockenheim was a great challenge. Nonetheless the stadium section is like an amphitheatre. You get 80-odd thousand drunken Germans blowing the klaxons and drinking beer. Not a classic for lots of overtaking but deserves its place.  Hungary \u25b6 Budapest \u25b6 29 July \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 70 Lap length 2.72 miles 2011 winner J Button \u2022 hungaroring.hu \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 5.30pm Expert view Sebastian Vettel  One of the hardest races. It can get very hot in the cockpit, which means we lose a lot of body fluid. There are a lot of bumps on the track and, because it has hardly any straights, you have almost no chance to &apos;rest&apos;. There are three extremely slow corners and it&apos;s hard to overtake there while on the start and finish lines we reach a top speed of 315kph [195mph]. We get a good shaking through the first corner due to the bumps; it&apos;s really the only place where you can overtake.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Great track because it&apos;s just relentless. It&apos;s corner, corner, corner \u2013 like Monaco without the armco barriers. Physically tough, mentally tough, difficult to overtake but that just puts a premium on the drivers in qualifying. Good crowd, lots of Finns, lots of Poles.  Belgium \u25b6 Spa \u25b6 2 September \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 44 Lap length 4.35 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 spa-francorchamps.be \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Jenson Button  Every driver loves coming to Spa. It&apos;s one of the few truly historic venues we visit and a place that commands the respect of every person in Formula One. There&apos;s so much about the place to love: Eau Rouge and Pouhon are two of the best corners on the calendar but the whole track just flows beautifully from one corner to the next. The weather is unique: one side of the circuit can be dry while the other is pouring with rain \u2013 so winning here is a special achievement.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Great track. Drivers, of course, love it. Very challenging: high speed, uphill, downhill, unpredictable weather. It just has your heart pumping and your adrenaline absolutely off the scale. That&apos;s all there is to it. Great track.  Italy \u25b6 Monza \u25b6 9 September \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 53 Lap length 3.60 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 monzanet.it \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 5.30pm Expert view Sebastian Vettel  Monza holds incredibly special memories for me, as it&apos;s where I scored my first-ever F1 win, with Toro Rosso in 2008. The circuit is one of the most challenging. It includes long straights where we reach more than 320kph, making it the fastest track. It is not physically demanding but it is not easy. Because of the straights we drive with less rear wing, so the car can be more unstable; accelerating out of Parabolica is a balancing act and the smallest mistake could mean the car slipping into the gravel trap.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  When you disappear out the back and see the old banking it gives you a sense of its historic place in F1. The Italian crowd is incredible \u2013 the passion and the energy \u2013 and, although it doesn&apos;t always get the best racing, with DRS on the long straights it was better last year.  Singapore \u25b6 Marina Bay \u25b6 23 Sep \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 61 Lap length 3.15 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 singaporegp.sg \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Lewis Hamilton  I think the idea of racing grand prix cars at night is absolutely fantastic \u2013 and the organisers in Singapore have done an incredible job in just a couple of years to make their race one of the most famous, iconic and desirable venues on the F1 calendar. This is another tough track: the heat and humidity are intense, even in the relative cool of the night, and the track never stops turning. It&apos;s incredibly bumpy too, so your body gets rattled for two solid hours. It&apos;s a great challenge \u2013 I love it.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Wonderful. Incredible backdrop, works well as a night-time venue. Physically tough - I know the drivers of late have asked for the race to be shortened, which obviously the FIA haven&apos;t done, and I&apos;m glad they haven&apos;t because grand prix racing should be demanding.  Japan \u25b6 Suzuka \u25b6 7 October \u25b6 7am \u2022 Laps 53 Lap length 3.61 miles 2011 winner J Button \u2022 mobilityland.co.jp/english/suzuka \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 2pm Expert view Jenson Button  Suzuka is one of the few legendary venues on the Formula One calendar. There&apos;s a lot of history to the place: it&apos;s where Senna and Prost had some brilliant battles and it&apos;s a track where you can really feel the ghosts of the past. The barriers are very close to the track in some places and the corners are tricky \u2013 get it wrong and you can easily crash and destroy a corner of the car. Japan feels like my second home, so winning there in 2011 was a special moment for me.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Absolutely fantastic. Any driver that goes there for the first time, their eyes are out on stalks. The sequence behind the pits \u2013 fast, narrow. Watch Senna&apos;s qualifying lap in the McLaren. Incredible. Lots of history. Middle of nowhere, pain in the arse to get to but just brilliant.  Korea \u25b6 Yeongam \u25b6 14 October \u25b6 7am \u2022 Laps 55 Lap length 3.49 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 koreangp.kr \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Sebastian Vettel  The circuit is very demanding and quite tight, especially at the pitlane entry. You actually drive almost blind along the wall and, if the car in front of you drives into the pit, you have to get out of the way quickly. It is effectively made up of three parts: the first reminds me of Turkey, the second stretch has long straights like Monza and the third has tight corners like a town track. It&apos;s important to find a rhythm. I find corner 11, which has two apexes, the most interesting.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Another exercise in ticking an advertising box. More to do with attracting media exposure than it is about the circuit. The location&apos;s not great and, although the drivers talk fondly about it, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to go down as a classic grand prix track.  India \u25b6 Delhi \u25b6 28 October \u25b6 9.30am \u2022 Laps 60 Lap length 3.19 miles 2011 winner S Vettel \u2022 jaypeesports.com \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 2pm Expert view Jenson Button  The Buddh International track felt like more an old, undiscovered track from F1&apos;s past when we raced there for the first time last year. It&apos;s fast, flowing and really satisfying \u2013 a bit like Spa but with all the facilities of a 21st-century venue \u2013 and, uniquely, features huge, wide-open approaches to the hairpins, which makes defending from another car particularly tricky. It&apos;s a good idea and works well. India&apos;s an amazing place \u2013 I loved the race last year \u2013 and I really hope the sport gains support.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Drivers speak favourably of the track. They put a bit of undulation in there, which gives a different feeling in the car. The venue looks a bit pieced together, although it does work; it&apos;s nice to be in India. I think the drivers like it which is always a good thing. You can&apos;t fake that.  Abu Dhabi \u25b6 Yas Marina \u25b6 4 Nov \u25b6 1pm \u2022 Laps 55 Lap length 3.45 miles 2011 winner L Hamilton \u2022 yasmarinacircuit.ae \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Sebastian Vettel  The track in Abu Dhabi is special. The race starts at dusk and finishes at night, which means we have to drive with special helmet visors. The other factor is that we drive anti-clockwise. The track&apos;s a bit like Singapore from the speed but the asphalt is smoother. There are two special features \u2013 one is the passage under the Yas Hotel, as where else can you drive under your room? The second is the pitlane exit. It&apos;s partly underground and feels like you&apos;re coming out of an underground parking garage.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  The racetrack&apos;s not the best but in terms of a venue for a sporting event and people moving around, for the teams and for the drivers, it works on many levels. But it will never be a classic grand prix track. That said, we&apos;ve had some interesting battles there.  USA \u25b6 Austin \u25b6 18 November \u25b6 7pm \u2022 Laps 56 Lap length 3.43 miles \u2022 circuitoftheamericas.com \u2022 Live Sky Highlights BBC 10.30pm Expert view David Coulthard  The guys involved have come at it the right way. It&apos;s built on the side of a hill so there is natural undulation to try to replicate some of the classic corners from around the world. The Becketts sequence at Silverstone, Turn 8 in Turkey, a rise up to Turn 1 a bit like the old \u00d6sterreichring \u2013 they&apos;ve put in some incredible sections. Austin&apos;s a great town, young vibe. It&apos;s close to South America so it taps into support for P\u00e9rez and Maldonado. And, in case it&apos;s of interest, three of the last five playmates of the year have come from Austin.  The designer Hermann Tilke&apos;s verdict  The track is very good \u2013 it will be a serious challenge. Bernie Ecclestone, [promoter] Tavo Hellmund and motorcycle racing legend Kevin Schwantz came up with a lot of suggestions. We put the best ideas together.  Brazil \u25b6 Interlagos \u25b6 25 November \u25b6 4pm \u2022 Laps 71 Lap length 2.68 miles 2011 winner M Webber \u2022 gpbrasil.com.br \u2022 Live Sky &amp; BBC Expert view Lewis Hamilton  I&apos;ll never forget my weekend in S\u00e3o Paulo when I won the world title back in 2008. To go out and race for your life on such a historic track \u2013 and with 100,000 Brazilians all watching your every move \u2013 was an intense and exhausting situation. Motorsport, and F1 in particular, means such a lot to the Brazilian crowd and their passion lights up the whole arena. For me this place will always be associated with Ayrton \u2013 it was his home crowd and will always be a special place for any F1 fan.  David Coulthard&apos;s verdict  Great track, anti-clockwise, pushes drivers to the limit. The paddock is like a shanty town in many respects but nobody minds because the atmosphere is great and the drivers love it \u2013 just goes to show you don&apos;t need incredible facilities for people to be passionate.

They&apos;ve won the past two championships but they aren&apos;t a pure breed, with Stewart Grand Prix and Jaguar Racing both in their lineage pre-2005. Adrian Newey recently told Autosport: &quot;We&apos;re still a relatively young team. We still occasionally make mistakes, which hopefully is like the swan that looks graceful on top but with a lot of action going on underneath.&quot; OK, he&apos;s talking about a bird, not a dog. But you get the idea. Best forgotten Sebastian Vettel blubbing like a toddler in the pits in 2007 while racing for sister outfit, Toro Rosso. He had worked his way up to third in the drenched Japanese GP and was set to take his and the team&apos;s first podium finish. Then he wiped out himself and the second-placed driver \u2013 his future team-mate Mark Webber, who said: &quot;It&apos;s kids \u2026 they fuck it all up.&quot; Bragging about Not since Ross Brawn and Jean Todt&apos;s heyday at Ferrari in the early noughties has Formula One seen as strong a technical/team boss pairing as Newey and Christian Horner. Puppet master Mark Webber can tell you. His cherubic rival \u2013 recently described by Sir Stirling Moss as a &quot;modern-day Fangio&quot; \u2013 wields more power than Woman B in Max Mosley&apos;s hotel room. They predict &quot;You can never take anything for granted,&quot; Horner said. &quot;We certainly don&apos;t underestimate the quality of our opponents but we&apos;re going into 2012 with a lot of determination to keep the two trophies in our cabinets.&quot; We predict The team&apos;s technical advantage may have been neutralised but Vettel&apos;s confidence and Newey&apos;s grey matter are a difficult combination to conquer. The drivers Sebastian Vettel 24 Germany In only two of 2011&apos;s 19 races did the German fail to make the podium \u2013 and he probably thinks he&apos;ll make it a clean sweep this year.

Fighting form There&apos;s little pre-season posturing from this squeaky clean contender, quietly hoping to lift their first belt since 2008. Have landed an early punch by being the only team to avoid the ugly step nose, with an elegant, featherweight car. Pedigree or mongrel? One of the few pure-bred teams, they carry the arrogant poise of a 45-year history that began with Bruce McLaren&apos;s Monaco debut in 1966 and which is undiluted through a dozen drivers&apos; championships. Best forgotten One of their inadequacies is an inability to rein in the behaviour of difficult drivers. From Alain Prost&apos;s and Ayrton Senna&apos;s bitter squabbling to Fernando Alonso&apos;s open disdain for his team, it can be like watching parents gape at their children brawling in a supermarket aisle. Hamilton&apos;s decline from national treasure to tax-exiled bad boy who has fallen out with several rivals, and his own dad, could be traced back to his mentor Ron Dennis taking a back seat. Bragging about In an era when England&apos;s national football squad struggle to muster an indigenous manager, the fact that Woking&apos;s finest have a pair of British drivers is almost quaint. Puppet master It used to be difficult to give Martin Whitmarsh the respect a team principal deserved \u2013 thanks to his aerospace background \u2013 and he took a while to earn his racing stripes. It&apos;s now impossible to imagine a bead of sweat breaking out on that smooth forehead. Ron who? They predict Lewis Hamilton&apos;s technical assessment: &quot;Last year we obviously had a lot of weight and a lot of downforce coming from the rear of the car. We were always struggling to balance it with trying to get enough front in. But I think this year it will be the other way round: we&apos;ll probably have too much front and be trying to find more rear.&quot; We predict The car may be pretty but it&apos;s far from aggressive. It could be no more merciless than a Bichon Frise in the traps at Wimbledon dog track.

Fighting form Given Ferrari&apos;s mean, ugly car and raw aggression, their opponents should be ducking the punches that come from the heavyweight of heavyweights, who have failed to knock out the opposition since their last drivers&apos; title in 2007. The technical team had been told to abandon the usual conservative approach and design a more radical car but a troubled testing programme suggests they ignored the sat nav and headed down a blind alley. At least they&apos;ve spotted it early. Pedigree or mongrel? Formula One&apos;s oldest family, a championship contender since 1950, with more romance than a Mills &amp; Boon could muster. If only they could find an Italian driver capable of delivering the title. Best forgotten The fact that after two dismal seasons Ferrari are still paying Felipe Massa to drive. Sure, it&apos;s not pretty to find a spring stuck in your face, as the Brazilian did in 2009&apos;s Hungarian GP accident, but he&apos;s never regained his form and Ferrari need to admit it. Fernando Alonso deserves a better wingman \u2013 and the team are going to struggle to take another championship without one. Bragging about Fielding the first solely pullrod-suspended Formula One car for 10 years. Puppet master British export Rob Smedley is so revered he has his own fan club. This endearing Teessider almost lifted Massa to title glory in 2008 and, if anyone can get the best of the Brazilian, it&apos;s his race engineer. They predict &quot;I am disappointed by our performance level at the moment,&quot; said technical director Pat Fry following testing. When asked if he thought podium finishes unlikely he added: &quot;Yes, but I am always slightly pessimistic.&quot; We predict They may have a car that looks aggressive, the imperative to win and, in Alonso, the man with the steeliest determination to beat Sebastian Vettel, but Fry and his squadron of boffins need to work some magic, and quickly. It would help if Massa snapped out of his trance. The drivers Fernando Alonso 30 Spain Arrogant and outstanding, at just 30 the Spaniard is an elder statesman of the 2012 field and deserves to notch up a hat-trick of titles.

There is muscle in the technical department, even if it is unlikely to knock out all the opposition. Pedigree or mongrel? Has as much breeding as the stray dog Michael Schumacher famously rescued from Brazil. In 2009 Mercedes bought Brawn GP, which had been created by Ross from the ashes of Honda after their withdrawal. Before Honda the team were BAR and on and on. Best forgotten The failure of star signing Schumacher to win a race. The German may be indelibly linked with Ferrari, who forced his hand into early retirement at the end of 2006, but the chance to return in what is tantamount to a national Formula One squad proved too tempting. A three-year break though and Mercedes&apos; inability to capitalise on Brawn GP&apos;s exceptional title-winning year have left him with a best-place finish of fourth. Bragging about Nico Rosberg. If you can routinely out-qualify and out-race the man with the most victories, titles, pole positions and fastest laps in Formula One history then you must be doing something right. Puppet master Fishing aficionado Ross Brawn is another northern engineer to rise to the top of the sport (see also Rob Smedley). He masterminded Schuey&apos;s successes at Benetton and Ferrari and his risky decision to buy out Honda F1 delivered the ultimate ego-boost when Jenson Button won the title in 2009. They predict &quot;The W03 is a clear step forward over its predecessor,&quot; Brawn said. &quot;None of us are happy with a recurring fourth place but I am quietly confident, with the strength we have got, the resources we have got and the team we are building.&quot; We predict With new tech signings Aldo Costa (Ferrari) and Geoff Willis (Red Bull/Williams/Honda) Mercedes are clearly upping their game. Wins should be expected. The drivers Michael Schumacher 43 Germany Now 43, the record breaker has seen Barrichello and Trulli put out to pasture and is fighting a string of new champs decades younger.

Toleman, Benetton, Renault, Lotus \u2026 the family tree for this team is as convoluted as Spaghetti Junction. Yet leafy Oxfordshire has always been a base for the squad and this year&apos;s racer has been christened the E20 in honour of the number of grand prix cars designed and built at Enstone. Best forgotten Robert Kubica. If the Pole had not been sidelined since being badly injured in a two-bit rally in the middle of nowhere in February last year, then he and Kimi Raikkonen would make the most electric of team-mates. Bragging about Putting a Frenchman in a Renault. OK, so Romain Grosjean was born in Geneva (but he races under a French licence) and the team are not called Renault any more. Just think back to Ren\u00e9 Arnoux flipping the bird at nonsense orders; to Jean-Pierre Jabouille taking Renault&apos;s first victory (and the first in F1 for a turbocharged car) in 1979&apos;s epic French Grand Prix. Let&apos;s pray to the God of Breton sweaters that Grosjean can deliver a little of this magic. Puppet master Eric Boullier is the brains behind the operation, a technical boffin with a degree in building space ships, who got the team principal gig for Renault in 2010 without having ever worked in F1 (and he&apos;s only in his 30s). They predict &quot;The team are very nice people, very easy going,&quot; Raikkonen said. &quot;We will have fun.&quot; Uh-oh. This comes from a driver who was once found asleep and cuddled up to an inflatable dolphin outside a Spanish bar. We predict Having failed to win a race since its second title-winning season with Fernando Alonso in 2008, this team need to pull their finger out. With Raikkonen&apos;s natural talent to harness, they might just do that.

Bank-rolled by rupees but based at Silverstone, the team were born out of the short-lived Spyker but their tangled roots lie in Midland F1 and Jordan. Best forgotten The pain of Giancarlo Fisichella&apos;s second-place in the 2009 Belgian GP. Yes it was the team&apos;s first pole, points and podium finish (in only their second year of operation) but he was only one second behind the winner Kimi Raikkonen. One second! Even Ajax \u2013 Kimi&apos;s German shepherd \u2013 was egging Fisi on to win. Bragging about The fact that Paul di Resta is a bona fide team leader after one season in the sport. Hailing from the racing clan who have spawned IndyCar star Dario Franchitti, the 25-year-old regularly outpaced former team-mate Adrian Sutil (who had five seasons under his belt), scoring points in his first two races and finishing as top rookie. His sixth-place qualifying slot for the British GP meant he has been tipped as a champion. Puppet master Team principal Vijay Mallya is now the paddock&apos;s reigning party-hosting patriarch, following the exile of Flavio Briatore for race-fixing (he masterminded a crash in the 2008 Singapore GP). Vijay looks much too jolly to try anything like that. They predict Deputy team principal Bob Fernley said: &quot;I don&apos;t think Vijay will accept anything less than fifth. It&apos;s a good job we didn&apos;t finish fifth last year because Vijay would have wanted fourth.&quot; We predict Last season&apos;s sixth place was impressive and Mallya&apos;s bravery in waving goodbye to the experienced, but ineffectual, Sutil in favour of another exciting hotshot deserves to be rewarded.

Pedigree or mongrel? It wouldn&apos;t win Best in Show at Crufts but it would pick up a rosette or two. Founded by Peter Sauber, the team started out building hill-climb and Le Mans racers (notwithstanding motor racing being illegal in his native Switzerland) and entered a start-up Formula One team in 1993. Despite being an occasional podium finisher and recording a best season of fourth in the constructors&apos; race, Sauber sold out to BMW in 2006, only to buy back his team in 2009. Best forgotten The, ahem, flying wings that caused both cars to be withdrawn from the Brazilian GP in 2000 for safety reasons. Bragging about Sauber&apos;s ability to spot untapped potential at 100 paces. He gave world champion Kimi Raikkonen a seat in 2001 despite Max Mosley calling the Finn a danger to other drivers. Puppet master One-time sparky Sauber is a racer&apos;s racer, whose cars have won the greatest race (that is the Le Mans 24 Hours for those who follow only F1) and who in the past has attracted brilliant talents such as Karl Wendlinger and Johnny Herbert to his team. A team owner of the old school that is sadly becoming a dying breed in the sport. They predict &quot;2011 was a split season,&quot; Sauber said. &quot;We had a good start and a disappointing end. This season we want to have the same start but we want to keep that level of performance throughout the season.&quot; We predict Despite struggling against poor reliability early in testing, the team set some quick times and have the continuity of their 2011 driver lineup to rely on.

Puppet master Technical director Giorgio Ascanelli probably had a few sleepless nights during the dismal 2010 season but this is the man who race engineered Ayrton Senna&apos;s 1993 season (including that unsurpassable Donington win).

Unlike the bankers with their ill-defined grumbles about the tax and regulatory &quot;climate&quot;, the chief executive of the Prudential cites a specific threat. It&apos;s Solvency II, the EU&apos;s soon-to-be introduced capital adequacy regime for insurers. If the Pru is obliged by EU regulators to throw a lot of extra capital (and capital of a different type) behind Jackson Life, its large US operation, Thiam thinks he hasn&apos;t a hope if winning more custom from US savers. &quot;Fighting US competitors who don&apos;t have to worry about Solvency II, we just won&apos;t have a market, we won&apos;t be able to sell any products at all,&quot; he says. He may be exaggerating, but Thiam is not alone in spying danger. Other big EU-based insurers with US operations, such as Dutch group Aegon, make the same point. Standard Life thinks even its Canadian business would have a problem. All of which suggests the industry&apos;s lobbying campaign will probably succeed and that regulators in Brussels will succumb to pressure to agree that the US regime can be viewed as equally robust as the EU&apos;s. If so, can Pru&apos;s shareholders and staff relax? Will Thiam drop the subject of relocating? Actually, yes, it seems so. &quot;We love the UK, we&apos;re a British company and we&apos;ve been here for 160 years, and without Solvency II we would not be having this debate,&quot; says Thiam. That response will surprise those who suspected that Thiam was using the Solvency II punch-up as a cover story to get the Pru to flee to Hong Kong or Singapore. He is, after all, the chap who squandered \u00a3377m of shareholders&apos; cash in an absurd pursuit of Asian insurer AIA. But his statement seems unequivocal: it would take something mighty serious for the Pru to leave London. That&apos;s entirely as it should be. City analysts may wave spreadsheets to advance an argument that the Pru could add a couple of quid to its share price by dismembering itself \u2013 ie by separating the supposedly go-go Asian business from the duller UK and US parts.

Alexia said most of the information about the initiative is in Greek, but sent this link to a recent article in the local Athens English-language newspaper, Athens News.

We need to take matters into our own hands,&quot; said Palandjian. Kleivokiotis said the trio all had day jobs and had chosen tourism as the focus of their efforts because it was &quot;the &apos;heavy industry&apos; of Greece&quot;: tourism accounts for about 15% of Greece&apos;s GDP and employs roughly a fifth of the country&apos;s 4m workforce.

Voter apathy on the increase The regular CiF commentator Kizbot has lived in Athens for several years. She contributes this on next month&apos;s general elections, seen by many as a likely turning-point: &quot;Greeks have always been fiercely proud of the role they personally play in upholding democracy and voter participation has usually been pretty high. But then many Greeks have lived through the hell of dictatorship and know that democracy is precious. So voting has always been seen as both a right and a duty. Until now. Ever since democracy was restored it is the two main parties who have taken turns to govern, with no real threat from other parties. Both main parties used trading favours and maintaining the status quo as a means of holding onto power and continued in this vein even throughout the crisis. When Deputy PM Pangalos claimed that all of Greece had &apos;eaten&apos; the money together, most of his compatriots disagreed. And with a good third of them now living below the poverty line, while Greek politicians earn some of the highest MPs salaries in Europe, that is understandable. Faith in politicians and the political system has all but collapsed and most Greeks are unlikely to bother voting, or intend to spoil their ballots, in the upcoming elections. Other smaller parties have started to garner more support, especially left wing parties. But, unfortunately, this is unlikely to result in much change in parliament as it is doubtful whether the left wing parties could ever manage to pool their resources and work together for change. They are, like the main parties, more interested in keeping an eye on the main chance than anything else. It doesn&apos;t leave Greeks a lot to vote for.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/15/asian-universities-challenge-us-uk-domination", "sentences": ["The National University of Singapore has climbed from 27th to 23rd place."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-15T06:00:00Z", "title": "Asian universities challenge US-UK domination of rankings", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "Britain has better universities than any other country apart from the US, but Asian nations are catching up fast, a survey of the world&apos;s top thinkers shows.

Harvard takes the top spot, with the University of Cambridge in third place and the University of Oxford in sixth place \u2013 the same as last year.

The results, published as a league table by Times Higher Education magazine, places 44 US universities in the top 100 \u2013 one fewer than last year \u2013 while Britain has 10, two fewer than last year. Japan and the Netherlands have five each in the top 100. Just four countries are represented in the top 20: the US, the UK, Japan and Canada. Some of the UK&apos;s leading universities have dropped several places since last year, while China&apos;s universities have improved their performance. China is expanding its higher education system faster than most other countries in the world. Imperial College London has dropped from 11th to 13th place and University College London from 19th to 21st.

There are several other league tables of the world&apos;s universities, but this one only ranks institutions on their reputation. Universities are likely to use the rankings to judge how much they should charge in tuition fees. Shabana Mahmood, the shadow minister for higher education, said: &quot;While it is a sign of our strength that the UK is one of only four countries represented in the top 20 universities in the world, the government should sit up and take note of the relative decline of UK institutions compared to those in Europe, the far east and Australia. &quot;This is symptomatic of the chaos and confusion being created by the government as a result of their rapid changes to higher education.

Nikon D7000    Question: This striking Malaysian mystery bird gets its name from one of its distinctive habits. What habit is that? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Is this an adult or a juvenile? What sex is this bird?  The Rules:  1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird&apos;s identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints so others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints may read like &quot;inside jokes&quot; and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. The Game:  1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4.

Cameron and Osborne have been negotiating through the media with Clegg and Alexander \u2013 not on how to support British business through an active industrial strategy but on how to cut the 50p top rate of tax for the richest 1% while slashing tax credits for working people. Meanwhile Vince Cable, an increasingly ineffectual business secretary \u2013 at odds with the roadblocks to reform in Downing St \u2013 watches from the sidelines. Aside from arguing about the tax burden on the top 1%, Cable pointed out in his leaked letter to the prime minister that, beyond deficit reduction, the government has failed to look &quot;beyond the electoral angle&quot; and has no &quot;compelling vision of where the country is heading&quot;. So the government is long on short-term tactics and short on long-term strategy \u2013 that is what Cable is saying. This is deeply worrying. In the context of the biggest squeeze on living standards in a generation and in an age of increasing global competition, we need to reform and modernise our economy so it secures jobs and investment at home and ensures we can pay our way in the world. While governments such as those in Germany, the US and Singapore have placed a strong partnership between productive business and active government at the heart of business policy, the dominant view of Britain&apos;s Conservative-led administration is that the best it can do is step back when industry is crying out for it to step up, creating the conditions for our enterprises and wealth creators to prosper and grow. As Ed Miliband and Ed Balls outlined earlier this week, one of the tests Labour has set for the 2012 budget is whether it puts in place the building blocks for the future of our economy. For this to happen, the following five things need to be in place: first, the emasculation of the Department for Business must cease. Cable&apos;s leaked letter reads like a secretary of state in office but without power. His department has faced calls for its abolition by senior Conservative backbenchers, when they should be promoting it as a great office of state, a loud and clear voice for British business. Cameron and Osborne must restore the department to its former glory and give it the status it enjoyed when Peter Mandelson was in charge. Second, there is no point producing policies with potential to do good if you don&apos;t deliver them competently. For example, ministers boast about their regional growth fund but 40% of the successful first-round bidders (announced this week last year) are still waiting for their monies. The simple truth is that the entire RGF project has been mired in delay, chaos and failure \u2013 not what business needs. Third, the government has created an environment that holds companies back and undermines their confidence to plan for the long term and invest \u2013 this is because of the policy uncertainty ministers have created. So, last year when the chancellor performed a tax grab on North Sea profits, it put at risk long-term investment in the UK oil and gas industries; in the autumn when the government slashed energy feed-in tariffs, it delivered a body blow to our solar industry. What are they going to do to address this in next week&apos;s budget? Fourth, as Cable&apos;s letter notes, businesses are questioning &quot;their ability to find affordable financing for future investment.&quot; Here, the government&apos;s lack of imagination is astonishing \u2013 note its abject failure to consider plans for a British investment bank, which Labour is seriously looking at. Project Merlin was a failure and so the chancellor said his credit easing scheme would ride to the rescue \u2013 more than five months on from that announcement, the scheme has yet to be implemented. There is to be news on this next week \u2013 we will judge it on the basis of whether it gets finance to robust businesses currently unable to get it. Finally, the government must use all the levers at its disposal to fill in the gaps, correct market failure, promote strong competition and back our businesses. Procurement is a powerful instrument that can be used to do this but on defence, for example, the government refuses to consider &quot;employment, industrial, or economic factors&quot; in purchasing decisions. The chief executive of the manufacturers&apos; association EEF has slammed the lack of &quot;one linkage or reference to the growth agenda or industrial strategy&quot; in last year&apos;s defence white paper. On transport, the government let the \u00a31.5bn Thameslink contract go abroad. On energy, &quot;uncertainty surrounding policy&quot; has caused the UK to slip from third to 13th on the Pew &quot;low-carbon technology investment and development&apos; rankings. Putting in place the building blocks for the future of our economy is common sense. It is also what businesses and industry tell us they want to see. Cable, Clegg, Cameron and Osborne have so far failed to do what our wealth creators have asked of them \u2013 the question is: will they deliver the goods next week? \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/mar/16/why-councils-spinning-freedom-information", "sentences": ["A series of FOI requests by the Daily Telegraph exposed how local authorities spent \u00a32m on hotel bills over just 3 years \u2013 including stays at the Four Seasons in New York, the Pan Pacific in Singapore, and the Athens Hilton."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-16T09:00:00Z", "title": "Why are councils spinning against freedom of information?", "tags": ["Local government network blog", "Finance", "Local government"], "article": "During the slow news days of Christmas, spinners at the Local Government Association sent out a press release: &quot;Councils quizzed on Santa, Napoleon and aliens in 2011&apos;s most wacky FOIs.&quot; With opportune timing, the story appeared in most national newspapers. Perhaps just a bit of fun, it gave the impression that local authorities are being bombarded by frivolous or vexatious requests, with the Freedom of Information Act costing local authorities \u00a331.7m a year. No matter that, according to the same evidence base used by the LGA, of 693,650 requests made to local government 98.4% were deemed straightforward by officers and not subject to internal review to weed out vexatious requests. It&apos;s striking that the LGA decided not to highlight how freedom of information has held town halls to account by exposing waste and maladministration. The Barnet bloggers showed how the council used an unlicensed security firm to covertly film residents. Perry Austin-Clarke, editor of the Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus, used FOI to discover the council was spending \u00a3500,000 on mobile phones bills. It subsequently fell to \u00a3100,000. A series of FOI requests by the Daily Telegraph exposed how local authorities spent \u00a32m on hotel bills over just 3 years \u2013 including stays at the Four Seasons in New York, the Pan Pacific in Singapore, and the Athens Hilton. The beauty of FOI is that it gives the public the same powers of inquiry as elected councillors. Scrutiny can now be as powerful outside the town hall as inside. This attention is not always appreciated by officers and members. Local government receives more FOI requests than any other part of government \u2013 because the services provided are the ones closest to the general public. In the Ministry of Justice&apos;s memorandum to the justice select committee inquiry into the act, it argued: &quot;At a time when all public authorities are required to do more with less, this consideration of the financial impact of FOIA on public authorities is pertinent.&quot; In Birmingham city council&apos;s response to the committee, it argues that FOI costs the local authority \u00a3800,000. The figure is based on \u00a325 an hour to locate, retrieve and review the information then (for no apparent reason) doubled the figure for staff costs. Until recently Birmingham was spending \u00a310,000,000 a year on pushing its agenda through in-house publicity and communications. The council argues that to reduce the cost of FOI, requests should be charged at \u00a325 to deter multiple requests. Yet it&apos;s multiple requests that allow groups such as the Taxpayers&apos; Alliance to make comparisons between local authorities \u2013 and find that councils such as Birmingham have the highest spending on publicity. As John O&apos;Connell, research director at the Taxpayers&apos; Alliance told me: &quot;The Freedom of Information Act was one of the most important pieces of legislation enacted by the last government. FOI helped shift the power back to those who pay, and away from those who spend. It would be wrong to impose limits or caps on how much information taxpayers can request, and if public bodies wish to cut down on the work they do responding to FOI requests then they should simply publish more information proactively.&quot; Cost is a poor argument. While the LGA was happy to isolate the high costs of FOI, it pales into insignificance against the \u00a3427m a year claimed in mileage allowances for councillors and staff in 2009-10. The scrutiny that FOI brings to local government drives efficiencies. It is certainly true that the number of FOI requests to local authorities has risen as people have become aware of their rights. Yet, research from University College London suggests that the cost of processing individual FOIs has also fallen by over half from \u00a3410 per request in 2005 to just \u00a3160 in 2010. FOI isn&apos;t just the preserve of journalists or political parties: 52% of requests are from individual citizens, with 5% from businesses, journalists and political parties. A concerted effort is underway to undermine the scope of FOI. It&apos;s possible that requests could be charged in the future, severely hindering comparative investigative journalism. Another proposal is to lower the cost limit of \u00a3600 per request for central government departments and \u00a3450 for all other public authorities. This will only affect a tiny minority of FOI requests \u2013 but often the more pertinent. A huge number of organisations (including Index on Censorship) are lining up to defend freedom of information. We&apos;re hoping the justice select committee makes clear that the act is here to stay. But some policy makers have a desire to turn back the clock. Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair&apos;s chief of staff, regrets the introduction of freedom of information. &quot;In retrospect, this was a mistake, not because secrecy is a virtue, but because policy making, like producing sausages, is not something that should be carried out in public,&quot; he has said. It&apos;s a politics-first approach; hold debates behind closed doors so political groups can present a united front. In local government, this ignores the possibilities that opening up decision making to the public offers. Local government must do more with less.

Perhaps just a bit of fun, it gave the impression that local authorities are being bombarded by frivolous or vexatious requests, with the Freedom of Information Act costing local authorities \u00a331.7m a year. No matter that, according to the same evidence base used by the LGA, of 693,650 requests made to local government 98.4% were deemed straightforward by officers and not subject to internal review to weed out vexatious requests. It&apos;s striking that the LGA decided not to highlight how freedom of information has held town halls to account by exposing waste and maladministration. The Barnet bloggers showed how the council used an unlicensed security firm to covertly film residents. Perry Austin-Clarke, editor of the Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus, used FOI to discover the council was spending \u00a3500,000 on mobile phones bills. It subsequently fell to \u00a3100,000. A series of FOI requests by the Daily Telegraph exposed how local authorities spent \u00a32m on hotel bills over just 3 years \u2013 including stays at the Four Seasons in New York, the Pan Pacific in Singapore, and the Athens Hilton. The beauty of FOI is that it gives the public the same powers of inquiry as elected councillors. Scrutiny can now be as powerful outside the town hall as inside. This attention is not always appreciated by officers and members. Local government receives more FOI requests than any other part of government \u2013 because the services provided are the ones closest to the general public. In the Ministry of Justice&apos;s memorandum to the justice select committee inquiry into the act, it argued: &quot;At a time when all public authorities are required to do more with less, this consideration of the financial impact of FOIA on public authorities is pertinent.&quot; In Birmingham city council&apos;s response to the committee, it argues that FOI costs the local authority \u00a3800,000. The figure is based on \u00a325 an hour to locate, retrieve and review the information then (for no apparent reason) doubled the figure for staff costs. Until recently Birmingham was spending \u00a310,000,000 a year on pushing its agenda through in-house publicity and communications. The council argues that to reduce the cost of FOI, requests should be charged at \u00a325 to deter multiple requests. Yet it&apos;s multiple requests that allow groups such as the Taxpayers&apos; Alliance to make comparisons between local authorities \u2013 and find that councils such as Birmingham have the highest spending on publicity. As John O&apos;Connell, research director at the Taxpayers&apos; Alliance told me: &quot;The Freedom of Information Act was one of the most important pieces of legislation enacted by the last government. FOI helped shift the power back to those who pay, and away from those who spend. It would be wrong to impose limits or caps on how much information taxpayers can request, and if public bodies wish to cut down on the work they do responding to FOI requests then they should simply publish more information proactively.&quot; Cost is a poor argument. While the LGA was happy to isolate the high costs of FOI, it pales into insignificance against the \u00a3427m a year claimed in mileage allowances for councillors and staff in 2009-10. The scrutiny that FOI brings to local government drives efficiencies. It is certainly true that the number of FOI requests to local authorities has risen as people have become aware of their rights. Yet, research from University College London suggests that the cost of processing individual FOIs has also fallen by over half from \u00a3410 per request in 2005 to just \u00a3160 in 2010. FOI isn&apos;t just the preserve of journalists or political parties: 52% of requests are from individual citizens, with 5% from businesses, journalists and political parties. A concerted effort is underway to undermine the scope of FOI. It&apos;s possible that requests could be charged in the future, severely hindering comparative investigative journalism. Another proposal is to lower the cost limit of \u00a3600 per request for central government departments and \u00a3450 for all other public authorities. This will only affect a tiny minority of FOI requests \u2013 but often the more pertinent. A huge number of organisations (including Index on Censorship) are lining up to defend freedom of information. We&apos;re hoping the justice select committee makes clear that the act is here to stay. But some policy makers have a desire to turn back the clock. Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair&apos;s chief of staff, regrets the introduction of freedom of information. &quot;In retrospect, this was a mistake, not because secrecy is a virtue, but because policy making, like producing sausages, is not something that should be carried out in public,&quot; he has said. It&apos;s a politics-first approach; hold debates behind closed doors so political groups can present a united front. In local government, this ignores the possibilities that opening up decision making to the public offers. Local government must do more with less. In these circumstances opening up the decision-making process can only be a good thing. It&apos;s a pity that the LGA is framing the debate in such a misleading way.

My family\u00a0travelled a lot when I\u00a0was young and my dad, a\u00a0self-taught polyglot, would talk to everyone we met with apparent ease, confidently switching between languages. His abilities made a big impression on me, but I was intimidated by him, and he didn&apos;t encourage me to follow his lead. I wasn&apos;t a natural language learner.\u00a0Aged 11, I made slow progress with French at school and\u00a0almost gave it up. But things felt\u00a0different when I took on German\u00a0at university \u2013 loving many German writers in translation, I wanted to read them in their native tongue, and that&apos;s been my main motivation for learning new ones since. It\u00a0can be a real revelation when you start to get it. Once I got German, I\u00a0was hooked; French, Latin, Greek and Sanskrit quickly followed. The idea\u00a0of having an encyclopedic mind \u2013 a\u00a0comprehensive overview of the world \u2013 has always fascinated me, and acquiring languages seemed a good way of achieving that. By my 20s, I&apos;d set my heart on devoting the rest of my life to learning as many as\u00a0I could. I&apos;m often asked what the secret is, and whether some people have an aptitude for absorbing words and phrases. The truth is, predictably, it&apos;s down to endless hours of concentration \u2013 reading, studying and practising grammar, as well as my\u00a0own technique called &quot;shadowing&quot;, which involves walking briskly outdoors while listening to a\u00a0recorded language and repeating it out loud. For five or six years, before I married and had children, I would study for 16 hours a day. I&apos;d transcribe Irish, Persian, Hindi, Turkish, Swahili. Gradually, all\u00a0these wonderful languages started to swim into focus, and ever increasing numbers of great works became\u00a0accessible. It&apos;s hard, but the rewards can be thrilling. When I started studying Spanish, for example, there was a moment when the living language \u2013 which I&apos;d heard spoken around me when I was growing up \u2013 suddenly revealed itself to me, as if the wax was falling from my ears. That&apos;s the moment I crave \u2013 it comes to me quickly with European, Germanic or Romance languages \u2013 and it&apos;s very addictive. Something similar happened when\u00a0I first went to Sweden \u2013 I&apos;d never studied Swedish, but when I heard it spoken around me, it seemed to combine elements of languages I\u00a0was familiar with. All it took was three weeks and I was able to hold my own in complex conversations. That&apos;s as much as most people would want, but as far as I&apos;m concerned, at that stage I&apos;m still in the foothills. Climbing the mountain \u2013 achieving native fluency \u2013 is always going to take years. Now, I can read about three dozen\u00a0languages and speak most of them fluently, and I&apos;ve studied many more. The more of them you\u00a0know, the more you see how inter-related they are. Exotic languages can be more of a challenge. I worked as a professor in Korea for eight years and it took almost a decade to get my Korean skills close to native level. We live in Singapore now, and at home I speak French with my sons, unless my Korean wife is there, in which case we&apos;ll use English. If we don&apos;t want the kids to understand everything we&apos;re saying, we use Korean. I&apos;m not a naturally forthcoming person and I used to be wary of talking to native speakers in their mother tongue. But to have the language come alive you have to speak it, to live it. Now, I find when I&apos;m immersed in a language, I have another, more garrulous persona. I think I&apos;m much richer for that \u2013 it makes me more confident. If I were\u00a0kidnapped tomorrow and dropped in an unknown region, I think there are only a few very remote areas I&apos;d struggle to make myself\u00a0understood. I&apos;m increasingly drawn to dead and endangered languages, and want to set up a polyglot academy where people with similar interests to mine can flourish. I&apos;ve studied Esperanto, and although I can see the benefits of a world language, I do think the loss of so many quirks and colours would leave the world a less intriguing place. It would be like visiting a botanic garden where there was only one type of plant \u2013 that thought horrifies me. \u2022 As told to Chris Broughton. Do you have an experience to share?

Image: Marie-Louise Ng, 24 February 2012 (with permission, for GrrlScientist/Guardian use only) [velociraptorise]. Nikon D7000    Question: This striking Malaysian mystery bird gets its name from one of its distinctive habits. What habit is that? Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species? Is this an adult or a juvenile? What sex is this bird?  Response: This is a blue-crowned hanging-parrot, Loriculus galgulus, a small parrot (Psittacidae) placed into the genus, Loriculus. This genus includes 13 species, all of which have stubby tails and mostly emerald-green plumage. The colouring and pattern on the birds&apos; heads is the most helpful for identifying these closely-related species.  I enjoy these parrots because they are unique amongst birds for their amusing habit of sleeping upside down [doi:10.1111/j.1474-919X.1968.tb00438.x] -- like bats!  The individual in the photograph is an adult, as indicated by her black beak (juveniles have pale orange beaks that are distinctly not-black, even when in shadows).  This bird is an adult female blue-crowned hanging parrot, as indicated by her smudged blue head patch (males have a sharply defined &quot;skull cap&quot;), by the hint of a golden-yellow patch on her back between her wings and by the complete lack of yellow on her rump (males have a sharply defined golden-yellow patch between wings and a bright lemon-yellow patch bordering the red rump patch) and by her lack of the brilliant red throat patch.  This species is rather distinctive but may be confused with its congener, the vernal hanging parrot, L. vernalis. The blue-crowned hanging parrot is distinguished by;  dark eyes (vernal hanging parrot has straw-coloured eyes)  black bill (vernal hanging parrot has a bright red bill)  the lack of blue on the throat (male vernal hanging parrots have a blue throat patch; females may show a faint hint of blue on the throat region)  pale pink feet (vernal hanging parrot has red feet and legs) The blue-crowned hanging parrot is found in lowland forest, marshland, bamboo thickets, mangroves, forest edge and more open habitats such as gardens, coconut groves and orchards. They eat fruits, nectar, buds, flowers, seeds, and small insects. Blue-crowned hanging parrots are cavity-nesting species. They lay between two and four eggs per clutch, the hen incubates them for 20-21 days and the chicks fledge between 33 and 35 days of age.  This species is not endangered.  These birds are kept in aviculture in both the United States and throughout Europe, although their dietary requirements predispose them to a number of infections if rigorous hygienic practices are not observed, which makes them challenging to keep in captivity. This is the main reason that this species is uncommon in aviculture, and even more uncommon as pets.  I think hanging parrots have sweet little voices, although they can be a bit high-pitched and squeaky. Thanks to the recordists who freely share their work at Xeno-Canto, here&apos;s a recording of the voices of a pair of blue-crowned hanging parrots with their two chicks (recorded at Pematanggadung, West Kalimantan, Borneo on 12 April 2008):      Recordist: Bas van Balen.

To drive recovery, is Britain going to stick to the individualist model of capitalism that created the crisis? Or, instead, will we strike out and develop a new balance between state, business and society? This is a debate that is as big as it gets. It is why people join political parties. It creates fundamental divisions of values and conscience. It is how we define ourselves. It is why the coalition partners are going to find it harder and harder to reach the compromises and trade-offs on which successful coalition depends. The problem for the right in Britain and its big brother in the US is that, after 30 years of the conservative revolution, it is now wedded to the premodern view that risks in a market economy and society should be run as individualistically as possible, whether the risk is carried by a company launching an innovative technology or a citizen contemplating old age. The rationale is that self-help in a Darwinian struggle for survival produces moral beings and vigorous economies. The policy conclusion is so-called supply-side reform \u2013 lowering the tax &quot;burden&quot; and stripping out labour market regulation that so delights the Tory right. Side-effects \u2013 the spoils falling to those who already have; denser concentrations of corporate power and growing inequality \u2013 are shrugged off. They are the unfortunate price that has to be paid. But, as a growing number of us are arguing \u2013 David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy and author of the recently published Power, Inc is but the latest to sign up \u2013 the propositions ignore reality. Prosperous economies and societies need risks to be taken in order that innovation and investment reach the highest levels. But the problem about the future and the risk of embracing new technologies and business models is that the prospects are necessarily unknowable. They overwhelm individual businesses, just as the risks of old age, ill-health and sheer bad luck overwhelm individuals. Unless society can develop mechanisms to manage business and social risk \u2013 deploying government creatively, sharing risk through a financial and company ownership system and creating robust social contracts \u2013 two inevitable things follow. Their economies grow less rapidly and their societies become intolerably fractured. Setting the wealth-creators free is a charter for plutocracy, economic fragility and social breakdown. This is a worldwide debate, as Rothkopf outlines, a bid to define what 21st-century capitalism could be. Some countries, such as Singapore and Israel, have developed small state entrepreneurial capitalism as their answer. Then there is Germany and the Nordic countries&apos; stakeholder capitalism; the democratic development capitalism of Brazil and India; China&apos;s self-described &quot;socialist market&quot; capitalism; and government activism even works in the US \u2013 witness the revival of the car industry. Nowhere can you find a modicum of economic and social success without some form of public and private partnership, directed financial systems, corporate ownership structures driving engagement and stewardship and effective social safety nets. This reality is now being increasingly recognised, not least because of the financial crisis whose origins in excessive faith in market forces was caused by the Anglo-Saxon right&apos;s ideas. Last week, I launched the conclusions of the Ownership Commission, which I have chaired for the last two years. A group of us, including Roger Carr, chairman of Centrica and president of the CBI, and Charlie Mayhew, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, concluded that an indispensable precondition for a sustained British recovery was a new and more systematic attempt to secure better ownership of British business assets. We must have more plural and diverse ownership structures, in particular more medium-sized family firms, co-operatives and employee-owned companies, and the public limited company needs to become less fixated with short-term profit goals. We need to ensure the tax, legal and regulatory system triggers the maximum amount of ownership engagement and stewardship and, where it falls short, to devise new means of filling the gaps. Plc shareholders, we advocate, should, as far as possible, pool their voting rights in new not-for-profit mutuals better to engage with the companies they own. We think company directors should be better enfranchised to think of the sustainable, long-term entirety of their business rather than the next hour&apos;s share price. We want the absurdities of the tax and regulatory system that hold back co-operatives and employee-owned companies to be swept away. We want medium-sized firms to be able to build more quickly their capital and their balance sheets \u2013 to create the equivalent in Britain of the German Mittelstand, the amazing cluster of largely family-owned companies that drive Germany&apos;s innovation and export success. We propose a dramatic and fast scaling-up of existing support along with new measures, such as banks being able to get Treasury indemnities for new lending. Ownership policy driving plurality, engagement and better stewardship should be one of the anchors of any framework for recovery, in effect the creation of a British variant of north European stakeholder capitalism, as business secretary Vince Cable, speaking at our launch, recognised and endorsed. But it is only a precondition. Britain has to reshape its financial system so that it backs business. The state has to become an active economic player, constructing the system of institutions and direct support that will drive particular industrial and business sectors forward. We have to spend hard cash on infrastructure and R&amp;D. And Britain&apos;s fraying social safety net needs repair, not further destruction. George Osborne \u2013 partly under Lib Dem pressure, partly because reality crowds in and partly because he has a classic Tory instinct to hold power even if it means doing un-Tory things \u2013 will make some concessions in his budget to this viewpoint. But it will not be full throated: for example, his much vaunted \u00a320bn national loan guarantee scheme is a con, not guaranteeing much-needed new lending but, rather, banks&apos; existing deposits. We need a better capitalism and this budget should have decisively begun its creation. Instead, it will be a fudge, betting all on lowering the deficit. A missed chance for Britain and the first notes of the requiem for this coalition.

Will it be the old-school glamour of The Delaunay, I wonder? Or the more cheffy attractions of Jeremy Lee, recently installed at Quo Vadis? Or, will it be a nondescript chain noodle restaurant just round the corner from where he lives? Well, of course it is. This is Alain de Botton, the philosopher of everyday life who has made a career out of writing about ordinary things \u2013 work, travel, Heathrow airport \u2013 and his lunch spot, XO, is about as mundane as they come. It&apos;s also weirdly out of place. But then, it&apos;s easy to see how De\u00a0Botton, the Jewish-Swiss-English public school-educated atheist who has just written a book on religion, knows that feeling well. XO looks like it should be in a slick part of central London frequented by office workers, whereas it&apos;s in Belsize Park \u2013 a posh, slightly bland, slightly international north London suburb (think Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin who, not uncoincidentally, live nearby). It&apos;s a large, open, empty space with a menu that describes itself as &quot;eastern and Oriental&quot; and takes in dim sum, sashimi, Vietnamese salad, Thai curry, black cod with miso, and banoffee pie. (&quot;I think we&apos;re in Asia somewhere,&quot; says De Botton. &quot;But it&apos;s hard to know where. Possibly Singapore airport.&quot;) Still, I&apos;m feeling quite grateful that it&apos;s not an M&amp;S ready meal, which he once described as ideal dinner-party food to the horror of the nation&apos;s foodies. (Worse, he proposed offering his guests &quot;a bottle of red and a bottle of white&quot;. &quot;A bottle?&quot; wrote an outraged Jay Rayner. &quot;One of each? Between eight?&quot;) He chose this place, he says, because &quot;it&apos;s quiet and at lunchtime it&apos;s very empty&quot;. But then, he doesn&apos;t like fashionable or popular restaurants: &quot;When a restaurant is too popular it starts to harm the reason you are there. I am not a foodie, thank goodness. I will eat pretty much anything. A lot of my friends are getting incredibly fussy about food and I see it as a bit of an affliction. You know, I say, &apos;Let&apos;s go here.&apos; And they say, &apos;No, no, it&apos;s not up to scratch.&apos;&quot; And not being fussy has its advantages because, at that moment, our starters arrive. I have the roast pumpkin and spinach gyoza \u2013 which is not very eastern, unless it&apos;s from east Italy, or possibly Anglia, but it&apos;s good, simple and freshly made. His chilli salt squid, on the other hand, looks like something Kerry Katona might advertise. So, why are we so obsessed with food and what is it replacing? &quot;What bothers me is that there is so much emphasis on food, rather than gathering and meeting \u2013 so that there is all this effort in creating the right food, whereas the food is only a small part of whether the encounter is successful or not.&quot; But cooking for someone can be an act of love, I say. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he agrees, &quot;but I would prefer that the act of love came directly, rather than indirectly, through the food.&quot; We&apos;re so used to seeing food as a\u00a0metaphor, but for De Botton it&apos;s just food. And what makes a meal an experience is when it&apos;s a meaningful encounter in which either side reveals something of themselves. &quot;This normally happens after a few bottles of wine,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s when people start to go, &apos;It is all shit and my marriage is terrible and I hate my job, I can&apos;t bear my parents\u2026&apos; or whatever it is, and suddenly there is a\u00a0feeling that friendships can be forged out of that darkness. In Britain it normally takes about 15 bottles of wine before that happens. And it would just be good if you could do it without that.&quot; In fairness, De Botton, who was born and spent his early years in Switzerland doesn&apos;t need alcohol to open up. He can discuss his difficult relationship with his father \u2013 the impressive and scary Gilbert de Botton, a financier who went to work for the Rothschilds before going on to found Global Asset Management \u2013 on nothing stronger than jasmine tea. De Botton senior spoke 12 languages, collected modern art and was rabidly atheist. In the introduction to his latest book, Religion for Atheists, De Botton junior writes: &quot;I recall him reducing my sister to tears in an attempt to dislodge her modestly held notion that a reclusive god may dwell somewhere in the universe. She was eight years old at the time.&quot; He recounts how, despite his upbringing, he suffered a crisis in his lack of faith; how Bach&apos;s cantatas made him falter, momentarily, in his godlessness. And how he believes that there are things that religion simply does better \u2013 such as weddings, and death, and community. His father died some years ago, but it&apos;s hard not to think that the book is in some ways a conversation with him that he has been carrying on in his head. And possibly his wife, too. She studied theology at Cambridge and was &quot;appalled that I should tackle religion&quot;. And he doesn&apos;t just tackle it. He asset\u00a0strips it, proposing that civil society should steal the things religion does well but leave out all the God stuff. One of his boldest ideas is for a new kind of restaurant. Christian mass, he writes, was a meal before it was a\u00a0service, eaten with strangers. In the early church, these were known as &quot;agape (from the Greek for &apos;love&apos;) feasts&quot;. In the modern city, he writes, there are any number of places to eat well, but there&apos;s &quot;an almost universal lack of venues that help us to transform strangers into friends&quot;. And so he proposes an &quot;agape restaurant&quot;. For, &quot;There are few more effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours than to force them to eat supper together.&quot; And there&apos;s a vivid description in the book of how we walk into restaurants alone. And leave alone. &quot;A city like London is sociable in a\u00a0sense that there are people gathering in bars and restaurants, concerts and lectures. Yet you can partake of all these experiences and never say hello to anyone new. And one of the things that all religions do is take groups of strangers into a space and say it is OK to talk to each other.&quot; Our mains arrive. I have a pad Thai and De Botton has aubergine and lychee green chicken curry. &quot;How is it?&quot; I ask. &quot;Nice.&quot; Actually, it&apos;s not unlike hanging out at Wagamama in Terminal 5. Which isn&apos;t really an accident. &quot;I&apos;m attracted to that sort of international anonymity,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s a certain kind of insular, old-fashioned, upper-class Britishness that gives me the spooks. I\u00a0am sure that comes from a boarding-school trauma. So someone like Cameron I find deeply creepy.&quot; De Botton failed to get into Eton, and ended up at Harrow &quot;where the duffers go&quot; because, he says, his parents didn&apos;t know any better. And the school was stuffed with David Camerons. &quot;He&apos;s the guy \u2013 you know, the head boy \u2013 who&apos;d say things like, &apos;Why don&apos;t you play rugby more?&apos; I ended up in this place which was hell on earth. A place that was obsessed by male machismo and sport and beery thickness. It&apos;s insane. That school should be closed.&quot; His schooling makes his indifference to food make much more sense. &quot;For 15 years I ate revolting food.

Statistics published on Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute show that demand from emerging economies \u2013 in particular India \u2013 drove the volume of worldwide arms transfers between 2007 and 2011 to a level 24% higher than in the previous four years. Alongside India the five largest arms importers today are all Asian states, according to the data, prompting fears of an arms race in a region still blighted by deep poverty. &quot;India has long been a major purchaser of weapons. Now it is the biggest in the world,&quot; said Pieter Wezeman, a researcher at the institute. Wezeman said India&apos;s top ranking was in part due to Delhi increasing its arms spend but also to China&apos;s increasing ability to produce its own weapons. India is now importing twice as many arms as China, its main regional rival, the institute&apos;s data shows. Three other large recipients of arms in 2007\u20132011 were South Korea, Pakistan, and Singapore. One recent Indian deal alone \u2013 for 126 fighter jets worth up to \u00a310bn \u2013 sparked fierce competition. The French Rafale aircraft is favoured to win the contract despite lobbying by David Cameron for the Eurofighter Typhoon, which is a third British. By some estimates, India will spend more than \u00a3100bn on weapons and systems in the next 15 years. Manoj Joshi, a security expert and journalist in Delhi, said India was trying to overcome decades of underinvestment: &quot;There is a huge backlog and India is not so much racing as running as hard as she can to stay still. Modernising the armed forces here is like running up an escalator.&quot;. Other deals include further fighter jets, transport planes, submarines and a range of naval vessels. Tanks, small arms and artillery also all need replacement, Indian officials say. Tensions between China and India have risen in recent years and Beijing has become one of Pakistan&apos;s biggest weapons suppliers. Joshi said the insititute&apos;s figures for India exaggerated the country&apos;s expenditure. &quot;Many of the headline announcements of purchases take years and years to actually be implemented or don&apos;t happen at all. The actual sums spent are more modest,&quot; he said. Many fear problems of graft in countries where corruption is endemic. A number of firms have been banned from selling to India by the authorities after investigations into bribery. The figures also show that leading suppliers continued to deliver weapons to Middle Eastern countries during the Arab spring. Despite a review in 2011 of its arms transfer policies towards the region, the US remains a main supplier to both Tunisia and Egypt. In 2011, the US delivered 45 M-1A1 tanks to Egypt and agreed to deliver 125 more. &quot;There was all sorts of talk of change of arms policies following the Arab spring but there was very little change in reality,&quot; Wezeman said. &quot;An arms embargo on Libya was generally respected but has now been lifted and so we may see a resumption of exports [to Tripoli]. In Egypt the US decided not to change any export policies and continued to supply arms [to the government] and the financial means as military aid to purchase them.&quot; The institute also underlines the continuing role of Russia in arms supplies to Syria. Last year Russia continued deliveries of surface to air and coastal defence missile systems, as well as securing an order for 36 Yak-130 trainer\u2013cum-combat aircraft. These deliveries contributed to a 580% increase in the volume of Syrian arms imports between 2002\u20132006 and 2007\u201311, the report says. &quot;Syria is not an important market for Russia but Russia has been by far the largest supplier and shown itself completely unwilling to put any constraints on transfers,&quot; said Wezeman. &quot;Russia has clearly indicated that it will continue supplying the Assad regime despite what is happening.&quot; The US remains by far the world&apos;s largest supplier of arms. A recent deal with Saudi Arabia for combat aircraft could be worth $30bn over several decades."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/20/m-c-saatchi-profits-surge", "sentences": ["Malaysia was &quot;outstanding&quot; while New Zealand, India and Japan were all profitable, and Singapore was reopened with an &quot;experienced and promising team&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-20T08:55:02Z", "title": "M&C Saatchi's pre-tax profits surge after UK growth", "tags": ["M&C Saatchi", "Advertising", "Media business", "Business", "Media"], "article": "M&amp;C Saatchi more than doubled pre-tax profits to \u00a316m in 2011, despite a 35% slump in its Asian and Australasian operation.

However, on an adjusted basis, taking into account factors including non-cash items amortisation, the increase in pre-tax profits, while still impressive, was up 17% year on year to \u00a315.6m. M&amp;C Saatchi said its 22% increase in revenue to \u00a3153m in 2011 was its best since the company floated in 2004. Its UK operation had a strong year, with like-for-like revenues up 25% to \u00a367m \u2013 the company pointed out the mobile division performed &quot;particularly well&quot; \u2013 with operating profit up 18% to \u00a313m. The UK is by far the group&apos;s most important market, accounting for 44% of total revenues and 66% of operating profits. Media planning and buying operation Walker Media&apos;s loss of its key Barclays account is likely to hit UK revenues this year.

Operating profit rose 30% to \u00a32.05m. Across Asia and Australasia revenues increased 6% to \u00a349.7m and profits declined 35% to \u00a32.4m, thanks to a &quot;more testing year&quot; that saw the departure of a number of very large clients.

Malaysia was &quot;outstanding&quot; while New Zealand, India and Japan were all profitable, and Singapore was reopened with an &quot;experienced and promising team&quot;. The Asia/Australasia market is the second biggest for the group at 32% of total revenues and 12% of operating profits. At its nascent Americas operation revenues rose 65% to \u00a36.7m and operating profit was \u00a377,000, up from a loss of \u00a3249,000 in 2010. Its fledgling Africa operation increased its revenues fivefold to \u00a33m while an acquisition in Sao Paulo, Brazil, single-handedly boosted the Americas division by 65%. &quot;We are reaping the benefits of our growing global network and the rollout of our growth specialist businesses such as M&amp;C Saatchi Sport &amp; Entertainment and M&amp;C Saatchi Mobile,&quot; said the M&amp;C Saatchi chief executive, David Kershaw. &quot;2012 has started well. Despite uncertainty with the macro environment we are benefiting from new revenues from the significant wins last year, such as O2.&quot; M&amp;C Saatchi raised its total dividend 15.4% to 4.5p. The company had a cash position of \u00a314.9m as at the end of 2011, up from \u00a39.7m at the same time in 2010. Kershaw said the company did not have plans to make a big acquisition in markets such as the UK and the US, however, building China would be a focus. &quot;If we look at anywhere it will be Asia. If we do M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] it will be there, it would be tactical,&quot; he said.

Britain is going to earn its way in the world. There is no other road to recovery. This Budget supports working families and helps those looking for work. It unashamedly backs business. And it is on the side of aspiration: those who want to do better for themselves and for their families. This Budget reaffirms our unwavering commitment to deal with Britain&apos;s record debts. But because we&apos;ve already taken difficult decisions, this can also be a reforming Budget that seeks to repair the disastrous model of economic growth that created those debts. A model that saw manufacturing almost halve as a share of our national economy, while the national debt doubled. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is how Britain will earn its way in the world: with far reaching tax reform. With a simpler tax system, where ordinary taxpayers understand what they are being asked to pay. With a tax system that is more competitive for business than any other major economy in the world. A tax system where millions of the lowest paid are lifted out of tax altogether, while the tax revenues we get from the wealthiest increase. But reforming tax is only part of the story. We will earn our way in the world by saying to all businesses \u2013 large and small: We will provide you with the modern infrastructure; new growth-friendly planning rules and employment laws; the kinds of schools and universities and colleges our future workforce needs. And in return, you, British businesses, have the self-confidence to: invest, expand, hire, innovate and be the best. We earn our way in the world if we stop being afraid to identify Britain&apos;s strengths and reinforce them, backing industries, like aerospace, energy and pharmaceuticals, creative media and science. A deliberate strategy to create a more balanced national economy, where financial services are strong, but they are not the only string to our bow. Mr Deputy Speaker, Stability comes first. And the Report from the Office for Budget Responsibility reminds us today of the risks to stability. Despite the welcome action by the European Central Bank, the impact of the sovereign debt crisis on the European economy has been significant. Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and others are now in recession \u2013 and Germany&apos;s economy shrank in the last quarter. In today&apos;s Report, the OBR are sharply revising down their forecast for euro area growth this year by 0.8% to - 0.3%. Their forecast for world economic growth is also revised down over the next two years - by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. Of course, Britain is not immune from these developments in our largest export markets. And the OBR say today that &quot;the situation in the euro area remains a major risk to our forecast&quot;. Another risk they identify is a &quot;further spike in oil prices&quot;, and there is no doubt that the high oil price \u2013 driven both by real demand and the Iranian situation \u2013 is of great concern across the world. It means that the OBR&apos;s overall assessment of the outlook and risks for the British economy is &quot;broadly unchanged&quot; since last November&apos;s report. Despite these headwinds, there are, however, some more positive signs. The OBR expect the British economy &quot;to avoid a technical recession with positive growth in the first quarter&quot; of this year. They say that the British economy has &quot;carried a little more momentum into the new year than previously anticipated&quot;. Indeed, the Office for Budget Responsibility is slightly revising up in their growth forecast for the UK this year to 0.8%. They then forecast 2% next year; 2.7% in 2014; And 3% in both 2015 and 2016. The OBR&apos;s forecast unemployment rate is the same as it was last autumn. They expect it to peak this year at 8.7 per cent before falling each year to 6.3 per cent by the end of the forecast period. But they have revised down their estimate of the claimant count, which they now expect to be around 100,000 lower in each of the next four years than they previously forecast \u2013 peaking at 1.67 million this year rather than the 1.8 million they forecast in November. And they forecast one million more jobs in the economy over five years. Inflation is expected to fall throughout the period, from 2.8% this year to 1.9% next year, and then 2% by the end of the forecast period. I am today writing to the Governor of the Bank of England to reaffirm the CPI inflation target of 2%. The Government&apos;s credible and responsible fiscal policy allows the independent central bank to pursue an activist monetary policy consistent with targeting low inflation. I confirm that the Asset Purchase Facility will remain in place for the coming year. Fiscal forecasts So employment is growing, inflation is coming down. And so too is the deficit. When this Government came to office, the budget deficit stood at over 11%. The state was borrowing one in four of every single pound it spent. Today, I can report that the deficit is falling and is forecast to reach 7.6% next year. The share of national income taken by the state will have fallen from almost 48% when we took office to 43% next year. We must stick to the course. So there will be no deficit funded giveaways today. But because we&apos;ve taken difficult decisions, nor do we need to tighten further. Over the five year period, this is a fiscally neutral Budget. This is achieved through a modest reduction in both taxation and spending. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me turn to those fiscal forecasts. The whole House will be pleased to know that these have improved a little from the forecasts I presented in November. Borrowing this year is set to come in at \u00a3126 billion, \u00a31 billion lower than I forecast in the autumn. And over \u00a330 billion a year lower than its peak the year before we came to office. Borrowing will then fall to \u00a3120 billion next year, if you exclude the transfer of Royal Mail pension assets. It will then fall to \u00a398 billion in 2013-14; Then \u00a375 billion; Then \u00a352 billion; Reaching \u00a321 billion by 2016-17. So in total, borrowing is \u00a311 billion less than I last forecast in the Autumn. This will be used to pay down debt. In my first Budget, I set the Government the fiscal mandate of achieving a cyclically-adjusted current balance by the end of the five year horizon. The OBR confirm today that we are on course to achieve that mandate, and have eliminated the structural current deficit by 2016-17. They also confirm that we are also on course to reach our target for debt to be falling as a percentage of national income by the end of the Parliament in 2015-16. Public Sector Net Debt is now set to peak at 76.3% in 2014-15, almost 2% lower than previously forecast \u2013 before falling the following year. Spending A balanced structural current budget and falling debt: our deficit reduction plan is on course. Mr Deputy Speaker, we will not waiver from it. To do so would risk a sudden loss of confidence and a sharp rise in interest rates \u2013 and we will not risk that. Instead we reinforce today our commitment to fiscal responsibility, not just this year \u2013 but in the years ahead. The transfer of the \u00a328 billion of assets from the Royal Mail pension fund to the Exchequer will free it from its crippling pension debts, ensure the pensions of hard-working staff are paid and help to bring in new private sector investment. Some would have been tempted to spend the windfall. I do not propose to spend it. Instead, I have used it to pay off debt. We will also maintain our control on welfare spending. The passing of the Welfare Reform Act two weeks ago was an historic moment. I pay tribute to my RHF the Work and Pensions Secretary and to all my coalition colleagues for supporting him against determined opposition from those who defend unlimited welfare. But even with the Act, the welfare budget is set to rise to consume one third of all public spending. If nothing is done to curb welfare bills further, then the full weight of the spending restraint will fall on departmental budgets. The next Spending Review will have to confront this. So I am today publishing analysis that shows that if in the next Spending Review we maintain the same rate of reductions in departmental spending as we have done in this review, we would need to make savings in welfare of \u00a310 billion by 2016. We will also address the rising costs of an ageing population, and the burden this places on future generations. We will be publishing a White Paper on social care. I&apos;ve also said that we would consider proposals to manage future increases in the state pension age, beyond the increases already announced. I can confirm today that there will be an automatic review of the state pension age to ensure it keeps pace with increases in longevity. Details of how this will operate will be published alongside the OBR&apos;s long term fiscal sustainability report this summer. One area where future government spending is expected to be lower than planned is Afghanistan. We were reminded again yesterday of the sacrifice so many of our servicemen and women have made. As the Prime Minister made clear with the US President last week, UK forces will cease combat operation by the end of 2014. As a consequence, I can tell the House that the cost of operations \u2013 which are funded by the Government&apos;s Special Reserve and entirely separate from the defence budget \u2013 are expected to be a total of \u00a32.4 billion lower than planned over the remainder of the Parliament. Let me be clear today, the full cost of operations will continue to be met from the Reserve \u2013 and our brave armed forces will get the equipment they need to complete the job. But I can ensure that some of the benefit of the lower cost is felt by those who fight so hard and give so much for our nation&apos;s security. We will fund an extra \u00a3100 million of improvements in the accommodation of our armed forces and their families. I will also double the families welfare grant which is used to provide additional support to the families left behind when people deploy. We&apos;ve already doubled the operational allowance. Today, I am doubling the rate of Council Tax Relief. The thousands serving our country in operations overseas will receive 100% Relief on an average Council Tax bill. Low interest rates/gilts Mr Deputy Speaker, our commitment to reduce the deficit is keeping interest rates low. In this Budget, we take measures to ensure that the benefits of those low market interest rates are felt across our economy. They are certainly benefitting the taxpayer. Thanks to the reduction in the deficit, and our low interest rates, this Government is saving a total of \u00a336 billion in debt interest payments compared to its predecessor. This year is the 400th anniversary of the creation of the Treasury Board and the modern Treasury. There have been times the Treasury has been borrowing money more cheaply than at any previous time in that 400 year history. Few countries in Europe could say that. This reflects the confidence investors have in Britain&apos;s ability to pay its way. I now want to test whether we can we can extend these benefits further into the future and diversify our portfolio. At present, the longest gilt we currently offer to the market is 50 years. The Debt Management Office will consult on the case for issuing gilts with maturities longer than 50 years, and the case for a &quot;perpetual&quot; gilt with no fixed redemption date \u2013 something Britain last felt able to issue six decades ago. We are also taking the opportunity to rebuild Britain&apos;s reserves, which had fallen to historically low levels. I can confirm our gold holdings have risen in value to \u00a311 billion. This does not include the 400 or so tonnes of gold sold a decade ago for \u00a32 billion, and which would now be worth six times that at over \u00a313 billion pounds. Working families are already being helped by historic low mortgage rates. The New Buy Scheme that we introduced last week uses the Government&apos;s balance sheet to help those who cannot afford the larger deposits that some mortgage companies are now demanding. It comes alongside a new, reinvigorated Right to Buy. And to ensure that there are new homes to buy, we are today expanding the Get Britain Building Fund that provides upfront finance to construction firms. Credit easing We are also passing on our low interest rates to small businesses, through the National Loan Guarantee Scheme. This started operation yesterday. Barclays, Lloyds, the RBS, Santander and the new business bank Aldermore are all involved. \u00a320 billion of guarantees in total will be available. In the Autumn Statement I also allocated \u00a31 billion to invest in funds that lend directly to the mid-cap businesses that are the backbone of our economy. This is an alternative source of finance to the banks. The response has exceeded our expectations. 24 funds have submitted proposals. I am today short-listing seven of them. And such has been the quality of the bids, I have also decided to increase the size of the Finance Partnership by 20% and I am also expanding the Enterprise Finance Guarantee. Growth Stability. Credibility. The low interest rates they bring. And passing on those low rates to families and businesses. These are necessary for growth. But alone they are not sufficient. We as a nation have to make a choice. This country became seduced by large deficits and the illusion of cheap finance. Do we watch as the Brazils and the Chinas, and the Indias of this world power ahead of us in the global economy; or do we have the national resolve to say: &quot;No, we won&apos;t be left behind. We want to be out in front&quot;. That is this Government&apos;s resolve. Under this Government, Britain has moved into the top ten of the most competitive places in the world to do business. But we have to do more. Here&apos;s how. Exports and investment First, exports. Over the last decade, our share of world exports shrank as Germany&apos;s grew. We sold more to Ireland than to Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 put together. That was the road to Britain&apos;s economic irrelevance. We want to double our nation&apos;s exports to one trillion pounds this decade. So we&apos;re expanding UK Export Finance and setting out new plans to help smaller firms in new markets. Exports abroad must be accompanied by investment at home. Britain has a reputation as a remarkably open and welcoming place for investment. We must never allow protectionist rhetoric to creep into our political system. Instead, we&apos;re actively seeking investment from overseas pension and sovereign wealth funds \u2013 and working to develop London as a new offshore market for the Chinese currency. We also want investment from British pension funds in British infrastructure \u2013 and we&apos;re now working with a dozen of the largest pension schemes specifically on that. We&apos;re the first British government to set out in a National Infrastructure Plan the projects we are going to prioritise in the coming decade. The roads, railways, clean energy and water, and broadband networks we need are all identified. I also believe this country must confront the lack of airport capacity in the South East of England \u2013 we cannot cut ourselves off from the fastest growing cities in the world. The Transport Secretary will set out Government thinking later this summer. We want to look at the opportunities for increasing the role of private investment in the road network, learning lessons from the water industry. I confirm today that Network Rail will extend the Northern Hub, adding to the electrification of the transpennine rail route, by upgrading the Hope Valley line between Manchester and Sheffield \u2013 and improving the Manchester to Preston and Blackpool, and Manchester to Bradford lines. For years, transport investment in the north of England was neglected. Not under this Coalition Government. We are working with our great cities to devolve decision making powers \u2013 and we are striking a ground-breaking deal with Manchester to support \u00a31.2 billion in growth-enhancing infrastructure. We will support \u00a3150 million of Tax Increment Financing to help local authorities promote development. And we will provide an extra \u00a3270m to the Growing Places fund. In all this we are working with local areas to support their ideas for growing the private sector in parts of the country where the state has taken a larger and larger share of the economy. The Mayor of London is also a very effective champion for the city he runs so well. We will work with him on plans this summer to go on investing in London transport, lengthening commuter trains, extending the Underground and exploring new river crossings in east London. So from the allocation made to the Mayor through the Growing Places Fund he will be creating a new \u00a370 million development fund to attract new business and new jobs. And the Mayor has persuaded me of the opportunities the new Royal Docks Enterprise Zone offers our largest city if we offer enhanced capital allowances there \u2013 so we will. 24 Enterprise Zones are now going ahead, across England. Chinese investment pouring into the zone in Liverpool. The Marches Zone in the West Midlands is already expanding. I want other parts of the United Kingdom to benefit from these policies. The Chief Secretary can confirm today that we will offer enhanced capital allowances for businesses starting up in the new Scottish enterprise areas in Dundee, Irvine and Nigg and there will be a new Welsh Enterprise Zone in Deeside, while we look forward to the first Enterprise Zone in Northern Ireland. Energy I also want to see investment in our world-leading energy sector, including renewables. We&apos;ve launched the Green Investment Bank; open for business next month. We&apos;ve introduced a Carbon Price Floor into our tax system to encourage investment and set the rate today. Combined Heat and Power plants will not be liable to carbon price support rates on fuels used for heat. Renewable energy will play a crucial part in Britain&apos;s energy mix \u2013 but I will always be alert to the costs we are asking families and businesses to bear. Environmentally sustainable has to be fiscally sustainable too. The Carbon Reduction Commitment was established by the previous Government. It is cumbersome, bureaucratic and imposes unnecessary cost on business. So we will seek major savings in the administrative cost of the Commitment for business. If those cannot be found, I will bring forward proposals this autumn to replace the revenues with an alternative environmental tax. Gas is cheap, has much less carbon than coal and will be the largest single source of our electricity in the coming years. And so my RHF the Energy Secretary will set out our new gas generation strategy in the autumn to secure investment. I also want to that ensure we extract the greatest possible amount of oil and gas from our reserves in the North Sea. We are today introducing a major package of tax changes to achieve this. We will end the uncertainty over decommissioning tax relief that has hung over the industry for years by entering into a contractual approach. We are also introducing new allowances including a \u00a33 billion new field allowance for large and deep fields to open up West of Shetland, the last area of the basin left to be developed. A huge boost for investment in the North Sea. Aerospace/ Science/ Creative hub We shouldn&apos;t be shy about identifying our successful industries and reinforcing them. Around one fifth of the world&apos;s top 100 medicines originate from UK research. So we&apos;re backing our life sciences sector through creating the Francis Crick Institute at St Pancras and cutting taxes on patents to make this one of the most attractive places in the world to invent new medicines. We&apos;ve protected the science budget. Now we&apos;re committing \u00a3100m of support, alongside the private sector, for investment in major new university research facilities. And with the world&apos;s second largest aerospace industry, we will also establish a UK centre for aerodynamics, to open next year that will encourage innovation in aircraft design and commercialise new ideas. Today we also set Britain this industrial ambition. That we turn Britain into Europe&apos;s technology centre. We will start with digital content. The film tax credit, protected in our spending review, helped generate over \u00a31 billion of film production investment in the UK last year alone. Today I am announcing our intention to introduce similar schemes for the video games, animation and high-end TV production industries. Not only will this help stop premium British TV programmes like Birdsong being made abroad, it will also attract top international investors like Disney and HBO to make more of their premium shows in the UK. It will support our brilliant video games and animation industries too. [Political content removed] To be Europe&apos;s technology centre we also need the best technology infrastructure. Two years ago Britain had some of the slowest broadband speeds in Europe; today our plans will deliver some of the fastest \u2013 with 90 per cent of the population having access to superfast broadband, and improved mobile phone coverage for rural areas and along key roads across the UK. But we should not be complacent by saying it is enough to be the best in Europe when countries like Korea and Singapore do even better. So today we&apos;re funding ultra fast broadband and wifi in ten of the UK&apos;s largest cities. Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle and London. My HF for Brighton Kempton asked me to help small cities too \u2013 no doubt with his own city in mind. I agree. \u00a350m will be available for smaller cities too. The fastest digital speeds in the world available in our cities, with the most connected countryside in Europe \u2013 and the most creative digital content anywhere. That&apos;s what a modern industrial policy looks like. And the Business Secretary and I have asked Michael Heseltine to review by the Autumn how Government spending departments and other public bodies can work better with the private sector on economic development. From Liverpool to Canary Wharf, Michael knows how it&apos;s done. Best place to start business Of course, those projects succeeded because they were not killed off by the planning system. You can&apos;t earn your future if you can&apos;t get planning permission. Global businesses have diverted specific investments that would have created hundreds of jobs in some of the most deprived communities in Britain to countries like Germany and the Netherlands, because they couldn&apos;t get planning permission here. That is unacceptable. Next week my RHFs the Communities Secretary and the Planning Minister will publish the results of our overhaul of planning regulation. We&apos;re replacing 1000 pages of guidance with just 50 pages. We&apos;re introducing a presumption in favour of sustainable development; While protecting our most precious environments. The new policy comes into effect when the National Planning Policy Framework is published next Tuesday. This is the biggest reduction in business red tape ever undertaken. As a country, we also want to make the most of the Olympic and Paralympics Games. Some of the biggest events will be on a Sunday. When millions of visitors come to Britain to see them, we don&apos;t want to hang up a &apos;Closed for Business&apos; sign. So we will introduce legislation limited to relaxing the Sunday trading laws for eight Sundays only, starting on July 22nd. Education/ flexible workforce Mr Deputy Speaker, earning our way in the world means giving young people the skills to compete. In time, my RHF the Education Secretary&apos;s school reforms will do more to improve the long term economic performance of our economy than any Budget measure ever will. But we&apos;ve got to help the young adults who&apos;ve already been let down by the school system. We&apos;re offering a record number of apprenticeships and our Youth Contract comes into force next month. I can tell the House, we are also exploring the idea of enterprise loans. Young people get a loan to go to university or college. We now want to help them get a loan to start their own business. We&apos;re also looking to see whether we can make public sector pay more responsive to local pay rates. It is something the last Government introduced into the Court Service. London weighting already exists across the public sector. Indeed, the Opposition have proposed the interesting idea of regional benefit rates. So we should see what we can do to make our public services more responsive, and help our private sector to grow and create jobs in all parts of the country. We&apos;ve asked the independent Pay Review bodies to look at the issue. Today, we publish the evidence that the Treasury are submitting to them. And some departments will have the option of moving to more local pay for those civil servants whose pay freezes end this year. Tax reform Mr Deputy Speaker, New infrastructure and investment. Ambitious reforms on planning, education and welfare to help businesses to create jobs. These will all help Britain earn its way in the world. But we also need a tax system that supports work. Two hundred years ago, Adam Smith set out the four principles of good taxation \u2013 and they remain good principles today. Taxes should be simple, predictable, support work, and they should be fair. The rich should pay the most, and the poor least. The tax system this Government inherited from its predecessor had drifted far from these principles. We have already addressed some of the problems. We&apos;ve established an Office of Tax Simplification to drive out complexity. Companies are now moving to Britain, not away. We&apos;ve stopped the jobs tax. We&apos;ve taken one million low paid people out of tax altogether. We now need further reform. We need to give Britain a modern tax system fit for the modern world. Tax transparency The first goal is a far simpler tax system, which businesses can easily navigate and where ordinary taxpayers understand what they are being asked to pay. So we will radically change the administration of tax for our smallest firms. Last year, I asked the Office of Tax Simplification for recommendations. They have proposed that we tax small firms on the basis of the cash that passes through their businesses, rather than asking them to spend a huge amount of time doing calculations designed for big business. I agree. So we will consult on this new cash basis for calculating tax for firms with a turnover of up to \u00a377,000 - double what the Office proposed. This will make filling in tax returns dramatically simpler for up to 3 million firms. We are also pressing forward with our ambition to integrate the operation of income tax and national insurance I announced at last year&apos;s Budget \u2013 so we don&apos;t ask businesses to run two different payroll tax administrations. A detailed consultation on how we do this is being published next month. We will also address some of the loopholes and anomalies in our VAT system. For example, at present, soft drinks and sports drinks are charged VAT; sports nutrition drinks are not. Hot takeaway food on high streets has been charged VAT for more than twenty years; but some new hot takeaway products in supermarkets are not. And some companies are using the VAT rules that exempt the rental of land to avoid tax that their competitors are paying. We&apos;re publishing our plans today to remove loopholes and anomalies, but we keep the broad exemptions on food, children&apos;s clothes, printed books and newspapers. We should also simplify the age related allowances \u2013 which the Office of Tax Simplification have recently highlighted as a particularly complicated feature of the tax system. The NAO points out that many pensioners don&apos;t understand them. These allowances require around 150,000 pensioners to fill in self-assessment forms, and as we have real increases in the personal allowances, their value is already being eroded away. So over time we will simplify the tax system for pensioners by doing away with the complexity of the additional age-related allowances for anyone reaching the age of 65 on or after 6th April 2013 and I will freeze the cash value of the allowance for existing pensioners until it aligns with the personal allowance. This will protect the existing level of allowance pensioners have, while introducing a single personal allowance for all. It is a major simplification. It saves money. And no pensioner will lose in cash terms. Under this Government, pensioners next month will receive the largest ever cash increase in the Basic State Pension of \u00a35.30 a week. Now, we want to simplify the Basic State Pension and its interaction with the second state pension. I pay tribute to the work my HF Pensions Minister has done on this. Such is the complexity of this means tested system, only someone like our Pensions Minister can work out exactly what someone&apos;s entitled to - and what they need to save. So I can confirm that we will introduce a new single tier pension for future pensioners, set above the means test. This is currently estimated at around \u00a3140. It will be based on contributions. And it will cost no more than the current system in any year. We will bring forward further details later this spring. A single, generous, basic state pension for those who have worked and saved hard all their lives. And a further major simplification of our tax and benefit system. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the information age people should know what taxes they&apos;re paying and what their money is being spent on. My HF the Member for Ipswich recently proposed to this House that we send to taxpayers an annual statement showing them just that. I think this is an excellent idea \u2013 and I intend to put it into practice. HMRC contacts roughly half of taxpayers each year. From 2014, these 20 million taxpayers will at the same time receive a new Personal Tax Statement. This will tell people how much income tax and national insurance they have paid; their average tax rates; and how this contributes to public spending. In other words - how much, proportionately, of their tax bill goes to fund the healthcare, education, or welfare; and how much is spent on servicing interest payments on the national debt. People will know what they are paying \u2013 and what they are paying it for. A tax system that is simple and transparent: that is our first goal. Business tax Our second goal is a tax system that is more competitive for business than any other major economy in the world. Our predecessors wanted to increase taxes on small business. Instead we&apos;ve cut the tax rate on small companies to 20%. Our predecessors wanted to increase national insurance on jobs. We have cut it. Our new Controlled Foreign Company rules will be legislated for in the coming Finance Bill and will stop global firms leaving Britain as they were, and encourage them to start coming here. This Government also supports research and development here in Britain instead of abroad. We&apos;ve already increased the generosity of the R&amp;D tax credit for smaller firms. I confirm that from next year we will also introduce an &quot;Above the Line&quot; R&amp;D tax credit that business organisations like the EEF, IOD and CBI have campaigned hard for. And we will help new start up businesses recruit and retain talent \u2013 by more than doubling the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme grant limit to \u00a3250,000 and easing the rules so that academics in our universities can turn great ideas into great companies. The Treasury will review for this autumn what more we can do to encourage employee ownership. All of these tax reductions will help win business for Britain. But the headline rate of corporation tax remains the most visible sign of how competitive our country is. We&apos;ve already cut the rate from 28% to 26%. This April it is due to fall again to 25%. I can announce today a further cut of one percent \u2013 to be implemented right away. From next month, Britain will have a corporation tax rate of just 24%. And we will continue with the two further cuts planned next year and the year after. So that by 2014, Britain will have a 22% rate of corporation tax. The biggest sustained reduction in business tax rates for a generation. A headline rate that is not just lower than our competitors, but dramatically lower. 18% lower than the US. 16% lower than Japan. 12% below France and 8% below Germany. An advertisement for investment and jobs in Britain. And a rate that puts our country within sight of a 20% rate of business tax that would align basic rate income tax, the small companies rate and the corporation tax rate. I am also increasing the rate of the bank levy to 0.105 per cent from next January, so that the additional corporation tax cuts do not benefit the banks; and so our levy will raise the \u00a32.5 billion a year that we said it would. Duties This Mr Deputy Speaker brings me to the main duties. Let me start with alcohol duty. The Government will shortly be publishing its Alcohol Strategy to address the growing problem of alcohol abuse, and the many billions of pounds it costs our NHS and criminal justice system. But today I have no further changes to make to the duty rates set out by my predecessor. Turning to tobacco duty. Smoking remains the biggest cause of preventable illness and premature death in the UK. There is clear evidence that increasing the cost of tobacco encourages smokers to quit and discourages young people from taking it up. So duty on all tobacco products will rise by 5 percent above inflation. That&apos;s 37 pence on a packet of cigarettes. This will take effect at 6pm tonight. One area where I am today making substantial changes is gambling duties. The VAT treatment of gaming machines is being repeatedly challenged by operators in the courts. So I will introduce a new Machine Games Duty \u2013 with a standard rate of 20% and a lower rate for low stakes and prize machines of 5% of net takings. The current duty regime for remote gambling introduced by the last Government was levied on a &apos;place of supply&apos; basis. This allowed overseas operators to largely avoid it \u2013 and much of the industry has, as result, moved offshore. 90% of online gambling consumed by our citizens is now supplied from outside the UK. And the remaining UK operations are under pressure to leave. This is clearly not fair \u2013 and not a sensible way to support jobs in Britain. So we intend to introduce a tax regime based on the place of consumption: where the customer is based, not the company. And from this April we will also introduce double taxation relief for remote gambling. These changes will create a more level playing field, and protect jobs here. I turn now to fuel and vehicle excise duties. High oil prices have put real pressure on household budgets and on businesses. That is why we took action in last year&apos;s Budget to cut fuel duty so it is 6p lower than our predecessors planned. We have also scrapped the last Government&apos;s fuel duty escalator of annual above inflation rises, regardless of the oil price \u2013 and are today confirming the fair fuel stabiliser. Above inflation rises will only return if the oil price falls below \u00a345 on a sustained basis \u2013 currently equivalent to around $75 dollars. These measures mean that this Government has eased the burden on motorists by \u00a34.5 billion at a time when money is very short. I do not propose to make any further changes to the fuel duty plans already set out. I am increasing Vehicle Excise Duty by inflation only. To encourage fuel efficient fleets, we will extend the 100 per cent first year capital allowance for low emission business cars, reduce the CO2 threshold for the main capital allowance rates; and increase the percentage list price of company cars subject to tax. I can also announce that I am again freezing VED for road hauliers. Personal tax/ Tax avoidance Mr Deputy Speaker, I now turn to personal and property taxation. My goal is a tax system where the lowest paid are lifted out of tax altogether, while the tax revenues we get from the richest increases. Most wealthy people pay their taxes \u2013 and without them we could not begin to afford the public services on which the country depends. But under the last Government, it was the boast of some high earners that, with the help of their accountants, they were paying less in tax than their cleaners. I regard tax evasion and \u2013 indeed \u2013 aggressive tax avoidance \u2013 as morally repugnant. We&apos;ve increased both the resources and the number of staff working on evasion and avoidance at HMRC. Taken together, the anti-avoidance measures in this year&apos;s Finance Bill will increase tax revenue over the next five years by around \u00a31 billion \u2013 and protect a further \u00a310 billion that could have been lost. This week, we have signed a further agreement with the Swiss to stop UK residents from evading tax. We&apos;ve done all these things \u2013 but today we do even more. On coming to office, I asked Graham Aaronson QC to establish whether a General Anti-Avoidance Rule could work in the UK tax system. He recommended that such a rule would improve our ability to tackle tax avoidance without damaging the competitiveness of the UK as a place to do business. We agree. So we will introduce one. We will consult on the details of the new Rule and legislate for it in next year&apos;s Finance Bill. A major source of abuse \u2013 and one that rouses the anger of many of our citizens \u2013 is the way some people avoid the stamp duty that the rest of the population pays, including by using companies to buy expensive residential property. I have given plenty of public warnings that this abuse should stop. Now I&apos;m taking action. I am increasing the Stamp Duty Land Tax charge applied to residential properties over \u00a32 million bought into a corporate envelope. The charge will be 15%. And it will take effect today. We will also consult on the introduction of a large annual charge on those \u00a32 million residential properties which are already contained in corporate envelopes. And to ensure that wealthy non-residents are also caught by these changes, we will be introducing capital gains tax on residential property held in overseas envelopes. We are also announcing legislation today to close down the sub-sales relief rules as a route of avoidance. Let me make this absolutely clear to people. If you buy a property in Britain that is used for residential purposes, then we will expect stamp duty to be paid. That is the clear intention of Parliament. I will not hesitate to move swiftly, without notice and retrospectively if inappropriate ways around these new rules are found. People have been warned. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is fair when money is tight, and so many families could do with help, that those buying the most expensive homes contribute more. From midnight tonight, we will introduce a new Stamp Duty Land Tax rate of 7 per cent on properties worth more than \u00a32 million. I also intend to deal with the unlimited use of income tax reliefs. Let&apos;s be clear \u2013 most rich people pay a lot of tax. It is also right that we have tax reliefs that promote investment, support charitable giving and reflect genuine business losses. But it can&apos;t be right that some people make unlimited use of these reliefs year after year. Everyone in this country and particularly those with the highest incomes should contribute a fair share to the Exchequer. Some reliefs \u2013 like the Enterprise Investment Scheme and pension&apos;s relief are already capped \u2013 and I don&apos;t intend to make any significant changes to pensions relief in this Budget. But to make sure that those on the highest income contribute a fair share I am introducing a new cap on those reliefs that are currently uncapped. From next year anyone seeking to claim more than \u00a350,000 of these reliefs in any one year will have a cap set at 25 per cent of their income. We&apos;ve capped benefits. Now it&apos;s right to cap tax reliefs too. Mr Deputy Speaker, that brings me to rates of income tax and the additional rate of 50 pence. This tax rate is the highest in the G20. It is higher not just than the tax rate of America but also of major European countries like France, Italy, and Germany. It is widely acknowledged by business organisations and international observers as harming the British economy. Like the previous Chancellor who introduced it, I&apos;ve always said it was temporary. But I also said three years ago that I would not be prepared to reduce it while we were asking the whole public sector to accept a pay freeze. I will stick to those pledges. A 50p tax rate, with all the damage it does to Britain&apos;s competitiveness, can only be justified if it raises significant sums of money. In last year&apos;s Budget I asked HM Revenue and Customs to look at the evidence, and especially to look at the self-assessment tax receipts that have come in since this January. I am publishing their report today. And what it reveals is that the 50p tax rate has caused massive distortions. HMRC find that an astonishing \u00a316 billion of income was deliberately shifted into the previous tax year \u2013 at a cost to the taxpayer of \u00a31 billion, something that the previous Government&apos;s figures made no allowance for. Self assessment receipts this year are below forecast by some \u00a33.6 billion, while other tax receipts have held up. The increase from 40p to 50p raised just a third of the \u00a33 billion we were told it would raise. Of course, the previous Government initially proposed a rate of 45p and then increased that to 50p. Let me tell the House what HMRC say about the difference between 50p and 45p. Their figures tell the story. The direct cost is only \u00a3100 million a year. Indeed HMRC calculate the loss of other tax revenues may even cancel that out. In other words, it raises at most a fraction of what we were told \u2013 and may raise nothing at all. So from April next year, the top rate of tax will be 45p. No Chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing. It is as simple as that. And thanks to the other new taxes on the rich I&apos;ve announced today, we&apos;ll be getting five times more money each and every year from the wealthiest in our society. So the richest pay more. The economy benefits. Britain is competitive again. Now the Shadow Chancellor has said that the HMRC report is not enough and that the Office for Budget Responsibility should pass judgement. They have. Because these days the direct costing the Treasury applies to every Budget measure is independently assessed and certified by the OBR. And unlike the previous government they also assess the cash flow consequences of forestalling. When it comes to the \u00a3100m direct permanent costs of this measure, the OBR say &quot;we believe that this is a reasonable and central estimate&quot;. And they also assess as reasonable the estimate that the new taxes I&apos;ve introduced on the rich today directly raise five times that amount. That is half a billion pounds we can now use to help people on lower and middle incomes keep more of their earnings. Child benefit Mr Deputy Speaker, in the Spending Review, we took the difficult decision to remove child benefit from families with a higher rate taxpayer. I said then that I simply could not justify asking those earning \u00a315,000 or \u00a330,000 to go on paying Child Benefit to those earning \u00a380,000 or \u00a3100,000. And I stand by that principle. All sections of society must make a contribution to dealing with the deficit \u2013 without this measure we wouldn&apos;t get the job done. But I said I wanted to do this in a way that is fair and that does not involve setting up some new means tested tax credit system for millions of families. And I said I would set out exactly how this measure would be implemented in this Budget. We want to avoid a cliff-edge that means people lose all their Child Benefit when they earn just a pound more. So I can today confirm that instead of withdrawing child benefit all at once when people earn more than the higher rate threshold \u2013 the benefit will only be withdrawn when someone in the household has an income of more than \u00a350,000. And the withdrawal will be gradual, 1% of child benefit for every extra \u00a3100 earned over \u00a350,000 so there is no cliff-edge, and only those with an income of more than \u00a360,000 lose all their child benefit. This means an extra 750,000 families will keep some or all of their child benefit. 90% of all families will remain eligible for child benefit. We can afford to implement the child benefit policy in this way because instead of extending the full benefit of this Budget&apos;s increase in the personal allowance to all higher rate taxpayers as we did last year \u2013 we will pass on a quarter of the benefit to higher rate taxpayers, and spend the rest on helping families with children towards the bottom of the higher rate band. Personal allowance Mr Deputy Speaker, that brings me on to the personal allowance \u2013 and central goal of this Budget: which is to support working families. This Coalition Government believes that the best way to support working people on the lowest incomes is to take them out of tax altogether. And the best way of getting money directly into pockets of working families on middle incomes is to increase the amount of their earnings they can keep before they pay tax. That is why this Government has set itself the goal of raising the personal tax free allowance to \u00a310,000 \u2013 and we&apos;ve promised real increases every year to reach that. In my last two Budgets, we have made great strides forward. Last year, the personal allowance rose by \u00a31,000. In two weeks time, it will go up by another \u00a3630 to \u00a38,105. Together, these increases have taken over a million low income people out of tax. And today, I want to go much further and much faster. I am announcing the largest ever increase in the personal allowance \u2013 the amount people can earn tax free. From next April that amount will increase by \u00a31,100. Every working person on low or middle incomes will benefit. People will be able to earn up to \u00a39205 before they have to pay any tax. Millions of working people will be \u00a3220 better off every year. That&apos;s \u00a3170 better off after inflation. Because higher rate earners will also benefit, 24 million people earning less than \u00a3100,000 a year will gain from this measure. We are in touching distance of the goal of \u00a310,000 personal allowance that we all share. And I can tell the country that as a result of our Budgets, people working full time on the minimum wage, will have seen their income tax bill cut in half. And this coalition Government will have taken 2 million people on the lowest incomes out of tax altogether. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the middle of this Parliament, in difficult economic times, this coalition Government has not settled for a &quot;do nothing&quot; Budget. We have not ducked the difficult choices \u2013 we&apos;ve taken them head on. A competitive top rate of tax. More revenues from those best able to pay. Fewer reliefs. A tax cut for working people. Support for families. Low income earners taken out of tax altogether. Alongside it, one of the lowest rates of business tax in the world. A simpler tax code. And a country where its citizens know the tax they are paying \u2013 and what they are paying it for. We have achieved all this \u2013 and kept to our deficit plan. Let us be resolved. No people will strive as the British will strive. No country will adapt as the British will adapt. No country will value those who work as we will value them. Together, the British people will share in the effort and share the rewards. This country borrowed its way into trouble. Now we&apos;re going to earn our way out. I commend this Budget to the House."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/21/budget-2012-broadband-subsidy", "sentences": ["&quot;But we should not be complacent by saying it is enough to be the best in Europe when countries like Korea and Singapore do even better.&quot; Osborne also told parliament in his budget speech the \u00a350m smaller cities fund was agreed after lobbying from Brighton Kemptown MP Simon Kirby.", "The government&apos;s chief concern should be the provision of a service to those areas lacking decent broadband infrastructure before pursuing the likes of Korea and Singapore.&quot; A spokesman for BT said: &quot;Speeds of up to 80Mbps will be available to 10m homes this year and that number will rise over the next few years to close to 90% with the help of government funds."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-21T17:11:00Z", "title": "Budget 2012: 10 cities to compete for \u00a3100m ultra-fast broadband subsidy", "tags": ["Broadband", "Internet", "Technology", "Wi-Fi", "Telecoms", "Budget 2012", "Budget", "UK news", "Business"], "article": "Ten cities were named as beneficiaries of \u00a3100m of government money to help develop ultra-fast broadband and Wi-Fi in the budget \u2013 while smaller towns were also promised a further \u00a350m of investment for the first time. Chancellor George Osborne said Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle and London will bid for their share of a \u00a3100m &quot;super-connected cities&quot; subsidy, aimed at ensuring universal access to 100 Megabit per second internet links. Government officials said the money will be used in neighbourhoods where private companies such as BT Group and Virgin Media are unlikely to invest \u2013 but critics dismissed the chancellor&apos;s national internet strategy as &quot;half-hearted&quot;. According to the Treasury, by 2015 the money will deliver ultrafast broadband coverage to 1.7m households and 200,000 businesses in high growth areas as well as high-speed wireless broadband for 3 million residents. &quot;Two years ago Britain had some of the slowest broadband speeds in Europe; today our plans will deliver some of the fastest,&quot; said the chancellor. &quot;But we should not be complacent by saying it is enough to be the best in Europe when countries like Korea and Singapore do even better.&quot; Osborne also told parliament in his budget speech the \u00a350m smaller cities fund was agreed after lobbying from Brighton Kemptown MP Simon Kirby. His 2012 budget identified broadband as one of the government&apos;s four infrastructure priorities, alongside roads, railways, clean energy and water. But critics say the \u00a3150m for cities plus \u00a3530m already promised for rural broadband fall short of the investment needed to compete with better infrastructure abroad. While Osborne claimed the fastest speeds in the world would be available in British cities, millions of homes in other capitals including Paris and Moscow already have access to speeds well above 100Mbps because their telecoms companies are laying fibre cables from the exchange direct to homes. A direct fibre connection is considered future-proof because it can in theory deliver speeds of 1,000Mbps or more. BT&apos;s plans largely involve laying fibre to street cabinets and relying on copper wires for the last leg, which will restrict speeds. &quot;This half-hearted approach to funding broadband infrastructure short-changes the British economy and British society,&quot; said Morag Lucey of telecoms billing group Convergys. &quot;Against the backdrop of the \u00a3200bn being invested in energy and transport infrastructure, funding from all public sources for broadband up to 2015 is likely to be smaller than government revenue from the digital dividend spectrum auction.&quot; The government could raise up to \u00a34bn by auctioning airwaves next year for super-fast 4G mobile broadband, and Convergys says some of the money could be used to fund more fibre for the UK. Dana Pressman-Tobak, managing director of fibre broadband startup Hyperoptic, said: &quot;In order to compete in a global broadband arena the government needs to take a long-term view and focus on encouraging broadband providers to adopt fibre-to-the-building models in cities. Anything less is not ideal.&quot; BT has no targets to bring fibre direct to a stated number of buildings in the UK. Residential customers will be able to order it, with speeds of up to 300Mbps, but the cost is so high that initially only businesses are likely to pay for the connection. Hyperoptic believes public money would be better spent bringing broadband to rural areas, a view which was echoed by Julia Stent, director of telecoms at price comparison site uSwitch.com: &quot;Although there are still broadband blackspots and speed issues in some urban areas of the UK, we worry that the major towns and cities will speed ahead of the rest of the country in the premature quest to become fastest in the world. The government&apos;s chief concern should be the provision of a service to those areas lacking decent broadband infrastructure before pursuing the likes of Korea and Singapore.&quot; A spokesman for BT said: &quot;Speeds of up to 80Mbps will be available to 10m homes this year and that number will rise over the next few years to close to 90% with the help of government funds. Not only that, speeds of 300Mbps will be available on demand across that footprint ensuring that businesses and consumers across the UK have access to world leading speeds should they wish.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/budget-2012-reaction-live-updates", "sentences": ["The government&apos;s chief concern should be the provision of a service to those areas lacking decent broadband infrastructure before pursuing the likes of Korea and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-21T17:20:00Z", "title": "Budget 2012: full reaction", "tags": ["Budget 2012", "Business", "Budget", "Politics", "Economic policy", "Economics", "Money", "UK news"], "article": "George Osborne rose at 12.31pm to deliver his annual budget in parliament. His speech lasted just under an hour. Here is a round-up of reaction from City economists, interest groups, businesses and the public. Overall impression Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club described it as a &quot;steady budget after the turbulence of the autumn statement&quot;. Tax has stolen the show, and the cupboard seems bare in terms of new spending initiatives to promote growth.  This was generally a steady, but business-friendly, Budget. It is clear that the government is trying to improve the climate for business and it&apos;s now up to businesses themselves to deliver the goods. This was one of the most predictable budgets of recent times, with the many leaks leaving the chancellor with no rabbits to pull out of his hat. In previous budgets the focus has been on the huge spending cuts that will be implemented over the next five years. It&apos;s clear that the government has now moved on to reforming the tax system, seeing that as the key to promoting growth.  The economic and fiscal forecasts were remarkably similar to those published in November. As we suspected, there was a small war-chest available to the Chancellor, but he wisely decided against any large scale giveaways, which will no doubt go down well with financial markets.  John Cridland, CBI director-general, said:  Family budgets have been under great pressure, and by putting more money in the pockets of ordinary people, the Chancellor has provided a much-needed confidence boost. An extra 1% off corporation tax this year could make a big difference to investment intentions. Plans to reduce the top rate of tax to 45p by April 2013 will show our top and aspiring talent that this government wants them to create wealth here. With many calls on the Chancellor to spend money he didn&apos;t have, the best news for businesses is that he stuck to his guns and delivered a fiscally neutral programme. If businesses were looking for more, it was in the area of deregulation. For smaller businesses, things may not feel very different on the ground. It would have also have been a huge relief if the chancellor had taken the opportunity to get rid of the currently unworkable Carbon Reduction Commitment.  Terry Scuoler, who heads up the EEF manufacturers&apos; organisation, was less impressed by the Budget.  The chancellor began positively by setting out his thoughts for a new economic model. But, by the end of his speech, the task of rebalancing our economy looked as daunting as ever. Whilst there are some helpful measures, they fail to send a strong enough signal to growing manufacturers that now is the time to bring forward their investment plans and to do it here. The corporation tax cut is welcome but, on its own, it is not the silver bullet that will unlock the business investment our economy urgently needs.  And Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Sevices union, was outraged.  This is a budget for the rich, and is outrageous at a time when unemployment is rising, people&apos;s pay is being frozen, pensions are being attacked, and social security slashed. It is a very arrogant demonstration of the fact that we are not all in this together. There is an alternative. Invest in collecting the billions of pounds in tax that is avoided and evaded every year, and use the money raised to create useful jobs doing things like building homes and improving public transport.  Economic forecasts  John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, reckons there is still another \u00a3114bn of fiscal pain to come.  Before the Budget it was thought the chancellor might have some wiggle room due to a borrowing undershoot of several billion pounds this financial year. But much higher than expected public borrowing in February has reduced the projected borrowing undershoot to a minimal \u00a31bn this financial year so in fact there was no windfall to speak of for the chancellor to bank or spend.  At least no further austerity was needed in this Budget, allowing the chancellor to switch from fiscal firefighting to tax reform. We should remember though that there is still a lot of fiscal pain to come.   Paul Mumford, senior investment manager at Cavendish Asset Management, said today&apos;s budget doesn&apos;t paint too bad a picture for the UK economic outlook.   It is, broadly, a picture of an economy on the right track. The projected reductions in borrowing and inflation are heartening, if punchy and a bit suspicious. The measures aimed at promoting business and growth \u2013 from the reduced Corporation Tax rate to increased infrastructure investment \u2013 hold a lot of promise and are suited to a low inflation environment. More specifically it is also good to see this Government recognise and encourage investment in the unexploited opportunities relating to North Sea gas.  Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, has crunched the new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. He says the near-term GDP growth forecasts look realistic, but the longer-term predictions may be hard to achieve.   The new forecasts from the OBR provide a rare recent luxury for a UK chancellor with the growth forecasts being essentially unchanged from those contained in last November&apos;s autumn statement and the projected public finance shortfalls trimmed for the next five years. This is of welcome relief to the chancellor and spares him having to tighten overall fiscal policy further. Indeed, the chancellor has indicated that the budget is fiscally neutral over the next five years.  Having said that, projected GDP growth of 0.8% in 2012 (revised up from 0.7%) is still worryingly weak and hardly a matter for celebration. And the very disappointing public finance data for February itself highlights that there are serious risk to the government meeting its fiscal targets. We believe that the OBR&apos;s near-term GDP growth forecasts look realistic, but we are far from convinced that the UK will be able to grow by 2.7% in 2014 and by 3% in both 2015 and 2016 given the persistent fiscal squeeze, the need for consumers to deleverage for an extended period and still significant problems faced by banks. This suggests to us that the government could well struggle to achieve its longer-term fiscal goals.  Bank levy Wayne Weaver, UK banking tax leader within Deloitte&apos;s financial services tax practice, commented on the news that the bank levy will increase to 0.105% from 1 January 2013.   The chancellor announced today yet another rise in the levy rate charged on bank balance sheets, confirming his intention that the levy should raise \u00a32.5 billion pa. The 2011 yield has fallen short of his target and would fall further as bank&apos;s continue to deleverage and modify their funding profile.  Stuart Fraser, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, was not happy about the increase in the bank levy.  The City welcomes the chancellor&apos;s acceleration of the downward trend in corporation tax to 24% from next month \u2013 and 22% by 2014. This underlines the government&apos;s commitment to creating one of the most competitive corporate tax systems and will help us attract and retain world-leading institutions. It is disappointing, therefore, that this has been matched by an increase in the bank levy. As the Chancellor noted, we need a stable and predictable tax regime to ensure our international competitiveness is not damaged. The banks make a huge contribution to the Exchequer through the various taxes they pay and it is important that they continue to have confidence in the UK&apos;s fiscal environment.  Simon Chouffot, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said:   This is less a &apos;Robin Hood&apos; Budget and more Sheriff of Nottingham - protecting the privileged few at the expense of services for the poorest. Osborne is barking up the wrong tree in this Budget. He won&apos;t bring down the deficit and protect those at the bottom by letting the richest off the hook. If we are really going to &apos;earn our way&apos; out of this economic mess we should be asking the City of London to pay its share. Yet tweaking the bank levy will raise no new money from the Square Mile. This is another good Budget for bankers.  Pensioners Ros Altmann, Director-General, Saga said the Budget was an &quot;outrageous assault on decent middle-class pensioners&quot;.  This Budget contains an enormous stealth tax for older people. Over the next five years, pensioners with an income of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a324,000 will be paying an extra \u00a33 billion in tax while richer pensioners are left unaffected. There is nothing in this Budget for savers, there is nothing to improve the annuity market, nothing to appease the damage of quantitative easing and nothing to support ISA changes and shelter older people&apos;s money in cash. This Budget is terrible news for pensioners. It is good to hear that we will be able to harness the power of pension funds to improve UK Infrastructure but in short, this Budget is another shocking example of the Government&apos;s attack on poorer and older people. It is dramatically unfair.  VAT &quot;Who ate all the pies?&quot; asks Audrey Fearing, VAT partner at Ernst &amp; Young.   The chancellor today announced changes that nibbled away at the edges of the current food VAT reliefs. Consumers can expect to see the cost of some of their favourite sports nutrition drinks, as well as hot pies, pasties and the like to jump by 20%, with effect from October 2012. The changes are being made in order to level the playing field. Most other drinks are already subject to VAT at the standard rate, as is the sale of hot take away food.  Film and video games tax relief Ivan Dunleavy, chief executive of Pinewood Shepperton &quot;warmly&quot; welcomed the government&apos;s plan to introduce a tax incentive for high-budget television drama.   This is further evidence of the government&apos;s measured support for the creative industries. Pinewood identified this as a growth area back in 2009 in its evidence to the House of Lords communications select committee when it investigated the British film and television industries. This decision builds on the success of the film tax incentive which has helped deliver record levels of inward investment in the UK.  The TV Coalition, which comprises some of the biggest names in UK and international TV production, said the tax incentive could &quot;put an end to the exodus from the UK of dramas telling a British story&quot;.   Shows such as Birdsong, Strike Back, The Tudors, Camelot, Parade&apos;s End and the Julian Fellowes&apos; drama Titanic, were all made abroad in countries including South Africa and Canada in the last year to take advantage of tax incentives. Research carried out by the TV Coalition estimates that a targeted tax credit in the UK, similar to that received by the film industry, would generate at least \u00a3350m a year as a result of high-budget scripted production relocating to the UK, creating thousands of jobs and keeping British skills world-leading in a highly competitive economy.  TIGA, the trade association representing the UK Games Industry, welcomed the planned tax relief for the UK video games industry, which it had campaigned for. Its chief executive Richard Wilson said:  This is a brilliant decision by the government and terrific news for the UK video games industry. It is also a decisive victory won by TIGA through audacity, determination and endurance. Like a boxer knocked down by his opponent, we refused to accept defeat and kept getting back in the ring. This victory will benefit not just the UK games development and digital publishing sector but also the wider UK economy.  Corporation tax cuts Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry welcomed the corporation tax cuts:  The measures announced in the budget statement will help improve the UK&apos;s general business environment and allow pharmaceutical companies operating here to remain competitive in a global market. Specifically, moves towards a more competitive tax regime, including a further reduction of corporation tax so that the UK has among the lowest rates in Europe, are welcome. Our industry is of huge importance to the UK economy, generating a trade surplus of \u00a37bn every year and employing 67,000 people directly.   Saurav Chopra, chief executive of daily deals for businesses site Huddlebuy.co.uk, was not impressed with the corporation tax cuts.  Corporation tax cuts do nothing to help the millions of smaller companies that are struggling to survive. How is this going to help them invest more money back into their businesses and jobs? The chancellor claims to unashamedly back business. He should be ashamed of himself for not doing more to help businesses with soaring fuel costs.  Oil and gas Alan McCrae, energy tax partner at PwC, said:  Overall, the package is to be welcomed as a boost for investment in the oil and gas industry in the UK. The proposals to extend field allowances for oil and gas projects will help mitigate against the very high rates of tax suffered by oil and gas companies and will allow some projects to proceed that would otherwise not be viable. By careful targeting of the incentives, these projects should now be able to go ahead and, by doing so, will enable them to make a significant contribution to future government revenues from the oil and gas industry.  The plans to give oil and gas companies greater certainty regarding tax relief for their decommissioning costs will also help the investment climate. This will give them significant reassurance over this area of uncertainty which has been blocking potential transactions in the North Sea. These transactions are important to the future of the UK oil and gas sector as the region matures and further significant investment is required to maintain production.  Stamp duty Lucian Cook, director of Savills Research, said the new 15% stamp duty charge on homes over \u00a32m bought through copanies marks the end of the use of corporate vehicles to avoid stamp duty.   Irrespective of consultation on a large annual charge (that looks and feels like a mansion tax aimed at overseas owners, albeit by another name), a 15% stamp duty charge for such transactions is probably a sufficient deterrent. The big question is whether there will be an opportunity for those who have used this route be given to undo it without being hit by the proposed capital gains tax charge.  We&apos;ll also need to look at whether transfer from corporate to personal ownership triggers a stamp duty charge at 7%. Whilst for domestic here is clearly a risk that this is seen as retrospective in nature and overtly aggressive. That could impact on London&apos;s attractiveness to overseas buyers. However much depends on the detail.  Russell Quirk, director of estate agents eMoov.co.uk, said:  Few parts of the Budget smacked of such naked tokenism as the new top rate of stamp duty. The extra tax revenues generated by the new 7% rate will be small, given that these super-prime homes are such a small proportion of the market. But if his fiscal case is shaky, the chancellor&apos;s political calculations are flawless. Much of the pain of the new top rate will be felt by wealthy foreign buyers, who can&apos;t vote in Britain. At a stroke Mr Osborne is trying to sugarcoat the abolition of the 50p income tax rate and give a nod towards Lib Dem calls for a &quot;mansion tax&quot;. &quot;But such crude attempts to placate opponents, or even coalition partners, rarely make for good policy. With such a huge disparity in property prices across the UK, it will inevitably turn into a tax on London and the south east. It may be a clever wheeze to mitigate the political fallout from the abolition of the 50p tax rate. But ultimately this ill-thought-out measure is just another tax on aspiration, and a levy on success.  Nicholas Leeming, business development director at Zoopla.co.uk, said it&apos;s difficult to argue against a clampdown on stamp duty avoidance.  But knowing that some buyers are able to avoid it through various financial means is a difficult pill to swallow. Ensuring the Treasury is in receipt of all the tax due on all UK property transactions will help avoid a situation in the future where additional property levies are needed to make up the fiscal short-fall. However, policing the clampdown will be difficult and there are no guarantees that some transactions won&apos;t slip through the net. There is no doubting the government&apos;s intention, but it remains to be seen if this will be an effective measure.  Leeming deplored the end of the stamp duty holiday for first-time buyers.  As a proportion of GDP, the UK already has the highest property taxes in the world. But stamp duty for first-time buyers, in revenue terms, is the fiscal equivalent of a mosquito on a rhino&apos;s back. The government believes the stamp-duty holiday has not been significant in encouraging first-time buyers into the property market and that is why they are scrapping it, but there are a number of other factors which have prevented the surge of buyers the government was originally hoping for. High inflation, low savings rates and strict lending criteria have all contributed to low first-time buyer numbers, but these are starting to ease. Inflation is falling, and lenders are becoming more flexible in their criteria so now is not the time to throw another obstacle onto the tracks. Over the last two years the taxman has missed out on just \u00a3650m from first-time buyers who have bought within the \u00a3250,000 threshold but the 5% rate on properties over \u00a31m, introduced at the last budget, has pretty well covered this shortfall netting nearly \u00a3550m in just twelve months. Given the importance of first-time buyers in providing the first link in the property chain, the government should be doing everything possible not to deter these buyers and allow them to energise the rest of the market. However, it appears that the government is focusing on a short-term strategy and while initiatives such as the NewBuy scheme are intended to compensate, in reality this will only help a small number of buyers and do little to assist the property market as a whole.  James Wyatt of estate agents Barton Wyatt said the closure of the stamp duty loophole won&apos;t deter his foreign buyers.   Chancellor George Osborne might have kept his promise of coming &quot;down like a tonne of bricks&quot; on those who have avoided paying stamp duty by closing the tax loophole in today&apos;s Budget but this won&apos;t deter foreign nationals from buying property in UK. The UK is an extremely attractive place to buy property given the pound&apos;s weakness in recent years. In fact the UK is an all round favourite choice due to our dominant financial centre, superb sporting and cultural activities, some of the world&apos;s best restaurants and top drawer educational choices. Since the start of 2012, 35% of our business has been selling houses to overseas buyers and of those, 65% were from Eastern Europe (Russian, Ukraine &amp; Kazakhstan).  Broadband Julia Stent, director of telecoms at uSwitch.com, said about the planned funding for ultra-fast broadband in 10 major UK cities:  The government remains set on rolling out super-fast broadband to 90% of the UK, bringing faster speeds to digitally isolated rural areas that suffer from such sluggish speeds and poor connectivity that it&apos;s hardly worth having a broadband service at all. But it was clear from the Budget that top of the broadband agenda for the government is the quest to become fastest in the world, and not just Europe. Whilst funding earmarked for ultra-fast broadband in 10 UK cities is both ambitious and heartening, and will undoubtedly benefit technology companies looking to develop and expand in the UK, the primary concern should be the provision of a quality service to rural areas before pursuing the title of fastest broadband in the world.  Although there are still broadband blackspots and speed issues in some urban areas of the UK, we worry that the major towns and cities will speed ahead of the rest of the country in the premature quest to become fastest in the world. The government&apos;s chief concern should be the provision of a service to those areas lacking decent broadband infrastructure before pursuing the likes of Korea and Singapore. Bringing an appreciable average speed to those in rural areas who have been forever languishing in the slow lane must be of equal importance.  Life sciences The BioIndustry Association (BIA) was broadly pleased with the budget. Glyn Edwards, BIA interim chief executive, said:  We are pleased that the chancellor recommitted the government to supporting the life sciences sector in the Budget. The chancellor&apos;s plans to help enable the commercialisation of research, invest \u00a3100m in new university research facilities and to increase the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme grant limit are to be welcomed. However, the BIA believes that this commercialisation will be helped if innovative companies have access to additional sources of funding, such as that offered by our proposed Citizens Innovation Funds. These funds would make the government an enabler rather than a provider of much needed investment in innovative businesses.  Gambling The chancellor has announced a higher duty rate of 20% for the new Machine Games Duty from February 2013. Gareth Martyn, indirect tax director in PricewaterhouseCoopers&apos; betting and gaming team, said it woud pile more pressure on businesses that are already struggling.  This new rate will have a major impact on pub chains and leisure companies as a whole. For the leisure industry, this will almost certainly be the most significant announcement coming out of today&apos;s budget as many operators considered a revenue neutral MGD rate would be around 16/17%. Therefore the rate announced today could affect earnings at a time when many leisure businesses are already struggling.  Here is some more reaction from readers and charities.

Much of this profit is ultimately channelled to pension and insurance investors in the UK \u2013 British American Tobacco and Imperial are two of the largest companies listed on the London stock market. London&apos;s role as a hub of the multinational tobacco trade is in part a legacy of the British empire. While BAT sells very few cigarettes in the UK, for example, it is a big player in many emerging economies. In Turkey it sells Viceroy and Pall Mall brands; its Kent cigarettes are big sellers in Russia, while Gold Flake and John Player Gold Leaf are popular in Pakistan. Rothmans in Nigeria and Kent and Montana in Iran are also important for BAT. India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Iraq, Egypt and Yemen are also promising markets for the company. The big four tobacco firms \u2013 Philip Morris, BAT, Imperial and Japan Tobacco \u2013 insist they do not recruit new smokers in developing countries; rather, they grow sales by converting existing smokers of local tobacco products to their stable of aspirational Western brands \u2013 often &quot;safer&quot; products, they say. A British American Tobacco spokesperson said: &quot;There is constant speculation that we&apos;re breaking into emerging markets to avoid regulation. But this is not true. We didn&apos;t invent smoking, nor &apos;export&apos; it anywhere, and we have been in many of these developing markets for hundreds of years \u2013 in the case of Africa, India and Brazil, since the early 1900s. &quot;As disposable income grows around the world, particularly in developing countries, more smokers are upgrading to premium brands rather than low quality local alternatives \u2013 and this doesn&apos;t just apply to cigarettes.&quot; And yet almost 80% of the 6 million people killed last year by tobacco-related illnesses were from low- and middle-income countries, according to new research from health lobby campaigners. The study identified tobacco as the No 1 killer in China, where smoking is said to cause 1.2 million deaths annually. It is also blamed for more than a third of male deaths in Kazakhstan and in Turkey \u2013 other major smoking nations. China accounts for about 40% of the global market for tobacco. The big four western firms have been eager to gain a foothold, but the industry remains firmly in state control. The New Tobacco Atlas \u2013 produced by the World Lung Foundation and the American Cancer Society and published in Singapore at the World Conference on Tobacco or Health \u2013 found that tobacco-related deaths had tripled in the last decade: they now account for more than 15% of male deaths and 7% of female deaths. The study indicated cigarettes had become an average of 21.7% more affordable in low and middle-income countries. Health campaigners insist the industry is in fact lobbying hard to block international standards on tobacco control. &quot;The tobacco industry thrives on ignorance of the true harms of tobacco and using misinformation to subvert health policies that could save millions,&quot; said Peter Baldini, chief executive of the World Lung Foundation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/22/michael-bloomberg-smoking-pledge", "sentences": ["&quot;There is nothing that any of us here will do that will save as many lives as stopping people smoking,&quot; said Bloomberg in New York, before he left for this week&apos;s world conference on tobacco and health in Singapore to make his announcement.", "Singapore was the first country in the world to ban tobacco advertising, in 1970."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-22T04:15:00Z", "title": "Michael Bloomberg makes $220m pledge to stub out global smoking habit", "tags": ["Smoking", "Michael Bloomberg", "Health", "Philanthropy", "New York", "World news", "Society", "US news"], "article": "The mayor of New York has bolstered a global crusade against tobacco with a donation of a quarter of a billion dollars to curb the growth of the industry in low- and middle-income countries. Michael Bloomberg, who introduced a ban on smoking in public places in New York despite warnings that it would destroy tourism and alienate voters, is putting unprecedented sums of money into anti-smoking efforts in poorer parts of the world where the industry is increasingly looking for expansion. About 80% of deaths from smoking-related diseases last year were in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Lung Foundation&apos;s Tobacco Atlas published on Wednesday. Smoking is the biggest killer in China, causing 1.2 million deaths a year and is the leading cause of male deaths in Turkey (38%) and Kazakhstan (35%). It is the biggest killer of women in the Maldives (25%) and the US (23%). &quot;There is nothing that any of us here will do that will save as many lives as stopping people smoking,&quot; said Bloomberg in New York, before he left for this week&apos;s world conference on tobacco and health in Singapore to make his announcement. &quot;It is a scourge all over the world \u2013 more so in the places where education isn&apos;t up to the standards that it is in the developed world, and the tobacco companies certainly try to target people who are poor and uneducated in their advertisements. I don&apos;t think there is any question about that.&quot; Bloomberg is the 12th wealthiest person in the US with a net worth of $19.5bn (\u00a312.3bn), according to the Forbes rich list last September. The $220m grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies will refill its fighting fund \u2013 $375m has been spent over the past six years. In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation joined in, announcing an additional $125m over five years. Bloomberg&apos;s money is targeted primarily at five populous countries where smoking is a big and growing problem \u2013 Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia and Russia \u2013 and 15 others, which, in total, are home to two-thirds of the world&apos;s smokers. Grants will go to organisations that can support and encourage governments to pass anti-tobacco laws, such as smoking bans in public places, advertising restrictions and increases in the price of cigarettes, in line with the World Health Organisation&apos;s Global Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. &quot;We want to get governments to raise taxes,&quot; said Bloomberg, remembering the days when children could get a pack of cigarettes from a slot machine in New York for 25\u00a2; now they cost $11. &quot;It is a real disincentive for kids \u2013 they don&apos;t have the disposable income.&quot; And he wants to de-glamorise smoking by persuading TV and film companies not to feature stars with cigarettes in their hands. But governments in low- and middle-income countries which try to use the law to curb smoking are increasingly being challenged by major tobacco companies. Bloomberg&apos;s money will help the likes of Uruguay fight a legal action brought by Philip Morris International. Using a Geneva-based holding company as the complainant, Philip Morris is alleging that large and graphic health warnings imposed by the Uruguayan government on cigarette packets violate a trade agreement between the South American country and Switzerland. The case is being heard at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes of the World Bank. It is important, say campaigners, because if Philip Morris wins, other small countries will be intimidated and less likely to face up to large tobacco firms. &quot;If PMI is allowed to compromise Uruguay&apos;s ability to protect its citizens, this will serve as a go-ahead to tobacco companies to challenge other nations&apos; tobacco control laws,&quot; warns Bloomberg Philanthropies. British American Tobacco has also threatened trade action against Namibia over the size of health warnings on packs. Dr Judith Mackay, one of the authors of the World Lung Foundation Tobacco Atlas and a well-known anti-tobacco campaigner, said it showed &quot;the whole drive from the high income to the low-income countries&quot;, adding that the tobacco companies &quot;are now challenging legislation from Scotland to Australia to Iran to Latin America. This is one of the biggest developments we have seen and one of the most sinister. The WHO has said it has got lawyers and will help. This is a form of harassment and intimidation of other countries that might face challenges.&quot; In some countries, there is no ban on tobacco companies giving free gifts and sponsoring sports events and the arts, she said, and a lack of transparency meant only in a few countries would politicians have to declare who funded their election campaigns. &quot;There may be vast undersea funding about which we know nothing,&quot; Mackay said. There are success stories. Even though China&apos;s enormous and profitable tobacco company is a state-controlled monopoly industry, the government has ratified the tobacco control framework convention and Harbin, a city in northern China, has brought in a smoking ban in public places. Turkey backed a nationwide ban in 2008, while Bloomberg-funded organisations rallied public support. Singapore was the first country in the world to ban tobacco advertising, in 1970.

Already bound by myriad political and trade agreements, these 10 countries comprising Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) account for 9% of the world&apos;s population \u2013 with some 600 million people, twice the size of the US \u2013 and have a combined GDP of $1.8tn (\u00a31.14tn). China has long had one foot in the region, which is home to rich oil, gas, mineral, hydropower, rice, palm oil, coffee and timber resources. By 2015, however, bilateral trading between China and Asean, which began with a fair-trade agreement in 2010, will have more than doubled from $231bn to $500bn, making China Asean&apos;s biggest trading partner, according to China expert Dr Ken Shao of Australia&apos;s Murdoch University. &quot;China&apos;s investment in south-east Asia is growing at a double-digit speed annually,&quot; says Shao. &quot;In 2011 to 2012, China&apos;s top six investment destinations in south-east Asia were Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore \u2013 with textiles, electrics, steel, shipbuilding, chemical and IT popular investment themes.&quot; Beijing hopes to pull even more purse strings by establishing a regional Asean bank \u2013 a so-called &quot;mini Asian development bank&quot; \u2013 to help small and medium businesses invest, fund infrastructure projects and promote development in south-western China, independent sources recently told Reuters. Already the provider of more loans to developing countries than the World Bank, according to research by the Financial Times, China finances numerous agricultural, hydropower, housing, railway, roadworks and mining projects in the region, particularly in Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Vietnam and the Philippines. While many Asean countries have welcomed China&apos;s investment \u2013 such as the $6bn Brunei-Chinese refinery deal inked in November \u2013 some have distanced themselves geopolitically from Beijing. Last year Burma shelved a Chinese-funded $3.6bn dam on the Irrawaddy river, citing environmental concerns, though analysts believe the move was intended to block China&apos;s military and political influence over the country. While the long-term impact of China&apos;s many hydroelectric projects are increasingly questioned both regionally and abroad, from Beijing they can be seen as a part of a wider effort to &quot;divert water resources for Chinese use&quot;, according to Dr Larry Wortzel of the US-China Security Review Commission, as well as &quot;move and control low-level value manufacturing, like textiles, to south-east Asia, [and] have access to rice, vegetables and fruits, and extract natural resources&quot;. Wildlife groups say Chinese demand for traditional medicine and exotic meats accounts for its strong hold over the illegal wildlife trade across south-east Asia, including tigers, turtles and pangolins. Militarily, China is amping-up its presence in the region, where it has historically supplied assistance to Burma, Cambodia and Laos. The region&apos;s best-funded military is engaged in a longstanding dispute with the Philippines over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea (which many other Asean nations also hold partial claim to) and will not shy from using force to intimidate its neighbours, says Wortzel, as Beijing &quot;will not yield on territorial claims in the region&quot;. &quot;One advantage Beijing has it that the Asean states have avoided becoming a military alliance \u2013 and they do not fully trust each other \u2013 so Beijing faces no major foe,&quot; Wortzel says. Next month, however, the Philippines and US will hold joint military drills near the Spratly Islands \u2013 a move China has not yet responded to."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/mar/23/apps-rush-starred-angry-birds", "sentences": ["It aggregates the deals from other services including Groupon and LivingSocial, and covers 500 cities in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Singapore.Android EARS|ONLY This iOS app offers curated playlists of dance music chosen &quot;by top DJs in electronic music&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-23T10:22:34Z", "title": "Apps Rush: Starred, Angry Birds Space, Fingerprint: Whole Wide World, Move the Turtle, Rollerhog, Pair and more", "tags": ["Apps", "iPhone", "iPad", "BlackBerry", "Windows Phone", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers", "Media", "Technology", "Twitter", "Angry Birds"], "article": "A selection of 19 new apps for you today: Starred iPhone app Starred promises that it &quot;turns Twitter Favourites into something useful&quot;.

The joint venture with China Eastern Airlines will target the lucrative Chinese air travel market, starting in 2013. The airline, branded Jetstar Hong Kong, is an extension of Qantas&apos;s low-cost carrier, Jetstar, which operates routes in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan. Jetstar Hong Kong will fly short-haul routes to China, Japan, South Korea and south-east Asia. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said there was tremendous potential for the airline in Asia. &quot;Establishing Jetstar Hong Kong in the heart of Asia and on the doorstep of mainland China is a historic opportunity to continue the successful expansion of the Jetstar brand in this region,&quot; he said. Qantas says Jetstar Hong Kong will be only the second low-cost carrier based in greater China. Fares would be pitched 50% lower than existing full service carriers, said the Jetstar Group chief executive, Bruce Buchanan. &quot;Jetstar&apos;s vision is to make travel more affordable for millions of people across Asia,&quot; he said. Hong Kong is a major world aviation hub, with around 40 million passengers flying through each year. China&apos;s travel market accounts for 300 million passengers a year and is forecast to grow to 450 million by 2015, according to Qantas. The announcement came after a turbulent year for the Qantas group. Last October, executives grounded all planes amid disputes with three unions. It cost Qantas more than A$70m (\u00a345m) and stranded tens of thousands of passengers worldwide. Relations between the unions and Qantas management had deteriorated after the airline announced plans for restructuring and moving some operations to Asia. Qantas remains locked in binding arbitration with one of the unions, the TWU, which represents ground staff working in baggage, freight and catering. In 2010 the airline hit the news when one of its Rolls Royce engines exploded, forcing the Airbus A380 to make an emergency landing in Singapore. The entire A380 fleet was grounded as a result. And in July 2008 an oxygen cylinder exploded on board a Qantas 747, blowing a hole in the luggage hold and forcing an emergency landing in Manila. The Jetstar Hong Kong announcement came on the same day Qantas began selling tickets for its first biofuel flight. The Airbus A330 flight between Sydney and Adelaide will run on a biofuel derived from used cooking oil, split 50:50 with conventional jet fuel and is scheduled to take place on Friday 13 April."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/mar/26/creative-industries-emerging-markets-growth", "sentences": ["His global creative agency Iris has burgeoned from 30 employees in 1999 to 1,000 employees in offices from London to Singapore.", "Millner said that he and his colleagues at Iris had found it easier to expand in Singapore than Germany and that it was more challenging still to set up their business in China, but it was worth the risk given that the rewards are much greater."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-26T15:21:01Z", "title": "Lights, camera, business action plan", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network"], "article": "The UK has a long history of being a creative nation and Britain&apos;s innovative and entrepreneurial spirit is celebrated around the world. As a proportion of its GDP the UK has the largest creative industries sector in the world, contributing 6-8% of the nation&apos;s output and employing about 1.5 million people. Britain has enjoyed particular success in sectors such as music, publishing, video games, film, design and fashion. Traditionally the UK&apos;s creative industry has benefited from close ties with the continent and EU membership but, with experts predicting that Europe faces another year of poor economic performance in 2012, how can the sector ensure future growth? Should businesses be turning their attention to new emerging economies? To discuss these issues, the Guardian recently hosted a seminar in central London, which was sponsored by the Marketing Agencies Association (MAA). An audience, mostly from the marketing and advertising sectors, were invited to take part in the seminar and to post questions to a panel of experts from the creative industry. The panel were: Mary Honeyball, the Labour MEP for London; Eric van der Kleij, the CEO of Tech City; and Ian Millner, the joint global CEO of Iris Worldwide and the chair of the MAA. There was broad agreement from the panel that the EU offered the UK&apos;s creative industry some benefits, but it was MEP Mary Honeyball, a member of the Culture and Education Committee at the European Parliament for the past eight years, who was its strongest proponent. &quot;I believe that the EU helps our creative industry in two key, tangible ways,&quot; said Honeyball. &quot;Firstly, UK businesses gain a great deal from being in the single market (where there is free movement of goods, people, services and capital) and secondly, the creative industries receive funding and loans from the EU, which they would otherwise probably not have access to.&quot; EU funding One of the key beneficiaries of European funding from the EU&apos;s Media Programme, which supports audiovisual businesses, has been the UK&apos;s TV and film industry. With the success of recent dramas such as Downton Abbey, the sector has become the market leader in Europe and it generates about \u00a33.3bn each year in revenue from European markets. As this help from the EU was discussed, audience member Scott Lenik of Pulse Group asked: &quot;Who have been the key beneficiaries of the grant?&quot; While the audiovisual industry receives financial support from the EU, many audience members felt other creative sectors seem to miss out on funding.  Honeyball conceded that this was indeed the case, but emphasised that this would hopefully change soon. &quot;We are about to give the cultural and creative industries a massive boost through our recently unveiled &apos;Creative Europe&apos; programme,&quot; she said. &quot;This will broaden the range of creative sectors which the EU can help and increase the current spend by 37% to \u20ac1.8bn [\u00a31.5bn] in the period 2014-2020. It will help thousands of people working in cinema, TV, culture, music, the performing arts, heritage and related areas.&quot; Honeyball was also keen to highlight a new loan facility, which will be underwritten by the EU and will make accessing money a lot easier for small, creative businesses at a time when banks view them as a risk. Honeyball said the Culture Committee is determined to make accessing funding simpler and less bureaucratic. Another member of the panel, Ian Millner, spoke of his own positive personal experience of the EU, but also its limitations. His global creative agency Iris has burgeoned from 30 employees in 1999 to 1,000 employees in offices from London to Singapore. Millner said that the main benefits of working with the EU were the openness, stability and flexibility it offered, but for him that largely &quot;defined success in the past&quot;. Millner then observed that because travel around Europe is so easy, our cultures are becoming more homogenous, and the points of difference among, say British, French and German creativity are becoming ever smaller and therefore, &quot;they don&apos;t need more British creativity thank you very much&quot;. He also pointed out that other countries in Europe benefit from being closer to stronger -manufacturing bases. Similarly, Eric van der Kleij, &quot;the government&apos;s entrepreneur in residence&quot;, and CEO of Tech City, one of the fastest-growing technology, digital and creative clusters in Europe, spoke of some of the advantages of the UK&apos;s relationship with Europe: &quot;The main thing we get from Europe, apart from contracts and jobs, is an incredible talent pool which is accessible without much border hindrance.&quot; One of the key discussion points at the seminar was to what extent the British creative industry needed to change and broaden its horizons. Having overseen the growth of one of the world&apos;s leading creative agencies, Millner is well-placed to judge whether our creative industries should be looking beyond Europe. &quot;Just as the EU offers ease and stability, the rest of the world offers potential and I am not sure that we are spending enough time discussing what British creativity can do to unlock it, because this is where there is opportunity,&quot; he said. &quot;The farther afield you travel, the more dramatic the cultural differences and therefore the benefits you can see creatively are greater. For example, we need to be looking to the Commonwealth and south-east Asia for ideas and funding and to be bolder.&quot; Van der Kleij agreed that Britain should be less parochial and pointed out that in his own company every time they employed a foreign national &quot;something special happened&quot; and that it was &quot;at the intersection of culture&quot; you found real creativity and innovation. He suggested that one of the reasons for the downfall of Kodak, which recently filed for bankruptcy, was that it was too inward-facing and didn&apos;t create pioneering strategies. Van der Kleij&apos;s comments were backed up by audience member Paul Turner, also of Pulse Group, who had previously worked in a company with foreign nationals and found it a very positive experience. The only point he questioned was whether with such a melting pot we could then define it as British creativity, or whether it would be more accurate to call it &quot;global creativity&quot;. In response to this question, Millner replied: &quot;We just want Britain to be interesting and attractive to people all over the world and, if it can be demonstrated that we have a powerful, strategic asset called creative services, that will mean that HQs are built here and that will attract jobs. My perspective is that if we can regain our edge, British creativity will be a key part of our recovery and people will want to invest more money in Britain.&quot; But in Britain we are not alone in tending to be a bit parochial. Millner said that he and his colleagues at Iris had found it easier to expand in Singapore than Germany and that it was more challenging still to set up their business in China, but it was worth the risk given that the rewards are much greater. Although there is no specific help at an EU level for British businesses in the creative sector wishing to explore new markets in other parts of the world, help is on hand from the government body UK Trade and Investment (UKTI). With 152 offices in 96 countries across the world, the organisation is extremely well-placed to enhance a company&apos;s cultural understanding of new markets and, as Van der Kleij pointed out, &quot;having that commercial diplomacy in a country can be extremely helpful&quot;. UKTI also does a lot of showcasing of the UK as a springboard into Europe. Van der Kleij also urged the British creative industry to lose its reservedness and cited the example of Tech City, which locals have branded &quot;Silicon Roundabout&quot; due to its location, which surrounds Old Street roundabout in London. He said: &quot;We are investing \u00a39bn into this amazing infrastructure, which stretches from Shoreditch to the Olympic Park, so as a nation we need to start thinking less parochially and be less reserved.&quot; The future With so much uncertainty surrounding the European economy, there is definitely some validity in Millner&apos;s and Van der Kleij&apos;s argument about looking to pastures new beyond Europe. However, Honeyball reminded those at the seminar that the EU isn&apos;t a monolith but a huge emerging market and it still offered the UK&apos;s creative industries numerous possibilities, alluding to the new Eastern member states, which she said shared a lot of similarities with other emerging economies. But Honeyball didn&apos;t deny that there were opportunities in other parts of the world, she just emphasised that we shouldn&apos;t give up on our ties with the EU. The good news is that with the Creative Europe programme currently being debated in the European parliament, by 2014 more sectors from the British creative industries should be receiving funding and this should give the industry a significant boost to succeed at home, in Europe or in the wider world.

But with their own club&apos;s future looking bleak and the fridges of Queen&apos;s Celtic fans stuffed with all the jelly and ice-cream they&apos;re keeping chilled for the party they&apos;ll throw &quot;when the Rangers die&quot;, the residents of Ibrox mustered enough pride to deny their bitter rivals the opportunity to wrap up the Euro Disnae League title at their own Big Hoose yesterday, in a surreal encounter that was nowhere near as exciting as the five goals and four sendings-off listed in the post-match stats suggest. &quot;My sending off is a joke,&quot; moaned Queen&apos;s Celtic manager Neil Lennon, who was told not to return to his technical area after approaching the referee at half-time, then ended up watching the match on the goggler in the press room after being advised it wouldn&apos;t be safe for him to watch from the stands. &quot;I spoke quite quietly and coldly to the referee in the tunnel. I didn&apos;t swear and didn&apos;t point any fingers. I told him I wasn&apos;t happy with his first-half performance.&quot; Lennon might have been better advised to ignore the referee and focus on swearing and pointing fingers at players who were beaten far more comfortably by beleaguered O&apos;Rangers than the 3-2 scoreline would have those who didn&apos;t watch the match believe. Apart from 60 seconds or so of tense injury time at the death, the result was never in doubt and the final whistle prompted scenes of unbridled jubilation in the Rangers technical area, not least from manager Ally McCoist, who made the kind of face that suggested he&apos;d just come \u2026 first in a tightly-fought episode of A Question of Sport against a team captained by snooker&apos;s John Parrott. With the Queen&apos;s Celtic likely to wrap up the title against St Johnstone on their own turf next weekend, the future looks considerably bleaker for O&apos;Rangers. That said, despite boasting finances most right-thinking folk wouldn&apos;t touch with a very long stick, as many as five different investors have expressed interest in rescuing the club from tax-knack induced oblivion. It emerged today that a Singapore-based consortium threw their bowler hat in the ring last Friday, joining Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy, the Blue Knights consortium, Club 9 Sports and an as yet unnamed party the Fiver really hopes, for the sake of cheap yuks, is backed by the notoriously rich Vatican.

BITS AND BOBS Glenn Hoddle has thrown his hat into the ring to become England manager - an appointment which, if the team are saddled with him, would neatly prove his controversial theory that the down-on-their-luck are being punished for their former sins. &quot;If I were to die tomorrow, my life would be incomplete,&quot; he added, posing an interesting medical conundrum. Should Roy Hodgson be given the England job, he can already count on the experience of an armband controversy after he ripped one commemorating the West Brom legend Ray Barlow from his arm during the Baggies&apos; 3-1 defeat to Newcastle. &quot;I meant no disrespect by it to such a great player,&quot; he parped.

Meanwhile, in good old Blighty, it required four people to come up with five talking points from the weekend&apos;s Premier League action, none of which even mention a book let alone a quest for betterment.

Brazil was the fastest growing market, recording an increase over 2010 of 48%, with Singapore and Taiwan close behind on 44% each. The volume of exports was up by a healthy 19% showing strong worldwide demand and growth was not simply driven by producers raising prices. In 2010, volume was only marginally ahead at 2%. The Scotch Whisky Association said the value of exports was up 23%. The USA was the biggest importer, followed by France, although by volume France was ahead. Rising demand in emerging and more mature markets has resulted in export values increasing by an average of 10% a year over the last five years, said the Scotch Whisky Association. Exports contribute \u00a3134 per second to the UK balance of trade. The value of exports to the USA broke the \u00a3600m barrier for the first time in 2011 to reach \u00a3654.9m \u2013 up 31% on 2010. Exports to France increased 27% to \u00a3535.4m. Affluent young professionals in fast growing economies are increasingly developing a taste for Scotch, viewing the drink as &quot;a status symbol&quot; and &quot;trendy,&quot; said SWA&apos;s Rosemary Gallagher. To meet increased demand, distillers are investing record amounts in production capacity across Scotland. In the last four years the Scotch whisky industry has invested more than \u00a31bn in new facilities. The industry employs 10,300 people in Scotland and another 35,000 across the UK supply chain. Gavin Hewitt, chief executive of the SWA, said: &quot;Despite continuing economic uncertainty, Scotch continues to meet increasing demand from all corners of the globe. It continues to appeal to consumers in countries such as the USA and France and is being enjoyed by younger professionals in newer markets in Asia and Latin America.&quot; Exports have increased for seven consecutive years, contributing to delivering an export-led recovery, a focus for the UK and Scottish governments. But some markets saw a decline, including Spain and South Korea. Hewitt added that securing fair market access and reducing tariffs is now a priority for the whisky industry. A free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea came into force in July. India is a priority for this year. Hewitt said: &quot;We are hopeful a free trade agreement can be signed which will lead to a reduction in the onerous 150% import tariff. The industry is investing in Scotland to ensure it can seize these overseas opportunities.&quot; The SWA figures derive from HM Revenue &amp; Customs data. They are based on individual company declarations of the export customs value and volume of shipments to each market (which may not be the final destination of the consignment). The figures do not reflect the mark-up charged by retailers. Scotland&apos;s Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: &quot;Scotland is rightly hailed as a land of food and drink, which is underpinned by the record exports achieved in both areas in 2011. &quot;This demonstrates that people around the world are appreciating the high quality and delicious products that Scotland&apos;s larder has to offer. &quot;With exports increasing by more than a fifth, the whisky industry has seen hugely impressive year-on-year growth, while Scotland&apos;s seafood remains at the heart of our food exports offering. It&apos;s also heartening to see a substantial 60% boost in fruit and vegetable exports.&quot; James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, said: &quot;Our food and drink industry is Scotland&apos;s biggest growth story right now. &quot;These new figures mean that the 10 year target industry set itself in 2007 - to grow our total exports by 38% - has been achieved six years early. &quot;Whisky has been a trailblazer across the globe. But our food sector is now following its lead, with exports up a staggering 62% in just four years, as our reputation as a land of food and drink grows day-by-day.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/mar/27/london-2012-ioc-legacy", "sentences": ["It was the legacy promises made by the London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe, in Singapore in 2005 that helped secure the Games, with the IOC particularly concerned to engage with a new generation."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-27T22:59:01Z", "title": "London 2012 has 'raised the bar' on legacy planning says IOC president", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "London", "International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, has hailed the &quot;legacy blueprint&quot; laid down by the London Games before Wednesday&apos;s meeting with the prime minister, David Cameron, and its final inspection visit. It was the legacy promises made by the London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe, in Singapore in 2005 that helped secure the Games, with the IOC particularly concerned to engage with a new generation. In order to create continued competition among potential host cities, the IOC also recognises the need to prove that investing in an Olympics can be a driver of regeneration and leave a lasting legacy. Rogge said that London had delivered on its promises and created a new blueprint for future hosts. &quot;London has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy. We can already see tangible results in the remarkable regeneration of east London. This great historical city has created a legacy blueprint for future Games hosts,&quot; said Rogge. Cameron said the opportunity to deliver on the myriad legacy promises made on behalf of the Games was the government&apos;s biggest challenge and the greatest opportunity. &quot;Legacy has been built into the DNA of London 2012. But by definition, of course, the true legacy of London 2012 lies in the future,&quot; he said. &quot;Though much has been done, I am acutely aware that the drive to embed and secure the benefits of London 2012 is still to come. That is our biggest challenge. It&apos;s also our greatest opportunity.&quot; The focus on legacy is part of a government drive to reframe the debate and highlight the benefits as justification for investing \u00a39.3bn of public money in them at a time of austerity. The government has been stung by criticism over areas of the promised legacy, most obviously in sports participation where a target introduced by Labour to use the Games to inspire one million more people to play more sport had to be dropped amid negligible progress, and will today publish a new 80-page document called Beyond 2012 as part of an attempt to redress the balance. Cameron and the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, are expected to highlight the progress made in securing a lasting legacy for six of the eight permanent Olympic venues, despite the ongoing debate over the future of the iconic stadium. Another recurring theme is the extent to which the Olympics have proved a boon to British business and acted as a calling card for the UK economy, as well as driving the regeneration of east London. There has also been criticism of the decision to slash the dedicated school sport budget by more than half only 18 months before the Olympics. But Hunt and the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, will counter it by pointing to the new School Games scheme backed by Sainsbury&apos;s \u2013 a network of inter and intra school sports competitions culminating in finals in the Olympic Park \u2013 and a reworked plan to encourage more grass-roots youth sport. The IOC&apos;s co-ordination commission delegation, led by its chair, Denis Oswald, will start its final two-day inspection visit following the meeting at Downing Street, which will also be attended by Lord Coe. It is the last of 10 visits to monitor London&apos;s progress that began in 2006 and, like those that preceded it, will largely consist of a series of in-depth updates on various aspects of the London 2012 preparation. As well as the latest &quot;Get Ahead of the Games&quot; transport campaign to try to prepare businesses and the public for potential bottlenecks during the Games, the IOC will also be updated on the plans for the last phase of the sometimes controversial ticketing process."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/mar/28/dominique-strauss-kahn-diplomatic-immunity-scandal", "sentences": ["The next morning he was out in Cinnamon Gardens, a suburb of Colombo, carrying logs for the fire,&quot; said Mr Hensley, who also served as New Zealand&apos;s high commissioner to Singapore as well as a posting in Washington, DC."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-28T14:05:00Z", "title": "Dominique Strauss-Kahn: diplomatic immunity's greatest hits", "tags": ["US news", "Dominique Strauss-Kahn", "United Nations", "World news", "US politics", "Law", "International criminal court"], "article": "From petty thieves and fine-dodgers to drunk-drivers and outright murderers, &quot;diplomatic immunity&quot; has been the cry of a rogues&apos; gallery of accused international miscreants plunged into hot water overseas. Former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn is the latest to try to claim its protection in his bid to get a civil case brought by the New York hotel maid he is alleged to have assaulted struck out. A look at the history of those claiming the status puts the one-time French presidential hope in a league with some rum fellows, red-faced diplomats and a Burmese ambassador who took immunity to a shocking extreme, or so the story goes. Mexico: BlackBerry thief In one of the more bizarre incidents of diplomatic immunity being claimed, a Mexican press attach\u00e9 sought to evade the law after being caught with the BlackBerrys of several White House staffers. The theft took place in 2008 during a bilateral get-together in New Orleans. After the devices had been placed on a table outside the meeting room, Rafael Quintero Curiel picked up a handful and headed to the exit. He made it to the airport before authorities picked him up. After initially denying the theft, he owned up after being shown video footage of him being caught red-handed. Claiming immunity, he headed back to Mexico where he was promptly sacked. Libya: London police murder     Police officers try to revive PC Yvonne Fletcher after she was shot outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984 during an anti-Gaddafi protest. Libyan officials say the suspect might not be extradited. Photograph: Mohamed Maklovf / Rex Features    The murder of police officer Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984 resulted in the UK cutting all diplomatic ties with Tripoli. No one was prosecuted over her death, and embassy staff claimed diplomatic immunity before being deported. The young police officer was shot during a demonstration against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, and the bullet was thought to have come from inside the building. Last year, it was reported that prosecutors had named junior diplomat Abdulmagid Salah Ameri as a suspect. He would have to be stripped of any immunity if charges were to be brought. United States: killings in Pakistan      Raymond Davis seen here being taken to a court in Lahore. US senator John Kerry said he was hopeful that the case could be resolved. Photograph: Arif Ali/AFP/Getty Images    Already shaky relations between Washington and Islamabad were dealt a further blow in January 2011 by the killing of two Pakistanis by CIA operative Raymond Davis. The US citizen claimed the pair were trying to rob him at the time of the incident. But despite claims of diplomatic immunity, Davis was initially jailed over charges of murder and illegal weapons possession. He was eventually released after paying off the relatives of the dead men under a deal that the families said they were forced to accept. Zaire: rent at the UN Poverty-stricken Zaire attempted to avoid paying rent at the home of its UN mission by citing diplomatic immunity. By early 1992, the African nation \u2013 known now as the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 owed $400,000 to a private landlord in Manhattan. The issue made its way to the New York courts, which eventually ruled against the central African nation, ordering US marshals to seize the premises if the Zairians failed to pay up. US: road charges in London     Traffic entering the London congestion charge area. Photograph: Graeme Robertson    Penny-pinchers at the US embassy in London have deprived Londoners of more than \u00a35.5m in congestion charges, and the figure continues to grow. In a long-running dispute, the US claims the charge is a tax, and as such diplomats are not liable to pay it. London mayors Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson have both taken a dim view of the US&apos;s reluctance to pay up. In an exchange over the money owed, Johnson reportedly reminded President Barack Obama that British diplomats stump up for US bridge tolls, and as such their trans-Atlantic cousins should do likewise with the C-charge. Burma: ambassador murders But perhaps the most egregious use of diplomatic immunity goes to the former Burmese ambassador to Sri Lanka who reportedly murdered his wife before burning her body in his backyard \u2013 in full view of spectators and police. The 1979 incident is recalled by Gerald Hensley, former vice dean of the diplomatic corps in Sri Lanka, who himself heard it secondhand from a Cuban counterpart. &quot;The story was she had started an affair with a band leader, and when she came back late one evening he shot her. The next morning he was out in Cinnamon Gardens, a suburb of Colombo, carrying logs for the fire,&quot; said Mr Hensley, who also served as New Zealand&apos;s high commissioner to Singapore as well as a posting in Washington, DC. Neighbours recognised that the Burmese diplomat was making a funeral pyre and informed Sri Lankan police when he then dumped his wife&apos;s body on top. &quot;It caused quite a stink,&quot; Hensley said, adding: &quot;The ambassador said it was Burmese territory and they couldn&apos;t enter. In the end he was removed by the Burmese government and nobody seems to know what happened to him.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/mar/28/london-2012-david-cameron-jacques-rogge", "sentences": ["Coe needs the legacy story to convince not only because he passionately believes it but to justify the promises he made almost seven years ago in Singapore to win the Games."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-28T21:00:02Z", "title": "Three wise monkeys see, hear and speak no evil about London 2012 | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "David Cameron", "Lord Coe", "Sport politics", "Sport", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "With the sun shining on Downing Street and the hubbub of tourists on the Mall mingling with the warm words of Olympians and Paralympians on the cobbles, it was easy to believe what was being said by those behind the lecterns inside \u2013 the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, David Cameron and Lord Coe. Like a modern-day Barnum, Cameron promised London would in less than four months play host to &quot;the greatest show on earth&quot;, with, the prime minister added: &quot;great sport, great culture, great business and a great legacy for Britain&quot;. An &quot;extremely grateful&quot; Rogge, present for the 10th and final IOC inspection visit to give his stamp of approval, praised London organisers for creating a new &quot;legacy blueprint&quot;. Coe, chair of the organisers, said London had already delivered on its promises and insisted the Games would enthuse a new generation as well as regenerating a neglected corner of east London. Tessa Jowell, the shadow Olympics minister, looked on from the front row in a show of cross-party unity that added to the impression of a love-in of Olympian proportions. The trio competed to see who could use the L-word \u2013 legacy \u2013 most often and Cameron sought his own personal world record for overuse of the word &quot;great&quot; amid a blizzard of statistics. The government has spent more than \u00a3100m on its &quot;Great&quot; campaign, which it claims will attract four million more visitors, spending \u00a32bn extra, and \u00a33bn of inward business investment in the wake of the Games. Like the three wise monkeys Rogge, Cameron and Coe could neither see, hear nor speak any evil about the Games. Was Rogge concerned about terrorism or transport? &quot;No,&quot; said the Belgian. &quot;We are a happy International Olympic Committee,&quot; he declared, though it&apos;s not his style to show it. As the trio spoke, it became increasingly clear that their fates are yoked together. Coe needs the legacy story to convince not only because he passionately believes it but to justify the promises he made almost seven years ago in Singapore to win the Games. Cameron is hanging his hat on the legacy benefits \u2013 from regenerating east London to boosting tourism \u2013 as justification for spending \u00a39.3bn on a giant party at a time of austerity cuts. And Rogge, for whom London will be his final Games as president, perhaps needs the legacy schtick to stick most of all. With Greece still all too visibly counting the cost of its 2004 Olympics and Rome having recently withdrawn its candidature as an Olympic city for 2020, it needs to convince future bidding cities in the west that the Olympics remain a worthwhile investment. &quot;I have seen extraordinary examples of new sports initiatives taking hold everywhere in this country. New clubs springing to life, reinvigorated sports facilities, more coaching opportunities, more athletes visiting schools, more sport and more values being driven off the back of sport,&quot; said Coe, although the figures don&apos;t yet back up his confidence. Cameron was even more effusive, insisting there was a direct link between feats of excellence on the track and inspiring young people to play sport. &quot;It&apos;s well known this has a transformational effect. You can have any number of government summits talking about sport in schools but the sight of Chris Hoy actually has people in shops saying: &apos;I want to buy a bicycle and I want to go on a bike.&apos; That&apos;s something you can&apos;t touch and is very powerful.&quot; It is also completely unproven \u2013 no previous Games has increased grassroots sports participation among the population. Sports participation figures were being measured wrongly, said Cameron, claiming he would not count under current measures because he ran once a week and played tennis once a week. This made him &quot;rather sad&quot;. There was no mention of whether a later badminton knockabout with Coe in the Downing Street garden would count towards the total. Having taken on President Obama at table tennis and London&apos;s mayor, Boris Johnson, at tennis for previous photo opportunities, perhaps Cameron is working towards a beach volleyball moment during the Games \u2013 which will take place down the road on Horse Guards Parade. The trio shrugged off difficult questions over school sport cuts, Dow Chemical&apos;s sponsorship and the ticketing arrangements. The only point at which Rogge looked disconcerted was when he tried to follow Cameron&apos;s convoluted tale about a pasty purchased at Leeds station as part of a digression into a defence of his government&apos;s decision to charge VAT on hot snacks. &quot;We are all confident we will have a great Games. But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating,&quot; concluded Rogge. There was no mention of whether the pudding would be warm, cold or subject to VAT."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/29/huawei-ban-cyber-cold-war", "sentences": ["Symantec rebutted the claims on Tuesday, saying it had announced the sale of its 49% stake in November 2011,when its chief executive, Enrique Salem, said: &quot;Symantec achieved the objectives we set four years ago and exit the joint venture with a good return on our investment, increased penetration into China and a growing appliance business.&quot; In Australia, Mitchell said: &quot;While we&apos;re obviously disappointed by the decision, Huawei will continue to be open and transparent and work to find ways of providing assurance around the security of our technology.&quot; He also pointed out that &quot;Huawei is building NBN-style networks in the UK, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia and more&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-29T16:12:22Z", "title": "Huawei contract ban stokes fear of cyber cold war", "tags": ["Telecommunications industry", "Business", "Telecoms", "Technology", "China", "Australia news", "US news", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Being banned from supplying telecommunications products to one country may be bad luck. But the Chinese company Huawei \u2013 the world&apos;s second-biggest supplier of telecoms network equipment \u2013 this week found itself facing shutouts from both Australia and the US, fuelling concerns about a cyber cold war between east and west. The company announced this week it had been banned from tendering for contracts in Australia&apos;s A$38bn (\u00a324.7bn) National Broadband Network (NBN) because of cybersecurity concerns. Then it emerged that the reason why its joint venture with the US online security company Symantec (which had the 49% stake) was dissolved last November was that the US company feared losing out on information from the US government, according to the New York Times. For Huawei, it&apos;s part of a continuous uphill struggle. &quot;We were informed by the government that there is no role for Huawei in Australia&apos;s NBN,&quot; said Jeremy Mitchell, a Huawei spokesman in Australia. That will be a blow to the company, which aims to overtake Sweden&apos;s Ericsson to be the world&apos;s biggest supplier of telecoms infrastructure such as fibre-optic connections and routers. It is already heading that way: for 2011 its revenues were \u00a320.3bn, compared with Ericsson&apos;s 227bn kronor (\u00a321.5bn). But to take the top spot, it needs contracts in projects such as NBN, which was launched in 2009 and aims to connect 93% of Australian homes and workplaces to optical fibre by 2020, providing superfast broadband services in urban and regional areas. When Huawei sought a A$1bn supply contract for the NBN, the attorney general, Nicola Roxon, blocked the bid \u2013 on advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. &quot;This is consistent with the government&apos;s practice for ensuring the security and resilience of Australia&apos;s critical infrastructure more broadly,&quot; she said in a statement. Roxon was backed up by the prime minister, Julia Gillard: &quot;You would expect as a government that we make all of the prudent decisions to make sure that the infrastructure project does what we want it to do, and we&apos;ve taken one of those decisions,&quot; she said. Certainly, concerns about silent Chinese incursions into western businesses have never been higher. Besides hacker attacks on Google in 2010 \u2013 thought to be government-inspired \u2013 security companies and the Pentagon have uncovered evidence of infiltration into a number of important US companies, while some using suppliers in China have complained of more subtle theft of intellectual property. A Huawei source insists that &quot;we take cybersecurity very, very seriously&quot;. But what&apos;s wrong with Huawei, an employee-owned business set up in 1987 that has never been accused of such activities? First, its chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, was formerly a Chinese army officer, fuelling claims that Huawei has a cosy relationship with the Chinese government \u2013 something the company denies. Second, no Chinese company can do business without the approval of its government, and Huawei works in such sensitive areas \u2013 nothing is more essential to a modern country than its telecoms system \u2013 it faces extra hurdles that might not apply to western companies. The US has fuelled the concerns: in 2008 Congress blocked a planned purchase (along with Mitt Romney&apos;s Bain Capital Partners) of the networking company 3Com, and telecoms company TeaLeaf in 2011. Congress has also barred Huawei from selling kit to any US operator, after blocking a sale to Sprint Nextel in 2010. (The Huawei source says: &quot;There&apos;s a very concerted campaign around China. We are running into that.&quot; Such concerns also help US-based manufacturers, of course \u2013 which is where the votes are.) Against that background, the New York Times says Symantec had become concerned that, as the US government shifted an information-sharing program about cyber threats to the control of the department of homeland security, it would be frozen out. For a company reliant on corporate clients, that could be lethal. Symantec rebutted the claims on Tuesday, saying it had announced the sale of its 49% stake in November 2011,when its chief executive, Enrique Salem, said: &quot;Symantec achieved the objectives we set four years ago and exit the joint venture with a good return on our investment, increased penetration into China and a growing appliance business.&quot; In Australia, Mitchell said: &quot;While we&apos;re obviously disappointed by the decision, Huawei will continue to be open and transparent and work to find ways of providing assurance around the security of our technology.&quot; He also pointed out that &quot;Huawei is building NBN-style networks in the UK, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia and more&quot;. He could have included Qatar, where it&apos;s also helping. In fact, 45 of the world&apos;s top 50 telecoms operators are customers. Most of the missing five are in the US. &quot;We have never been told by the Chinese government to do a certain thing. If we would, that would be to our detriment and we would lose the market share that we have,&quot; Mitchell said. In the UK, BT reiterated its confidence in Huawei, and said that it was able to examine source code for products to check for &quot;back doors&quot; or eavesdropping functions. It said in a statement: &quot;BT&apos;s relationship with Huawei and other suppliers is managed strictly in accordance with UK laws and security best practice. BT&apos;s network is underpinned by robust security controls and built-in resilience. We continue to work closely with all our suppliers and the government, where appropriate, to ensure that the security of the network is not compromised.&quot; Australia&apos;s former foreign minister Alexander Downer, who is an independent director on the board of Huawei&apos;s Australian unit, rejected the government&apos;s security concerns. &quot;This sort of whole concept of Huawei being involved in cyberwarfare, presumably that would just be based on the fact that the company comes from China. This is just completely absurd,&quot; he told ABC Radio. But even if it is, there are those in the west who are reluctant to put aside their mistrust for now. But Huawei is likely to have the last laugh. While Ericsson sold its half-share in the loss-making Sony Ericsson mobile phone business in October 2011, Huawei has just ventured into the handheld business \u2013 and analysts already expect it to undercut rivals such as Taiwan&apos;s HTC. This week&apos;s setbacks for Huawei may not be its last, but the company is by no means finished with its ambition. Household names, just not in Britain Huawei Company from the Shenzhen special economic zone that is pushing to become the world&apos;s largest telecoms equipment manufacturer. Second only to Ericsson in size, it is branching into smartphones and has research centres around the world. Western concerns focus on its chief executive&apos;s former links with the Chinese army, the lack of clarity around its operations \u2013 and natural defensiveness about letting a company from a communist dictatorship run the most sensitive systems a modern country can have. ZTE  Formerly Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation, ZTE also comes from Shenzhen and is growing rapidly in the telecoms sector, focusing increasingly on smartphones. Formed in 1985 by enterprises associated with China&apos;s ministry of aerospace, it has provided mobile networks for companies including Vodafone in the UK, Canada&apos;s Telus and France Telecom. It has been accused of helping Iran to get around US sanctions on the importation of systems from Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Symantec. Lenovo When it bought IBM&apos;s PC business in 2005, many in the computing world were shocked \u2013 but it was just the beginning of the company&apos;s rise. While IBM got a 18.9% share (since reduced to below 5%), Lenovo was catapulted into the spotlight and is now one of the three largest PC vendors in the world. It has the advantage of being located in the heart of Asia, the largest market where PC sales are showing growth. (In the west they&apos;re shrinking.) It is also pushing into other products such as smart TV and, inevitably, smartphones, where it will be the first to use Intel chips."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/30/cooking-with-poo-oddest-title-prize", "sentences": ["Her book was crowned winner of the Diagram prize following a public vote, beating an array of oddments including Mr Andoh&apos;s Pennine Diary: Memoirs of a Japanese Chicken Sexer in 1935 Hebden Bridge; The Great Singapore Penis Panic and the Future of American Mass Hysteria; and Estonian Sock Patterns All Around the World, to win the award."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-30T08:48:51Z", "title": "Cooking with Poo wins oddest book title prize", "tags": ["Oddest book title prize", "Awards and prizes", "Publishing", "Books", "Culture", "Chefs", "Thai food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "If 30-minute meals with Jamie or domestic goddessdom with Nigella fail to tempt this evening then it might be worth considering the latest big thing in home cuisine, Cooking with Poo, which has just won the Diagram prize for the oddest book title of the year.

Her book was crowned winner of the Diagram prize following a public vote, beating an array of oddments including Mr Andoh&apos;s Pennine Diary: Memoirs of a Japanese Chicken Sexer in 1935 Hebden Bridge; The Great Singapore Penis Panic and the Future of American Mass Hysteria; and Estonian Sock Patterns All Around the World, to win the award. &quot;Given that this year the three most voted-for works contain the words &apos;poo&apos;, &apos;sexer&apos; and &apos;penis&apos; in the title, it appears that this year&apos;s prize will go down in history as a blue year,&quot; said the award&apos;s custodian, Horace Bent. &quot;But there is nothing wrong with that. Many of the world&apos;s greatest writers have dabbled in off-colour humour, so I find Cooking with Poo a fitting winner.&quot; There is no prize for the author of the winning title \u2013 instead The Bookseller magazine, which runs the award, usually gives a bottle of &quot;fairly passable plonk&quot; to whoever spotted the title. As Cooking with Poo was &quot;unearthed indirectly via Twitter&quot;, however, the magazine will be making a donation to Urban Neighbours of Hope, a charity that helped create Diwong&apos;s cookery programme. Diwong may find winning the Diagram award brings other benefits: previous recipient Michael Young, author of Managing a Dental Practice the Genghis Khan Way, said it had the unlikely effect of increasing his literary clout. &quot;Since the award of the prize, I am pleased to say that my writing career is once again flourishing. Editors are keen to publish my words,&quot; he said. &quot;Being the winner of the Diagram prize has, I feel, given both the book and me a great deal of credibility, which perhaps without the epithet &apos;prize-winning&apos; we would never have achieved.&quot; The award has been running since 1978, when it was conceived at the Frankfurt book fair and given to Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice. Previous winners also include Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers, Highlights in the History of Concrete and Bombproof Your Horse."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/30/rupert-sawyer-channel-8-hacked-tweet", "sentences": ["So after five Singapore slings and a back rub from Glenda I took to my personal, and rather influential, Twitter account to set the record straight."], "publicationDate": "2012-03-30T12:11:00Z", "title": "Hacked off?

Like many of you, I haven&apos;t had much time for silly games. On the advice of our government, I&apos;ve had my hands full (literally) with jerry cans full of petrol to ensure I can keep my 6.8-litre Bentley Azure T on the road if this tanker strikes go ahead. Luckily I have nine spare baths and 16 unused sinks in my London home which I can use as temporary fuel dumps \u2013 God only knows how the working-classes are getting on with this and their hot pasty hoarding. And while the nation descends into 1970s-esque petro-pasty anarchy \u2013 it&apos;s not the selfish petrol tanker drivers or money grabbing exchequer that&apos;s in the line of fire \u2013 it&apos;s Channel 8. Day after day my competitors write and broadcast lies about our great organisation. After last week&apos;s Mrs Sawyer sex tape scandal I thought the cheap shots might have ended. But within hours of her replacing her false teeth and explaining in a dignified way why she&apos;d been grubbing around on all fours on film with a cameraman in the gloom, the daggers were out again. This time it&apos;s back to the same old bollocks. Channel 8 hacks phones, Channel 8 hacks the internet, Channel 8 cheats the public by buying all the good shows off rubbish channels and putting them on its excellent pay-tv network, Channel 8 Pacific\u2122 in glorious 4D\u2122 and Hyper Definition\u2122. Well, maybe if my competitors spent more of their budgets on quality American dramas and less money on buying into shit talent show formats and making baseless fictional documentaries attacking my glorious empire they&apos;d be able to afford to give their viewers what they really want. Now, as you will know, I&apos;m normally a man with a cool head \u2013 I turned down Red or Black? when Simon Cowell was still in short trousers. But this week I felt I could stay silent no longer. So after five Singapore slings and a back rub from Glenda I took to my personal, and rather influential, Twitter account to set the record straight. Of course, within minutes, my rivals were misreporting the incident as &quot;Rupert&apos;s Rant&quot;. But as you can see from the evidence below \u2013 every word was carefully considered, and true. Having watched the latest &quot;documentary&quot; attack on 8, I wittily began:     Lies, damn lies, and my competitors - starting to get the major hump with this industry ...&mdash; Rupert Sawyer (@RupertSawyerCEO) March 29, 2012   Of course most of this was taken out of context, garnering headlines like &quot;Psycho Sawyer blows his load online&quot; and &quot;Channel 8 hate!&quot; \u2013 mostly on my own website, of course. But within seconds I felt I&apos;d not said enough, adding:     Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right - here I am ... Stuck in the UK media industry with you!&mdash; Rupert Sawyer (@RupertSawyerCEO) March 29, 2012   I had another drink and sent a stark warning to those who dare to challenge me:     Enemies of Channel 8 will be dealt with decisively.

And neither am I - the future is 8-shaped&mdash; Rupert Sawyer (@RupertSawyerCEO) March 29, 2012   But you see it&apos;s not Channel 8, and I, its visionary leader, that is full of hate, it is the rest of the industry. No those full of anger and fear are the few dinosaurs running the other big media outlets who (just like the excellent drama Terra Nova) are on the verge of extinction. They see the tide has turned against their outmoded party political squabbles and lucrative monopolies, they know that the people want, nay, expect, more from a 21st-century media company. The simple fact is, Channel 8 delivers what the people want \u2013 from titillation, scandal and sensation in our newspapers to the best in movies, sports (we have just bought the Go-Karting world series), comedy, drama and arts (plus titillation, scandal and sensation) across our television channels. While my rivals sellotape old Open All Hours DVDs to the front of their newspapers in a vain attempt to increase sales, we need only tell the truth to see circulations rise. While the rest of the terrestrial channels spend their time conducting so-called &quot;investigative journalism&quot; into my empire and cosying up with the windbags at the Leveson inquiry, we&apos;re the first on the scene when breaking news happens. And so I say to you all, my loyal staff \u2026 Keep the faith. Because we may be in the firing line right now \u2013 but these few misguided clever clogs are firing nothing more than chaff at us, and very soon even this will run out. When that day comes, the real people that matter, the public, who already adore us, will finally see \u2026 there&apos;s only one place to be in the modern media age, and that&apos;s with Channel 8.

They housed athletes in RAF camps. Members of the British team bulked out their meagre diets with whale meat. And the only sort of drugs testing was to see whether the medal winners had overdosed on the Horlicks tablets handed out to those taking part. Those who organised and paid for the make-do-and-mend 1948 Olympics might raise an eyebrow at the description of the event planned for London this summer as the austerity Games. To be sure, the economic backdrop looks superficially similar: an economy in trouble; a country up to its eyeballs in debt; a chancellor counting every penny. But there the similarity ends. The Britain of 2012 is struggling to emerge from a long and deep recession that has pushed national debt to upwards of 60% of the economy&apos;s annual output. Activity is still 4% below the peak reached in early 2008 and it will take until 2017 for living standards to return to 2004 levels, the year before London won the right to host the Games. This week the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, completed his last pre-games inspection visit and the IOC&apos;s co-ordination commission said London was &quot;ready to welcome the world&quot;. If the economic backdrop has made the organisers&apos; job more difficult, it is nothing compared to the scale of the challenge faced by the organisers in 1948. The Britain of 1948 was struggling to recover from six years of total war that had emptied the Treasury&apos;s coffers, forced Churchill to go cap in hand to Roosevelt for help and pushed the national debt to 250% of GDP. In 2012, Britain is hard up; in 1948 it was flat broke and there was no question of the Labour government of Clement Attlee committing the sort of sums to a sporting event that will be spent this year. This month the Commons public accounts committee expressed concern that once the cost of the security lockdown of London was taken into account, the final bill for the 2012 Games would be a little shy of \u00a311bn, a fourfold increase since London put in its bid seven years ago, and almost equivalent to Britain&apos;s gross domestic product in 1948. By contrast, the cash-strapped Attlee government, which at one stage considered ceding the right to hold the Games to the United States, earmarked just under \u00a3750,000 for the Olympics. Even when inflation and more than six decades of growth are taken into account, the disparity in spending between the 1948 and the 2012 Games is marked: about 0.7% of GDP in 2012; less than 0.01% of GDP in 1948. The organisers in 1948 faced a different challenge from those in 1908, who were able to showcase the capital of the empire at a time when the value of the pound was rigidly set by a gold standard policed by the Bank of England. Britain was still (just about) the world&apos;s most powerful nation and the Liberal government could afford to wage a naval arms race with Germany while planning to lay the foundations of the welfare state. In 1948, the US was clearly the world&apos;s most powerful nation, the dollar had supplanted sterling as the global reserve currency of choice, and the Attlee government was trying to juggle Britain&apos;s expensive defence commitments with its pledge to build the New Jerusalem. London basked in a heatwave in the summer of 1948 but, as films such as the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico showed, it still bore the physical scars of the blitz. Labour&apos;s priorities were to find jobs for the millions of demobilised servicemen, convert factories back to peacetime use, rebuild Britain&apos;s shattered infrastructure and find the resources for the welfare state. The NHS was launched less than a month before George VI opened the Games. Even so, other European countries were in worse state than Britain, and London agreed to host the first Games since Hitler&apos;s carefully orchestrated Berlin Olympics 12 years earlier. The 1948 event was short on bombast, the finale to the opening ceremony being the release of thousands of pigeons above north London. Only a strings-attached loan from Washington had rescued Britain from an economic Dunkirk after the fighting stopped in 1945. Not only was there no new Olympic stadium, there was no new velodrome, aquatics centre or handball arena either. Nor was there a purpose-built Olympic village: male athletes were billeted in RAF camps in Uxbridge, West Drayton and Richmond; female athletes were housed in London colleges. The organisers laid on bedding but asked contestants to bring their own towels. The frugality was harsh but deemed necessary by Sir Stafford Cripps, who set the benchmark for all subsequent austerity chancellors. Cripps, who would rise before dawn and take a cold bath to prepare himself for the rigours of the day ahead, encapsulated the spirit of the age and presided over an economy where rationing was even tougher than it had been during the war. A concession to the UK team was that their rations were increased to those of a heavy industrial worker while the Games were on. &quot;It was very hard to get hold of meat, although there was unrationed whale meat,&quot; the British runner Sylvia Cheeseman said of her preparations for the 200 metres. &quot;It was horrible but I was so intent on getting my protein that I ate it.&quot; Many teams brought in their own food and, in the case of the French, their own wine as well. The previous year had begun with one of the coldest winters of the century, with power cuts to industry and a big loss of exports. Under the terms of the loan negotiated with the Americans, sterling had to be convertible into dollars from the summer of 1947, a move that prompted a full-scale sterling crisis. To cap an annus horribilis, Cripps&apos;s predecessor as chancellor, Hugh Dalton, was forced to resign after he let slip some of the details of his budget to a journalist on his way into the Commons. As a result, the government was determined to do the Games on the cheap. It scrounged gymnastic equipment, food and mineral water from other governments. The Canadians even donated a couple of planks of springy pine for the diving boards at Wembley&apos;s Empire pool. Germany and Japan were not allowed to take part in the Games but even with the Soviet Union also absent, the British team won a meagre haul of three gold medals, two of them in the rowing at Henley. The face of the Games was Dutch athlete Fanny Blankers-Koen, with four golds. Despite the austerity and the air of shabbiness, London 1948 was considered a remarkable success. After six years without professional football or cricket between 1939 and 1945, there was an appetite for sport and those who took part noted how the Games were faithful to the original Olympian ideal that the important thing was not winning but taking part. By today&apos;s standards the austerity Games were not commercialised, the TV rights were sold to the BBC for \u00a31,000. What&apos;s more, they made money. The economist Stefan Szymanski has noted that it is a myth that the Olympics pay for themselves, either through Keynesian pump-priming or a surge of tourism. But if hosting the Games has bankrupted some cities and left others with white-elephant stadiums, that was not true of London in 1948. Spending came in at \u00a3732,268, below the budget of \u00a3743,000, while receipts (mostly from ticket sales) were \u00a3761,688. The taxpayer will be footing the bill for London 2012, but that was not the case 64 years ago. The austerity Games made a profit of almost \u00a330,000 \u2013 of which the taxman received \u00a39,000. Then and now Standing ticket to watch athletics \u2013 3s 6d (17.5p). Now: \u00a3202.

It was the 90s and a craze was sweeping England. One of my best friends had just restarted the classes he had gone to\u00a0as a child. I went with him and loved it instantly. Ten years later, I was a black belt\u00a0training with my sifu, Master Lai, in\u00a0London. In kung fu, sifu is used as\u00a0a term of respect for an expert with the skills to guide others. I was so inspired by Master Lai that I wanted to meet his master, the elusive Sugong, meaning grandmaster. All the time I&apos;d been\u00a0training, Sugong&apos;s portrait had\u00a0been on the wall, staring down\u00a0at us, and he had always intrigued me. His temper was as legendary as his\u00a0physical prowess; at 80, he\u00a0could\u00a0do the splits, smash concrete blocks and hammer six-inch nails into planks with his hands. Master Lai always spoke about him with awe. When I had the idea of visiting Sugong, he encouraged me, sending letters of request to him. I still hadn&apos;t received his consent by the time I\u00a0left, but I\u00a0took the chance. I quit my job in advertising, packed my bags and headed to Malaysia. After a few weeks, I finally got a\u00a0text from one of the guys who used to train with Sugong and he gave me directions to a town outside Kuala Lumpur. I was picked up at the station by another student and driven to meet Sugong. I&apos;d seen a\u00a0few kung fu films and part of me half-assumed I&apos;d be meeting a\u00a0wise master deep in meditation while athletic disciples ran through mountains carrying pails of water to strengthen body and soul. I certainly hadn&apos;t been expecting the sight that confronted me: a dark school playground where 10 students were lined up in two rows. Sugong was in front of them, scolding them. There was nothing temperate or\u00a0meditative about him. Sugong\u00a0was quite short and built like a bull, with huge muscles and a swagger you wouldn&apos;t expect in an 80-year-old. As he sized me up, I\u00a0was trying to get the measure of him as well. At first I felt very uncomfortable and he didn&apos;t really acknowledge me or seem pleased by my presence. He\u00a0had agreed that I could train with\u00a0him, yet I felt he was doing his best to convince me to leave. I\u00a0would be up at 5am to get a taxi to the edge of town where he lived and training would start at 6. He was a\u00a0Shaolin kung fu grandmaster, but it felt like I was being taught very little and shouted at a lot. His teaching style involved showing me some steps very quickly\u00a0and then leaving. In my anxious state, I&apos;d try to follow what he&apos;d done and practise diligently until his return. Then he&apos;d scream at\u00a0me in caustic Chinese. By the end\u00a0of the first month, I was beginning to wonder what I was doing. During one particularly tough\u00a0day, he berated me furiously for getting something wrong before leaving me to practise alone. When he came back, he tore me to shreds again. If I was going to leave, it would have been then. But early the next morning, I was back and it was Sugong who finally cracked. He may have doubted my ability to improve, but he knew I wouldn&apos;t leave. His attitude changed. He stopped shouting as much and seemed to warm to me. I started to feel slightly less scared of him. Although the scoldings continued, they became more affectionate. I\u00a0became gripped by his life story, which he would describe during our post-training breakfasts of intestine noodle soup or chicken&apos;s\u00a0feet. Sugong had spent eight years in a Singaporean temple, training under its abbot, before moving to Malaysia (his reasons for doing so weren&apos;t clear, but run-ins with gangsters were mentioned). Instead of spending six months training, I\u00a0stayed on for\u00a0three years. We&apos;d train for hours together, going on treks to Indonesia and Singapore. I\u00a0visited the village in China where his relatives lived. When he fell ill, I\u00a0was there with him in hospital. When I finally decided to return to England, he was brisk with me \u2013 Sugong wasn&apos;t one for big goodbyes. I knew I&apos;d miss him, and that he&apos;d miss me, but he remained bullish. &quot;If you come back in five years&apos; time, I&apos;ll still be here, I&apos;ll still behave the same way and I&apos;ll still be just as healthy.&quot; It was difficult to doubt. \u2022 Do you have an experience to share?

China, South Korea and Taiwan on Monday reported modest increases in sales and orders in March as businesses switched from selling to Europe in favour of exports to the growing US economy. Only India bucked the trend in the region after months of high inflation and uncertainty over the outcome of regional elections undermined manufacturers&apos; confidence and hit sales. Delhi, at the centre of Asia&apos;s third-largest economy, suffered a third straight month of slower growth in its purchasing managers&apos; index (PMI), dragged down by a decline in orders. Indian businesses were also hesitant after the costs of raw materials showed no signs of falling. While the index remained above 50, it slipped to 54.7 in March from 56.6 in February. Any figure above 50 indicates expansion. China&apos;s manufacturers have also suffered the after-effects of rising inflation. Government attempts to cool the economy following a prolonged housing boom have included tighter credit controls, which have helped to avoid a hard landing. But the controls brought an end to the stimulus that kept the economy growing at a fast pace in 2010 and 2011. China&apos;s economy now appears to be headed for its weakest quarter since early 2009. Beijing&apos;s official PMI hit an 11-month high with a stronger than expected 53.1 for March. But a separate, private survey by HSBC, which focuses more on smaller factories than the large state-owned enterprises captured in the official data, paints a gloomier picture. The index stayed below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, coming in at 48.3. &quot;The upside surprise in China&apos;s manufacturing PMI is welcome, and should help quell excessive fears of a &apos;hard landing&apos; in China,&quot; said Vishnu Varathan, an economist with Mizuho in Singapore. &quot;But equally, we should not be lulled into thinking that China has turned a corner either. Global conditions continue to be highly uncertain notwithstanding the stabilisation in Europe and &apos;green shoots&apos; in the US.&quot; Qinwei Wang, China economist at analysts Capital Economics in London, said the official PMI might be too optimistic. &quot;The much better performance in the index probably reflects its seasonal strength around this time of the year rather than a significant improvement in conditions for the sector,&quot; he said. &quot;Indeed, the official PMI has never declined in March and the average increase in that month has been 3.2 points since it was first released in 2005 (excluding the latest data). The data are said to have been seasonally adjusted prior to release, but a clear pattern still remains.&quot; HSBC&apos;s PMI for South Korea edged up to a one-year high of about 52 in March from February&apos;s 50.7, despite a 1.4% decline in exports. In Taiwan, the PMI figures marked the second straight month of improving business conditions and the pace of expansion was the fastest since April 2011.

Scotland&apos;s new long-distance canoe trail     Canoe coast-to-coast with Scotland's Great Glen Canoe Trail. Photograph: Alamy    A 60-mile coast-to-coast waterway across Scotland from just outside Fort William at the head of Loch Linnhe sea loch to Inverness in the north-east, which uses the Caledonian Canal, several rivers and a number of lochs, was officially launched last week as the Great Glen Canoe Trail (greatglencanoetrail.info), Scotland&apos;s first formal canoe trail. Although paddlers were already allowed on these waterways, a network of tourist organisations have joined forces to make negotiating the trail easier, with more access points, canoe hire, camping facilities and maps available to those who choose to tackle all or parts of it. The trail starts at Corpach in the south, at the bottom of an impressive series of lochs called Neptune&apos;s Staircase, a wonder of Thomas Telford&apos;s Victorian engineering. This, along with the Caledonian Canal, links lochs Linnhe, Lochy, Oich and Ness, allowing boats to &quot;climb&quot; the hills of the Great Glen and avoid a long sea journey around the treacherous tip of the country. Canoes can&apos;t go through those first locks, so they have to be carried up, or you can start at Banavie, three miles away. The whole route takes at least five days, but I did half of it, in four days, and to make things even easier, arranged our trip with Wilderness Scotland (wildernessscotland.com), which provides equipment and a guide \u2013 reassuring when winds picked up on the ocean-like lochs. All we needed to do was paddle, pitch camp and relish the adventure through this varied and wild landscape. If you just want a day trip, opt for the Banavie to Gairlochy section, just six miles each way, with Ben Nevis sheltering you. Catherine Mack What&apos;s new?

We run a few programmes that provide these opportunities, for example our Artists&apos; International Development Fund for artists to travel, explore and collaborate internationally. In partnership with ACE it aims to help those who haven&apos;t had much international experience. There&apos;s also our Young Creative Entrepreneur (YCE) programme, which celebrates entrepreneurial talent in the creative sector and is a powerful global network of over 3,500. This is all about peer networking and sharing intelligence and opportunities, either online or alongside events like the UnBox Festival in Delhi and the Great Escape in Brighton. Collaborate across the sectors: I think one of the most valuable things we can do is offer international opportunities cross-sectorally and indeed beyond the arts and culture sectors \u2013 we should look to where it intersects with the broader creative industries, cultural sector and economy. The UK creatives we work with often find some of the most exciting and innovative potential in places where there isn&apos;t such a formal and well-supported creative sector, where people have to do several jobs at once and at a more dynamic pace. This throws up other challenges of course but it can be stimulating when you put the two together. A good example of this is our Culture Shift events that we&apos;re piloting in Lagos, Nairobi, Johannesburg and Cairo at the moment. Get to know the culture of the place you want to operate first: There are so many nuances in different markets and understanding some of them will help you reach other producers and audiences more effectively. One way of doing this is to have a go-between or fixer who can translate! Be open to new ways of trying things: And be open to failure; you might find something better than what you thought you needed. Antonia Byatt, director, literature, Arts Council England We should always remember the artistic context of an international collaboration: It&apos;s really important that people can see, read and hear foreign works, for example by bringing in international writers or supporting translation \u2013 it helps artists here connect with people more widely. Remember the artistic values of working internationally: We think it&apos;s really important that artists get the chance to expand their horizons through working internationally \u2013 it&apos;s certainly good for stimulating ideas and for giving artists a sense of what is really excellent beyond their national boundaries. But it is also important for building networks; networking is a good way to build more valuable partnerships that work and are based on sharing practice \u2013 they can lead to funding for the right reasons, not pragmatic ones that don&apos;t really develop the work. Shihui Weng, associate producer, National Theatre of Scotland Embrace diversity: The only barriers we have in the arts are the artificial ones we put up. I firmly believe the sustainable way of making theatre and arts now is via exciting new partnerships, often internationally, where we push boundaries and stimulate new ideas. The fact that I&apos;m Chinese and working in Scottish theatre is a positive indication that this country does embrace diversity in a big way. Let&apos;s share what works: I do feel we need a network that brings internationally-active organisations and people together, to meet regularly and share resources and experiences. It seems everyone is doing all these wonderful and exciting projects and forming new partnerships, but then there&apos;s a distinct lack of communication about it with their peer organisations. Never assume that everyone who works in the arts works the same way as you: Language is often not the biggest barrier \u2013 misunderstanding is mostly coursed by different mentalities, different cultural policies, culture differences and so on. It means there should be no assumptions, no &quot;for crying out loud, how can they not understand this?&quot; and no &quot;they never reply to my emails or copy me in&quot; \u2013 we should learn the steps like babies, and enjoy it. Anthony Alderson, director, the Pleasance Theatre Trust Travel: Visit the festivals and go to Edinburgh in August; it is the greatest melting pot of creative talent anywhere on earth! In one day you can meet someone from every continent. Johan Storgard, general manager / CEO, Svenska Teatern / ACE-Production Involve the agents: An interesting experience I&apos;ve had in Asia and China, having been active there now for three years, is that there are several theatre and arts fairs (eg Singapore Live and Guangzhou Arts Fair). These are real producer-meets-buyer meetings and they&apos;re extremely interesting since the demand for new content for production and touring is growing so rapidly. Since most of the agents are quite small it would be great to create a stronger agency network when looking into these emerging markets, instead of everyone working by themselves and on their own. Engaging with these international agencies could give all us producers a stronger position abroad as well as a broader perspective on the sector as a whole. Commenter, TillyWalnes Let&apos;s collaborate, not compete: Last Summer we ran a training event in Croatia for 40 film festival professionals \u2013 it resulted in the initiation of an informal network of festivals from 17 countries across Europe who are now working in collaboration with each other. What was interesting is that film festivals historically see themselves as competitors \u2013 for films, audience, industry delegates, slots in the calendar etc \u2013 but bringing a range of international organisations together to learn encouraged them to see each other as collaborators instead. Now they&apos;re exchanging programmes, sharing information, promoting each other and have plans to do even more, for example joint projects and funding/sponsorship bids. Something that I&apos;ve learnt which is key is creating the right conditions to enable this attitude shift to take place. Establishing trust is vital: The physical distance between international partners means that when you do have the opportunity to meet face-to-face, you should really embrace it to ensure strong bonds for the future. For a recent international programme we scheduled in lots of time for people to discuss common issues and work on addressing them together. Having time to socialise informally is a must too \u2013 beer and discos worked a treat for us! This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Amazon is not the only company to have shifted its European headquarters outside of the UK. One of the first things that Kraft, the US food giant, did after it took over Cadbury in 2010 was to integrate the British acquisition into its existing European corporate structure, headquartered in Switzerland, which has a corporate tax rate that can be as low as 8%. But the headline corporation tax rate is not the only factor companies consider when deciding where to locate. Luxembourg has an effective corporate tax rate of 28.8%, but is regarded by some as a benign regime. Luxembourg, for instance, does not have legislation to govern the prices companies within a single group charge each other for goods and services. Those multinationals that choose their locations carefully can see a substantial benefit to their overall tax charge. In its filing with the US securities and exchange commission for the financial year to June 2011, Microsoft explained the reason why its effective tax rate was so far below the US statutory rate of 35%. Microsoft racked up an effective tax rate of just 18% and said this was due to the tax rates in its regional operating centres in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico being lower than the US statutory rate. Indeed, 16 of the 17 percentage points reduction in Microsoft&apos;s effective rate was due to income earned overseas being taxed at a lower rate. Google is another company with European headquarters in Ireland where the headline corporation tax rate is just 12.5%. It has been criticised because, like Amazon, it channels revenues generated in the UK to Ireland without paying corporation tax on the associated profits. In its defence, Google insists it has complied with all tax rules and points out that the company has an obligation to work in a tax-efficient manner on behalf of its shareholders. However, the US multinationals are beginning to find a problem with their tax efficiency. Many are building up big cash piles overseas to avoid remitting that money to the US, where it would be subjected to a 35% tax charge. Apple, which also has an Ireland-based European headquarters, is estimated to have amassed a cash hoard in excess of $64bn (\u00a340bn) in its overseas subsidiaries. This money cannot be repatriated to the US without significant tax consequences. One solution for the multinationals is to finance acquisitions using cash which is banked overseas. Both Google and Amazon have done this. However, that still leaves billions of dollars just sitting in bank accounts. Apple is orchestrating a share buyback scheme and paying its shareholders a dividend in a bid to bring down its total $100bn cash pile. But this\u00a0does not represent any direct investment into economies around the world which are in desperate need of the cash the corporate giants are clinging on to. It is no surprise that the lobby for the introduction of a cash repatriation tax holiday in the US is becoming increasingly vocal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/05/tutu-dance-company-denied-malaysia", "sentences": ["A leading Singaporean dance company has been denied a permit to perform in Kuala Lumpur, reportedly because a Malaysian government body deemed their costumes indecent.", "Singapore Dance Theatre had been due to perform a selecion of classical ballet, including a duet from The Nutcracker and sections of Balanchine&apos;s Serenade at Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (KLPac) this weekend.", "Singapore Dance Theatre has received licences to perform in Malaysia several times in the last two years.", "Hijjas goes on to claim that the decision &quot;has caused enormous doubt in the arts community, not to mention a huge loss of money,&quot; and therefore conflicts with the ministry&apos;s outward objective &quot;to increase national income through contributions from the creative and communications industries.&quot; The Malaysian government disputed this version of events, saying that it did not receive a permit application for a Singapore ballet troupe to perform."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-05T12:25:13Z", "title": "Tutu short?

Singapore Dance Theatre had been due to perform a selecion of classical ballet, including a duet from The Nutcracker and sections of Balanchine&apos;s Serenade at Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (KLPac) this weekend. However, the company was forced to cancel after its members were denied visas by Puspal, a subsidiary licensing arm of the Malaysian information, communication and cultre ministry. &quot;Ballet dancers in Baghdad are allowed to wear ballet costumes on stage,&quot; said Hijjas, &quot;Are we to understand that the Malaysian public is less cosmopolitan, less morally resilient and less broad-minded than the citizens of a Middle Eastern country that has been ripped to shreds by war and violence?&quot; According to Hijjas: &quot;All of the costumes for women had long skirts, except for The Nutcracker, which was to be performed in a short classical tutu and tights, the kind that has been worn by ballet dancers since they performed before the Russian tsars in the 1870s.&quot; Similar classical tutus have featured in approved dances, including some earlier this year at government-run theatre Istana Budaya. Hijjas accused the organisation of being &quot;inconsistent&quot; in its application of guidelines.

The Guardian has learned that major firms such as Lloyds Banking Group (through its investment arm Scottish Widows), Aviva, the UK&apos;s largest insurer, and the Co-op have imposed a blanket ban on holding shares in companies that make or supply cluster munitions, purging them from nearly all their share portfolios. Royal Bank of Scotland has banned all new lending to the same companies, and is now reviewing its defence industry shareholdings. Similar action is being taken by all the firms to clear out shares in anti-personnel landmine manufacturers, following intense pressure from human rights campaigners. The industry is operating two parallel &quot;stop lists&quot;, which cover a dozen arms companies involved in making or supplying cluster bombs and anti-personnel landmines, including the US defence companies Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, and the South Korean industrial conglomerate Doosan. The unpublicised but co-ordinated move represents a significant strengthening in the ethical investment and lending policies of the institutions involved, which is expected to put the UK&apos;s other major banks, Barclays and HSBC, under pressure to follow them. The clampdown follows criticisms from human rights campaigners, including Amnesty International and the Dutch group IKV Pax Christi, which last year vigorously attacked the industry for failing to take rapid and comprehensive action on their cluster bomb and landmine investments. It is understood that at least one of the largest firms has found, in a confidential survey, that a significant majority of its customers were unhappy with investing in makers of cluster bombs. The four firms collectively have investment portfolios worth nearly \u00a3600bn and it is estimated they will have to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in shares across all the firms on the stop lists. Aviva, RBS and Scottish Widows have yet to advise their clients of the move, and have yet to complete their purge. The main exclusions will be portfolios based on the US stock market and privately held share portfolios, which they manage for clients or act as the nominee, where the client controls the investment policy. Those exclusions could affect at least 10% of the total funds run by Aviva and Scottish Widows. The US investors and clients of some firms involved have angrily resisted attempts to sell off US defence shares, industry sources said, pointing to a growing gulf between UK institutions and the US over ethical and socially responsible investment policies. All four UK institutions said their policies had been heavily influenced by the introduction of the 2008 Oslo convention on cluster munitions, which bans the manufacture, sale and use of cluster bombs, and the 1997 Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel landmines. The cluster bombs convention, which came into force in 2010, has now been ratified by 70 states and signed by 43, with the notable exception of the US, China and India. The US has been accused of trying to undermine the treaty by forcing through exclusions in other UN treaties. It has instead banned the export of cluster munitions with a failure rate of more than 1% but insists its forces will continue to use them. The UK government now bans the manufacture, sale and export of the devices, which are still being made or offered for sale by US, Pakistani, Indian, Singaporean, Chinese and Israeli firms. Several companies that sold cluster bombs at the UK&apos;s main arms fair last year were expelled. The Dutch and Swiss governments are now introducing new laws forbidding their financial institutions from investing in cluster munitions firms \u2013 a measure the UK government is continuing to resist. Roos Boer, a policy adviser for IKV Pax Christi, which is based in Utrecht, said she would carefully study the banks&apos; new stances to see if they were exploiting any loopholes. The group remained sceptical about their exclusion from privately owned investment portfolios. &quot;If these financial institutions are disinvesting from cluster munitions producers that would be a very positive step,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;re generally seeing a positive trend emerging in the UK, but we urge financial institutions to be comprehensive in drawing up their policies. &quot;Any exception or loophole which allows funding to go to cluster munitions producers runs counter to the goal of a world without cluster munitions, and it runs counter to the demands of the public.&quot; The main stop list used by Aviva, RBS and Scottish Widows was compiled by the Swedish ethical investment consultancy Ethix, and it includes Hanwha Corporation (South Korea), Singapore Technologies Engineering (Singapore), Alliant Techsystems (US), Aryt Industries (Israel), Doosan Corporation (South Korea), GenCorp (US), General Dynamics Corporation (US), L-3 Communications Corporation (US), Lockheed Martin Corporation (US), Poongsan Corporation (South Korea), Textron (US) and Poongsan Holdings Corporation (South Korea). Aviva, which manages global investments worth \u00a3400bn, told the Guardian the company had decided in 2008 that the manufacture of cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines undermined fundamental human rights. After initially banning shareholdings in firms that made cluster munitions or anti-personnel mines from its own shareholder funds, that policy is now being applied across all its portfolios where it controls investment policies. In 2010, it controlled $65m (\u00a341m) worth of bonds in Lockheed Martin and $67m in Textron. &quot;The Aviva board has now determined that this exclusion should also be applied to Aviva policyholder funds. We are currently working to implement this decision and will provide an update when this is complete,&quot; the firm said. Bailed-out Lloyds bought $62.5m worth of shares in Lockheed Martin in 2009. Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, which has worldwide investments worth \u00a3140bn, and is the main investment business for Lloyds, said: &quot;We are now well advanced in a process of identifying and divesting from overseas companies where there is strong evidence of involvement in activities prohibited by the convention. &quot;This applies to all funds where SWIP [Scottish Widows Investment Partnership] and other Lloyds Banking Group companies control the investment policy of the fund. We have a similar divestment policy in place for companies that are breaching the Ottawa treaty on anti-personnel landmines.&quot; RBS, more than 80% owned by the taxpayer and whose investment portfolios have shrunk to about \u00a330bn after the banking crisis, banned any new lending or financing of companies linked to the cluster bombs industry last year, after being exposed by IKV Pax Christi. In 2009, it underwrote or bought $200m in shares and bonds in Lockheed Martin and Alliant Techsystems. It is understood to have begun investigating its smaller shareholdings for any shares in the 12 firms on the stop list. Co-op Asset Management, which has \u00a316bn in investments and uses a different stop list to its competitors, said it would have divested all of its retail investment products and its own investment funds by the end of April. &quot;All of our active portfolios are no longer invested in such holdings and no further investments in such companies have or will be made through these funds,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;By the end of this month we will also have divested all of our passive, tracker funds, which are non-retail funds owned by the Co-operative&apos;s life fund, from these companies.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/10/zimbabwe-mugabe-deathbed", "sentences": ["Officials in Zimbabwe have dismissed as &quot;hogwash&quot; reports that President Robert Mugabe is close to death in a Singapore hospital.", "The president is alive and well.&quot; Other media reports quoted Webster Shamu, Zimbabwe&apos;s information minister, as saying: &quot;It&apos;s a lot of hogwash.&quot; Two senior officials from Mugabe&apos;s Zanu-PF party also denied the report, which originated on a small news site, the Zimbabwe Mail, claiming that Mugabe was &quot;battling for his life&quot; in a Singapore hospital.", "&quot;But some sick and malicious people are spreading false stories about him being seriously ill while others are saying he is dead or dying out there.&quot; The two officials confirmed Mugabe was in Singapore but declined to give any further details."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-10T14:10:44Z", "title": "Zimbabwe regime dismisses Mugabe deathbed reports", "tags": ["Robert Mugabe", "Zimbabwe", "Africa", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Officials in Zimbabwe have dismissed as &quot;hogwash&quot; reports that President Robert Mugabe is close to death in a Singapore hospital.

The president is alive and well.&quot; Other media reports quoted Webster Shamu, Zimbabwe&apos;s information minister, as saying: &quot;It&apos;s a lot of hogwash.&quot; Two senior officials from Mugabe&apos;s Zanu-PF party also denied the report, which originated on a small news site, the Zimbabwe Mail, claiming that Mugabe was &quot;battling for his life&quot; in a Singapore hospital. They said he was on an Easter break with his family. &quot;The president is well and away on a private holiday to help his daughter prepare for postgraduate studies, but we are expecting him home this week,&quot; one of the officials told Reuters. &quot;But some sick and malicious people are spreading false stories about him being seriously ill while others are saying he is dead or dying out there.&quot; The two officials confirmed Mugabe was in Singapore but declined to give any further details. Asked whether the president had also used his 10-day trip for a medical checkup, one said: &quot;We are not going to be engaged over rumours, speculation and wishful thinking.&quot; The president is reportedly in Hong Kong, on his way home. One of the officials said he was expected to chair a rescheduled cabinet session on Thursday. Mugabe has been in power for nearly 32 years, making him one of Africa&apos;s longest serving leaders. His health is a subject of ever-intensifying speculation. Witnesses have described him as looking ill and falling asleep at meetings. A June 2008 US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks suggested he was suffering from prostate cancer. His increasingly frequent trips to east Asia are widely assumed to include specialised medical care. But in an interview on state radio for his 88th birthday in February, Mugabe joked: &quot;I have died many times. That&apos;s where I have beaten Christ. Christ died once and resurrected once; I am as fit as a fiddle.&quot; The latest scare appears to have been triggered by a terse government statement saying a weekly cabinet meeting set for Tuesday had been postponed to Thursday. As is now also common with rumours over Nelson Mandela&apos;s health, the story quickly hit Twitter like a runaway train and spread to international media. Among the first to urge caution was Trevor Ncube, a leading Zimbabwean publisher, who posted: &quot;Please note that the source of the Mugabe rumour story is not a reliable one.&quot; By Monday night, the Zimbabwe Mail had published a fresh story, headlined &quot;Ailing Mugabe returns home Wednesday&quot;. It quoted a member of the Zanu-PF politburo as saying: &quot;The president is on his Easter holidays, like everyone else. He returns to his post this week, at the same time as those who are asking about his whereabouts from their holiday hideouts.&quot; Mugabe is the only leader independent Zimbabwe has known. Questions over his health gain added urgency because of perpetual uncertainty about who will succeed him. . On Monday night, Andrew Meldrum, a former Guardian correspondent who reported from Zimbabwe for over two decades, blogged on the Globalpost site: &quot;Over the years there have been so many rumours about Robert Mugabe&apos;s ill health and impending death that journalists in Harare have become used to urgent phone calls from their editors who claim they have it on good authority that Mugabe has died or is on his deathbed. They clamour for a story of the dictator&apos;s demise. &quot;I&apos;ve received many of those phone calls myself and have made many late-night calls to hospitals, doctors, members of Mugabe&apos;s cabinet and his Zanu-PF party, trying to get confirmation or denial of the reports of his death. &quot;And then Mugabe shows up, jaunty and outspoken, dashing the reports \u2026 until the next set of rumours surface \u2026 I remember when everyone was convinced that he suffered from inoperable throat cancer, when actually he was hoarse from a series of speaking engagements.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/apr/11/public-private-partnerships-the-record-isnt-great", "sentences": ["Singapore adheres rigidly to this principle, commissioning only eight PPP projects in the seven years after PPP became government-approved."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-11T07:39:01Z", "title": "Public private partnerships: the record isn't great", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Finance", "Procurement"], "article": "The use of Public private partnerships (PPP) has been a bold experiment and has led to some innovation - but overall, the record has not been great. PPP in the UK began nearly 30 years ago with the Channel Fixed Link, while the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) - a UK speciality - celebrates its 20th birthday this year. These schemes have undoubtedly allowed the UK to acquire social infrastructure earlier, helping to stimulate short-term economic growth, but it has led to an overhang of debt stretching some 30 years into the future and to constraints on the way public bodies are able to use their assets. Moreover, the value for money advantages of PFI have been achieved only in narrow circumstances and PFI schemes have often been &quot;mis-sold&quot;, while the public sector has revealed deficiencies in the skills necessary to work with private finance. This is a very real problem. The UK whole of government accounts for 2009-10 reported \u00a329.9bn of PPP/PFI liabilities on the balance sheet, with a total of 642 signed contracts were in place by November 2011. The Treasury is now conducting a review of PPP/PFI and its future. One of the most curious aspects of PPP/PFI in the UK is how their use is justified. There are two traditional justifications. One is where there is not enough money in the public purse, PPP could be the only way to build vital infrastructure. This is an &apos;additionality&apos; justification, which would be expected in a developing economy. In wealthier economies, value-for-money is the justification: is PPP cheaper than the public sector alternative? Singapore adheres rigidly to this principle, commissioning only eight PPP projects in the seven years after PPP became government-approved. When there has not been severe public spending constraints, the UK has maintained that value-for-money is the only official justification for PFI. In reality, however, the UK has often pursued PPP/PFI for non-value-for-money reasons. PPP/PFI was seen as a super-sized credit card. Many supporters of public sector projects have expressed concern about being pushed into privately-financed procurement reasons not because they provide value for money, but because it was seen as the only way to get new things built. One reason the value-for-money justification struggles to gain traction is that it is so hard to prove. The benefits offered by private finance, the transfer of risk from public to private sector, and improvements in decision-making processes are too nebulous to provide any certainty that they outweigh all the known PFI/PPP problems. Compounding this problem has been the lack of commercial awareness in the public sector. PPP/PFI guidance has suffered from confusion (from 2000, when the Treasury insisted value-for-money be the only criterion for investment appraisal, departmental guidance elsewhere continued to stress non-value-for-money PPP/PFI advantages) and, while there have been vast improvements over time, the public sector still struggles to adequately define the PPP/PFI outputs it wants or to negotiate effectively with the private sector to achieve them, leading to cost over-runs or unexpected consequences. PPP/PFI has undoubtedly allowed the UK to acquire social infrastructure earlier, helping to stimulate short-term economic growth, but it has led to an overhang of debt stretching some 30 years into the future and constraints on the flexibility of public bodies in using their infrastructure. There have been mistakes and misunderstandings, but also innovation. New forms of PPP/PFI continue to be developed, with the introduction of a new Green Investment Bank and a nice reversal of the principles behind PPP with the possible finance and construction of High Speed 2 by the public sector for lease to private operators. Still, following in the steps of football and cricket, PPP wouldn&apos;t be the first time the UK has pioneered something, only to see it perfected overseas. Gillian Fawcett is head of public sector, Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, which has published a report on PPP and PFI schemes around the world.

The quake&apos;s centre was 20 miles beneath the ocean floor and about 308 miles from the provincial capital of Banda Aceh, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). It was initially reported as being of 8.9 magnitude but was downgraded shortly after it hit. A 6.5-magnitude aftershock has since been reported. Traffic jams were reported in Aceh, where people scrambled for higher ground as sirens mingled with sounds from the mosques, Reuters reported. A rescue team from Indonesia&apos;s disaster mitigation agency was sent to the region to help. Officials in the neighbouring countries of Thailand, Malaysia and India issued precautionary evacuation orders along coastal regions. Thailand temporarily closed Phuket airport, according to local media, with warnings of waves up to 4 metres (13ft) in height hitting the holiday islands of Phuket and Krabi, although no tsunami waves have yet been reported. Tremors, some lasting for as long as five minutes, were felt across south-east Asia after the earthquake hit. Reports on Twitter described employees rushing out of office buildings and families looking for safety as far away as Rangoon, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, India and Sri Lanka. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) said an alert had been issued for 28 countries, including Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iran and Oman. An updated warning said sea-level readings indicated that a tsunami measuring 17cms (6.7ins) had been generated but that if no major waves had occurred &quot;for at least two hours after the estimated arrival time, or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours, then local authorities can assume the threat is passed&quot;. It warned, however, that damage to boats and coastal structures could continue, owing to rapid currents. The PTWC lifted the tsunami warning for most areas of the Indian Ocean about four hours after the first quake. Bruce Presgrave of the USGS told the BBC a destructive tsunami was less likely because the quake had been caused by the earth moving horizontally instead of vertically. Indonesia sits above the ring of fire, a series of fault lines which make the archipelago nation of roughly 18,000 islands prone to volcanic and seismic activity. The 9.1-magnitude quake that occurred on Boxing Day 2004 triggered a tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed 230,000 people, nearly three-quarters of whom were in Aceh.

The 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck the seabed 300 miles west of Banda Aceh, the island&apos;s provincial capital, at 3.38pm local time, and was followed by an 8.2-magnitude aftershock just two hours later, causing locals to scramble for higher ground as traffic jams, power cuts and the sound of sirens and Qur&apos;an recital calls created an atmosphere of chaos, according to Reuters. The tremor passed without any immediate reports of casualties or major damage, and was met with greater public awareness and successful earthquake drills. Residents in Banda Aceh, some of whom holed up in mosques to pray while others fled to nearby hills on the back of motorbikes, said the ground shook violently for up to five minutes, causing widespread fear about the potential aftermath. &quot;We were afraid that it was a signal that a tsunami would hit the area,&quot; one resident told the Jakarta Post. Another said that most residents were able to handle the situation calmly. &quot;Unlike in 2004, when the strong earthquake hit Aceh early in the morning, many people were still sleeping so most of us were not ready,&quot; Jauhari of the Indonesia Community Radio Networks said. &quot;This time, the earthquake occurred at a busy hour when most people were awake, so people just left buildings and went to safe places.&quot; Tremors were felt as far away as India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Singapore, with Twitter reports of office workers scurrying from their buildings in panic and tourists in beach resorts on the Thai island of Phuket worried over approaching tsunamis. Tsunami waves of three to four metres were expected in Phuket, which was badly damaged in the 2004 tsunami, but an island-wide system of tsunami warnings saw local residents and tourists calmly evacuating. Thai officials temporarily closed Phuket airport and also issued warnings for other coastal provinces. &quot;Guests from expensive hotels overlooking Phuket&apos;s beaches were evacuated to the hills behind and local people were driving away in cars and on motorcycles,&quot; freelance journalist Apichai Thonoy told Reuters. &quot;Everyone seemed quite calm. The warning had been issued well in advance.&quot; The US Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre lifted its Indian Ocean-wide tsunami warning later on Wednesday afternoon to read that &quot;level readings now indicate that the threat has diminished or is over for most areas&quot;. Indonesia, India, Thailand and Sri Lanka dropped their tsunami warnings, although Kenya and Tanzania were still on alert along their Indian Ocean coastlines on Wednesday afternoon. Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said there was no threat of a tsunami after the earthquake hit and told local reporters that &quot;the situation in Aceh is under control&quot;. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage in Aceh either, he said. &quot;Our warning system is working well, and I have ordered the national relief team to fly immediately to Aceh to ensure the situation is under control and to take any necessary action,&quot; he said. At least three tsunamis of up to 80cm reportedly hit Indonesia&apos;s coastlines, although a tsunami as destructive as that in 2004 was unlikely, according to officials. The US Geological Survey told the BBC that such a tsunami was improbable because Wednesday&apos;s quake was caused by the earth moving horizontally instead of vertically. South-east Asia analyst Maria Patrikainen of IHS said that while the Indonesian government had increased its efforts to tackle natural hazards since the 2004 tsunami, many provinces still lack resources equipped to deal with natural disasters. &quot;Since the inauguration of the tsunami warning system in 2008, concerns have been raised that the inadequate training of the officials operating the system could lead to malfunctions,&quot; Patrikainen said. &quot;Also, there have been reports of vandalism of supporting equipment, with several buoys broken, missing, or stolen.&quot; Earthquakes in Indonesia are common due to its location on the ring of fire, a series of fault lines which make the archipelago nation of roughly 18,000 islands prone to volcanic and seismic activity.

Profits from UK banking recruitment plunged 50% year-on-year between January and March, dragging the firm&apos;s overall UK profits down 3.7% to \u00a330.6m. Chief executive Steve Ingham said: &quot;Clearly there are still issues around the euro zone sovereign debt and these things are influencing our business, but ... I don&apos;t think things are getting worse. Our conclusion on March was that banking remains difficult [and] certain geographies remain more challenging than others.&quot; He pointed to Italy, Spain and Britain. European stock markets were rocked by a wave of panic selling on Tuesday amid fresh fears over Spain and Italy, which saw borrowing costs jump. Michael Page, which is seen as a bellwether for the wider economy, described the UK market as &quot;very challenging and highly competitive&quot; but said this was offset by stronger performances in other countries, including Germany and France, which grew by 36% and 10% respectively. Group profits climbed 6.9% to \u00a3136m in the first quarter. Shares in the company dived 6% in the morning following a recent strong run for the FTSE 250 index stock, and finished the day 3.6% lower at 437.8p. In Asia, where the firm employs more than 1,000 people, profits climbed 23% to \u00a326.3m. However, like UK and North America, the weakness in banking reduced growth rates, particularly in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. Amid the turbulence in financial markets over recent months, profits from banking recruitment worldwide dropped 12% and the sector now accounts for 8% of the firm&apos;s trading (UK banking makes up 1%). Recruitment in engineering, construction, property, supply chain and business procurement, accounts for nearly a fifth of its business. Investec Securities analyst Robert Morton switched his recommendation on the stock to &apos;hold&apos; from &apos;buy,&apos; saying: &quot;The recruitment sector will clearly face some choppy waters in the very short term, but we still believe that the underlying structural recovery/growth story for the sector remains intact.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/apr/13/london-olympics-sponsors-protests", "sentences": ["It was a partnership between BP, Locog and delivery partners including the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust, and the Locog chairman, Lord Coe, portrayed it as an example of delivering on the promises he made in Singapore seven years ago."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-13T08:00:04Z", "title": "Olympic values attract cash-rich brands and those who despise them | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "With the countdown clock ticking into double figures, the lines have been drawn and battle joined. This summer will feature an intense tussle between the brands that have paid tens of millions of pounds to be associated with the Olympics and use its values to burnish their own, and those who believe that their presence risks overshadowing the Games. It is a battle that has been rumbling on a guerrilla basis for months as protesters against Dow Chemical&apos;s sponsorship of the Games and the wrap that will surround the stadium have refused to back down, believing it has outstanding liabilities relating to the 1984 Bhopal disaster. With London 2012 organisers, the government and the IOC equally clear that they back Dow, the stand-off will continue. These protesters are about to be joined by &quot;greenwash&quot; campaigners targeting other sponsors including BP and Rio Tinto as well as protesters against familiar targets including McDonalds and Coca-Cola. Others still will use the canvas of the Games to push their own causes. The big brands have paid handsomely for the right to do much the same. They have the cash for big consumer campaigns but have also used the Olympics as the basis for corporate social responsibility and staff engagement programmes that seek to improve their corporate image or underline their brand values. To take one example, earlier this week a group of around 70 teenagers were honoured at an event at the British Museum after completing a four-year mentoring programme. It was a partnership between BP, Locog and delivery partners including the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust, and the Locog chairman, Lord Coe, portrayed it as an example of delivering on the promises he made in Singapore seven years ago. There was no denying the value of the project to those who took part or the very tangible benefits it had on their lives. Those involved, some from deprived areas, said it had given them confidence, boosted their skills and raised their sights. Many are now going on to university and all will volunteer at the Games. But to the protesters, schemes such as the BP Young Leaders programme are a mere drop in the ocean when measured against the damage done by the energy giant in other areas of its business. The group - the Campaign for a Sustainable Olympics - that successfully fooled some sections of the media into believing BP had been dropped as a &quot;sustainability partner&quot; said it was seeking to redress the balance. &quot;If this Games is really to leave a legacy for future, we hope it will have an impact on future sponsorship deals. BP have gained a huge amount from their sponsorship of the Olympics in financial and PR terms. It&apos;s depressing. It&apos;s a sick joke,&quot; said Harry Broadbent of CAMSOL. Mike Sharrock, BP&apos;s partnership director for London 2012, said: &quot;What we&apos;ll try and do is just focus on what we&apos;re doing. We&apos;re confident our contribution is a positive one. What we have tried to do is make sure that everything we&apos;re doing is credible and authentic.&quot; While sponsors will have to invest substantially in &quot;leveraging&quot; their deals, which cost up to \u00a340m a time in the first place, the tactics used by protest groups will be more opportunistic, utilising social media, PR stunts and, potentially, disruption of events such as the marathon and cycling road race. As the Dow row and the controversy over the percentage of tickets that go to corporates have shown, Locog will fight to the hilt to back the sponsors that have contributed \u00a3700m to the \u00a32bn costs of staging the Games. The London 2012 chief executive, Paul Deighton, told the Guardian its approach would effectively be to ignore protesters while also planning to deal swiftly and seriously with any invasion of the field of play. Police have said they will facilitate peaceful protest but are expected to clamp down hard on any attempt to disrupt the action or block the 30 miles of exclusive Games Lanes that will help ferry VIPs, sponsors, competitors, officials and the media around the capital. With a range of direct action groups promising disruption during the Games, the antics of Trenton Oldfield proving the impact a single gesture can make (however muddy the inspiration) and various groups claiming to have been inspired by one another and planning a more co-ordinated approach, one thing seems certain: the blithe prediction of Boris Johnson that this would be an Olympics unmarked by protest is unlikely to be borne out. A stadium by any other name The London Legacy Development Corporation (the quango formerly known as the Olympic Park Legacy Company), hoping to secure full-time tenants for the Olympic Stadium in time for the Games and currently in tense negotiation with West Ham United, is conducting a parallel search for a naming rights partner. It is understood to have received 23 expressions of interest in naming rights for the stadium, aquatics centre and multi-use arena. The issue of naming rights had been one of the sticking points in negotiations with West Ham and the issue will have to be sensitively handled, not least because the winners will be attaching their name to venues built with close to \u00a31bn of public money. Final bids are due in by 16 April. Blatter finally answers London&apos;s calling Gary Lineker and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke will conduct the draw for the Olympic football tournament at Wembley on 24 April, with the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, set to swerve the engagement. It is becoming something of a habit, because the draw will take place just under a year after he ducked out of a similarly high-profile event at the stadium. With Fifa gripped by corruption allegations, he failed to attend the Champions League final between Barcelona and Manchester United to &quot;prepare&quot; for the Fifa Congress that would lead to his return as president unopposed despite the furore. Despite his apparent aversion to London he will nevertheless be here for the Games, though pictures of him whizzing down the Games Lanes are unlikely to be high on the wish list of Locog&apos;s PR corps."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/13/burma-sanctions-david-cameron", "sentences": ["&quot;I can&apos;t speak for why the regime is acting in the way that it is, but I think it&apos;s clear when you look at Burma&apos;s neighbours you can see economies that are growing more quickly, you can see poverty that is being tackled more effectively, you&apos;re seeing in other countries \u2026 democracy going hand in hand with greater economic success and growth.&quot; This is the last stop on Cameron&apos;s tour of Asia, in which he has visited five countries in five days: Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Burma."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-13T12:36:00Z", "title": "Burma sanctions should be suspended says David Cameron", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "David Cameron", "Politics", "World news", "Foreign policy", "UK news", "European Union", "Myanmar"], "article": "     David Cameron called for sanctions against Burma to be eased after holding talks with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

The prime minister said: &quot;I think it is right to suspend the sanctions that there are against Burma - to suspend them, not lift them.&quot; Cameron continued: &quot;[Burma] shouldn&apos;t be as poor as it is, it shouldn&apos;t have suffered under dictatorship for as long as it has and things don&apos;t have to be that way. &quot;There is the real prospect of change and I&apos;m very much committed to working with you in trying to help make sure that your country makes those changes. &quot;I met with President Thein Sein today, and I think there are prospects for change in Burma, and I think it is right for the rest of the world to respond to those changes. &quot;Of course we must respond with caution, with care, we must always be sceptical and questioning, because we want to know those changes are irreversible, but \u2026 I think it is right to suspend the sanctions that there are against Burma - to suspend them, not lift them, and obviously not to include the arms embargo - because I do think it is important to send a signal that we want to help see the changes that can bring the growth of freedom, human rights and democracy in your country.&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi said: &quot;We still have a long way to go but we believe we can get there. &quot;I believe President Thein Sein is genuine about democratic reforms and I am very happy that Prime Minister Cameron thinks that the suspension of sanctions is the right way to respond to this. I support the \u2026 suspension, rather than the lifting, of sanctions, because this would be an acknowledgement of the role of the president and other reformers. &quot;This suspension would have taken place because of the steps taken by the president and other reformers, and it would also make it quite clear to those who are against reform that should they try to obstruct the way of the reformers, then sanctions could come back. So this would strengthen the hand of the reformers.&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi paid tribute to the &quot;help friends have given us over these last decades, especially Britain and other very close friends&quot;. She added: &quot;They have always understood our need for democracy, our desire to take our place in the world and the aspirations of our people. &quot;And we have always shared in the belief that what is necessary for Burma is an end to all ethnic conflict, respect for human rights - which would include the release of political prisoners - and the kind of development aid which will help to empower our people and take our country further towards the road to genuine democracy.&quot; Cameron said he had invited Aung San Suu Kyi to visit Britain in June. Had she attempted to leave Burma in previous years, she knew she would have been prevented from returning. Cameron said: &quot;For many years, Daw [Aunt] Aung San Suu Kyi was allowed, if she wanted to, to leave this country. You wrote that they would roll out the red carpet all the way to the aeroplane, and put you on to it, but never let you return ... I have invited Daw Suu today, to come to London in June, and to come to the United Kingdom in June, to also see your beloved Oxford in June, and that I think is a sign, if we&apos;re able to do this, of huge progress, that you will be able to leave your country, to return to your country, and to continue your work as a member of parliament.&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi, who lived and studied in Britain during the 1960s and 1980s, responded: &quot;Two years ago, I would have said: &apos;Thank you for the invitation, but sorry.&apos; Now I am able to say: &apos;Well, perhaps.&apos; And that&apos;s great progress.&quot; The prime minister also paid tribute to the opposition leader, saying: &quot;Everyone in the United Kingdom has been inspired by your struggle \u2026 What an inspiration it is to have followed your struggle, to have watched your incredible courage, and the light that you have shone to all those around the world who want to see freedom, democracy and greater human rights \u2026 It is an honour to stand by your side.&quot; And he suggested that political reform would lead to economic prosperity in her country. &quot;I can&apos;t speak for why the regime is acting in the way that it is, but I think it&apos;s clear when you look at Burma&apos;s neighbours you can see economies that are growing more quickly, you can see poverty that is being tackled more effectively, you&apos;re seeing in other countries \u2026 democracy going hand in hand with greater economic success and growth.&quot; This is the last stop on Cameron&apos;s tour of Asia, in which he has visited five countries in five days: Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Burma."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/15/uk-defence-firms-export-fears", "sentences": ["A buyer of a Yaris in Sheffield will have no influence on a buyer in Singapore.&quot; For defence, it is the opposite, says Southwell."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-14T23:06:05Z", "title": "UK defence firms fear austerity drive will shoot down export revival", "tags": ["BAE Systems", "Manufacturing sector", "EADS", "Business", "Defence policy", "Politics", "Arms trade", "France", "Europe", "World news", "Saudi Arabia", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "Only an eagle-eyed observer can spot what makes the Mantis aircraft so special, because visitors are kept at a distance lest they rumble its technological secrets. But the main giveaway is the label on the cockpit: &quot;No human occupant.&quot; The drones that have taken airborne warfare to a clinically impersonal level are the forebears of this unmanned aircraft, which is capable of flying reconnaissance missions with an unprecedented degree of independence. There will be no pilot on the ground flying the Mantis with a joystick: just a set of pre-programmed aims, such as scouring Pakistan&apos;s vast northern borderlands for terrorist camps. &quot;They are great for dull, dirty and dangerous operations,&quot; says Martin Rowe-Willcocks, an executive in the unmanned flight division at BAE Systems, maker of the Mantis and Britain&apos;s largest defence company. The Mantis is perhaps a slightly unremarkable-looking glimpse into the future, with its brown colour scheme and conventional-looking design, but a weaponised cousin, called the Taranis, is a rather more arresting sight. Or at least that&apos;s the impression given by the poster in the room next door at BAE&apos;s sprawling manufacturing site in Warton, Lancashire. Resembling an ultra-sleek stealth bomber, it is hidden away somewhere in the building. These unmanned prototypes carry the long-term export hopes of a UK defence industry that needs to trade its way out of trouble and is losing jobs in the wake of government spending cuts. David Cameron pointed the way last week, when he took British defence executives on his tour to south-east Asia. On one leg of the visit he called for greater co-operation between the British and Indonesian armed forces and defence industries. Defence employs 110,000 people directly in the UK, which is the world&apos;s third-largest buyer of defence equipment behind the US and China. Domestic deals accounted for more than half of the defence industry&apos;s \u00a322bn sales in 2010, which makes the search for exports all the more pressing. Although the Warton hangar proves that artificially intelligent planes are far from an abstract concept, a mass-produced breakthrough is years away, because Taranis and Mantis are prototypes only. For now, BAE and its peers must sell their less futuristic products into a domestic market stifled by coalition austerity or into export markets that are also suffering from spending cuts. Expanding markets, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, are swamped by competitors also looking for an escape from their domestic troubles. In an example of this scramble, the Indian government has chosen the Rafale fighter made by France&apos;s Dassault over BAE&apos;s Typhoon as the frontrunner for a $10bn (\u00a36.3bn) jet contract, with the French making a cheaper bid. BAE and its partners in the Eurofighter Typhoon consortium have not given up on the deal, but they are in second place. A few hundred yards from the pilotless-plane hangar, the head of BAE&apos;s military aerospace unit sits in an office that reminds visitors of the past rather than the future, decorated as it is with images of the Spitfires and Lancaster bombers made by BAE&apos;s predecessors. Making Typhoons is Warton&apos;s main business and aircraft are the cornerstone of the whole industry \u2013 aerospace accounts for around 55% of UK sales. Chris Boardman, managing director of BAE&apos;s military air and information business, admits that the government&apos;s strategic defence and security review was &quot;obviously devastating from our perspective and from the employees&apos; perspective&quot;. Under the review, the \u00a337bn UK defence budget will be reduced by 8% by 2014, and BAE workers have felt the impact. BAE is cutting 2,000 jobs from its aerospace operations, including 900 at Brough in Yorkshire, while a further 1,500 are under threat at its Portsmouth shipbuilding operations. AgustaWestland, the Italian-owned helicopter maker, is cutting 375 jobs in Britain. In a hall next door to Boardman&apos;s office, Typhoons are assembled in a low-key atmosphere of diligent scrutiny that appears to be the signature ambience of advanced manufacturing. The RAF is the main client for the aircraft, although one of the nearly completed models is destined for Saudi Arabia. Explaining the relatively serene environment, a BAE employee says there is no need for riveting if you are putting together a carbon fibre fuselage, which just slots together. Precision is also a prerequisite. The design allows for only 1mm of deviation across the whole aircraft and the alignment of parts is scrutinised by lasers. For BAE, AgustaWestland and other defence manufacturers it is the likes of Saudi Arabia, concerned by the ambitions of Iran and flush with petrodollars to counter them, that will grow in importance as UK spending shrinks. &quot;There are lots of aircraft here ready for the RAF but if we did just that we would be running out of work in the next couple of years. So we have to be successful elsewhere,&quot; says Boardman. BAE is hoping to secure a Typhoon order from Oman, as well as a deal to build a maintenance facility in Saudi Arabia \u2013 a major Typhoon customer. But the Typhoon still needs government backing, says Boardman, who explains how all defence manufacturers require the support of their home state. &quot;You have to have your government promoting you. The best example would be Margaret Thatcher in Saudi Arabia. She made it clear that there had to be a strategic relationship with the kingdom on Saudi Arabia, and from that you get export sales,&quot; he said, referring to a process that included the controversial al-Yamamah arms deal. It brought BAE more than \u00a340bn of revenue, as well as a Serious Fraud Office investigation that ended abruptly under government orders in 2006. For any defence firm, the domestic market is vital, says Boardman. &quot;Those nations who are interested in what you have got need to see your government continually investing in that aircraft or ship and its maintenance.&quot; Boardman is more optimistic than many of his peers, who feel the government is removing support for one of the UK&apos;s biggest manufacturing sectors despite calling for a &quot;march of the makers&quot; to boost industry. The official defence industry view is gloomy. Robin Southwell, president of ADS, the trade body for the aerospace, defence, security and space industries in the UK, says defence is a &quot;pretty worried&quot; sector. &quot;We are an industry that is flatlining at best,&quot; he says. The exhortation to export, underlined by George Osborne&apos;s call in last month&apos;s budget for industry to double exports to \u00a31 trillion by 2020, also concerns him. &quot;The trouble is, everybody is exporting,&quot; says Southwell. With manufacturing in economic and political vogue, Southwell argues that defence should be a showcase for industry: &quot;We are a proven engine room for growth in this nation, we provide a window into Britain&apos;s engineering excellence.&quot; But government support is insufficient, ADS says. The phrase &quot;off the shelf&quot; has alarmed British defence firms in recent months. In its white paper on defence procurement published in February, the Ministry of Defence says it will meet the country&apos;s defence and security needs through &quot;open competition in the domestic and global market, buying off the shelf where appropriate&quot;. What this means is that only in exceptional circumstances will British firms receive preferential treatment. Southwell, who is also chief executive of the UK operations at EADS, the European defence and aerospace group, argues that UK defence manufacturers need British government contracts to develop products. Foreign states want to see that UK manufacturers, and their products, are trusted by their domestic government before they buy them. Southwell draws comparisons with the car industry, a powerful exporter in the UK whose domestic market was underpinned by a scrappage scheme during the depths of the recession. &quot;The car industry is a good example of a joined-up strategy where they have a domestic supply side sorted. Defence does not have a supply-side strategy other than a limited area where there is a direct sovereign capability needed.&quot; Eight out of 10 cars made in the UK are exported, but for defence manufacturers the domestic market is all-important. &quot;The difference within our industry is that generally you only have one buyer in the UK. Someone will buy a Toyota Yaris anywhere in the world irrespective of whether someone buys it in the UK. A buyer of a Yaris in Sheffield will have no influence on a buyer in Singapore.&quot; For defence, it is the opposite, says Southwell. &quot;If the UK army is not using a piece of [British-made] defence equipment, then the chances of a foreign buyer taking it diminish rapidly.&quot; Alberto de Benedictis, chief executive of the UK operations of Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland&apos;s owner, says the UK defence industry is at a crossroads. &quot;Its future will very much depend on how the MoD manages its acquisition plans and policy in the coming years. If an off-the-shelf procurement policy became a policy to acquire offshore it would obviously be detrimental to the future of the British defence industry.&quot; A further glimpse of the future is provided a few miles up the road from Warton, at another BAE site in Samlesbury. Fuselage and tail pieces are being manufactured for the F-35 fighter, a US-government led project that the UK government is set to buy. After that, it will be the era of Mantis and Taranis-type vehicles. And that too will be collaborative. Following the Anglo-French defence pact, Dassault and BAE are putting their differences over the Indian market to one side and co-operating on building an unmanned aircraft that will follow Mantis. Those dull, dirty and dangerous missions will not be carried out alone after all."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/15/catherine-bennett-perils-of-emigration", "sentences": ["Given the huge number of online-commenting expats who like to dwell, whatever the ostensible topic, on how vastly superior to benighted Britain is their adopted home in Hong Kong, Singapore, UAE, Malaysia, Saudi etc, it was to be expected that Mr Jones would be cheered for confirming that the UK is still the corrupt, costly, overtaxed, cold, overcrowded, criminal, scrounger-ridden, unmannerly cesspit they left behind.", "Moreover, for what it&apos;s worth, a recent world happiness index indicates that, even without a tropical climate and white-sand beaches, the much disrespected Salford might be a better place to live than, say, Kuala Lumpur, since Malaysia came 51st to Britain&apos;s 18th \u2013 still comfortably above Singapore (36th)."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-14T23:12:00Z", "title": "Don't be suckered by the siren call of the expat idyll | Catherine Bennett", "tags": ["Society", "Australia news", "UK news", "World news", "Bhutan", "Tracey Emin"], "article": "If evidence of their leader&apos;s dwindling popularity were not glum enough, &quot;senior aides in Downing Street&quot; are, according to the Spectator&apos;s political editor James Forsyth, &quot;much struck by polling that shows that 40% of Britons would emigrate if they could&quot;. Should the aides take the snub so personally? True, this level of disenchantment does not say much for Mr Cameron&apos;s trademark wellbeing index, particularly in the context of precious, national pick-me-ups such as the jubilee flotilla, the Olympics and the glorious sinking of the Titanic. On the other hand, to threaten to leave the country because of its high rate of taxation is as deeply Tory as tax avoidance itself. Could it say something extremely positive, in fact, about the democratisation of greed, that more and more people want nothing more than to follow the party&apos;s former treasurer, Michael Ashcroft, to his beloved home in Belize, to try life in Guernsey, like another party treasurer (resigned), &quot;Spotty&quot; Rowland, or to emulate another Cameron favourite and adviser, Philip Green, whose wife&apos;s residence in Monaco has snagged the couple tax savings of an estimated \u00a3285m? Nor is the noble impulse to seek refuge in some of the most noxious places on Earth, rather than pay tax, confined to British retail, banking and business operatives. A few years ago, the Cameron supporter and former YBA Tracey Emin explained why she was thinking of leaving Britain. Admittedly, unlike more adventurous emigres who are willing to endure exile in unspeakably vulgar or otherwise harsh conditions, far from family or friends or anything we might recognise as civilisation, Emin&apos;s destination was her holiday home in the Var. She was vexed by the imposition of a 50p tax rate on income of more than \u00a3150,000, which would &quot;mean me paying about 65p in every pound with tax, national insurance and so on&quot;. And there were other annoyances, familiar to anyone who has looked at expat message boards. &quot;So much here is simply not working now,&quot; she explained. &quot;The taxes are too high, there aren&apos;t enough incentives to work hard and our politicians have put me off. We&apos;re paying through the nose for everything.&quot; Wisely, as it turns out, Emin appears to have given her country another chance. Now, thanks to George Osborne, she no longer pays 65p in the pound to stay in broken Britain, while her fellow artists in France tremble at the Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s threatened 75% tax on earnings over \u20ac1m. With enough French people here already to warrant a dedicated election campaign, MigrationWatch must be worrying about how South Kensington can possibly accommodate a second influx of desperate creatives, to say nothing of the threat to the indigenous intellectual and busking communities. The singer Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, for instance, whose 1962 song Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles is currently finding a new audience via the Greek film Attenberg, has spoken about fleeing to London should Hollande&apos;s tax prevail. &quot;I&apos;ll have to sell my apartment,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ll be on the street.&quot; Although, given the fabled wealth of her baby-boomer contemporaries, a warm welcome for Mme Hardy cannot be in doubt, it is Britain&apos;s alleged inundation by other homeless immigrants from all over the world that, to judge by emigration forums, inspires much of the restlessness and disenchantment now exercising the government. Those Britons who do leave their parents in the hands of incomers and themselves become immigrants to somewhere else are, however, hailed as enterprising doers we can ill afford to lose. David Jones, for example, a father of 12 whose loathing of benefit &quot;scroungers&quot; has earned him near-celebrity red-top status and the designation &quot;Britain&apos;s hardest-working father&quot;, was lionised in the papers again last week for another heroic act: quitting. &quot;I feel like the way the UK is at the moment that the opportunities I want for my children are not going to be there,&quot; Jones told the Daily Mail, prior to flying to Brisbane, where he arrives with neither job nor home. Given the huge number of online-commenting expats who like to dwell, whatever the ostensible topic, on how vastly superior to benighted Britain is their adopted home in Hong Kong, Singapore, UAE, Malaysia, Saudi etc, it was to be expected that Mr Jones would be cheered for confirming that the UK is still the corrupt, costly, overtaxed, cold, overcrowded, criminal, scrounger-ridden, unmannerly cesspit they left behind. For instance, wrote another Australia settler: &quot;This place is a gold mine, I&apos;m living proof. Birmingham turns my stomach every time I visit.&quot; In the event, along with sympathetic responses, dozens of posts informed the hard-working yet impulsive Mr Jones that, like Spain, Portugal, Greece, France, Canada and other traditional escape routes, Australia no longer offers cheap housing and an eternity of carefree picnics at 1950s prices. &quot;We are doing up our house to sell so we can come back to England perhaps not having to work 14-hour days in Melbourne,&quot; wrote one de-emigre. So where to? For expats, pref non-gay, who are inspired by Bahrain employee John Yates to exchange a few British freedoms for an improved quality of barbie, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Dubai and Qatar are all recommended, with the proviso that some of the locals may practise the very cultural attitudes that make some would-be emigrants feel like strangers in their own country. Moreover, for what it&apos;s worth, a recent world happiness index indicates that, even without a tropical climate and white-sand beaches, the much disrespected Salford might be a better place to live than, say, Kuala Lumpur, since Malaysia came 51st to Britain&apos;s 18th \u2013 still comfortably above Singapore (36th). For true employee happiness, however, the BBC should have moved everyone, lock, stock and barrel to northern Europe, where the happiness scores of high-taxed Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands suggested, once again, that George Osborne is inimical to national wellbeing. Philip Green, you gather, would not be happy there. Unless, as Horace suggested a while back, we take our happiness, or discontent, with us. However, a recent, admittedly biased \u2013 being self-selecting \u2013 poll of Guardian readers showed almost 70% are still dreaming of escape, undeterred by evidence that formerly dependable bits of abroad can unexpectedly turn costly, overtaxed, criminal, corrupt, polluted, unmannerly, xenophobic or restrictive and even, though it is hard to imagine, produce native versions of Livingstone and Johnson. Just reading some would-be emigres&apos; comments was a reminder of how great it can be to live in Britain and not only because it makes you face the bald, comparative facts about human rights, healthcare, housing, schools, pensions. Where else do you find this furious, uncensored brew of romance, humour and self-loathing, expressed with a rage that comes off the screen? Not, at a guess, in the little kingdom of Bhutan, where happiness famously comes first. Frustratingly for would-be emigres to that smiliest of realms, it appears to be a condition of general contentment that no immigration is encouraged, not even from Britain."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/apr/16/banks-move-country-headhunter-voices-of-finance", "sentences": ["&quot;People pissed off at the tax rates in Europe go to Singapore or Hong Kong.", "But even Singapore and Hong Kong is not where you want to be, if you are aiming for a high-flying career in finance."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-16T14:30:00Z", "title": "Do banks really move country when they get bashed? | Joris Luyendijk", "tags": ["Banking", "Business"], "article": "This is a story is about why banks, their threats notwithstanding, may not be so eager to leave London for a city with lighter regulation or lower taxes. Obviously dozens of factors must play a role in a decision to relocate, but a recruiter I spoke to recently mentioned a factor I had not heard before, and I thought: let&apos;s share it here in the hope that financial workers will come forward to confirm or contradict. I shall call this recruiter &quot;Marcus&quot;. He is a wonderfully astute man who spoke to the blog earlier about how financial recruitment works: &quot;We have these stock tricks and invented stories to tease out information. It&apos;s all about org charts, &apos;maps&apos; if you will, of who in a bank works where, on what, with whom. Banks really don&apos;t want us to have these charts as it makes poaching much easier for us.&quot; Marcus got back in touch when the post So, how can bankers live with themselves? went up. In it another recruiter highlights a largely ignored disconnect between national electorates and an increasingly globalised financial elite. In one quote: &quot;Many of my clients simply don&apos;t seem to care a whole lot about what the general public think. These are extremely well educated and multilingual professionals. Many are in mixed marriages with kids who have lived on two or three continents. They don&apos;t belong anywhere and don&apos;t feel beholden to any national project.&quot; Marcus texted that he recognised some of his clients in the description of post-national bankers, adding: &quot;A lot of Brits and Yanks in particular are getting fed up with the anti-banker sentiment.&quot; We decided to meet for a chat about how bankers in his network are taking the continuing anger at the financial sector. Will they leave? But first I ask him: how are things these days in the financial sector in London? &quot;It&apos;s grim. Normally there&apos;s one round of redundancies a year. Last year there were three. In April I am expecting another round. Banks still need to cut. Until now it was mostly dead wood. The sort of people that would make me think, are you still here? Those people are now out. And the cutting continues. &quot;At the same time banks are being far more aggressive in targeting their bonuses towards key staff and giving a big hint to everyone else that they can stay or leave, the company is easy either way. The idea of getting a (large) bonus just for turning up and doing your job is over. Of course this may change as the economy improves. There are some who are realising that they are going to have to work hard to get their bonus! About time too. So what are the effects of the broad anger directed at the banks? &quot;European bankers seem less bothered, perhaps they move in more exclusive circles, in the sense of being farther removed from British society at large. I get people telling me, they want to go to Asia. They say they can&apos;t stand the complaining and bashing anymore.&quot; But will they go? &quot;People pissed off at the tax rates in Europe go to Singapore or Hong Kong. That happens. Japan is seen as too insular. But even Singapore and Hong Kong is not where you want to be, if you are aiming for a high-flying career in finance. Sure, for two years or so it can make your CV look good \u2013 provided you made a real impact and you got out again. &quot;But top people are very scarce in Asia and banks tend not to let you go easily once there. For the most ambitious bankers New York and London are still where you want to be. It&apos;s like football. No matter what, you want to play in the Premier League, not in some far away league \u2013 no matter how much they pay you there.&quot; Are the banks themselves moving away, say, in response to new regulation? &quot;I don&apos;t see any one making moves. For a while there was this rumour that JP Morgan was going to take the plunge. They didn&apos;t renew the lease on a building, and were going to lease something much smaller. So everyone was going, is this it? In the end they just moved into another building. &quot;It&apos;s a huge step and will have to come right from the top, boardroom level. The thing is, no one wants to be the first, have all that on your shoulders. There&apos;s a degree of lock-in. Simply because the financial sector is in London, it&apos;s hard for individual banks to move away from here. Hedge funds have moved to Zurich. But a hedge fund employs 30 people. A major bank employs 30,000 people. &quot;Suppose you decide to move your operations to Zurich. Inevitably you are going to lose a few people in the process. You need to fill their positions. Where in Zurich will you find people with the right qualifications? You won&apos;t, so you end up having to lure people from London to Zurich. That&apos;s going to be hard. Also, it will be become easier for competitors staying on in London to poach some of your stars \u2013 much easier for people to switch jobs than to stay in your job while moving to another country. Bankers have partners who may have got jobs as well. Their kids are in school. They&apos;ve got a social life here. Say, this banker is married to a high-flying lawyer; is she also going to move? What will she be doing in Zurich or Dublin? &quot;SocGen [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale] have their trading floor in Paris. They want to move part of it to London for exactly this reason; it&apos;s so hard to hire in Paris.&quot; I had what I came for, a &quot;light-bulb moment&quot; of insight that banks leaving London or New York are bound to lose staff that will be very hard to replace. But then Marcus talked about the impact of the crisis on banks&apos; hiring, on the ins and outs of &quot;arse covering&quot;, on how Goldman Sachs is like Manchester United and why his dream is to talk to a German:  &quot;In the old days as recruiters you&apos;d work very hard from January to July, and take it easy the rest of time. By late December, early January you&apos;d hear what the banks&apos; and financial firms&apos; hiring needs were going to be. Then you&apos;d work till July to fill these. &quot;This year everyone in the banks is waiting for the other to move. They&apos;re telling me, &apos;We are waiting to see who we&apos;ll lose.&apos; People are scared. In other years they&apos;d have made a specific plan how they were going to make more money in the coming year, and this would come with particular hiring needs; we&apos;re going to expand into area X, expecting to generate Y extra revenue and for that we need Z new people. &quot;These days, they don&apos;t make plans because they are too scared that they won&apos;t work out. If everyone is hiring and you fuck up, it doesn&apos;t really matter because everyone was doing it. But now that everyone&apos;s hunkering down, if you stand out by hiring and it doesn&apos;t lead to extra revenue. &quot;It&apos;s arse covering. It&apos;s the same reason why people in corporations prefer to deal with bulge-bracket banks. If you hire one of those unknown boutique outfits, no matter how much better you may think they are, and no matter how much better value for money you believe they&apos;re offering, if it all goes wrong but you hired Morgan Stanley, you can say: &apos;Look, these guys are the most prestigious in the industry, what can I do?&apos; Whereas if you hired some unknown Ludvick Associates or something, it&apos;ll be easy for others in your organisation to lay the blame at your feet. &quot;Same story in consultancy. Often management has taken the decision already, but they still hire a big consultancy firm to seal that decision with its approval.&quot; Earlier, Marcus said that bonuses were coming down or were even disappearing. What about salaries? &quot;Goldman Sachs has been most clever about compensation. Two years ago all banks doubled salaries because bonuses came under such pressure. Goldman was the only one to make this temporary, limiting it to two years. Now every other firm wishes they had done this because Goldman is bringing down the salaries again. For others this is very difficult because it means you actually have to go into the contract and change it, which is a legal nightmare. &quot;Goldman Sachs \u2026 I&apos;d say it&apos;s like Manchester United. Only Manchester United players love Manchester United, everyone else hates them, but every player in the league would secretly love to play for them. Still, Goldman has lost some of its sheen, with the appalling losses they have had. Marcus&apos;s first interview for this blog contained fascinating stuff about recruitment research and the hunt for the &quot;org chart&quot;. He had some more gems: &quot;Italians and Lebanese are fantastic sources because they all seem to know each other. If you get one to talk to you, they&apos;ll go, wait, I have a cousin who works there and there, and I know someone who knows someone who is on that team. Spanish bankers are like that, too. &quot;So when I start doing research on a particular team at a bank, I will go down the list of people, and start by calling the person with an Italian or Spanish name. Of course this is not an iron-clad rule, but generally speaking it works well. &quot;Lebanese are more guarded than Italians when you establish contact. Almost impossible to get talking are the Germans and Swiss. They say nothing. It is a real shame because they are so precise. That would be my dream, to get Germans to talk to me.&quot; \u2022 Follow @JLbankingblog on Twitter"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/apr/17/barclays-standard-chartered", "sentences": ["Standard Chartered has climbed 26.5p to 1525.5p after traders said Singapore fund Temasek&apos;s purchase of 1% of Chinese lender ICBC could put a question mark over its 10% stake in Standard."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-17T08:48:41Z", "title": "Banks boost FTSE with Barclays and Standard Chartered in demand", "tags": ["Business", "Barclays", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Standard Chartered"], "article": "Banks are among the gainers as the market edges higher, helped by analyst comments and a touch of speculation.

Vodafone thought it had won victory in January when the Indian supreme court dismissed the tax demand, but last month the government proposed a change in the law to reopen the claim.

The [communist] politburo policy of avoiding contacts and conserving terrorist strength remains in force.&quot; Madoc added: &quot;In spite of the considerable difficulties of creating underground control organisations from the jungle, it is known that the MCP [Malayan Communist party] is striving continuously to implement directives on subversion in town and villages \u2026 &quot;Hence the need to maintain constant watch over the gullible and ambitious opponents [of] the existing regime who are natural and probably unconscious targets for subtle forms of subversion.&quot; Casualty tables written for December 1956 record: &quot;Ranking terrorists eliminated \u2013 8.&quot; The phrase &quot;eliminated&quot; is used repeatedly to describe the killing of insurgents. In January the following year, Madoc recorded: &quot;In Selangor a small but important success was achieved when the whole of the Ampang branch, on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, was eliminated.&quot; In March 1957, less than six months before the colony&apos;s formal independence, a monthly intelligence assessment observed: &quot;By the standards of the last year the number of terrorist eliminations may be considered satisfactory.&quot;     Photograph: The National Archives    The killing of Tan Fuk Leong, it was noted in May that year, &quot;by aerial bombardment, may presently ease the situation in North Negri Sembilan [sic].&quot; The assessment added: &quot;His inspiring leadership of the 3rd Independent Platoon has been a major factor in the preservation of MCP influence in the north of the state. We know from experience that the elimination of senior leaders has little apparent effect on the morale of followers, but the plain fact is that only one deputy platoon commander survives.&quot; Other means of combating communist subversion included banning books from 29 blacklisted publishing houses in Hong Kong, China and Singapore. A branch of the Labour party of Malaysia was censured for staging a concert at which &quot;two objectionable songs were sung in spite of the fact that the police had registered their disapproval&quot;. Another secret file reports on an inquiry into allegations that British troops regularly strip-searched and abused women near the village of Semenyih during a &quot;food denial&quot; operation aimed at preventing rice being smuggled out to communist units in the jungle. Women complained that they were forced to remove their clothes, which were then thrown some distance away so they had to recover them under the gaze of loitering soldiers. The final report into the allegations is absent from the file. An insight into how the government in London initially resisted the anti-colonial winds of change is contained in a &quot;secret and personal letter&quot; sent out in March 1953 by Sir Thomas Lloyd, permanent undersecretary at the Colonial Office. Dispatched to &quot;governors of non-self governing territories&quot;, it began: &quot;The growth of anti-colonial activity is a feature of the general world situation with which we have to reckon these days. The dangers for us from it are sufficiently obvious, not least because its use to smooth the way for communist strategy in colonial territories \u2026 It may only be a matter of time before members of the Arab/Asian bloc will cause [their] agents to interest themselves to our detriment in the underground political affairs of our territories.&quot; His circular, posted to British governors in Malaya, British Guyana, Fiji, Cyprus, Kenya, Uganda, Jamaica, Trinidad, Northern Rhodesia and other colonial outposts, requested feedback on &quot;the effect of anti-colonialism on the attitude of the politically conscious among indigenous colonial people&quot;. It added: &quot;In territories where there is a domiciled European population, [we recognise that] this is far from being the whole story.&quot; In Malaya, a far-seeing official acknowledged that: &quot;The word &apos;colonial&apos; has acquired a stigma and should be dropped. We should not have a Colonial Office, a secretary of state for colonial affairs, a colonial service and so on. Why not &apos;Commonwealth protected territories&apos; or some such phrase?&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/19/uneven-road-to-doing-business-burma", "sentences": ["Those patrons are companies from China, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, with interests in oil, gas, shipping, light manufacturing and other resource-based industries."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-19T06:00:02Z", "title": "Uneven road to doing business in Burma | Salil Tripathi", "tags": ["Private sector", "Global development", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Business", "Human rights", "Myanmar"], "article": "Businesses are interested in Burma because the country is rich in natural resources and has a vast pool of young people eager to work and to consume. They have been restrained because Europe and the US have imposed sanctions on the country ever since the military regime refused to recognise the opposition&apos;s victory in the 1990 elections. But times have changed. The president, Thein Sein, has introduced political and economic reforms, the Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi led the National League for Democracy (NLD) to victory in parliamentary elections on 1 April, and last week David Cameron called for a suspension of sanctions. Given the current mood, the question is no longer whether business should invest in Burma \u2013 sanctions will eventually get lifted \u2013 but how? With my colleagues, I spent a week recently in Rangoon to understand and explore how new investment in Burma can be consistent with international human rights standards. Reflecting on conversations with business leaders, diplomats, academics, human rights activists, journalists and development workers, it is clear the road ahead will be uneven. The challenges investors face in making sure their investments are not only profitable but also based on internationally accepted principles are going to be formidable. The NLD&apos;s response to future investment plans will be crucial. Many potential investors say they have stayed away from investing because the NLD backed sanctions. The party says it welcomes &quot;responsible investment&quot;. In her book Letters from Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi \u2013 who is due to visit Britain and Norway in June \u2013 wrote that the best investment is one in the future of democracy. Stressing how human rights issues are intertwined with business decisions, she wrote: &quot;If businessmen do not care about the number of political prisoners in our country, they should at least be concerned that the lack of an effective legal framework means there is no guarantee of fair business practice, or in cases of injustice, reparation.&quot; Burma has a staggering array of problems. Human rights activists mention fertile land being grabbed from farmers for commercial purposes. Workers have challenged management at a few plants, but their rights remain under threat. Major concerns remain over the use of forced labour in some parts of the country. Investors know too little about their likely local business partners or their antecedents. Besides, there is competition. Think of Burma as a crowded cafeteria with eager waiters and chefs busy cooking. The restaurant is loud and messy, with some patrons eating with chopsticks, some with their fingers. The waiters don&apos;t wear the same uniform, they aren&apos;t unionised, and nobody knows the hours they or the chefs are expected to keep. It isn&apos;t known if the women get the same wages as men. The food is not organically grown, and much of it is imported and expensive. There are inexplicable surcharges. In this metaphorical restaurant, there are a few seats at the back, where tables with white tablecloths are laid out with knives, forks and napkins, with overpriced wine on the menu. There are no patrons there yet, but it doesn&apos;t matter to the owners, because other patrons have kept the kitchen busy. Those patrons are companies from China, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, with interests in oil, gas, shipping, light manufacturing and other resource-based industries. Burma is reminiscent of India and China in the 1970s: its bureaucrats regulate and control the economy as in India, just as they control China&apos;s politics, then as now. The starting point for investors should be the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, adopted unanimously in 2011 by the UN Human Rights Council. The principles stress states&apos; obligation to protect human rights as well as the corporate responsibility to respect rights, and the need for remedies where governance gaps exist. Some key issues in Burma include access to land, workers&apos; rights, the role of security forces, the quality of partners, the business environment, and the impact on communities. In practical terms, it means that when companies want to access land \u2013 as owners, leaseholders, or tenants \u2013 their human rights due diligence should include securing the free, prior informed consent of the affected people. This isn&apos;t easy in a country where arbitrariness is the norm and where marginalised communities have been voiceless. Similarly, it means that in making hiring decisions, companies should recruit workers without discrimination and recognise their right to associate freely and bargain collectively. It means ensuring that investors do not partner business groups with an unsavoury record. Much will depend on how Burma&apos;s government acts to avoid the resource curse that many countries with abundant natural resources have faced in the past. But foreign investors \u2013 potential and existing \u2013 will have to act in an accountable and transparent manner. Burma offers the opportunity to put human rights at the heart of investment and development decisions. The country&apos;s long-suffering people deserve no less."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/apr/19/how-to-be-a-civil-servant-martin-stanley", "sentences": ["The website, which grew out of a book Stanley wrote, now serves information to senior civil servants as well as journalists and political researchers from 160 countries; apart from the UK, the six biggest readerships are in the US, Russia, Canada, India, Singapore and the Ukraine, and intriguingly, one sole visitor from New Caledonia."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-19T09:37:32Z", "title": "Martin Stanley: a very civil service", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "HR", "Central government"], "article": "Twelve years ago Martin Stanley set up a website to provide information for junior civil servants on anything and everything from civil service numbers and Whitehall jargon to pay and pensions. Since then How to be a civil servant has grown substantially in readership, from 51,000 visitors in 2005 to 252,000 last year. The website, which grew out of a book Stanley wrote, now serves information to senior civil servants as well as journalists and political researchers from 160 countries; apart from the UK, the six biggest readerships are in the US, Russia, Canada, India, Singapore and the Ukraine, and intriguingly, one sole visitor from New Caledonia. &quot;The readership shows a worldwide appetite for information on what is still often seen as the Rolls-Royce of civil services,&quot; says Stanley, a former chief executive of the Competition Commission who started his career in the civil service, working in, among others, the Inland Revenue and the Cabinet Office, where he was director of the regulatory impact unit. So what is driving the website&apos;s success? It not only caters to a need for factual information (pay and pensions are still the most popular issues) but increasingly for crucial debates on civil service reform, says Stanley. &quot;So much has changed in some areas of the civil service and yet so little in others,&quot; he says. &quot;There have been big changes in working practices and environments and the speed and informality of communication, which has led to a huge demand for accurate and immediate information.&quot; But, Stanley adds, while there&apos;s also steady demand for the site&apos;s advice on how best to work with ministers, preparing decent speeches and submissions and drafting letters, &quot;it worries me that the UK&apos;s strengths in these areas rest on constitutional foundations in which there has been little or no overt change, not just over recent years but over recent decades.&quot; Stanley cites a lack of quality decision making, by either ministers or officials, for example in preparations for competition in the NHS, the government&apos;s plans to sell off forestry (and subsequent U-turn), and promotion of the &quot;big society&quot;. The Quaker charge to speak truth to power has long become synonymous in Britain with the civil service, but is it still able to play this crucial part in the power play with ministers? Stanley believes in a lack of self-confidence in the service and cites Lord Hennessy, who compared the assuredness of senior officials in the 1970s who had grown up in the Great Depression and had fought in the Second World War with now. &quot;Successive prime ministers and other senior ministers have reported deep frustration with the support they receive from Whitehall, and sought support and advice elsewhere,&quot; says Stanley. &quot;Lord Adonis said &quot;the biggest single obstacle I faced was the weakness of the Whitehall machine&quot;. Whitehall culture is inevitably one in which caution is rewarded and risk-taking is frowned upon.&quot; But a lack of political or civil service support for changing the relationship could be down to a number of reasons, Stanley says, including ministers unwilling to admit others are also responsible for important decisions and senior civil servants unwilling to accept responsibility for departmental effectiveness. David Walker recently argued that senior civil servants should bear some of the moral and political responsibility for not fully challenging ministers if things go wrong. Stanley agrees: &quot;You can&apos;t train officials to be better at standing up to ministers \u2013 you have to change the incentives, and that means making them more responsible and accountable. &quot;We should question whether the country is still best served by the constitutional settlement in which the relationship between civil servants and ministers is supposed to be one of mutual interdependence, with ministers providing authority and officials providing expertise. Maybe ministers should no longer be held to account for the wide range of expertise-based decisions which are now taken by government.&quot; Instead, Stanley says, &quot;there would be explicit recognition that ministers are responsible and accountable for establishing the government&apos;s strategy (with some support from a small cabinet including relevant experts, a few civil servants and others) while the civil service is responsible and accountable for providing advice, consultation, communication and execution.&quot; How the civil service should be reformed is of course hotly debated, with Sir Jeremy Heywood recently stoking the fire with the suggestion that policy-making could be outsourced. Stanley says increasing traffic is coming to the website because it &quot;seeks to track these debates&quot;. And if it&apos;s any indication, visitors look likely to rise still.

Christine Lagarde, the fund&apos;s managing director, was poised on Friday night to announce that she had cobbled together enough contributions to build a bigger firewall after Australia, Singapore, South Korea and some leading developing countries agreed to take part. Announcing Britain&apos;s contribution, George Osborne said the UK had always been a supporter of the IMF and was willing to be part of a &quot;global effort&quot; to provide an increase in resources. The chancellor said the loan, which at just under \u00a310bn will not require a vote in parliament, was in line with sums being pledged by countries that were not part of the eurozone. The deal was struck after a brief rally in European stock markets following the IMF&apos;s commitment to step in with bailout funds and a better than expected business survey in Germany. The Ifo survey of German business sentiment edged up for the fifth straight month despite the continuing crisis, which has recently centred on the ability of Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece to survive their second deep recessions in three years. Spanish bond yields jumped above the crucial 6% level for the second time this week as prime minister Mariano Rajoy&apos;s rightwing government debated a further \u20ac10bn (about \u00a38bn) package of spending cuts and increased charges in education and health. &quot;It&apos;s necessary, imperative because at this moment there is no money to pay for public services,&quot; Rajoy said. The situation worsened in Greece after two of its top banks reported historic losses for 2011 after huge writedowns on loans to the Athens government. A sovereign debt swap, orchestrated by Brussels and a group of international banks, blew holes in their balance sheets. Alpha Bank and Eurobank together posted losses of \u20ac9.3bn, about 10 times more than they are currently worth in the market. The losses left Alpha&apos;s core capital reserves at 3%. At least \u20ac50bn of Greece&apos;s second bailout is earmarked to rescue its banking sector, with some of the money coming from the IMF. It is not known if widespread bank losses will force a fresh round of fundraising. Although Lagarde has said the $400bn in new loans is for use in any of the fund&apos;s 188 members, the increase in firepower is seen by the US, Canada and emerging market economies as a fighting fund for the eurozone. Labour and some Conservative MPs oppose the loan, but Osborne said it would be a sign of a &quot;dysfunctional world&quot; if member countries did not provide the fund with the resources it needed. &quot;This is a loan not a gift,&quot; he said. No country had ever lost money by lending to the IMF. Andrew Tyrie MP, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said the IMF was the &quot;only fire brigade available to the global economy&quot;. Britain&apos;s contribution was vital. Labour&apos;s Treasury spokesman, Ed Balls, said the chancellor needed to impose tougher conditions before providing more funds. &quot;The IMF has a vital role to play in the global economy and should have the resources to do that job, but it should not be bailing out the eurozone when the euro area countries are not doing their own bit to help themselves,&quot; he said. The chancellor said the four conditions he had set for a UK contribution had been met \u2013 that any loans disbursed by the IMF would be subject to the normal tough conditions, that the money would be spent helping countries rather than currencies, that other members chipped in and that the euro zone reinforced its own firewall. Osborne said the loan would come from the UK&apos;s reserves, was not money that would otherwise have been available for public spending and would not add to the national debt. Lagarde&apos;s appeal for resources exposed divisions within the IMF&apos;s membership. South Korea said it would match Britain&apos;s contribution, Australia pledged $7bn and Singapore $4bn. The US and Canada have refused to take part, while Brazil linked its support to changes in the IMF&apos;s governance to provide a greater say for the fast-growing emerging economies. Canada said that European members of the IMF&apos;s board should decide how to use the $200bn in the war chest provided by the eurozone, but that non-European members should set the conditions if the amount pledged by non-euro countries was also needed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/apr/20/malasimbo-music-festival-philippines", "sentences": ["For on the boat are not just trendy young Filipinos but kids from all over east Asia \u2013 from Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore.", "There are no direct flights between Britain and the Philippines but returns from Heathrow to Manila with stopovers in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Dubai or Singapore booked through My Adventure Store cost from \u00a3600 "], "publicationDate": "2012-04-20T21:45:00Z", "title": "Malasimbo music festival, the Philippines", "tags": ["Festivals", "Philippines holidays", "Travel", "Asia", "Festivals", "Culture"], "article": "It&apos;s two in the morning, or maybe it&apos;s three, and I am conducting a Filipino dub orchestra.

Before heading to the Philippines, I had never imagined I would take to live dub with such enthusiasm. Perhaps it had something to do with the local brew, the cheap-as-chips \u2013 but far more potent \u2013 Tanduay Rhum. Or maybe it was the surroundings, the palm-filled hills of Puerto Galera. By a tranquil, azure bay on the north side of Mindoro island, 120km south of Manila, it earned its name in the 16th century as a port in a storm for Spanish galleons. Today it&apos;s a Unesco-designated reserve, and instead of colonial merchants, young travellers from around Asia, and further afield, are washing up on its shores.     Bay at Puerto Galera, Philippines Photograph: Paul MacInnes    A motley crew of British hacks and DJs, we&apos;re on the island for the Malasimbo Festival, and none of us is quite sure what to expect. We arrive on a Friday afternoon after a dusty drive from Manila and a crowded catamaran crossing to Mindoro. After a few restorative San Miguels, we&apos;re whisked into the hills towards Mount Malasimbo. It&apos;s a steep climb and a rocky road, not the ideal terrain for a jeepney (the local transport, an unfortunate combination of retired military vehicle and cattle truck). But after a few stalls and a couple of worrying moments of slippage we arrive at the entrance to the festival site, 250m above sea level. Complimentary Tanduays in hand, we head down a fairy light-lined path. Turning the corner into the festival, my mouth forms an involuntary &quot;wow&quot;. To the left of us an emerald slope rolls down into a broad clearing lined with palm trees. Lights installed among the fronds cast kaleidoscopic rays across the tree line and pieces of sculpture scattered beneath. The festival&apos;s single stage stands in the middle of the clearing where a band of percussionists are hammering out a series of complex, syncopated rhythms. We charge down the hill. It&apos;s only the second year of the Malasimbo Festival but in 12 months, attendance has more than doubled, to 5,000 people. Its aim is simple: rather than flying in acts from around the globe, Malasimbo concentrates on showcasing Filipino music (headliner Joe Bataan is a US citizen but of Filipino extraction, so he kind of counts). That means all strands of Filipino music, from soul to jazz, hip-hop to beat music, psych rock and as many permutations of dub reggae as you can imagine. Not everything is of the highest quality but there is a real sense of celebration to every performance and to be exposed to such a range of new music in one place is a rare occurrence \u2013 it feels a privilege to be there. That Friday night we stay on until the DJs among us, Dave Harvey and Steve Nickolls of Bristol-based Futureboogie, have played their mix of cutting-edge house and electro to a crowd which, by this hour, is anything but cutting-edge. We scramble for the last jeepney home and by the time the sun has come up we have descended the hill and are dozing by the pool of our hotel (there&apos;s no camping at Malasimbo, which might detract from the authentic festival experience, but does have its consolations).     Malasimbo Festival dancers Photograph: Paul Macinnes    A few hours later we&apos;re up again for day two, helped by a tosilog, the Filipino fry-up. Garlicky rice and fried eggs are served with tocino, thick slices of bacon marinated in anise wine and sugar. It&apos;s sweet, it&apos;s sour, it&apos;s full of fat and, with a side order of Jazz Chutney, it&apos;s the perfect way to start this particular day. From the hotel we head to the boat. Boat parties are what the Brits have brought to Malasimbo. The idea is that dancing all night on land is not enough; you need to dance all afternoon and throw yourself in the sea, too. So, anchored out in the bay, looking a bit like a floating climbing frame, is our venue, the Liki Tiki. Futureboogie, as fresh as the morning dew, are on the decks again and I offer moral support by imbibing more rum and hurling myself off the top deck. Nick Colgan, our host for the trip, is watching the crowd. A broad, bald Brummie who spent 25 years as tour manager for UB40, he now presides over a series of festivals that have helped make Croatia a clubbing destination. For his Garden Festival he took a scenic stretch of coast with friendly weather and created a different kind of festival, built around daytime boat parties. He&apos;s hoping to do the same in the Philippines, launching the Tropical Garden festival in spring 2012 on the same site. On this trip he veers between avuncular and hard-nosed, keeping an eye on everything from our wellbeing to the sound systems to the state of the jeepneys&apos; suspension. But while on the Liki Tiki, however, he could be forgiven for checking out the clientele and allowing a few bells to ring in his head. For on the boat are not just trendy young Filipinos but kids from all over east Asia \u2013 from Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore. These are kids who are used to clubbing but less familiar with being able to do it in wide-open spaces. They are well aware of the European festival habit and are keen to have one of their own \u2013 perhaps without the muddy fields, but that&apos;s not too difficult to achieve in this part of the world.     Percussionists, Malasimbo Festival    That said, when we head back up the hill that Saturday night a tropical shower becomes a persistent downpour \u2013 not that it stops the crowd, or the increasingly redoubtable Futureboogie boys. The next morning, the skies are blue once more and I&apos;m standing at the prow of a catamaran heading away from Mindoro. I&apos;ve got muddy shoes, a mangled wristband and a mysterious bruise on my buttock. And I&apos;m happy. \u2022 The trip was provided by The Garden Festival (thegardenfestival.eu) which will host The Tropical Garden Festival next spring and the Malasimbo Festival (malasimbofestival.com, dates for 2013&apos;s festival tbc).

Friday marked the 67th day of Rangers&apos; administration with those running the club still to name which of those parties interested in the business will be handed preferred bidder status. Hours after McCoist made his plea one of those bidders, Bill Miller, outlined his somewhat ambitious \u00a311.2m purchase plans for Rangers in detail. McCoist said: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m worried more now than before but I&apos;m certainly more aware that we have to start getting some action in terms of preferred bidder status.&quot; The manager added: &quot;I agree that the longer it goes on, the greater chance there is that the club won&apos;t exist. But I&apos;ve said that all along. We&apos;ve always been positive but we&apos;ve never ever said that there isn&apos;t another option that we don&apos;t want. It goes without saying that that option we don&apos;t want will become more apparent the longer it goes on.&quot; It was purely coincidental that a subsequent statement from Miller emerged, albeit he has already met the Rangers manager. Miller wants to run Rangers as a fresh entity while administrators conclude what he regards as a lengthy process to form a company voluntary arrangement. Thereafter he will look to merge the businesses. &quot;I will put the &apos;heart&apos; of the club into an &apos;incubator&apos; company while [the administrators] Duff &amp; Phelps work to make the &apos;sick patient&apos; healthy through a CVA process that effectively works to &apos;radiate&apos; the toxicity of past administrations&apos; sins out of the patient while the &apos;healthy heart&apos; is preserved and moves forward,&quot; Miller said. &quot;Once the CVA process has been completed and the patient is on the mend, the administrators will return Rangers Football Club plc to me for a nominal sum.&quot; Yet in what is a crucial element Miller will proceed only if he receives unlikely guarantees that Rangers will not suffer further domestic football penalties. Earlier this month the Scottish Premier League announced proposals to punish any club which seeks to re-enter the competition as a newly formed company. &quot;My offer is contingent upon the regulatory bodies agreeing that the club will begin play in the 2012-13 season in the SPL and that they will do so without any loss of points and with all historic titles intact,&quot; Miller added. Earlier on Friday the Singapore-based Bill Ng announced he was pulling out of the race to buy Rangers whilst firing a broadside at Duff &amp; Phelps. Ng said: &quot;Recent developments in the bidding process, with unwarranted and unexplained delays, have prompted our withdrawal from the bidding process. After lengthy negotiations with a number of key stakeholders, we have serious concerns over the deliverability of the shares on offer to gain control of the club, in a time frame that will allow us to exit the administration via CVA. &quot;We would like to highlight that we have become increasingly uncomfortable and frustrated with the process dealing with Duff &amp; Phelps, and the length of time that it has taken to reach this stage.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/22/conspiracies-legacy-empire", "sentences": ["Britain&apos;s Internal Security Act \u2013 ironically repealed only the day before White&apos;s article \u2013 was used in both Malaysia and Singapore (where it remains in force) to suppress democratic activism and entrench authoritarianism."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-22T20:00:06Z", "title": "Letters: Conspiracies and the legacy of empire", "tags": ["National Archives", "Politics past", "UK news", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Kenya", "Africa", "Chagos Islands", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "Guyana", "Americas", "World news"], "article": "In his report on the opening at the National Archives (TNA) of the first tranche of colonial files stored secretly at Hanslope Park until last year (Hundreds of Malayans &apos;eliminated&apos; by British in 1950s secret files reveal, 18 April), Owen Boycott suggests that they reveal how &quot;the government in London initially resisted the anti-colonial winds of change&quot;. He cites a letter from one of these files, sent to governors by the Colonial Office in March 1953. In fact, a copy of this letter was released to TNA in the 1980s under the standard 30-year rule, and its contents have thus been publicly available for decades. This tends to confirm what many historians have assumed since the existence of the &quot;migrated archives&quot; was first revealed \u2013 that much of this material will simply confirm what we know from other sources. We have long been aware that British withdrawal from many of its former colonies was accompanied by the destruction of government records. We can also probably assume that some particularly sensitive files were simply spirited away and are not part of the Hanslope Park collection. Some of what remains may well be of considerable value, and its belated release is to be welcomed. But although &quot;secret files&quot; make for good headlines, it will take a much longer process of careful analysis and cross-checking before we can confidently point to significant &quot;revelations&quot;.Professor Philip MurphyDirector, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London \u2022\u2008The FCO&apos;s claim that its secret archive contained no migrated British Guiana sensitive archives discredits the entire release process (Don&apos;t be fooled by claims of Foreign Office transparency, 18\u00a0April). British Guiana saw one democratically elected government overthrown by British troops in 1953 and then from 1962-64 a well-documented joint British and American covert operation, which involved terror bombings, detention of politicians and black propaganda. The decolonisation of British Guiana was part of the cold war: the security files kept at Government House, with their thick data on local people, would have had potential future operational value and would have been repatriated. When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO that they had been destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point &quot;discover&quot; its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes &quot;a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of&quot;. Historians should have full access to that inventory. The FCO refuses to make public the full inventory of the Hanslope Park archive. While we have full confidence in Professor Badger, many historians now wonder if he was not handed an archive which, once again, had been screened and culled.Professor Richard DraytonRhodes Professor of Imperial History, Kings College London \u2022\u2008Your special report (18 April) on the release of recently discovered colonial files highlighted the deportation of the Chagos islanders to make way for a US base on Diego Garcia in the early 70s. The London-based files, released in 1999, provided the evidence on which the high court ruled in November 2000 that the expulsion was unlawful and that the Chagossians should be allowed to return to their homeland. These additional files will provide further insights into the way the FCO perpetrated the subterfuge that the people were contract labourers from Mauritius and Seychelles where they were to be &quot;re-located&quot;. The release is timely, as the European court of human rights is currently considering the case. It is to be hoped that the court will take account of these documents and also the WikiLeaks concerning the designation of the Chagos Islands marine protected area in 2010, before reaching its judgment.David SnoxellCo-ordinator of the Chagos Islands all-party parliamentary group \u2022\u2008The Foreign Office documents on Diego Garcia confirm a conspiracy that the US and UK engaged in to forcibly remove the Chagossians. It&apos;s a conspiracy that continues, as the UK enacts environmental laws in bad faith (WikiLeaks cable 09LONDON1156) and the US presses for permanent displacement (WikiLeaks cable 05LONDON3980). The US and UK governments must redress the wrongs that they have committed against the Chagossians. More than 28,000 people around the world signed a petition to the White House. But this is only a first step. A substantial change in the US government&apos;s position on the Chagossians will need an outpouring of complaints to Congress.Elena LandriscinaStudent attorney, UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic \u2022\u2008It is likely to be correct that despite William Hague&apos;s professed policy of transparency towards the release of government files from the colonial era that far from everything will be released and it will depend on the skills of historians to spot gaps in the record. This does however suggest an important need for a policy on such matters for the future \u2013 that is files being amassed now \u2013 which will meet the standards of an age where information is likely to come in to the public domain. Given his professed attachment to democratic principles, is this perhaps something that the deputy prime minister could usefully address himself to?Dr Keith FlettLondon Socialist Historians Group\u00a0  \u2022\u2008One assumes that the brutality of the last days of empire will become part of Michael Gove&apos;s &quot;island story&quot; to be taught in all his beloved academies.Paul Noel WilsonBarnoldswick, Lancashire \u2022\u2008Michael White&apos;s suggestion that British colonial wars might have been justified by the cold war (Colonial papers and the ugly legacy of empire, 18 April) is typical of the emerging rehabilitation of imperialism: tragically misguided and historically ignorant. The Malayan emergency did Malaysians &quot;a historic favour&quot;? It entrenched in power a predatory Malay elite, consigning ethnic Chinese and Indian citizens to second-class status to this day. Britain&apos;s Internal Security Act \u2013 ironically repealed only the day before White&apos;s article \u2013 was used in both Malaysia and Singapore (where it remains in force) to suppress democratic activism and entrench authoritarianism. It was Britain&apos;s attempt to return to ruling Burma after Japan&apos;s invasion \u2013 not its supposedly hasty departure \u2013 that provoked a split in the pro-independence forces and the subsequent civil war. The single-minded quest to crush anything that vaguely threatened local hierarchies and western interests \u2013 described, often in a knowingly cynical fashion, as &quot;communism&quot; \u2013 also wreaked havoc on the wider region. A popular democratic movement in Brunei was suppressed by British forces, which consistently backed the monarchical dictatorship which remains in power today. Forcing Britain&apos;s colonial territories into the Malaysian Federation to serve as an anti-communist bulwark also provoked war with Indonesia, which helped precipitate General Suharto&apos;s coup and the massacre of one million suspected communists. Suharto, backed by western arms and aid, then ruled Indonesia brutally for 31 years. Elsewhere in south-east Asia, hideous violence was inflicted on Indochina by French and US forces, again in the name of anti-communism. As many as 3.8m Vietnamese were killed in the Vietnam war, while 1.7m died in Cambodia after a bombed-out population was forced into the arms of the Khmer Rouge. After Pol Pot was overthrown by Vietnamese forces in 1978, the west backed the Khmer Rouge at the UN, the US even sending them arms. The cold war did indeed &quot;have a point&quot;: to defend power and privilege. The peoples of what used to be called the &quot;third world&quot; paid \u2013 and continue to pay \u2013 a heavy price for that.Dr Lee JonesAuthor, ASEAN, Sovereignty and Intervention in Southeast Asia \u2022\u2008The recent release of documents by the Foreign Office is a welcome step towards greater transparency in government. Perhaps now the government may also feel able to comment upon the WikiLeaks revelations, for instance that the marine protected area created around the American military base of Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean was primarily put in place \u2013 not to safeguard the environment \u2013 but was a cynical move to prevent the return of the Chagossian people who were forcibly evicted in the 1960s? According to the cable from the US embassy in London, Colin Roberts, for the Foreign Office said: &quot;There would be &apos;no human footprints&apos; or &apos;Man Fridays&apos;.&quot; And that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago&apos;s former residents. This &quot;Man Friday&quot; phrase is repeated in the documents released last week, when FO officials joked among themselves about their policy to remove 1,500 British subjects from their homes, to lie to the UN committee concerned with the health and wellbeing of such communities, and deny to the press and public that the evacuation was taking place. The jovial and clubby tone about the forced deportation of a people and their continual struggles against poverty, racism and homesickness is troubling to read in documents from the 1960s. Can the government confirm that the tone has changed today and that the WikiLeaks cable is an invention? Or \u2013 even more important \u2013 would the government change the policy and the tone and allow the Chagossian people to return to their homes?Philippa GregoryPatron, Comit\u00e9 Chagos"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/23/world-bank-land-grabs-africa", "sentences": ["&quot;The World Bank&apos;s policies for land privatisation and concentration have paved the way for corporations from Wall Street to Singapore to take upwards of 80m hectares (197.6 acres) of land from rural communities across the world in the past few years,&quot; said the groups in a statement accusing the bank of promoting &quot;corporate-oriented rather than people-centred&quot; policies and laws."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-23T14:00:30Z", "title": "Campaigners claim World Bank helps facilitate land grabs in Africa", "tags": ["Global development", "Land rights", "Environment", "International land deals", "World Bank", "Economics", "Global economy", "Africa", "Food poverty"], "article": "The World Bank is helping corporations and international investors snap up cheap land in Africa and developing countries worldwide at the expense of local communities, environment and farm groups said in a statement released on Monday to coincide with the bank&apos;s annual land and poverty conference in Washington DC. According to the groups, which include NGO Friends of the Earth International (FOEI) and international peasants&apos; group La Via Campesina, decades of World Bank policies have pushed African and other governments to privatise land and focus on industrial farming. In addition, they say, the bank is playing a &quot;key role&quot; in the global rush for farmland by providing capital and guarantees to big multinational investors. &quot;The result has often been \u2026 people forced off land they have traditionally farmed for generations, more rural poverty and greater risk of food shortages&quot;, said FOEI in a separate report launched ahead of the World Bank conference. The event, which promises to focus on &quot;land governance in a rapidly changing environment&quot;, is billed as a forum to discuss &quot;innovative approaches&quot; to land governance challenges including climate change, the growing demand for key natural resources, and rapid urbanisation. But campaigners say the conference mistakenly focuses on how to improve large-scale land deals rather than on helping local communities to secure or retain access to their land. The FOEI report suggests land grabbing is intensifying and spreading, especially in rural areas of Africa and Asia. &quot;High levels of demand for land have pushed up prices, bringing investment banks and speculators into farming,&quot; it says. &quot;The World Bank&apos;s policies for land privatisation and concentration have paved the way for corporations from Wall Street to Singapore to take upwards of 80m hectares (197.6 acres) of land from rural communities across the world in the past few years,&quot; said the groups in a statement accusing the bank of promoting &quot;corporate-oriented rather than people-centred&quot; policies and laws. In 2010, the World Bank spearheaded the development of new principles for responsible agricultural investment to better ensure that land deals respect local rights, livelihoods and resources; these guidelines have also been criticised for legitimising, rather than challenging, the global rush for land. Allegations of land-grabbing have hit countries around the world and have been accompanied by growing concern about whether large-scale land deals are delivering promised income and employment for local people. This week, a coalition of NGOs and research institutes is expected to release the latest findings of the Land Matrix project, which has attempted to systematically document recent land acquisitions. Current estimates suggest that 80-230m hectares of land have been leased or bought in recent years, largely to produce food, feed or fuel for the international market. World Bank money has been involved in many recent international land deals, says the FOEI report. In Uganda, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the bank&apos;s private sector lending arm, contributed $10m for a project to clear 10,000 hectares of land for palm oil plantations on Bugala Island in Lake Victoria. But FOEI research has shown that local people were prevented from accessing water sources and grazing land, suggesting that \u2013 despite promises of employment \u2013 many people have lost their means of livelihood. Resistance to land grabs is growing: Harvard University has come under intense pressure to ensure its investments do not contribute to land grabs in Africa, while Iowa State University has withdrawn from a deal in Tanzania that could have displaced an estimated 160,000 people. In South Sudan, the government halted a land deal after local communities erupted in protest, saying their lands had been secretly leased to an American company. This month, farmers and land rights activists from across Sierra Leone converged on the country&apos;s capital for a national assembly of communities affected by large-scale land deals, where groups launched a new civil-society watchdog to monitor agribusiness investments. The meeting followed the first international farmers&apos; conference to tackle land grabs, held in Selingue, southern Mali, in late 2011. On Tuesday, food justice activists, environmental organisations, students and Occupy Wall Street groups are set to gather in front of New York&apos;s Waldorf Astoria hotel to challenge the fourth annual Global AgInvesting (GAI) conference, where institutional investors and fund managers are meeting to discuss opportunities for agricultural investments overseas. &quot;Governments around the world need to stop land grabbing, not just try to mitigate its worst impacts. Governments must abide by their human rights obligations on land and drastically reduce demand for commodities such as palm oil from the west,&quot; said Kirtana Chandrasekaran, FOEI&apos;s food sovereignty co-ordinator. David Kureeba, from the Ugandan national association of professional environmentalists, said: &quot;People&apos;s rights to land [in Uganda] are being demolished. Small-scale farming and forestry that protected unique wildlife, heritage and food is being converted to palm oil wastelands that only profit agribusinesses.&quot; Government officials, civil society, experts and the private sector will gather at the World Bank conference, which ends on Thursday, to discuss large-scale land aquisitions, land governance in the context of climate change, and rapid urbanisation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/apr/24/singapore-mens-fashion-week", "sentences": ["In Singapore, while in the city to attend Men&apos;s fashion week, my chat about the country&apos;s biggest fashion event drew a blank with drivers.", "Instead, they were more interested in talking about what a mollycoddled generation Singapore has produced in its youth.", "Singapore has the highest concentration of millionaires and shopping malls in the world, but relatively few locals have had an interest in high fashion or the arts.", "I remember my frustrations growing up in Singapore in the early 2000s; my hunger for creative energy could only be satiated through copies of Vogue and Dazed &amp; Confused.", "This men&apos;s fashion week (MFW) was the first of its kind in Asia, devised by Singaporean philanthropist and entrepreneur, Frank Cintamani, who set the ball rolling when he flew a group of Parisian couturiers to Singapore last October for the city&apos;s first Haute Couture week.", "Frank Cintamani, founder of Singapore fashion week.", "One of more directional collections came from Britain&apos;s Bodybound, if perhaps aided by the buzz in the build-up to their show: Royal College of Art-educated Kim Choong-Wilkins \u2013 whose mother is of Singaporean descent \u2013 and Pliny Champion created a new collection that expanded on ideas from their home show, but a pair of clear PVC culottes set tongues wagging: Will they, won&apos;t they show bums?", "Designs by Diet Butcher Slim Skin and Reckless Ericka at Singapore Men\u2019s fashion week.", "Photograph: Men\u2019s Fashion Week Singapore    But where is the local talent?", "Of the 19 designers chosen, just one \u2013 Reckless Ericka \u2013 could be truly considered Singaporean.", "So does the Singapore approach represent a new future for fashion shows?", "Among attendees, there was some discussion as to whether the Singapore Men&apos;s fashion week is bringing back a charm that is lost and occasionally reminisced about\u2013 where professionals, with ever-increasing hunger for newness, dart in and out the European shows.", "Like every new kid on the block, Singapore needs to offer something original to gain credibility.", "What I can be sure of is that Cintamani and Singapore have this in common: what they say they&apos;ll do, they will get done.", "Within the next few years, Singapore&apos;s cab drivers may well become rather more fashion-literate.", "The headline was also modified as the piece incorrectly identified this as the first men&apos;s fashion week in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-24T15:22:00Z", "title": "Singapore shows promise with its fashion week", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "Fashion weeks"], "article": "The short conversations you have with taxi drivers reveal a great deal about a city&apos;s character.

In Singapore, while in the city to attend Men&apos;s fashion week, my chat about the country&apos;s biggest fashion event drew a blank with drivers. Instead, they were more interested in talking about what a mollycoddled generation Singapore has produced in its youth. Singapore has the highest concentration of millionaires and shopping malls in the world, but relatively few locals have had an interest in high fashion or the arts. I remember my frustrations growing up in Singapore in the early 2000s; my hunger for creative energy could only be satiated through copies of Vogue and Dazed &amp; Confused.  Today, however, change is in the air. The government is charging towards their goal to become a global arts hub by 2015. This is &apos;arts&apos; in the broadest sense: the ban on casinos has been dropped, and locations such as Marina Bay Sands, a venue for the fashion weeks, have begun to attract international attention. &quot;We no longer want to be the Switzerland of the world, but the Monte Carlo of the world,&quot; said one local friend in a humourous but accurate remark. This men&apos;s fashion week (MFW) was the first of its kind in Asia, devised by Singaporean philanthropist and entrepreneur, Frank Cintamani, who set the ball rolling when he flew a group of Parisian couturiers to Singapore last October for the city&apos;s first Haute Couture week.      Frank Cintamani, founder of Singapore fashion week. Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images    The agenda for 2012 was to bring music and menswear together \u2013 &quot;Who is Lady Gaga without the fashion she wears?&quot; Cintamani quipped. The budget for this year is $8 million SPD (\u00a34 million), highlighting the scale of the project. &quot;We&apos;re making the first serious attempt to marry fashion and music,&quot; Cintamani, looking sharp in a Givenchy suit, tells me when I meet him during MFW. &quot;But the same objective remains \u2013 that this is a platform for Asian menswear designers.&quot;  Is roping in a whole other industry a bit too much too soon? &quot;I couldn&apos;t wait half a generation before this picked up, I needed to inject the music component to propel it to the next level. It needs to be ten times the scale of what it is,&quot; he adds. MFW found sponsorship this year from brands such as Aston Martin and Leica. What the majority of designers at MFW brought to menswear were new possibilities to be both comfortable and stylish. Approaching the music and menswear element most holistically was Hisashi Fukatami&apos;s label Diet Butcher Slim Skin, inspired by the experimental compositions of pianist H Zett M, who gave a live performance while the Japanese designer spun electro sounds on stage. The collection made combat style chic, with a touch of romanticism. Three-piece suits were fresh with cropped trousers, particularly in the ombr\u00e9s and embroidered linen. Another highlight came from Korean brand Beyond Closet, where designer Tae Yong used American sportswear to inject humour into the workplace \u2013 his opening look rather strangely but successfully spliced an old-fashioned blazer with elements from a varsity jacket, while another style elongated the baseball jacket to knee-length.  One of more directional collections came from Britain&apos;s Bodybound, if perhaps aided by the buzz in the build-up to their show: Royal College of Art-educated Kim Choong-Wilkins \u2013 whose mother is of Singaporean descent \u2013 and Pliny Champion created a new collection that expanded on ideas from their home show, but a pair of clear PVC culottes set tongues wagging: Will they, won&apos;t they show bums? They covered up in the end, which served as a benign reminder that this is the country that issues penalties for public indecency. &quot;We didn&apos;t want it to be a statement for the sake of it,&quot; Champion said. The collection overturned traditional menswear with a considered jam on rivets, studs, transparency and metallic knits.      Designs by Diet Butcher Slim Skin and Reckless Ericka at Singapore Men\u2019s fashion week. Photograph: Men\u2019s Fashion Week Singapore    But where is the local talent? Of the 19 designers chosen, just one \u2013 Reckless Ericka \u2013 could be truly considered Singaporean. The small island has always struggled with its own design scene; it is now playing its strength as an efficient melting point \u2013 &quot;a postmodern pastiche of the best bits,&quot; Charlie Casely-Hayford remarked. Afton Chen and Louis Koh, the duo behind the label, displayed great construction skills, creating volume and drama out of the lightest of fabrics (a must in the tropics) and received a well-deserved standing ovation. So does the Singapore approach represent a new future for fashion shows? Among attendees, there was some discussion as to whether the Singapore Men&apos;s fashion week is bringing back a charm that is lost and occasionally reminisced about\u2013 where professionals, with ever-increasing hunger for newness, dart in and out the European shows. &quot;At least there&apos;s entertainment here instead of all the waiting around and chaos in London \u2013 it&apos;s never this relaxing!&quot; another London-based journalist said to me, as K-pop group Se7en took the stage in between the catwalk shows.  But as well as a dearth in homegrown designers, the music-fashion fusion puzzled some designers and industry attendees. Each fashion show was followed by a performance from K-pop and Asian stars throughout the five-day event. Never mind that I knew little of the artists or the songs; the energy sometimes failed to penetrate several guests as seats emptied after each designer&apos;s bow.  The event&apos;s ambitions were grand; the 220,000 square feet venue was significant, though of what was fundamentally a showcase of 19 designers over five days, the result sometimes felt a little underwhelming. But let&apos;s remember that it took 20 years for power players to start taking London fashion week seriously. Like every new kid on the block, Singapore needs to offer something original to gain credibility.  What I can be sure of is that Cintamani and Singapore have this in common: what they say they&apos;ll do, they will get done. And there certainly exists a growing group of locals tired of hearing what a cultural desert the country is. Within the next few years, Singapore&apos;s cab drivers may well become rather more fashion-literate. \u2022 This article was modified at 09:57 on 25 April to correct the spelling of Reckless Erika.

Writing in the great, but currently neglected, tradition of Waugh, Wodehouse and Kingsley Amis, he is probably at his best in his 1967 Fleet Street novel Towards the End of the Morning, a very funny story of expenses fiddling, lunchtime boozing, and big ambitions leaking away over the galley proofs of the &quot;Country Day By Day&quot; column. But there are plenty of others too, from the entertaining 1999 art-historical romp Headlong, to his debut The Tin Men, a satire praised by Wodehouse himself, in which Swiftian mad scientists attempt to automate every aspect of British life, from bingo and altruism to football results and newspaper headlines (they discover a lexicon of &quot;multipurpose monosyllables&quot; which can be used in almost any combination to turn out &quot;soothingly familiar yet calmingly incomprehensible&quot; headlines: &quot;Strike Threat Probe&quot;, &quot;Test Row Leak&quot;, &quot;Hate Plea Move&quot;). In Towards the End of the Morning, his thwarted hack John Dyson is sent on a foreign trip, and finds himself mentally transformed: &quot;The Final Departure lounge, sealed off from gross particular Britain by passport and customs barriers, was a bright nowhere land, sterilised of nationality and all the other ties and limitations of everyday life.

Beyond those lies the Foundation \u2013 a dream of spotless white walls, cloudless blue skies and well-watered bougainvillaea, run like clockwork by Mrs Toppler&apos;s PA, the &quot;discreetly tanned, discreetly blonde, discreetly effective&quot; Nikki Hook. Unfortunately, between him and his destination lies Oliver Fox, an impulsive chancer with &quot;tousled blond hair, and soft smiling eyes&quot;, who is having serious doubts about his latest wheeze \u2013 a week in a borrowed villa with Georgie, a woman he has met once, in a bar. By chance he picks up Dr Wilfred&apos;s identical suitcase at the carousel, and when he sees Nikki waiting at arrivals with a sign saying &quot;Dr Norman Wilfred&quot;, he decides to assume the academic&apos;s identity; he is soon charming the other guests with his clueless but wittily gnomic replies on scientometrics. Dr Wilfred, meanwhile, is duly whisked off by Oliver&apos;s pre-ordered taxi to a villa, where he goes to sleep and wakes up to find Georgie in his bed. Meanwhile, Oliver&apos;s\u00a0angry girlfriend arrives on the island; a Greek shipping magnate and a Russian oligarch also become embroiled in the action. Did I mention that Skios was a farce? Like Frayn&apos;s film Clockwise, it&apos;s a sort of stylised anxiety dream about a well-ordered world spinning into chaos. A lot of his comic novels have farcical plots, but the main focus and the driving force in the comedy are traditional novelistic ones: the characters and their amusing delusions; satirically observed social detail. Skios resembles a straight theatrical farce, all mistaken identities, embarrassing situations, amazing coincidences and mislaid clothing, building to a frenetic denouement. Frayn has described it as &quot;an experiment to see you if you can write a farce as a novel without the communal response that helps farce to work in the theatre&quot;. It is not, it has to be said, an entirely successful experiment. It lands Frayn with characters who are genre-bound and tinny: bland romantic leads supported by by-the-numbers comic foreigners. They seem to want actors to flesh them out, to gurn amusingly and perform pratfalls on their behalf. I suspect also that farce is best taken at one sitting: it needs concentrated attention to reach a hysterical pitch. Skios, though short, is too long for that. Though this is clearly not one of Frayn&apos;s best, it doesn&apos;t demand much, and it has a lot of incidental charm. There are quite a few good jokes, and the satire of the high-brow culture circuit is sharp: &quot;They had had lectures on the Crisis in this and the Challenge of that. They had an Enigma of, a Whither? and a Why?, three Prospects for and two Reconsiderations of.&quot; Frayn waxes philosophical towards the finale, with dazzling detours into determinism and the &quot;great gear chain of cause-and-effect&quot;. But by the time the book has ended \u2013 with a surprisingly high body count \u2013 it&apos;s not clear that Skios has transcended its origins."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/26/bo-xilai-wiretap-hu-jintao-claims", "sentences": ["But Bo Zhiyue, an expert on elite politics at the University of Singapore and no relation of Bo Xilai, thought it unlikely that authorities would disclose such matters publicly."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-26T09:58:12Z", "title": "Bo Xilai officials 'wiretapped call to President Hu Jintao'", "tags": ["Bo Xilai", "Hu Jintao", "China", "World news"], "article": "The spotlight on the Bo Xilai affair has turned back on to political tensions in China following reports that officials in Chongqing wiretapped a call to the country&apos;s president, Hu Jintao \u2013 helping to trigger the scandal that unseated Bo. Official accounts of the case have portrayed it as being unrelated to the political struggle for power in the country. Bo is instead accused of unspecified disciplinary violations while his wife, Gu Kailai, is accused of murdering the British businessman Neil Heywood. But the New York Times, which cited almost a dozen sources with ties to the Communist party, said the wiretapping was seen as evidence of Bo&apos;s overreaching ambition and compounded leaders&apos; mistrust of him. It said anti-surveillance devices detected that the call to Hu, made by a senior anti-corruption official in Chongqing last August, was being monitored. Bo was party secretary of the south-western city at the time. The incident encouraged disciplinary and security officials to investigate Bo&apos;s police chief and ally, Wang Lijun. That is thought to be one of the factors that ultimately led to Wang&apos;s flight this year to a US consulate, where he alleged that Gu had murdered Heywood. Jean-Pierre Cabestan, professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University, described the wiretapping as &quot;a kind of betrayal&quot;. He added: &quot;This is more than the killing of one man. That was the last straw, but I think before that, and even without that, [Bo] was already being investigated and would have been forced into retirement or something more serious. &quot;It underscored how much mistrust you have among leaders and particularly between Bo and some of the people in the centre.&quot; According to the New York Times, a preliminary indictment in March accused Bo of damaging party unity by collecting evidence on other leaders. But Bo Zhiyue, an expert on elite politics at the University of Singapore and no relation of Bo Xilai, thought it unlikely that authorities would disclose such matters publicly. &quot;It may [prove to] be a fact that Bo Xilai did all these things for his own advancement but it is too damaging to make public,&quot; he said. &quot;Who knows who else might be involved? It would be a lot more complicated,&quot; he said. The New York Times said the eavesdropping operations in Chongqing began as part of a surveillance project overseen by Wang, which was officially intended to tackle crime and maintain stability in the area but went much further. One political analyst, citing information obtained from a colonel, alleged Bo sought to tap the phones of virtually all high-ranking leaders who visited the city \u2013 including Zhou Yongkang, the security boss thought to be Bo&apos;s main defender among senior leaders. &quot;Bo wanted to be extremely clear about what leaders&apos; attitudes toward him were,&quot; the analyst told the newspaper. The newspaper said that in the case last August, Ma Wen, minister of supervision, was calling Hu on a high-security land link from the state guesthouse in Chongqing, which was monitored on Bo&apos;s orders. After learning of the tapping, Beijing turned central security and disciplinary investigators on to Wang, whom Bo blamed for the incident. The political analyst told the New York Times that the party&apos;s central commission for discipline inspection had stationed up to four teams in Chongqing \u2013 two of them undercover \u2013 by the beginning of 2012. One focus was a corruption case in a city where Wang was once police chief. A party academic with ties to Bo said Wang had twice filed complaints to the inspection commission before his flight to the US consulate, claiming Bo had &quot;opposed party central&quot; authorities, including ordering the wiretapping of central leaders. The requests were rejected. But Bo was furious to learn that Wang had also monitored calls by him and Gu, sources said. Following Wang&apos;s flight he detained his wiretapping specialist, a district police chief named Wang Pengfei. With attention to the Bo family&apos;s finances growing, his brother resigned from a Hong Kong-listed company, China Everbright International, late on Wednesday. The company said the decision was taken &quot;to minimise any possible adverse impact on the company of certain reports recently published by the media on his family background&quot;. Bo Xiyong, who had been vice-chair at the company since 2003 under the name Li Xueming, held around 10m of its shares, worth around $4.2m. A commentary in the state-run tabloid Global Times accused the west of using the case to score cheap points. &quot;Bo is being investigated in accordance with the law. This news is really explosive, but will not shake China&apos;s political foundation,&quot; it said. &quot;Most western people are unfamiliar with Bo&apos;s name and Chongqing. It is illogical that the mainstream western media places so much attention on Bo&apos;s case,&quot; it complained. It claimed the Chinese public&apos;s interest in the case was dwindling. Chinese media have not been able to report on it beyond reprinting the official Xinhua announcements."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2012/apr/27/your-views-on-the-news-nintendo-diabetes-boeing-dreamliner", "sentences": ["I did a 13-hr 6000 mile non-stop run from London to Singapore not long ago and it just about did my head in."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-27T11:31:00Z", "title": "Your views on the news - diabetes costs, Nintendo and Boeing's Dreamliner", "tags": [], "article": "Boeing dreamliner arrives in Britain Commenters reviewed the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, as the much anticipated aircraft made its first appearance in the skies above Britain ahead of a 2014 delivery date. Polymorph says:  Direct flights to Australia but carrying less passengers? Even if there are fuel savings with this plane the temptation will surely be to schedule more flights thus adding to the total of planes and atmospheric pollution, contrails and crowded skies around airports. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s a lovely plane, and technologically advanced, but I can&apos;t help feeling that less will eventually equal more.  brenzone is not sold:  18-hour, 8500 mile journey in one shot. It&apos;s hardly going to draw me. I did a 13-hr 6000 mile non-stop run from London to Singapore not long ago and it just about did my head in. Banged up in a plane, albeit a 747 jumbo, for all that time, with insipid movies, bland music, etc. I was bored out of my tree. Even boozing and a book wouldn&apos;t relieve the tedium. I think I&apos;d rather go by Aeroflot in a Tupolev or whatever next time if it be possible - change in Moscow, maybe put down in Tashkent and Rangoon ... Much more enjoyable :)  Vestrit7 disagrees:  For those of us who have to travel long-haul semi-regularly, the opportunity to get the trip out of the way in one flight is really attractive.  If they could extend the flight range to be able to do say London to Auckland in one flight, I&apos;d be a very happy punter. But most flights from the UK to NZ are two stop-overs, so even if this plane cuts that to one stop-over, that&apos;s a big improvement in the experience (keep in mind that when ex-pats like me travel home to places like NZ or Australia, we just want to get there as quickly as possible. Stop-overs are really just a pain in the hoop, rather than an opportunity to check out some new city or airport). Besides, if you&apos;re bored and you&apos;re on a plane that long, just sleep! :)  ColonelCallan writes:  The number of Dreamliner&apos;s in operation will remain insignificant, so any improved efficiency will still be a drop in the ocean compared to the overall impact of aviation on the environment. As the number of passengers and flights grows, demand for airlines will increase with the greatest demand coming from Asia which is just discovering cheap air travel. All this new capacity will more than outweigh and offset any efficiency improvements of individual planes like the A380s and the dreamliners coming onto the market.  JMpiper responds:  There will be hundreds of Dreamliners within a few years, and the technology like composite materials and the new Trent engines will gradually find their way onto all planes. It may well be a showcase of the technology for now but I think it looks promising.  13-year-olds and the pill Should the contraceptive pill be available to 13-year-old girls from high street pharmacies? An evaluation of a pilot scheme that offered girls over the age of 16 the pill without requiring them to see a GP first suggested the trial could be extended nationwide and to include 13- to 16-year-olds. Jazzactivist posts:  Seems to me that the most sensible option might be for young women aged 16 and over to be able to go to a pharmacy and buy the repeats of the pill over the counter, once they have been prescribed the right one for their needs by a doctor. And girls aged 13 - 16 should have to go to a GP or family planning clinic to get it, and have access to a bit of discussion about why they need it, what they hope to achieve by using it etc. These girls are under the legal age of sexual consent, and the law exists because their bodies are still going through physical changes and, as they are still children, they need to be protected from sexual exploitation.  I was prescribed the pill at 17, as I was having sex with my boyfriend, but I suffered from headaches, double vision and extreme tiredness, which was explained away as normal for teenagers. It took quite a while to discover that I had an allergy to synthetic progesterone and shouldn&apos;t be taking the combination pill. It is important that young women, and particularly girls, receive the right information and contraception for them. perhaps presenting this as a caring approach may encourage girls and young women not to rush into sex before they are really ready.  NaturallySelective says:  Anything which helps to avoid unwanted pregnancies is to be welcomed and I look forward to hearing a chorus of cheers from the anti-abortionists. More seriously, availability of the pill for very young teenagers does raise the real possibility of increasing pressure for girls to have sex before they are emotionally mature, quite apart from the matter of their being under- age. It is essential that better and more widely available education is part of the process, including measures to help young girls build their self esteem so that they, not their peers or their boyfriends, can make the right choices at the right times.   From bishtraining:  Speaking as someone who works in the field.... I think there are various issues with this kind of approach, which I&apos;m sure the commissioners and evaluators are looking into.  We need to ensure that pharmacists doing this are well trained and able to offer a safe and confidential space for young people.  Taking the contraceptive pill is more complex than taking an emergency contraceptive pill (pharmacists already offer a very useful service for young people in most parts of the country for this). So young people need to be given &apos;the pill teach&apos;: taking them roughly the same time each day, what happens if they miss one, side effects etc etc. They also need to have a conversation about their general health to check for contraindications of a particular type of contraception or pill. This needs time, space, patience and a working relationship with the young person. Possibly a system where pharmacists work in conjunction with local services would be good. This would work well for repeat prescriptions (which many women are frustrated about) and a way of making services accessible and convenient for young people.  Training needs to be more comprehensive than simply how to do a proper pill teach too. There have been instances of pharmacists not being able to provide emergency contraception because of their own sexual values. No-one should be forced into doing sexual health work if they don&apos;t want to/don&apos;t feel that it fits in with their values. However those that do should be doing training that enables them to explore the stigma around sex in society, their own sex education and sexual messages which they may carry around with them, how young people approach services with suspicion and fear etc etc.  Another concern I have is that this kind of focus on providing contraceptive pills can ignore the many other sex and relationships needs of the young person. Sexual health is a helluva lot more than giving someone a pill, or a condom.  The benefits of young people going to a young people&apos;s clinic (like Brook or NHS run services) are that the staff and clinicians are more attuned to the issues that we need to address with young people: STIs, relationship health, whether the sex is wanted, whether someone is ready for sex and how to ensure that sex is pleasurable. These services also have the staff with the expertise and the resources to answer young people&apos;s questions, to fill in the many (and often huge) gaps around sex ed.  Young people also like having someone to chat to. I work in clinics with young men, I&apos;ve often been the only person they can talk to. They like a confidential space to chat about their lives, feelings (big time feelings) and worries. These kinds of trusting working relationships can be key in helping young people to improve or sustain their sexual health and well being. So whilst offering services might increase access, I think we need to make sure that the quality, thoroughness and expertise are there too.  Cost of diabetes to the NHS Research suggesting that diabetes will account for \u00a316.9bn of the NHS budget within a generation prompted a debate among readers about the cost of treatment and the challenges faced by those with diabetes and the health service&apos;s approach to the condition. colddebtmountain comments:  As someone who suffers from hypoglycemia without an apparent diabetic element, I can empaphise with the many who suffer from diabetes, and know that it is not a disease that everyone brings on themselves through obesity. Thankfully I am able to self treat my low blood sugar by glucose tablets, but others are not so lucky. It is easy to blame individuals but society through its general lack of exercise, particularly for young people, is not helping. From age seven I walked to school and home again, a combined distance of three miles, exercised regularly in the playground ( I was one of those girls who muscled in on the boys football), went swimming (cheaply) at least once every week, and went on to play sports for my secondary school. I have learned that eating too much, the wrong kinds of food, or just all the time, are often a sign of unhappiness in a human being and it occurs to me that the wrong kinds of available social activity generate their own punishments on us all. It is essential that along with the emphasis on more exercise we actually start understanding why so many people are not esepcially happy with their lot in life. Perhaps that will ensure the right kinds of social activity get a boost and cheer up a lot of the casualties we are now treating because of expedient policy making.  From GeorgeStephenson:  An interesting statement. A simple question - What proportion of the diabetes problem will be taken on by the private medical sector ? Or is this one of the illnesses that is so wide spread that the private sector does not want to take it on ? Let us have some balanced assessment from the media instead of knocking the NHS for political purposes. How about publishing private treatment costs for diabetes for a start and what percentage of the patients are treated by the private sector ?  DeusXM writes:  While I agree that there is a general need to encourage healthier lifestyles, the problem is that the NHS gives out extremely mixed messages. Firstly, the targets that the NHS sets for diabetes treatment aren&apos;t rigorous enough. I have T1 diabetes (a different condition to T2) but I see firsthand how T2s are treated. The gold standard for quality of diabetes control is the HbA1c test. People with an HbA1c of 6.5% or higher tend to suffer the expensive complications. Yet the NHS, in my experience seems remarkably accepting of people with T2, with A1cs in the 8-9% range and doesn&apos;t really push them to acheive better results (&apos;normal&apos; is broadly 4-5.5%). Secondly, the NHS persists in putting forward completely outdated and incorrect dietary advice. T2s are told to reduce their intake of sugar and fat but also told to ensure that around 60% of their diet comes from starchy carbohydrates. All carbohydrates, once metabolised, become sugar in the blood. So the NHS advice is essentially that people with T2 diabetes get 60% of their calories from sugar. This further increases insulin resistance, which leads to greater insulin production, which leads to greater weight gain (fat is simply glucose converted for storage by insulin). Plus they have high blood sugars anyway. The diet recommended for T2s actually causes obesity AND complications. The irony of all this? There&apos;s only one food item that doesn&apos;t increase your blood sugar at all - fat. The NHS needs to seriously re-evaluate its dietary advice AND its targets for treatment if it is to prevent people with T2 from developing complications.  medallion says:  There seems to be a general misunderstanding among people with Type 1 diabetes about the way Type 2 is treated these days.  There are over a million people using insulin in the UK but only around a third of these - say 300,000 at most - have Type 1 diabetes The remainder - say 800,000 or more - who use insulin have Type 2. They use insulin because it gives better control of blood glucose levels than tablets alone. Sir Steve Redgrave actually has Type 2 diabetes - one of the many Type 2s who use insulin to keep himself healthy. So the Guardian photo of a person injecting was absolutely appropriate despite what one of your posters said.  Insulin is expensive, especially the newer insulins which drug companies market aggressively to doctors although the older insulins do the same job almost as well, as NICE confirms. If doctors confined their prescribing to these older insulins they could help cut the drugs bill quite a bit.  Since at least 90 per cent of people with diabetes have Type 2, I think it is wholly appropriate for articles such as this to focus upon it and the outrage of your Type 1 correspondents is unreasonable. Moreover not all Type 2s are overweight. About 20 per cent of people diagnosed with Type 2 are slim and a healthy weight - although of course that does mean that the vast majority are obese or overweight.  But how do we prevent the tide of obesity that is overtaking us? Frankly no one knows.  British families on the breadline? A warning from Britain&apos;s leading foodbank network, the Trussel Trust, about the increasing number of emergency food parcels it is having to give out sparked discussion about current levels of social deprivation. thecantonlighthouse contributes:  Is it really just families on the breadline who are receiving these parcels or is the Guardian slipping into politician mode by throwing the word &apos;family&apos; in every time there&apos;s a victim.It&apos;s as if a headline that many people are relying on food handouts wouldn&apos;t be enough, they need to be decent hardworking family victims. The deserving. Just a thought.  jasont69 posts:  I work with kids from some of the poorest families in my area and no one here would like to hear this, but here it is: the vast majority of these families still have enough money for cigarettes and cheap booze, and in some cases Sky TV. Go figure...  From Cesca01:  This article has seriously made me cry, i&apos;d love to be able to say what&apos;s happening is unbelievable in a developed society. Only thing is it&apos;s global fascism which has developed, in which wealth can only trickle-up to the parasitic few, everyone else must be impoverished at an ever accelerating rate to support their imaginary wealth. What&apos;s happening is just the tip of the iceberg, there&apos;s far worse to come and when enough people are as desperate as these families, which will happen, there won&apos;t even be foodbanks by then. Normal people will be driven to destitution by the evil the political and corporate parasites inflict on us, unless we finally take the power back and demand participatory democracy and economics.  From Mazada has this to say:  The Foodbank seems to have slipped into our way of life without a proper assessment as to why this kind of charity is needed, and what are the long term effects on those who need handouts, and why gross inequalities of income in countries such as Britain are no longer seen as a priority.  gherkingirl comments:  I work with some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in society and we have to keep packets of biscuits in the office at all times to have something on hand when they come to us with low blood sugar having not eaten for three days and walked five miles to get to us, otherwise we&apos;ve had clients faint, fall asleep or just be too unwell to continue the interview. My boss also uses the biscuits as an icebreaker having learned that if you can get them to share a packet of biccies with you, it&apos;s much easier to bring up the subject of food parcels and make it less embarrassing to need a handout. In 15 months working there no one has asked if they could have a food parcel, but we give them to about a third of our clients in collaboration with the local church run shelter and foodbank (which in non Trussell Trust). I am amazed by how stoic people are, risking their health to get to us (our clients are disabled) and often declining help because they don&apos;t want to take it from the &apos;needy&apos;.  We help them access benefits and crisis loans and much as I was cynical when I started (and remain so) I haven&apos;t seen the kind or people you caricature. Although I do phone Sky and Virgin a lot to try and get them to allow people to break the contracts they took out when times were better, but they get locked into and then taken to court over because both companies make it damned hard to get out of a contract even when people lose their jobs and try to be honest about their finances. I wish life was as simple and one dimensional as you try to make out...  From Iamtheurbanspaceman:  Coventry is a place close to my heart: seems to me we&apos;re in serious trouble when somewhere with such a fantastic history of production (the oft repeated series of industries over the centuries went ribbon weaving to clockmaking to bicycles to motorbikes to motorcars to... nothing) has a significant number of people who cannot even afford to feed themselves.  On Facebook Brian J posts:  I am involved with one of these, which is managed by a group of local churches. regrettably, the need is growing rapidly, and while it could be argued that we are doing the government&apos;s job ofr them, if we don&apos;t do it, then who will? Annejennette SI&apos;m going to see about setting a food bank up in my area although I know there is 1 in the neighbouring town, so much poverty around and we all need a boost sometimes! I remember as a child my mother collecting butter cheese and stewing steak on producing her benefit book, the government done away with this assistance so brill ideas food banks!  Nintendo losses - what went wrong? Nintendo sales were down for the first time in 30 years, it was reported this week. Our readers offered their views on what could have caused the drop. From RobLindsay:  I think a lack of serious 3rd party support for their consoles in this generation leaves them unable to compete on a wider scale, their first party games are good but the series are getting a bit stale, their third party support consists of little but shovelware of dubious quality  md1500 adds:  Nintendo&apos;s losses were the result of two things. They were phasing the Wii out to concentrate on their next console. Because of this, they didn&apos;t release many games for it. Given that most of the Wii&apos;s software output is due to Nintendo themselves, this hampered sales. The 3DS launched with next to no games, hysterical tabloid reports about how the machine rapes your eyeballs, and a lot of people thought it was just a DS in 3D rather than a new handheld. Finally, the fact that the 3DS was launched directy after a tsunami which adversely affected the Japanese economy, could not have helped matters. It is worth remembering though, that although Nintendo posted a 43billion yen loss, this is still far less than the 65billion they were predicting. And I agree with Callous above, the one thing they definitely shouldn&apos;t do is make games for smartphones.Nintendo - doomed since 1889.   Callous says:  Those claiming Nintendo should make games for phones..don&apos;t seem to realise that Nintendo made around 4 times as much in revenue from gaming ... as the ENTIRE iPhone App store did in FY2011.  Releasing a few games on the iPhone would make them a bit of short term cash..but utterly destroy their business model in a couple of years as their money comes from hardware, software and licence fees from third parties. Their hardware and licencing revenues would be decimated if they released on another format. Nintendo&apos;s major problems have been some extremely unfounded negative media coverage (certainly in regards to the 3DS being a headache machine), some crazy reporting from analysts (who misinform on a regular basis) and a gaming media who are only interested on reporting on &quot;mature&quot; shooting games...plus a mass of people who think it&apos;s ok to illegally download games (ie steal) as opposed to pay for them. if Nintendo hadn&apos;t felt forced to drop the 3DS price (largely thanks to the negative media campaign against the machine) they would have made a profit. Still..it&apos;s strange that Nintendo is always seen as &quot;doomed&quot; by the media..when they are one of the few game companies to actually have made a profit in the last decade. Nintendo may have lost a few hundred thousand this year......but Sony has lost around 4 billion dollars in their gaming division since the launch of the PS3......and Microsoft has also lost around 4 billion dollars since they entered the gaming market.  And readers also left tributes to their favourite consoles: From Kezabien2:  I&apos;ve had lots of great memories over the years of Nintendo consoles. The NES was my first ever console and was the real introduction to gaming for me. I then had the SNES, which the fondest memory for me was arguing with my Megadrive-owning friends over who was better between Sonic or Mario. The N64 was ok \u2013 some of the 1st party games such as Mario 64, F-Zero, Ocarina of Time and Goldeneye are some of the best games I&apos;ve ever played but I think this console was over-shadowed a little by the PSOne for me. The Gamecube is actually one of my favourite consoles of all time. The games selection wasn&apos;t the best but the games themselves were some of the best I can remember. I think having this alongside the PS2 made the early 2000&apos;s probably my favourite time in gaming.  RivaldoRules writes:  The SNES was the best console. The glory years.  After that Sony came along and it all went a bit wrong for Ninty. Bet they wish they&apos;d taken up the SNES-CD idea...  Within 5 years they&apos;ll be the same as SEGA, but instead making sad children&apos;s games for the new console platforms.  I forgive them though. They gave me Tetris and a Gameboy.  And on our Google+ page GeorgeK writes:  Nintendo was caught trying to do two things at once: the touch screen and internet-capable DSi lost the battle for those two areas with the iPod Touch, and lost the gaming battle with Sony and Xbox. The 3DS was an attempt to reconcile a irretrievable situation. I see only one was forward for Nintendo: choose a frontier in which no product has been released yet, then dominate it the way Apple dominates the touch screen  Brian A:  As for Nintendo&apos;s losses, it is the first time since they switched to gaming. With a 5+ year old primary console, an underwhelming 3DS launch, and a strong yen, it&apos;s no wonder they had a loss. With 3DS sales picking up and a new primary console launching this year, it seems likely that they&apos;ll go back in the green again.  Matt C:  Nintendo is great, but I think they&apos;ve made the mistake of marketing to children too much instead of adults or teenagers, aside from the Wii exercise selling point, which was actually a good idea.  James N:  The Mario Kart series is basically the reason I bought 2 DSes and a Wii, that and Mario Bros completely worth it. Smash brothers and others were awesome and lets not forget Golden Eye brought the beauty of FPS to console only players, exploding the FPS scene. Call of Duty/Battlefield franchises should send them money out of respect.

When guards discovered a radio he had helped make to bring news to the inmates, he was interrogated and tortured. &quot;He was horribly punished,&quot; said producer and co-writer Andy Paterson. &quot;You are left after that messed up for many, many years. Then decades later he got on a train and met a beautiful woman who made him laugh for the first time and she had the strength to try and find out what was happening to him.&quot; Paterson first read Lomax&apos;s book more than 13 years ago and knew it was a film he wanted to make. &quot;It&apos;s a story that will never let you go.&quot; He was introduced to Bill Curbishley, manager of The Who, who owned the rights to Lomax&apos;s books, but the story&apos;s epic scale and their plan to follow the structure of the book exactly was difficult to fund. A reshaping of the story to highlight the role of Patti Lomax proved more attractive. Teplitzky was signed to the project, and the script was sent to Firth, fresh from The King&apos;s Speech, who loved it. Firth said it was important to him that he meet Eric and Patti Lomax before he started preparing for the role. &quot;They are both incredibly engaging,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s incredibly approachable, as much as a person can be on a subject like that. He is 92 and not really demonstrating that at all. He is mentally far more agile than I am. I have to keep up with him really. He has a tremendous sense of humour that can be a little dark at times. I found him nothing but a delight and you do feel a little overwhelmed by the enormity of the story you are trying to tell.&quot; Kidman has yet to meet Patti Lomax, but will spend some time with her during the shoot. &quot;I wanted to form the character first and then meet her, so I was not trying to force myself into being her,&quot; she said. &quot;I have to find my own way.&quot; Like Firth, Kidman had been struck by the story when she was sent the script. &quot;I just found the subject matter very moving, that&apos;s what drew me to it and the power of somebody loving someone through trauma. I found that inspiring and I can relate to it.&quot; The day after she signed up for the film she read an article in an American newspaper about a woman falling in love with a man who had just returned from Afghanistan. &quot;I thought, there&apos;s a sign that this is still incredibly relevant.&quot; It is not Kidman&apos;s first visit to Scotland. She revealed at the press conference that she had visited the country as a teenager and had taken a road trip with her then boyfriend as far north as Ullapool. The film is a joint UK and Australian production, backed by, among others, Creative Scotland and Lionsgate UK, who will be releasing the film in the UK. The 10-week shoot will move from Scotland to Thailand in late May and then Australia in early June. Andy Paterson said there had been some qualms among the Japanese acting community when it came to casting the roles of the Japanese soldiers. &quot;The initial reaction to a film about the Burma railway was that people were scared of it and ran away from it,&quot; he said. &quot;But when we said it&apos;s the Railway Man, the actors turned around and said we would be honoured to be part of that story.&quot; Andrew Dixon, chief executive of Creative Scotland, said the project was a great boost to the creative community in Scotland. &quot;We invest in films for different reasons, because there&apos;s a story about Scotland, because there&apos;s a Scottish writer involved, because there are locations in Scotland or because it provides talent opportunities for our people within the film industry,&quot; he said. &quot;A project like the Railway Man, an international film of great standing does all of these things. It is a really great project for us in Scotland.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fashion-blog/2012/apr/27/fashion-statement-matchy", "sentences": ["Photograph: ASOS    There was a lot happening in the world of menswearSingapore staged a men&apos;s fashion week, which Sue-Wen Quek had some issues with."], "publicationDate": "2012-04-27T15:23:00Z", "title": "Fashion statement: matchy-matchy, and other trends that are 'on trend'", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "Men's fashion"], "article": "Yes, it&apos;s official - you&apos;re allowed to match your clothes againClashing patterns has been all the rage for what seems like an age - yes this week Fashion Statement rhymes.

I\u00a0go to see Gatz at a theatre in downtown Manhattan, as you might visit a disagreeable relative: expecting discomfort and boredom, but feeling virtuous for making the effort. As the\u00a0lights go down, virtue gives way to\u00a0dread. The idea for the show came to John Collins 10 or so years ago. He is the founding member of the Elevator Repair Service, an experimental theatre company devoted to making unusual work out of what he calls &quot;non-dramatic source material. To take\u00a0something from one medium and\u00a0make it work in our medium.&quot; At the time, Collins was thinking about creating a puppet show &quot;by finding random objects and sticking eyes on\u00a0them&quot;. Another member of the company happened to be rereading his\u00a0favourite novel, The Great Gatsby, and, since Collins likes to use whatever is to hand, they started messing around with ideas. Doing a straightforward adaptation was one notion, but then Collins had a brainwave: why not focus\u00a0on the very thing that most productions would try to disguise: the\u00a0medium. &quot;We could try to smooth over it by adapting it into a play. Or we could hit that problem head on and try to stage it as a novel. That was exciting.&quot; I mention all this as further evidence of just how unpromising a proposition Gatz is. Once the idea to present it as a novel was in place, Collins and Scott Shepherd, who plays the lead and is hoarse when I speak to him from yet another marathon performance, started rehearsing in the only space available to them, a roughed-up office above a theatre. Something about the setting made sense. And so, bit by bit, a\u00a0scenario evolved: of a bored office worker, finding the novel in a filing cabinet and getting slowly, inexorably sucked into it over the course of a single working day. The audience watches in real time as he reads it aloud and various colleagues come over, take the book from him and assume characters in the play, switching back and forth between realities. It is an insane idea. It militates against every commercial principle in the book. It is also, as I\u00a0discovered when I first saw the show in\u00a02010, heart-stoppingly brilliant. The trepidation of the audience in the first 20 minutes is something everyone in the company is aware of. Collins thinks it actually plays in their favour. Low expectations make the slow realisation that it isn&apos;t going to\u00a0be\u00a0awful much more powerful. Somewhere around the first hour, as Shepherd&apos;s narration gathers pace, you can feel a collective sigh move through the room, and from there on in it&apos;s electrifying. His is an extraordinary performance. Such are the physical and mental demands of the role, that the only way he can approach it, Shepherd says, is like a regular day at work. After all, it is set in an office. He cannot process Gatz as a single entity. It is more like performance art than acting. &quot;The show is so big you can&apos;t keep it\u00a0all in your mind. When I go out at the\u00a0beginning, I&apos;m not thinking about\u00a0the end or even chapter two. It&apos;s\u00a0like not looking down from a high ledge. If I start to think of the hours that are\u00a0ahead, I get overwhelmed. The\u00a0original\u00a0idea was, let&apos;s see what happens if we\u00a0just start reading a book\u00a0and don&apos;t\u00a0stop. I hang on to that\u00a0idea so that I don&apos;t feel I&apos;m going\u00a0out there to\u00a0present, so much as\u00a0to have another encounter with this\u00a0book and try to be as open to new\u00a0meanings in it\u00a0as possible.&quot; For the last 10 years, the show has been performed on and off at theatres and festivals around the country, and several generations have moved through the cast. Kate Scelsa is one of the original members, and she has a weird time sitting for long stretches on stage without anything to do. She plays a secretary, who assumes various roles, enlivening the scenes with heavy dialogue. A recent graduate, she was an intern when Collins first conceived of the show and, since she answered the phones in real life, he said why not try it on stage? She is subtly hilarious in her cubicle, but what is she actually doing in there the rest of the time, while the action unfolds around her? Editing her novel, it turns out. &quot;You have to have a strategy,&quot; she says. &quot;For Scott [Shepherd] it&apos;s one thing, a crazy endurance test, and I don&apos;t know how he does it. The rest of us have to have another project going on that has our attention.&quot; You simply can&apos;t keep up the adrenaline and treat it like a regular performance, she says. And so, during the off-hours backstage, while one actor practises the piano and another looks after her young baby, Scelsa edits her novel for young adults \u2013 the difference being that she can also do this on stage. &quot;I\u00a0feel like my character would be the person in the office who spends time on her laptop doing something else. You can only see me from the shoulders up in my cubicle; so I&apos;m editing my book.&quot; (It&apos;s called Fans of\u00a0the Impossible Life; she is looking for a publisher). After seven years of performing the show, the rhythm is so\u00a0ingrained that Scelsa never misses\u00a0a\u00a0cue. Shepherd, meanwhile, has Gatsby almost entirely by memory. The rest of the cast sometimes challenge him in a game called Test the Freak, where they read out three words at random and see if he can continue. This was put more scarily to the test on stage, says Shepherd, when the book fell apart in his hands one evening. &quot;We&apos;ve only used two books for this show. One book became so deformed it was held together with duct tape. We had a superstitious attachment to it \u2013 the Book \u2013 and finally it turned into a taped-together sheaf of papers. Then we had a new book and that started to fall apart. One day, a chunk of chapters went flying out and slammed against the back wall. Fortunately, it was part of the book I&apos;d already read. When\u00a0they taped it back in, they taped\u00a0it one page off. The next day I\u00a0was reading, turned the page and there was a page missing. I had to rely on memory. And I did it.&quot; The show&apos;s commercial success has been &quot;shocking to everyone&quot;, says Scelsa. It has toured in Australia, Norway and Singapore. The New York run, at the Public theatre, was sold out. At one point, they tried to split the show in two and run it on concurrent evenings, but &quot;it totally backfired&quot;, says Ariana Smart-Truman, the producer. &quot;We realised that it&apos;s hard for\u00a0someone to come back two nights\u00a0in a row. You have to get your babysitter back, find parking again. So people would see part one and say it&apos;s terrific, but I&apos;m not coming back. Part one would be full and part two would be half full.&quot; The impact of the show was also squandered. The extraordinary thing about Gatz is that, by the end, a feeling of common cause has arisen between the audience and the cast. You have been through this experience together; a usually private activity, reading, has been turned into a collective one and it\u00a0is intensely, surprisingly moving. &quot;This\u00a0is not an experiment to test an audience to see how much they can take,&quot; says Collins. &quot;Durational performances have a special appeal, but that&apos;s not what we&apos;re doing here. The work you&apos;re committing yourself to \u2013 The Great Gatsby \u2013 is worthy of it. It&apos;s only as long as it has to be.&quot; What&apos;s more, he says, &quot;if you want to make something that&apos;s exceptionally successful, there have to be some things that are exceptional about it. It\u00a0has to take risks.&quot; Even after all this time, when Shepherd reaches the end of another epic performance, he hardly knows how he got there. &quot;I can&apos;t contain the whole experience in my head at that moment \u2013 but I can feel the impact. We&apos;ve all been there all day. It&apos;s a pretty tremendous feeling.&quot; Waves of emotion flow up from the audience, so different from their nerves at the start of the show. &quot;It&apos;s not as hard as they think it&apos;s going to be. It turns out that literature works.&quot; \u2022 Gatz is at the Noel Coward theatre, London WC2, 8 June to 15 July.

The hardworking gelding, who was having his third start of the year and the 42nd of his career, has a variety of possible targets through this summer and autumn but is likely to cross swords with Frankel in October&apos;s Champion Stakes if not before. Asked if she would be afraid of taking on the famously unbeaten colt, Corine Barande-Barbe, trainer of Cirrus Des Aigles, said: &quot;No, I&apos;m happy to meet him. Competition is good between good horses. I think it was the easiest race I ever won. He&apos;s a tremendous horse, he was in good condition and he showed how good he is. He&apos;s a miracle.&quot; The six-year-old raked in \u00a31.9m for his previous victory, in the Dubai Sheema Classic in March, while this race was worth a relatively modest \u00a3142,000 but connections appeared especially jubilant. Barande-Barbe said the significance of this win lay in its being the horse&apos;s first Group One success in his native France, at a track where seven earlier victories have made him a favourite. Sent off at odds of 7-10, Cirrus Des Aigles was in front after half a furlong and gradually edged into a clear lead. Turning for home, Olivier Peslier urged him to lengthen and the response was impressive, in light of the rain-saturated turf. At the line, he had eight lengths in hand over the second-placed Giofra, prompting one local expert to recall Mill Reef, who won this race in similarly impressive style 40 years ago. It is a mark of the improvement made by Cirrus Des Aigles that he was only third behind Planteur in last year&apos;s Ganay. This time Reliable Man, the winner of last year&apos;s French Derby, was third, with the British-trained Wigmore Hall finishing fourth under Hayley Turner. His trainer, Michael Bell, said the horse was simply not as effective on a &quot;sticky&quot; surface. &quot;He&apos;s a lovely horse, very quiet,&quot; said Peslier of the winner. &quot;He&apos;s a gelding, so they have no choice [but] to run him and he&apos;s very famous because he runs many times. With stallions, they show they are very good and then their career is over.&quot; Asked to speculate about a clash with Frankel, the jockey said: &quot;He&apos;s different. Frankel is a real champion and has more speed. He [Cirrus Des Aigles] just keeps on going.&quot; Barande-Barbe, noted by the local press for changing her mind about running plans at frequent intervals, appeared to favour a tilt at the Singapore Airlines International on 20 May followed by the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Royal Ascot a month later. Ready alternatives include the Coronation Cup at Epsom in early June and the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud later that month, while Ascot&apos;s King George in late July was also mentioned as an important target. The horse&apos;s season is expected to build towards the Champion Stakes at Ascot in mid-October, a race he won last year, narrowly beating So You Think. But there are likely to be many races in between, as the trainer has said he gets bored if allowed to go for longer than three weeks without competitive action. &quot;He has not had a hard race today,&quot; she said. &quot;Olivier gave him a very good ride. Now the horse knows more about racing, you can just let him do what he wants.&quot; Officials at Ascot will inspect the course on Monday afternoon as persistent rain threatens to prevent Wednesday&apos;s fixture from taking place. The card features the Group Three Sagaro Stakes as well as two Listed races and a large attendance is expected, some tickets having been offered for free. The forecast is for further heavy rain or showers between now and Wednesday,&quot; said Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course. &quot;We could get another 25mm, which is not very encouraging, as patches on the round course are already waterlogged and there are some puddles in the straight, which is what prompted us to call an inspection. The straight course does drain particularly well but these are pretty extreme conditions. We&apos;ve had four inches of rain since 17 April.&quot; Waterlogging has already caused the abandonment of Monday&apos;s fixture at Towcester and a 7.15am inspection is planned at Windsor, where there were waterlogged patches last night.

The MPs say there are &quot;huge differences&quot; in the performance of teachers but express concern that the pay system rewards poorly performing teachers at the same levels as their more successful counterparts. In a report, the committee urges ministers to develop proposals for a pay system that rewards the teachers who add the &quot;greatest value&quot; to pupil performance. The report says: &quot;We believe that performance management systems should support and reward the strongest teachers, as well as make no excuses (or, worse, incentives to remain) for the weaker.&quot; The MPs acknowledge there would be practical and political difficulties in such a system, but say the relative impact of an outstanding teacher is so great that such difficulties must be overcome. Performance-related pay for teachers was first introduced under the last government. Before that, teachers were paid according to a nine-point salary scale, progressing up the scale with annual increases. After the reform, teachers at the top of the existing scale could increase their salary with merit-based rises. A study by the Centre for Market and Public Organisation, a research centre at Bristol University, found the scheme introduced by Labour improved pupils&apos; results &quot;by about half a GCSE grade&quot; per pupil. Schools minister Nick Gibb said the government has asked the school teachers&apos; review body \u2013 which considers matters relating to teachers&apos; pay, duties and working time \u2013 to make recommendations on introducing &quot;greater freedoms and flexibilities&quot; in teachers&apos; pay, including how to link it more closely to performance. The minister said: &quot;We welcome the committee&apos;s report into this important area, and will consider its recommendations in full and respond in due course.&quot; However Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said: &quot;Payment by results is total nonsense. Children are not tins of beans and schools are not factory production lines. Successful schools rely on a collegiate approach and team working. &quot;Performance-related pay [PRP] is not only inappropriate but also divisive. Children and young people differ and class intakes differ from year to year, making it impossible to measure progress in simplistic terms. &quot;PRP will create even more difficulties for schools facing the most challenges because teachers will realise that they will get no thanks for teaching their students but will get more money by going elsewhere.&quot; The MPs&apos; report also calls for candidates for the teaching profession to be observed in the classroom before they are offered a training place to check their suitability for the job. The MPs say that allowing young people to try out teaching could improve the quality of applicants and lead to a lower drop-out rate. The government should consider developing a formal &quot;internship&quot; system, similar to one run in Singapore, to allow youngsters to experience the &quot;content, benefits and career potential&quot; of teaching before committing to it, the report says. These &quot;taster sessions&quot; should include actual teaching, rather than just observing lessons, the committee said, with students given feedback afterwards. &quot;Applying to do teacher training is a &apos;high stakes&apos; decision and the purpose of these sessions is to give people a chance to try out their own aptitude before committing,&quot; the report said. &quot;We believe this approach could help both deter some people who are not best suited to teaching and persuade others to consider it.&quot; The MPs backed ministers&apos; plans to toughen up the literacy and numeracy tests taken by trainee teachers but advised caution over the introduction of a test of candidates&apos; personal skills. The report suggests the creation of a sabbatical scheme to allow outstanding teachers to take time out of the classroom to work in a different school, undertake research or refresh their subject knowledge."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2012/may/03/voluntary-sector-network-daily", "sentences": ["Adam Lent questions whether social media can link service-users and donors to promote more of a free market in the voluntary sector New Philanthropy Capital: Minding the gaps Matthew van Poortvliet, a research analyst at NPC, looks at the role charities can play in helping troubled families UK Fundraising: Facebook and fundraising in Singapore The problem charities seem to have when it comes to social media is not engaging with people once they have initially interacted This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-03T09:37:03Z", "title": "Voluntary sector network daily: Thursday 3 May", "tags": ["Voluntary Sector Network"], "article": "Civil Society: Volunteer Centre network &apos;will fragment&apos; under council cuts Justin Davis Smith, the chief executive of Volunteering England, has warned that volunteer centres are in danger of fragmenting due to local government cuts Third Sector: Two health charities ponder merger Nuffield Health and King Edward VII&apos;s Hospital, two health charities based in London, are discussing a potential merger RSA blog: Charitable giving \u2013 could it work more like a proper free market?

I can only assume it involved a combination of watching Top Gear, shouting at Top Gear, staring at my fists and hating myself. But I&apos;d better get used to that feeling again; the first series ends tomorrow, and I&apos;m not sure how I&apos;ll cope. Homeland is an increasingly rare specimen: a quality US import that Sky Atlantic hasn&apos;t hoovered up like your fat auntie at a buffet. Admittedly, it took me a while to figure this out. First I had to overcome the suspicion that it&apos;d be another hectoring show about Iraq. And then I had to overcome the suspicion that, as a sophisticated post-Wire American drama series, it&apos;d just be a load of blokes mumbling indecipherable slang at each other. And then there was that title sequence. That insanely off-putting title sequence, all discordant free-jazz and upside-down presidents and snatches of garbled speech. Honestly, C4 could have hired the kid from Stavros Flatley to come to my house, daub the word &quot;HOMELAND&quot; across his belly in rancid ketchup and smash it into my face while his dad blared The National Vuvuzela Orchestra Of Singapore Plays All The Hits Of Enya At Once through a megaphone and it would have still been more inviting. Despite all that, Homeland&apos;s appeal is perfectly clear. It&apos;s 24. Yes, it&apos;s a slightly more grown-up 24. It&apos;s 24 for people who own a good set of cutlery. It&apos;s 24 for people who live in Didsbury. It&apos;s a 24 where suspects can be interrogated with a childhood anecdote and not a direct gunshot to the kneecap of their newborn baby. It&apos;s a 24 that won&apos;t keep clattering into a closed patio door again and again with a confused look on its face. But it&apos;s still 24. It&apos;s even written by the same people. And that&apos;s brilliant. You can understand why Homeland&apos;s similarity to 24 hasn&apos;t been more explicitly trumpeted. Homeland is billed as classy and hip and nuanced, while the last three seasons of 24 felt like they&apos;d been scrawled on the back of a Happy Meal box in crayon. But the worst things about Homeland are usually the worst things about 24. Like the feeling that it sometimes makes stuff up as it goes along, and the same wearying reliance on moles. Then there&apos;s Abu Nazir. He might have started off as a man with a convincing motive, but now he&apos;s basically just Voldemort with a webcam. But these are just niggles. What really sets Homeland apart from 24 is Claire Danes&apos;s Carrie. She crosses lines. She sleeps around. She bursts into tears. She&apos;s hiding a mental illness from her bosses. She likes jazz, for crying out loud. Before the heartbreaking climax to last week&apos;s episode \u2013 where her entire life dissolved around her \u2013 it had been genuinely difficult to know how much we should trust her. Was she right to be suspicious of Brody, or was she just having a manic episode about a guy with naturally twitchy fingers?

The Roger Charlton-trained Cityscape, backed down in the 30 seconds before the off from 4-1 to red-hot favouritism at 5-4, missed the break and confronted by a sedate pace James Doyle, on his first visit to Hong Kong, was never able to put the Khalid Abdulla runner into a position that gave the partnership&apos;s supporters much hope that they would repeat their Dubai World Cup heroics. The importance of local conditioning was again made evident by the failure of any of the four challengers from Britain, Australia and the UAE to get involved in a finish that resulted in the 2010 2,000 Guineas fourth lead home a local 1-2-3-4, with Glorious Days, Lucky Nine and the HK horse of the year Ambitious Dragon, who may not have been quite at his peak after an unhappy visit to Dubai in March, trailing Xtension home. The Godolphin Mile winner African Story, in sixth, did best of the overseas horses, followed by another UAE representative, Musir, in seventh, Cityscape in 10th and the Australian mare King&apos;s Rose 11th. Charlton felt Cityscape&apos;s slow start counted against him as well as the early pace and the track conditions. He tweeted: &quot;Cityscape missed the break and no pace so was always struggling and he didn&apos;t seem that happy on the ground.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not sure what we will do with him now,&quot; Charlton added later. &quot;Missing the start didn&apos;t help and from where he was he had little chance in a slowly run race and he may have been feeling the ground a little bit, but there was no great kick at the end. It&apos;s always difficult when you travel horses to know that they&apos;re on song.&quot; Doyle reported: &quot;I thought the race rode very rough. We half missed the break and we were hassled the whole way round. They went very slow and sprinted up the straight, and that just doesn&apos;t really suit the horse. Missing the break was the thing.

From his air-conditioned office, minutes from the cemetery in the capital, Port of Spain, Martinez reels off the four witnesses needed: a doctor, a priest, a court official and himself, the prisons commissioner. &quot;It\u00a0is traumatising to take a man&apos;s life,&quot; he explains. &quot;It&apos;s an emotional issue, as there is such a high murder rate here. The death penalty sends a message, but it may or may not solve the problem.&quot; Prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, backed by former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner, who is now her minister for works and transport, is campaigning for enforcement of the death penalty to fight the &quot;the tsunami of crime&quot; that has hit Trinidad and Tobago. In Jamaica, which has one of the world&apos;s highest murder rates, there is also a growing clamour for the rope to be used. The debate is close to boiling point in the English-speaking Caribbean, partly because it plays on one of the few remaining links to Britain colonialism. The fate of those on death row is currently decided more than 4,000 miles away, in Westminster, at the judicial committee of the privy council (JCPC). &quot;We talk about independence, meaning a flag and an anthem,&quot; Martinez says, &quot;but we need to sever the umbilical cord with the mother\u00a0country.&quot; The JCPC remains the highest court of appeal for 27 countries, including former Caribbean colonies, and the persuasiveness of a British campaign to abolish capital punishment \u2013 argued through successive cases \u2013 has prevented many islands from carrying out punishments that remain on their statute books. The London-based Death Penalty Project (DPP) provides free representation to those facing the death penalty in countries that still use the JCPC as their final appeal court. The judgments made there are influencing the capital punishment debate around the world: increasingly Commonwealth countries accept that executing someone who has been on death row for five or more years constitutes cruel and inhuman treatment. This follows the landmark Jamaican case of Pratt and Morgan, in which the judges ruled that the death sentences of two convicted murderers who had spent 14 years on death row should be commuted to life imprisonment. The case is viewed around the Caribbean as the main barrier to implementing the death penalty \u2013 by the time that most appeals have been exhausted, the five-year limit has run out. Keir Starmer, the UK&apos;s director of public prosecutions, who used to appear on behalf of condemned prisoners, has described the project as the &quot;most successful litigation organisation in the world&quot;. In March, two British QCs were arguing these points before five British judges in an oak-panelled room within the new UK supreme court building in Westminster. It could have been a day like any other in the British legal system, except for the large Trinidad and Tobago flag in the corner. The judges were hearing the case of Marcus Jason Daniel, one of 33 people on death row in Trinidad. Daniel has been convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. The DPP organised psychologists to assess Daniel&apos;s mental health and argued that he should have been able to use the defence of diminished responsibility at trial. The JCPC will assess whether Daniel&apos;s conviction was safe, and if his death sentence should be sent back to Trinidad&apos;s appeal court for review. Listening to well-spoken barristers reading witness statements littered with colloquialisms and expletives is often surreal but this had an extra edge. Julian Knowles QC referred to &quot;liming&quot;, Trinidadian slang for partying. Another exchange had Lord Clarke interjecting: &quot;Smoking &apos;blacks&apos; is drugs, is it?&quot;, to which the counsel Peter Knox QC replied helpfully: &quot;Yes, my lord. A cigarette mixed with cocaine and marijuana.&quot; Privy council judges emphasise their role is to apply the law of the country in question. They deny their stance is explicitly anti-death penalty. However, Lord Dyson, one of the judges hearing Daniel&apos;s case, told the Guardian last year that hearing death penalty appeals made him feel &quot;extremely uncomfortable&quot;. He acknowledged the role the court has played in preventing executions: &quot;I&apos;m not aware of any case in recent years in which the death penalty sentence has been upheld.&quot; Rajendra Krishna is personally grateful for the intervention of British judges. He spent seven years on death row in Trinidad, having been convicted of murder during a botched burglary in his early 20s. He is wary of the press, as any local media attention could affect his chances of finding work. However, he is happy to speak to British journalists, explaining that he owes his freedom to English people. &quot;We [the inmates] always had faith in the privy council because the justice in Trinidad and Tobago is very poor,&quot; he says. &quot;I have no confidence in no Caribbean court. I believe in the privy council. I would rather the British judges make the decisions.&quot; Krishna eventually spent 27 years in prison until the privy council granted his immediate release last year. &quot;No one deserves to hang. Everybody deserves a second chance in life. [Among] the people on death row \u2026 not everybody is innocent.&quot; But those who are not guilty and can&apos;t afford representation, he adds, also &quot;end up in there&quot;. While the privy council has saved lives, the idea of British judges having the final say over former colonial subjects in 2012 \u2013 the 50th anniversary of both Jamaican and Trinidadian independence \u2013 may seem anachronistic. As Justice Adrian Saunders, a judge at the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), puts it: &quot;Are you independent if your final court of appeal is situated in the former colonial power?&quot; The CCJ was set up as an alternative to the privy council to serve as the final appeal court for the region. Until now, it has failed to attract widespread support. The court currently only hears appeals from Barbados, Belize and Guyana \u2013 even though it is situated in Trinidad. This is about to change. Last month, the Trinidadian prime minister pledged to stop sending criminal appeals to the privy council. This follows a promise from Jamaica&apos;s new prime minister, Portia Simpson Miller, in January, to end &quot;judicial surveillance from London&quot;, sign up to the CCJ and drop the Queen as head of\u00a0state. While many have welcomed the news as an overdue step towards full independence, there are worries that leaving the privy council removes the barrier to hangings. Judges at the CCJ deny they preside over a &quot;hanging court&quot;. They point to a death penalty appeal heard in 2006, where the sentence was commuted. The judgment allowed the CCJ to set out its philosophy on capital punishment. Justice Wit, another CCJ judge, said it showed the court was not &quot;insulated&quot;. He continued: &quot;Creating a Caribbean jurisprudence; that means a jurisprudence more connected to our kind of problems and our culture but that does not mean we are going to work in a vacuum. I would even say that at some points, the judgment was more progressive than I&apos;ve seen from the privy council.&quot; The CCJ has been hailed as a model for selection of judges among international courts. The court&apos;s impressive e-filing and video-conferencing system allows it to hear cases from around the region. The court can also travel to hear cases, which makes it more accessible than the JCPC, where parties must either pay for travel to London, accommodation and visa costs, or hire British lawyers. Saunders argues: &quot;Access to the privy council is so restricted that almost all of the cases heard are those by or against the state, by or against big corporations, by or against wealthy individuals or pro bono death penalty cases. So the average man and woman has never had the opportunity to appeal right up\u00a0to the privy council.&quot; It&apos;s a persuasive argument for the CCJ, so why has there been a reluctance to sign up? Trinidad and Tobago&apos;s attorney general, Anand Ramlogan, told the Guardian in March that the priority is &quot;the fight against crime&quot; while signing up to the CCJ is a decision that &quot;must be decided by the people and not the politicians&quot;, implying a time-consuming referendum. But the move to stop sending criminal cases to the privy council, while retaining its jurisdiction in civil appeals, could be read as a canny political move to show the population that the government is doing something about the mounting murder rate \u2013 124 so far this year. A recent survey by the DPP showed that 91% of Trinidad and Tobago&apos;s population support capital punishment. Ramlogan says his role means he is &quot;duty bound \u2013 regardless of personal views \u2013 to facilitate and advance its implementation&quot;. Contrast that to his message in the local press in 2010: &quot;Rest assured the death penalty is coming \u2026 if you do the crime you will not just do the time, but we will pop your neck.&quot; Douglas Mendes, a Trinidadian human rights lawyer, is used to death-penalty politicking. &quot;When people are complaining about crime, the first thing that somebody says is &apos;let&apos;s hang somebody&apos; and they distract the population into a debate about hanging.&quot; He notes that capital punishment will always garner popular support (recent surveys in the UK have often shown large numbers in favour of bringing back executions). &quot;Every country where it has been abolished, it&apos;s because someone took a\u00a0leadership\u00a0decision.&quot; Even without abolition, the privy council&apos;s jurisprudence is increasingly being adopted on other continents. Kenya, Malawi and Uganda have taken almost 5,000 people off death row as a consequence of a ruling that mandatory death sentences for all murders are unconstitutional. One irony of the campaign is that having once exported capital punishment to its dominions around the world and hardwired it into their constitutions, the UK is now leading the fight to abolish the gallows. &quot;There&apos;s no death penalty in Latin America. It was abolished in Brazil in 1950s,&quot; observes Saul Lehrfreund, the DPP&apos;s director. &quot;It&apos;s a British colonial legacy. About 60 countries retain the death penalty; a significant proportion are former British possessions. We are trying to get abolition on to the Commonwealth agenda; 19 member states are abolitionist.&quot; Opposing the death penalty is now official government policy. The foreign secretary, William Hague, called for abolition when he addressed the Commonwealth People&apos;s Forum in Australia last year. The UK has supported a series of UN resolutions supporting a moratorium on the death penalty. Asked in the Lords what representations Britain makes to the United States (where there are 4,000 people on death row), Foreign Office minister Lord Howell described it as &quot;one of our priority countries&quot;. The project&apos;s work and some of its training programmes have been partially funded by the Foreign Office. One of the most prominent defenders of capital punishment is Singapore, which left the JCPC in 1994; it has ignored subsequent legal developments. Yong Vui Kong, a 23-year-old Malaysian, is due to die because the state imposes a mandatory death sentence for drug trafficking; he was carrying 47g of heroin. His lawyers, who have been supported by the DPP, have made a clemency application to the president. The greatest challenge for abolitionists is China where, some estimate, around 4,000 executions are carried out each year. The numbers have been reducing and last year the National People&apos;s Congress cut the number of capital offences from 67 to 54. The case of Wu Ying, a 31-year-old multi-millionaire and the sixth richest woman in China, has stirred up public debate about capital punishment. She was condemned to death for &quot;illegal fundraising&quot; but in an unusual act of public clemency the death penalty was rejected in her case. The Death Penalty Project is hoping to expand its work in China. &quot;Abolition is the long-term goal,&quot; says co-director Parvais Jabbar. The project has held workshops in Beijing and Guangzhou for judges who have the discretion to impose the death sentence. &quot;When we started we were quite a long way apart, but by the end of the exercise we were getting closer together.&quot; So will they be greasing up the gallows in Trinidad? Abolitionists should not assume the CCJ will bow to demands for more executions. The\u00a0privy council may be loosening its global reach, but its philosophy will\u00a0live\u00a0on.

Photograph: Mast Irham/EPA    Global trends in capital punishment Although the global trend is towards abolition of the death penalty, progress is unlikely to be smooth. Belarus, the last country in Europe to execute criminals, shot two young men \u2013 Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalev \u2013 convicted of carrying out a 2011 Metro bombing in Minsk. Iraq, which has reinstated capital punishment, has put more than 60 people to death since November; on one day alone, 19 January 2012, 34 prisoners were killed. According to Amnesty International, there were at least 360 judicial killings in Iran in 2011 (up from 252 in 2010) and at least 82 in Saudi Arabia (up from 27 the previous year). Almost 150 countries have now either abolished the death penalty in law or in practice, or introduced a moratorium. In the US, there were 43 executions but support appears to be ebbing. More than 500,000 people in California have backed an abolition proposal ensuring it will be on November&apos;s ballot paper. Connecticut became the 17th state to abolish capital punishment in April. Amnesty International&apos;s secretary general Salil Shetty says: &quot;Even among the small group of countries that executed in 2011, we can see gradual progress. These are small steps but such incremental measures have been shown ultimately to lead to the end of the death penalty.&quot; Owen Bowcott"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/07/corkboard-travel-news-roundup", "sentences": ["\u2022 \u00a315,000, firebox.com/product/4964 Cheap date Singapore Airlines has discounted flights from London to south-east Asia and Australasia if you book before 31 May to travel before 30 November 2012.", "Economy return fare to Singapore is \u00a3585, to Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia and Burma around \u00a3660, Australia \u00a3755-\u00a3800, and New Zealand \u00a3875."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-07T08:30:39Z", "title": "Corkboard: our weekly travel news roundup", "tags": ["Travel", "Hotels", "Luxury travel"], "article": "Escapism A former Napoleonic fort in the Solent has been transformed into a luxury holiday let, available through agents including Amazing Retreats (clarenco.com/venues).

But the problem with really getting to grips with this vast and teeming terrain is reliable statistics. Not many organisations, and certainly not isolated bloggers like me, have the manpower to sift properly for patterns in the dozens of box-office breakdowns that trickle out at the start of each year.  Those that do \u2013 research services such as IHS Screen Digest and Rentrak \u2013 aren&apos;t cheap to access. And there are places even they can&apos;t reach easily \u2013 like sub-Saharan Africa, where data is unreliable, if it&apos;s collected at all. Devoted box-office sites such as Box Office Mojo  and The Numbers grapple with these blackouts, too: Box Office Mojo, the most extensive free site, still has no up-to-date charts for China \u2013 only the most talked-about cinema territory at the moment (it&apos;s difficult to find non-Mandarin sources). You can see why it even takes the US establishment several months to put together its worldwide snapshot. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the lobby group for the major studios, releases its Theatrical Market Statistics report for the outgone year in March. It used to focus solely on the North American domestic market, but now it also takes in the current key growth sector \u2013 international box office \u2013 for Hollywood films. The instalment released six weeks ago showed what, roughly speaking, has been the story of the last decade: zero growth on the US front; a 7% increase (close to the annual norm) in overseas markets, from $21bn to $22.4bn. I&apos;d like to see far more detail on the international side in the report \u2013 the kind of intricate breakdown the US market gets. The MPAA salutes the continuing phenomenal growth in China (up 35% to tie with France as the world&apos;s second largest box-office market outside the US, behind Japan); and we also learn that Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa territory made a small gain (4%) and Latin America a startling jump (24%). But it&apos;s pretty general. The Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa category in particular is a massive and unhelpful conflation, both culturally and economically. If the studios&apos; focus, as Charles Gant suggested in last week&apos;s Film &amp; Music, is now firmly abroad, surely they have more nuanced information available? Here&apos;s a slightly more high-res breakdown of the top growth countries over the last year: 1. Argentina, $172.2m (2010 box office) / $235.4m (2011 box office) / 36.7% (year-on-year rise) 2. Estonia, $10.3m / $14m / 35.4% 3. China, $1,506.7m / $2.026.9m / 34.5% 4. Taiwan, $185.4m / $245.4m / 32.3% 5. Singapore, $119.1m / $150.8m / 26.6% 6. Romania, $35m / $44.2m / 26.4% 7. Chile, $73.4m / $92.3m / 25.8% 8. Malaysia, $161m / $195.2m / 21.2% 9. Columbia, $134.3m / $161.7m / 20.5% 10. Bulgaria, $21.9m / $26.1m / 19.3% Figures: IHS Screen Digest A few observations of my own about 2011. Firstly, the Chinawood gold rush \u2013 which has been picking up media coverage all year \u2013 obscures impressive growth elsewhere around the Asia Pacific area in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Dedicated audiences are springing up around the region, and with plenty of well-drilled cinema producers nearby with strong cultural affinities (South Korea; Japan; China, if it can ditch the censorship), the new cinemagoers are not necessarily Hollywood&apos;s for the taking. Secondly, all of the economically fecund Bric countries feature in the list of runners (Brazil and Russia come in 11th and 17th), except for India. I don&apos;t have any 2011 figures, but its box-office and cinema admissions have both been in decline over the last two or three years. Is that a problem with the quality of Indian cinema, which dominates there, leaving a possible in-road for Hollywood (which has been slowly increasing its presence)? Or is there a greater similarity between the US and India than might first appear \u2013 two countries with mature film industries, both hitting saturation point and audience fatigue? Thirdly, several of the nations above also feature on the United States Trade Representative (USTR)&apos;s piracy priority watch list: Chile, China, Russia and the country with 2011&apos;s fastest growing grosses, Argentina. If rampant piracy and crazy growth rates can co-exist, that seems to further undermine the MPAA&apos;s ongoing arguments about the damage done to the industry by downloading and DVD piracy. Time for a rethink? Lastly, if the slowdown in the US domestic cinema market is just what happens in developed countries where market saturation is approaching, Europe bucks that trend. Not only are the fringes (Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria) looking healthy, but the affluent heartland was showing big cine-love as well (Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands feature just off the top 10 \u2013 and France and Germany had good years, too). North America didn&apos;t just post no growth in 2010-11; its box office actually declined (from $10.6bn to $10.2bn). PricewaterhouseCoopers, in its annual Global Entertainment and Media Outlook report, predicted North American box office of $12.2bn in 2011; that would have meant the kind of growth figures that haven&apos;t been seen on the continent for 10 years \u2013 so who knows where they got that one from? Analysing this backslide isn&apos;t straightforward, and as many experts including David Bordwell were quick to point out, 2011 didn&apos;t have Avatar. But in view of the US&apos;s slow box-office growth over the last decade, I wonder if the growing focus on films for the international market isn&apos;t beginning to have consequences at home. Given that the very biggest films \u2013 the poles for the box-office tent \u2013 are becoming less American, are the studios doing enough for their home market? With a string of socially resonant titles in 2011 \u2013 The King&apos;s Speech in the UK, Intouchables in France, Kokow\u00e4\u00e4h in Germany \u2013 you can&apos;t say the same about Europe. Not that you would pick any of these talking points up from the MPAA report \u2013 but then part of the function of this annual clarion call is PRing the American film industry. Maybe it&apos;s safer to keep the message simple. They&apos;ve been bullish since March: their CEO Chris Dodd revealed in a recent speech that domestic box office was up 17% in the first quarter of 2012 over last year. He was also cheerleading the slate of blockbusters that will hopefully go on to lay claim to swelling foreign markets (and The Avengers and Battleship, with the new release patterns Gant points out, are giving him cause for optimism). The MPAA can&apos;t be too bullish, though \u2013 that would lay it open to the charges of cultural imperialism that are quick to arise wherever Hollywood looks too tyrannical. The one stat I would really like to lay my hands on is the percentage of global box office that goes to Hollywood (and it&apos;s not easy to come by \u2013 the MPAA certainly don&apos;t publish it). I&apos;m not the only interested party: I recently received an email from a junior officer at the Chinese Film Bureau asking me that same question. My best stab \u2013 based on the combined takings for the six major studios as a share of worldwide box office in 2010 \u2013 is 67%. That&apos;s a conservative estimate; somehow it&apos;s both more and less than I expected. Thoughts (and more sophisticated calculations) gladly received. \u2022 Thanks to Charlotte Jones at IHS Screen Digest for the table figures."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/08/water-industry-pipes-scandal", "sentences": ["And during a recent visit to Singapore, I discovered that the island state has driven leakage losses down to below 5%.", "A tip from Singapore to Ofwat."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-08T15:16:30Z", "title": "The water industry is burying a leaking pipes scandal | Fred Pearce", "tags": ["Water", "Environment", "Regulators", "Business"], "article": "Out of sight is out of mind \u2013 and nowhere is that more true than in the boardrooms of the water companies of England and Wales, where executives have for decades sought to bury the scandal of our leaking water mains. Except perhaps at the industry regulator; as the Guardian&apos;s Damian Carrington reveals, Ofwat has decided that, despite imposing hosepipe bans across much of the country this summer, most water companies will not be required to cut their leaks before 2015. In a densely populated country with generally sparse rainfall, that just does not make sense. Don&apos;t be too impressed with the water companies when they say they have been working hard to plug the holes in their pipes. I wrote my first news article about water leaks back in 1980 for a long-forgotten magazine called Municipal Engineering. A study published then \u2013 I still have it \u2013 put the national water leakage rate at 24%. And nothing has changed. The latest statistics for the four biggest English water utilities show Severn Trent losing 27%, Thames Water and United Utilities (supplier to northwest England) 26%, and Yorkshire Water 25%. In the case of Thames Water, which serves drought-plagued London, that is almost 200 litres, per customer, per day. Ofwat, ever the industry&apos;s apologist, claims leaks have been cut substantially since the mid-1990s. Which is true \u2013 but they rose before that, during and after privatisation of the old water authorities in 1989. And recorded losses today are marginally high than they were a decade ago \u2013 about 3.4 billion litres a day. That would fill quite a few hosepipes. The truth is that the engineers who manage our water companies like building stuff above ground \u2013 like reservoirs and water works. Things they can show off and pin plaques to. Plugging leaks is for wimps. And the money men who hold the purse strings \u2013 Australians, Americans, Malaysians and Chinese among them \u2013 are often more interested in the short-term profits to be culled from a monopoly business, rather than investment in maintaining infrastructure. In theory, ensuring long-term investment is what Ofwat is there to do. But the regulator is always under pressure from governments to keep water prices down. As a government spokesman told the Guardian: &quot;We have to find a balance between the need to fix leaks and keeping water bills affordable.&quot; The current water shortages after two dry winters show the short-sightedness of that approach. Ofwat does set leakage targets. But they are ridiculously modest and poorly policed. There seems to be a view within the industry that controlling leaks is a gesture to political correctness, rather than prudent asset management. Four years ago, Severn Trent was found guilty at the Old Bailey of a &quot;sustained and successful campaign of dishonesty&quot;, in which over five years it had declared to Ofwat leakage figures that were more than a third lower than the reality. Ofwat hadn&apos;t noticed. In fact the scam only emerged when someone inside the company blew the whistle and the Serious Fraud Office took charge. Was such dodgy book-keeping a widespread industry practice? You might guess so. Declared leakage rates rose shortly after the scandal emerged. And rather than ostracising the company, the water industry in 2009 named Severn Trent &quot;utility of the year&quot;. Oh, and it remains our top leaker. Ofwat claims that even replacing all the 300,000 kilometres of water mains in England and Wales would only halve leaks. Really? That statement is hard to reconcile with best practice abroad. Under the custody of Thames Water, London&apos;s water mains leak at least a quarter of its water, but Paris and New York claim to lose just 10%. And during a recent visit to Singapore, I discovered that the island state has driven leakage losses down to below 5%. It just shows what you can do if you try. A tip from Singapore to Ofwat. Replacing mains is only part of the job. Equally important are detailed metering of pipe networks to detect leaks, and proper control of water pressure, which reduces stress on pipes and means that less water leaks out if they do break. At root, the water companies have an attitude problem. They want to sell water, and the more the better. Perhaps we can&apos;t blame them. But the regulator should have a different view. What we need are utilities geared up to saving water. Ofwat must reward those that take up the challenge \u2013 and penalise those that do not. Tough new leakage targets would be a good start. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/may/08/educity-iskandar-malaysia", "sentences": ["Newcastle, Southampton and Reading universities will take their place alongside the Netherlands Maritime Institute of Technology and the Singaporean private university Raffles.", "The Iskandar special economic region in Johor lies at the southern-most tip of Malaysia, just 5km from the border with Singapore.", "Newcastle has existing partnerships with higher education providers in the centre of Singapore, which is just 35 minutes away from the new campus in Iskandar, so the chance to build on these was not to be missed, Jordan explained.", "&quot;The growth triangle of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia is a very big market."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-08T16:03:00Z", "title": "Inside Educity Iskandar: a university partnership in Malaysia", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "Partnerships", "Student experience", "Higher education", "Education", "Newcastle University", "University of Reading", "University of Southampton", "International students", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Transnational education is booming and the forms in which it is delivered are proliferating all the time. Ever increasing numbers of UK universities are setting up franchising arrangements, 2+1 models, or even full-blown overseas campuses. The 350-acre campus at Educity Iskandar will be shared by no fewer than eight international universities, including three from the UK. Newcastle, Southampton and Reading universities will take their place alongside the Netherlands Maritime Institute of Technology and the Singaporean private university Raffles. Australia&apos;s Monash and a Californian cinematic art school associated with Pinewood Studios are in talks with Iskandar&apos;s management, leaving just one spot left for another, as yet unknown, international institution. Students from all of the universities will live together in one giant international student village and will share sports and leisure facilities far beyond those any single university could afford, including a 14,000-seater stadium and an Olympic-length swimming pool. In the 1990s Malaysia singled out higher education as one of its strategic investments. Historically Malaysia has sent its students abroad for their education, now it is preparing to reverse that position, it wants to become the hub of its region drawing thousands students from across south-east Asia to its universities in huge numbers. Attracting foreign universities to set up overseas campuses is part of the that plan. The Iskandar special economic region in Johor lies at the southern-most tip of Malaysia, just 5km from the border with Singapore. For Reg Jordan, CEO and provost of Newcastle&apos;s Medical School in Malaysia both of these things \u2013 the location and the financial incentives associated with the special economic region \u2013 were major factors. Newcastle University got the call in 2004. It was invited to bring medicine and biomedical sciences to the project. Jordan said it represented a &quot;golden opportunity&quot; for Newcastle to develop its internationalisation strategy. &quot;Like many civic universities in the UK we have little flags all over the world which have normally grown up through research collaborations and all the rest of it. But our vice-chancellor felt it was time to pick a few strategic areas and plant one or two large flags. The international campus here \u2013 a fully owned branch of Newcastle University \u2013 is a golden opportunity to do that in south-east Asia, and brings us to the new markets. The World Bank will tell you that there&apos;s going to be an increasingly exponential demand for higher education but it&apos;s largely going to come from Asia and south-east Asia,&quot; Jordan said. Newcastle has existing partnerships with higher education providers in the centre of Singapore, which is just 35 minutes away from the new campus in Iskandar, so the chance to build on these was not to be missed, Jordan explained. &quot;The growth triangle of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia is a very big market. We already had a presence here so when the operation came to put our own full international branch campus, our building, our staff, right next door to where we have other interests that became a quite interesting proposition.&quot; Planting a large operation in the centre of south-east Asia will also help Newcastle maximise the value of its intellectual property. &quot;For the university at large it also gives us a base through which the value added business can be added through the research endeavours back in the UK,&quot; Jordan said. Jordan also sees the occupants of his south-east Asian outpost as playing &quot;ambassadorial roles&quot; for the north-east of England. &quot;A colleague of mine said that one of the best things that Newcastle University could do for the north east of England is to be globally linked. We have a lot of ambassadorial roles, in a sense.&quot; Southampton, which will open the doors of its new engineering faculty in Malaysia in October this year, is similarly excited by the location. Professor Mark Spearing, pro vice-chancellor, international, said the location was a &quot;very natural fit for us&quot; given the number of important engineering companies which operate in the region. &quot;Malaysia is the hub of hi-tech industry \u2026 Dyson, Rolls Royce, Lloyds Register and BAE Systems are all interested in working with us and employing our students.&quot; Of the host country&apos;s motives he said: &quot;Malaysia recognises that it is a small country in a region of giants so it wants to move into higher value added activities, not manufacturing but design and engineering, and it needs a very strong education system to do this.&quot; But what of the practicalities? Rob Robson is CEO and provost of the University of Reading in Malaysia, which is currently offering english language and business courses in temporary accomodation in Johor Bahru. When the full campus opens in 2015, it will be delivering, chemistry, finance, real estate, pharmacy, law and construction. He says that all of the partner universities must do well for the project to thrive. &quot;If one institution does badly, and gets a poor reputation, that will be harmful for all of us.&quot; The management of a large-scale project where organisations&apos; fortunes are interrelated is &quot;a layer above what we do in a regular university.&quot; &quot;We all have our own brands out here but what more can we do to be greater than the sum of our parts \u2026 working together is going to be terribly important.&quot; For Spearing, the key to smoothing the process of opening the school was &quot;getting our people on the ground quickly&quot;, rather than trying to arrange things remotely, and &quot;having a lot of native language speakers involved. We had a target of 50% locally employed academics and that was not difficult at all.&quot; All of Southampton&apos;s administrative staff in Malaysia are local, although they are supported and guided through the processes by UK staff at the moment, he said. &quot;Procurement and purchasing all went smoothly because our staff speak the language,&quot; he said. But what about student discipline? Or student health and welfare in the student village? Robson foresees that problems on site &quot;will need to be solved by committee&quot;, He says initial talks have taken place about setting up some kind of &quot;parliament type system, or council to settle disputes&quot;. This council will also &quot;act as a pressure group on commercial aspects,&quot; since the international student village and leisure facilities will be operated by private companies. There are a myriad of other practical issues to be dealt with \u2013 such as getting the balance of staff. The Malaysia government has warned overseas universities against poaching too many academic staff from indigenous universities so the Iskandar project will recruit globally. Robson said &quot;obviously we&apos;re very keen to use Reading&apos;s UK staff to begin with but we will want to switch to local staff on lower wages when possible.&quot; At the moment, because it was first to open, Newcastle is operating its medicine faculty like a university in miniature, paying for everything \u2013 IT, library, student welfare \u2013 itself. So all three of the UK universities are looking forward to merging what they can of these services to share costs in the future. Spearing said &quot;one of the huge attractions of EduCity is the opportunity to share resources and spread risk.&quot; This frees the universities up &quot;to concentrate on academic delivery&quot;.

Photograph: Guardian archive    Thanks to Ciaran&apos;s prod in the right direction, further investigation on our part reveals that the comedy own goal in question was indeed scored in a match between Chelsea and Leciester City that was played at Stamford Bridge on 18 December 1954.

But luckily Henrik Hansen is on hand to elaborate and help us flesh this answer out. &quot;In the 1995-96 Danish Superliga season, FC Copenhagen had two players in their squad named Morten Nielsen,&quot; he reveals. &quot;One of them was usually referred to as Morten B Nielsen (short for Morten B\u00f8hme Nielsen) to avoid confusion. On one occasion, an away game on 31 March at Vejle, the two players were substituted with Morten Nielsen replacing Morten B.

VVV went on to win 2-1.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;What is the greatest ever difference in points between the champion and the last-place finisher in the top English division at the end of a season?&quot; asked David Shepherd back in February 2005. Here was our answer at the time: In the 1984-85 season, Everton amassed 90 points from 42 games. Down in 22nd place, however, Stoke City could only manage a paltry 17, we replied. This difference, 73 points, is the largest ever recorded in the top division of English football. Sunderland, who were relegated in 21st place, earned 40 points. More startling, however, is the fact that on two occasions, a mere 16 points separated the top and bottom positions. In the 1937-38 season, Arsenal were crowned champions with 52 points, while West Bromwich Albion finished bottom with 36 points. The 1927-28 First Division also threw up the same points difference. Champions Everton gained 53 points, while Middlesborough propped up the division with 37. That season, seven teams finished on 39 points, including Portsmouth, who were relegated on goal difference. And now for a 2012 update: Since we answered David&apos;s question, in the seven end-of-season tables to have been published since David wrote to us in 2005, the record of a 73-point gap between top and bottom of the Premier League has been broken not once, but twice. In 2006, champions Chelsea won the title with 91 points, while abject Sunderland finished rock-bottom with 15, leaving a gap of 76 points between best and worst. Two years later, the gap was 76 points again, when Manchester United were crowned champions with 87 points, while bottom-feeders Derby County were relegated with a record-breaking low of 11 points earned from one victory and eight draws in their 38 top flight games that season. CAN YOU HELP? &quot;I was surprised to learn that Fernando Hierro, Real Madrid defender from 1989 to 2003, scored 21 goals in the 1991-92 league campaign, second only to the top scorer of that season Manolo of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid,&quot; writes Faris Natour. &quot;Was there a time when a defensively-minded player, preferably a defender, did actually snatch the top-scorer award in the league?&quot; &quot;Former Sheffield United midfielder Curtis Woodhouse gave up football to become a professional boxer. Have any other players boxed professionally before, during or after their football careers?&quot; wonders Steve Doohan. &quot;In a recent game between Singapore Welsh and, ironically, our German counterparts, kick-off was delayed as neither team had a ball. Has any game played at a slightly more professional level been delayed due to an equipment glitch?&quot; asks Gar Mogs. &quot;As things stand it looks like Nikica Jelavic will finish the season as top scorer for Rangers in the SPL and for Everton in the Premier League. We were just wondering if any other player has finished top scorer for two different clubs playing in two different leagues in the same season?&quot; writes Alistair Graham. &quot;Has a goalkeeper ever received two yellow cards in the same game for time wasting?&quot; tweets RD1133.

Underneath the hard exterior of a city&apos;s infrastructure, such as green buildings or energy-efficient power grids, a whole host of factors from extensive master planning to urban governance support it. From the thinktank&apos;s perspective, says Cheng, governance is key. One of the fundamental roles of government is to provide a broader framework whereby the private sector can participate actively in the building of harmonious cities, where the spatial, social and environmental aspects of a city are of equal importance. &quot;The private sector wants clarity, certainty, some predictability. So, the government has to come up with the overall vision; create plans and policies that make that vision attractive to the private sector; and make those plans and policies transparent and credible,&quot; he says in an interview. In Singapore, one way the government achieves this is by opening sustainability projects to public tender, thus ensuring that such projects are benchmarked at a level feasible for private companies. A 2011 tender for the development of a major desalination plant, for example, was deliberately scoped to allow private sector participation \u2013 it was won by water management company Hyflux. Similarly, the design and development of the city-state&apos;s latest integrated resort Marina Bay Sands, which has received accolades for its eco-friendly practices, was carried out privately but according to the government&apos;s vision for the site. There is, of course, still more room for private sector participation above and beyond following the governmental lead. Cheng, an architect by profession who previously spent 13 years with Singapore&apos;s Urban Redevelopment Authority, cites green buildings, which have caught on in the city-state because developers see them as a way of selling projects. The infrastructure is widespread, but the mindset still has to catch up: there is room for improvement in the way these buildings are managed. &quot;To me, you can do good and do well at the same time,&quot; he says. &quot;It is not a bad thing to try to align private profit objectives with the greater good. When we introduce guidelines and legislation, we level the playing field and encourage the private sector to participate much more easily.&quot; The public sector must take the lead not just at the infrastructural and policy level, he adds. The next step: leaders at the city level will increasingly become more like CEOs, taking on a managing role and influencing the cities&apos; push towards sustainability. Already, eco-cities are springing up across Asia and sustainability proposals are pouring out of major urban centres such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. &quot;We are entering an era of cities. This is where the action is taking place, where a lot of economic and intellectual powers are concentrated. People move to cities because the opportunities are there. Urbanisation will take place at the edges of the cities \u2013 when we talk about China urbanising, for example, it&apos;s not an overall transformation but an expansion of existing cities and the growth of towns into cities.&quot; As this continues, leadership, institutional strength and the ability to think in the long term \u2013 rather than focusing solely on short-term development \u2013 will determine how sustainable a city can become. But there is also a major mindset change waiting in the wings, Cheng adds, and in the context of Asia, this is the concept of what constitutes an eco-city to begin with. Conventional models prescribe a village-like, self-sufficient ecosystem, but this cannot be applied in developing parts of the world, where policymakers at all levels face a whole suite of complex socio-economic challenges ranging from widespread poverty to resource scarcity. Instead, what is needed is a compact, high-density model that utilises economies of scale for resource and energy efficiency \u2013 such as many cities in Asia are already implementing. &quot;A lot of people would criticise Singapore as a country for being non-self-sustainable,&quot; says Cheng, who has himself been involved in the planning of one of these eco-cities, the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. &quot;But in 2010, we proposed at the Venice Architecture Biennale that if the whole world followed Singapore&apos;s model, only 0.5% of the Earth&apos;s area would be needed to house the population.&quot; Ultimately, he says, the relevant question for public and private sector alike is not whether a city or country can achieve some benchmark. &quot;Being sustainable is about socio-economic as well as environmental development. It&apos;s almost like a journey.

Calls for a more responsible approach to capitalism are growing, along with the sense that a more sophisticated understanding of investment risk \u2013 one which takes longer-term sustainability issues into account \u2013 is urgently required. The financial crisis and big failings at big names such as BP, Telco, News Corporation and Olympus have highlighted the importance of companies having business strategies that are sustainable over both the short and the long-term. There is a growing need to &apos;do more with less&apos; in the context of population growth, climate change and resource availability, particularly with regards to pollution and the consumption of energy and water resources. Integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into financial decisions is critical in supporting efforts to tackle the pressing issues of climate change, population growth, food security and human rights. Such an ambitious task requires a concerted response and a number of investor-led initiatives exist to encourage the switch to a greener economy for the Rio+20 conference. Twenty years ago, the first Earth Summit highlighted the importance of the natural environment and its crucial role in sustaining life on earth. Twenty years later, investors are being urged to sign the &apos;Natural Capital Declaration&apos; - a statement by the financial sector on its commitment to work towards integrating natural capital criteria into financial products and services. The Natural Capital Declaration is calling on governments to develop the regulatory frameworks needed to stimulate businesses to integrate, value and account for natural capital in their business operations by means of disclosure, reporting and fiscal measures. The declaration is open to signature by CEOs of willing financial institutions and is intended to get top-level buy-in by banks, institutional investors and asset managers. It will be launched at Rio+20. Aviva has convened a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Coalition (CSRC) of more than forty global institutions, including institutional investors managing in excess of $1.6tn, to call for improved reporting on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks at Rio+20. Markets are driven by information and if the information they receive is short term and thin, then these characteristics will define global financial markets. The coalition is therefore asking Earth Summit delegates to commit to develop a policy framework on Corporate Sustainability reporting. Ideally, the Rio summit will result in an international commitment to develop national regulations which mandate the integration of material ESG issues into annual reports and accounts and which provide effective mechanisms for investors to hold companies to account on the quality of their ESG disclosures, including, for instance, through an advisory vote at a company&apos;s annual general meeting. Stock exchanges also have a unique role to play in facilitating improvements in corporate sustainability reporting and performance. The Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative has been urging all stock market listing authorities to make it a listing requirement that companies consider how responsible and sustainable their business model is. It subsequently requests companies put a forward-looking sustainability strategy to the vote at their AGM. So far, only a few a stock exchanges, such as those in South Africa, Singapore and Malaysia, have made progress. Elsewhere, there has yet to be a serious commitment to sustainability by, for example, integrating it into the guidance that they issue to companies or their listing rules. At EIRIS, we are working with asset managers, asset owners, and stock exchanges around the world to increase the uptake of responsible investment. Sustainability encompasses a very broad range of ESG issues and it is vital that investors consider each of these \u2013 and not just focus on environmental issues \u2013 when assessing corporate performance. We have recently developed a system of sustainability ratings that enable investors to understand and assess the sustainability performance of companies. In the run up to Rio+20 we have applied these sustainability ratings to 2,063 companies worldwide to see where they have got to in tackling the various sustainability challenges they face. Our report &apos;On track for Rio+20? How are global companies responding to sustainability?&apos; finds encouraging signs that companies are making sustainability a significant part of their plans and strategies and acknowledging its importance, not only in terms of acting as good &apos;corporate citizens&apos;, but also in terms of ensuring their own long-term success. However, a significant proportion of companies demonstrate only limited progress and big brands like Google and Apple are left behind on sustainability \u2013 along with other leading consumer names. Significant differences in sustainability performance also exist at the national level with UK and continental European companies outstripping their US and Asian counterparts. This underlines the need for commitments to tackle sustainability which are agreed and applied at the global level. If the UN conference on sustainable development is to be successful in promoting the shift to a greener and fairer economy, both companies and their investors must be fully engaged in the sustainability debate. Rio+20 offers an important opportunity to advance the concerted action needed by financial institutions, business and governments alike to support the transition to a more long-term, sustainable and resilient economy.

Where HE flourishes, so can an economy. Until now, however, there has been little interest in the comparative strengths and qualities of national education systems around the world. Which countries and governments provide the best environment? More transparency and clarity is needed around this in order to encourage knowledge-sharing, collaboration and development of opportunities for students in all countries. While there are a number of well-regarded global rankings of individual institutions, these don&apos;t shed any light on the broader picture of the system itself, and its state of &apos;health&apos; in terms of encouraging and supporting excellence and international links. It&apos;s important for governments to be able to benchmark how they&apos;re doing. A quality higher education system is one that is well connected internationally facilitates the introduction of new ideas, and fosters trade and other links with foreign countries, through the movement of students and researchers across national frontiers. At the same time, students are increasingly choosing countries to study in as much as individual institutions. This week saw the first publication of a new ranking of national HE systems, based on research at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research (University of Melbourne) into data from 48 countries with a developed HE offering. The ranking is organised by Universitas 21, a global network of research universities The ranking is based on 20 different measures critical to what makes a &apos;good&apos; HE system, grouped under four umbrella headings: resources (investment by government and private sector), output (research and its impact, as well as the production of an educated workforce which meets labour market needs), connectivity (international networks and collaboration which protects a system against insularity) and environment (government policy and regulation, diversity and participation opportunities). Population size is accounted for in the calculations. For the UK it&apos;s a mixed picture, particularly for a system which continues to attract such a large proportion of international students. Ranked tenth overall, the UK is held down by a ranking of only 27th on resources, including a low rank of 41st for government expenditure. Against that, the UK is ranked only second to the United States on output. The difference in ranking between output and resources is the greatest for all 48 countries and reflects very high productivity. The UK also does well on international connectivity, ranked sixth as it has the fourth largest percentage of international students. It&apos;s ranked 13th on environment, losing points for lack of diversity and being ranked at 19 by the World Economic Forum. While the UK looks to the world stage, many other nations are more interested in what&apos;s happening in their region. The four Nordic countries are all in the top seven; four east Asian countries (Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Taiwan and Korea) are clustered together at ranks 18 to 22; Eastern European countries (Ukraine, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia) are together in the middle range; and the Latin American countries (Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico) also cluster together. While many countries don&apos;t feel they can be a world leader, they do want to match the standards of their neighbours. Government funding of higher education as a percentage of GDP is highest in Finland, Norway and Denmark, but when private expenditure is added in, funding is highest in the United States, Korea, Canada and Chile. Investment in research and development is highest in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. The United States dominates the total output of research journal articles, but Sweden is the biggest producer of articles per head of population. The nations whose research has the greatest impact are Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United States, United Kingdom and Denmark. While the US and UK have the world&apos;s top institutions in rankings, the depth of world class higher education institutions per head of population is best in Switzerland, Sweden, Israel and Denmark. The highest participation rates in higher education are in Korea, Finland, Greece, the United States, Canada and Slovenia. The countries with the largest proportion of workers with a higher level education are Russia, Canada, Israel, United States, Ukraine, Taiwan and Australia. Finland, Denmark, Singapore, Norway and Japan have the highest ratio of researchers in the economy. International students form the highest proportions of total student numbers in Australia, Singapore, Austria, United Kingdom and Switzerland. International research collaboration is most prominent in Indonesia, Switzerland, Hong Kong SAR, Denmark, Belgium and Austria. China, India, Japan and the United States rank in the bottom 25% of countries for international research collaboration. In all but eight countries at least 50% of students were female, the lowest being in India and Korea. In only five countries were there at least 50% female staff; the lowest being in Japan and Iran. Competition between individual institutions on regional and international levels is intense and growing as mobility increases and all &apos;markets&apos; become more open. It&apos;s crucial for nations and the appreciation of the global HE system as a whole that attention is not bogged down in rivalries between single &apos;name&apos; players in HE capable of attracting an elite. Whole country systems matter to mass populations of people, improving their lives and contributing to national and international prosperity. The Universitas 21 Ranking should be recognised as an important reference point for governments and everyone involved in HE, to keep focus and attention on how HE can be galvanised for growth.

Why the IRS and not the INS? Because the point of the list is not simply to keep track of who&apos;s in and who&apos;s out. The point of the list is to potentially bring shame on rich people who renounce their citizenship to dodge taxes. For one Facebook billionaire, the shaming deterrent appears to have been ineffectual. The most recent IRS list was published on 30 April. It contains 460 names. And if you scroll down to &quot;S,&quot; you find the name of one very, very rich person: Eduardo Luiz Saverin, the Facebook co-founder who still owns an estimated 4% of the company. Saverin&apos;s presence on the list was first reported by Bloomberg. With Facebook about to roll out an IPO, Saverin&apos;s 4% stake \u2013 worth about $3.8bn, if the IPO valuation holds \u2013 might leave him open to a major tax bill.

Fear is a constant fact of my life. I fear dying in some faraway place. Dying at home has a lot to recommend it. I got eased into British life at the World Service. Working at Bush House in 1969, we sat most afternoons having tea with people from China, Singapore and South Africa. It was like being at the United Nations. Poetry says the things that I can&apos;t say. I read a lot, but I never write it. I&apos;ll leave that to Mr Keats, Mr Byron and Mr Eliot. I wish I had asked more questions of my grandmother.

Rationing was still in place, it was a bomb site, and here was this young girl, the new Queen, promising to do her duty by her people. It all looked so uncertain. My colleagues in the States used to tease me about why I hadn&apos;t come to work in America. But they didn&apos;t understand. We were British \u2013 we ignored the continent closest to us! In my childhood in Trinidad we looked to London for everything. I have planned some interviews for weeks and weeks. I would go around with a piece of paper, asking people what they really wanted to know of George Bush.

This was not simply because of his pictures, for which he won a Pulitzer prize in 1965. They documented the war&apos;s effect on humanity: families huddled in fear in the midst of fighting soldiers; people mourning those already dead; a father confronting Vietnamese soldiers over the body of his son; the face of an American soldier staring emptily at the camera, his helmet decorated with the words: &quot;War is hell.&quot; Faas&apos;s dictum was simple: &quot;You can&apos;t photograph a flying bullet, but you can capture genuine fear.&quot; Beyond his own work, he played a crucial role as chief of photo operations for AP, recruiting and mentoring other photographers, who became known as &quot;Horst&apos;s army&quot;. Vietnam may have been the first war brought into living-rooms via television, but the newsfilm with the footage had to be developed, edited, voiced and flown for TV broadcast. The most immediate images of the war, and the most memorable, were still photographs, and the ones with the greatest impact came from AP, which distributed them to papers around the world. Faas insisted on sending to the wires Eddie Adams&apos;s picture of the Saigon police chief executing a suspected Viet Cong agent in the street near the AP bureau, knowing the photo&apos;s power would overcome issues of good taste. He also fought to publish Nick Ut&apos;s shot of a naked girl fleeing her napalmed village, over the objections of editors offended by her nakedness. Faas had recruited Ut&apos;s older brother, Huynh Thanh My, to AP; My was killed in combat in 1965. Boasting an intelligence network described as second only to the Viet Cong, Faas had an uncanny ability to anticipate where the action would be, and a bravery that impressed even US General William Westmoreland. In the words of New York Times correspondent David Halberstam, who shared a house with Faas, Westmoreland &quot;adored Horst: this brave young foreigner who seemed to spend all his time in the field and whose photos did not seem particularly political&quot;. Faas&apos;s ability to function in war may have been the result of growing up with it. He was born in Berlin, and recalled watching air-raids over the city. His parents fled as the Russians approached in 1945, winding up in Munich, where he perfected his English as a teenage drummer with a jazz band of black American soldiers. In 1951, he took a job with the Keystone photo agency as a darkroom clerk; he was notorious throughout his career as an editor for maintaining strict control over the inventory of developed film. He covered the Vietnam peace talks in Geneva in 1954 before joining AP in 1956, where his career in combat began in Congo. He then covered the rebellion in Algeria, before being assigned to Vietnam in 1962, arriving on the same day as AP&apos;s New Zealand-born reporter Peter Arnett, who said: &quot;Horst was absolutely fearless on the battlefield.&quot; In 1967, Faas was wounded by a rocket grenade during fighting near Bu Dop. He was told by the medic who saved his leg that he was &quot;so grey I thought you were a goner&quot;. He was confined to the bureau for a period and became AP&apos;s roving photographer for Asia, based in Singapore. In 1972, he won his second Pulitzer, with Michel Laurent \u2013 who would be killed in Vietnam three years later \u2013 for their photographs of Bengali soldiers bayoneting rebel Pakistani militia accused of rape in Dhaka, in what is now Bangladesh. Outside of war, he and Arnett collaborated on a travel journal around the US, and Faas returned to Congo, which had been renamed Zaire, to provide memorable shots of Muhammad Ali&apos;s Rumble in the Jungle. In 1976, he moved to London as AP&apos;s senior photo editor for Europe, where in 1990 he overruled the objections of some editors to graphic photos submitted to the Johannesburg bureau by Greg Marinovich, who won a Pulitzer for his shots of ANC members beating to death a suspected Inkatha spy, images reminiscent of Faas&apos;s Dhaka pictures. In 1997, Faas and Tim Page edited Requiem, a book about photographers killed in Vietnam, and in 2003 he and AP editor Richard Pyle collaborated on Lost Over Laos, the story of their search for the site where four photographers were lost when their plane was shot down. He retired from AP in 2004, and in 2005 fell ill at a photojournalism symposium he had helped organise in Vietnam. The spinal haemorrhage left him paralysed from the waist down, and though he continued his work as an ambassador for photojournalism, it was with great difficulty. His philosophy of photojournalism is summed up best by the reply he gave photographer Zoran Bozicevic, who asked for instructions while covering the Bosnian conflict for AP. &quot;You tell me what you are going to do,&quot; Faas replied. &quot;You&apos;re the man on the ground ... don&apos;t let someone hundreds of miles away decide it for you. Just tell me where you are going and call back when you have the pictures ready. And stay safe.&quot; He is survived by his wife, Ursula, and daughter, Clare. \u2022 Horst Faas, photojournalist, born 28 April 1933; died 10 May 2012"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/13/rangers-charles-green-craig-whyte", "sentences": ["Green heads a 20-strong consortium, which includes investors from Singapore, and has promised to offer \u00a38.5m to creditors, plus football debts of \u00a33.5m as and when they are received by Rangers."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-13T17:22:58Z", "title": "Rangers' consortium leader Charles Green denies links to Craig Whyte", "tags": ["Scottish Premier League 2011-12", "Rangers", "Scottish Premiership", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Charles Green, the man in charge of the consortium poised to take over Rangers, has denied any business link to the club&apos;s former owner Craig Whyte. A report on Saturday morning claimed that one of Green&apos;s companies completed a \u00a330m deal with Close Brothers 12 years ago. Whyte, under whose ownership Rangers plunged into administration, sold off future catering revenues at Ibrox to Close Brothers during his ill-fated reign. Green confirmed he had given Whyte \u00a31 \u2013 the same value paid \u2013 for his 85% stake in Rangers, and said: &quot;I gave him a pound out of my own pocket too, so he has made a 100% profit.&quot; On any suggestion of a previous connection, Green said: &quot;It was complete rubbish. I met Craig Whyte for the very first time a week last Tuesday in London.&quot; Green has been afforded exclusive\u2011bidder status three months after Rangers entered administration.

But nobody could put cash on the table. I can,&quot; Green said. On the likelihood of a company voluntary arrangement succeeding, Green said: &quot;We can&apos;t be confident.

The headline detail of the proposal has been discussed. We can&apos;t get a commitment until they have an opportunity to consider it at senior level.

Despite the common conception, there&apos;s little doubt that, these days, China&apos;s so-called clones are more than just copycats. Compared to Twitter, for example, Sina Weibo regularly evolves and adds elements to its user experience, such as a video site, games, applications group chat, comment feature and more. However, it remains to be seen whether this innovative, flexible approach gives them the global potential to take on the originals, as ZDNet Asia suggests. Sina Weibo and co are only active in China, but they have already built formidable user bases \u2014 which includes a sprinkling of overseas users \u2014 and hold their weight favourably in comparison with the top western equivalents: \u2022 Facebook: social network \u2013 900 million registered users \u2022 Twitter: microblogging service \u2013 140 million active* users \u2022 LinkedIn: professional social network \u2013 161 million registered users \u2022 Sina Weibo: microblogging service \u2013 300 million registered users (reported 100 million active* users per day) \u2022 Tencent Weibo: microblogging service \u2013 300 million registered users \u2022 Renren: social network \u2013 137 million active* users \u2022 Kaixin001: social network \u2013 120 million registered users *Note the difference between active users number and (total) registered users While they have been successfully adopted by large numbers of China&apos;s 500 million plus internet users, that doesn&apos;t mean that they will thrive at that rate if pushed out to the rest of the world. Need for differentiation in a congested space Today&apos;s social media landscape is a congested and consolidated one that is not easy for new services to enter, particularly those that fail to offer clear differentiation over what already exists and used by millions. This struggle to be unique would be a clear challenge for China&apos;s social networks were they to expand worldwide. Tencent Weibo has embraced English the most actively \u2013 offering a translated service for non-Chinese users \u2013 but, as Tech Rice notes, this is very much an experimental move, rather than a calculated play to beat Twitter and Facebook on their home turf. The Sina Weibo website remains available in Chinese only, but any move to embrace English would likely be to appeal to those in the surrounding regions, particularly Southeast Asia \u2014 where Chinese culture has roots and the country continues to exert influence \u2014 rather than &apos;global&apos; markets. Irrespective, the lion&apos;s share of content on these services is in Chinese, which severely reduces the benefit they can offer users, even with an English user interface. That issue is particularly notable when Twitter and a whole host of other services are available in English and local languages, providing a more informative and useful service. Plenty of work still to do in China Aside from the challenge of competition, Chinese social networking giants still have a lot of work to do in their home country with their core services. Weibo microblogs, in particular, have become key platforms through which news is broken, making the platform increasingly attractive to internet users in the country, despite the state&apos;s efforts to restrict the medium&apos;s influence. Access to the internet continues to grow in China, meaning that market saturation, which Facebook faces in the US, is not a big deal for Chinese social networks. Authorities estimate the number of internet users in the country could reach 800 million by 2015, as Tech In Asia reports. China is fast approaching 600 million web users already and this prospective growth, while optimistic, is feasible and would provide a growing source of new users. Effects of real-name regulation The challenge of recruiting more users is set to become increasingly important as the effects of the country&apos;s real-name regulations, which requires users to verify their accounts with official ID, are felt. The currently large registered user numbers for Weibo services are likely to drop significantly as spam and inactive users are removed from the services, once the rule is fully implemented. This process is still very much playing out but, with Sina conceding that just 60% of its user base is likely to be verified, services will need to focus on recruiting new users and encouraging increased activity in China. That is a significant challenge in itself and, with China the core market, it should take precedent over any attempt to expand overseas. Generating revenue a priority China&apos;s microblogs are struggling to turn in profit, particularly with the cost of operations, content licensing, infrastructure and more weighing down their financial reports. While Sina and Tencent in particular have other businesses that can support Weibo services, both are keen to develop their revenue streams and see profit from the platforms in the near future. Mobile is a key part of potential monetisation, and China&apos;s social networks are not alone in needing to build smartphone strategies. The issue is also concerning Facebook, as it seeks to generate fresh streams of income and provide a better user experience for mobile users. The concern isn&apos;t limited to social networks either. Baidu, the country&apos;s Google-like search giant, is focused on developing its mobile play in China, where official statistics claim there are 356 million mobile web users. More than just being a distraction from more pressing priorities, any initiative to target overseas users would also be a costly operation, if done correctly. Given the requirement for differentiation, any move to woo those outside of China would require a sizeable budget for product development and marketing, not to mention additional infrastructure. There would also be little guarantee of tangible success and return in investment. As it stands, Weibo services offer advertising potential for international firms through their focus on China. For example, a Baidu advertising reseller just moved into Australia, where a number of industries \u2013 particularly in travel and leisure \u2013 are targeting increasingly affluent Chinese consumers. Other organisations are taking to the Chinese social media space, albeit with initially mixed results, but social networks are seen as a key platform towards reaching the increasingly prosperous middle and upper classes in the country. Weibo, as a dedicated Chinese service, offers a platform to reach these audiences, as do other Chinese social networks. Keeping its overseas investment low, the company can already count on growing interest and international advertising dollars for its audience in China. Southeast Asia a more likely focus than &apos;global&apos; On the face of it, Chinese social networks have enough priorities in China to keep them occupied but there are no guarantees. Global moves themselves would not make sense, for reasons outlined above, but local markets like south-east Asia could develop into new promising &quot;spill-over&quot; markets for China&apos;s social network. Tencent has already begun tapping this potential with the introduction of its Weixin mobile chat application into the region, branded We Chat. The company&apos;s messaging services are tightly integrated to its Weibo service so, if it sees success in the region, it could follow up with a more sustained social media push. Meanwhile, Baidu revealed plans for a Singapore-based research centre earlier this year, as it develops its understanding and capacity to introduce relevant new services into the region. The company is also rumoured to be setting up an office in Latin America but, as critics have pointed out, it will need to adequately differentiate itself from its rivals if it is to stand a chance of succeeding there. Baidu is in a position where, as a search engine, it makes more sense to expand its service worldwide, but for China&apos;s social networks, the benefits of full-on international expansion are currently outweighed by focusing on the domestic market \u2026 for now, at least.

Appearance: All chin and hair gel. You forgot the mad staring eyes. Is he a psychopath? He&apos;s a successful businessman! That&apos;s not exactly a no. It was meant to be. Saverin is the former Harvard student who helped to launch Facebook. I thought that was Mark Zuckerthingy. You know, the billionaire who dresses like a teenager. Hence the words &quot;helped to&quot;. Saverin was one of Facebook&apos;s four founders and used to be its chief financial officer. Used to be? He fell out with Zuckerberg over the size of his shareholding. Ooh, matron! He now owns just 4% of the company, versus the chairman&apos;s 28%. Even so, when Facebook is floated in a few days, his stake should be worth almost $4bn. Of which the taxman will take \u2026 Remarkably little. Having moved to Singapore in 2009, Saverin gave up his US citizenship last year. Entirely coicidentally, there is no capital gains tax in his new home. Isn&apos;t this a little shifty? Absolutely not! Just ask Mr Saverin&apos;s highly paid lawyers. Hm. So how is this entirely legitimate and honourable action playing with the American public? Not too well. It doesn&apos;t help that Saverin was born in Brazil and moved to the US as a child because his family were afraid of kidnappers. As the unfortunately named Tom Glasscock posted on Facebook: &quot;He comes to this country, takes advantage of the opportunities we offer for advancement and achievement, hits the jackpot, and then bails. Wham bam, thank you ma&apos;am \u2026&quot; It does sound as if someone&apos;s getting shafted. So what does Saverin do with his lolly? He invests it in firms with names such as Qwiki and Jumio. No, the interesting stuff. He showers models with champagne while partying in St Tropez and Miami. Seriously? According to certain tabloids. He definitely splashes it around more than Zuckerberg, who only bought his first property last year. I can&apos;t decide which one I admire more. Then let&apos;s just hate them both. Do say: &quot;The rich are different from you and me \u2026&quot; Don&apos;t say: &quot;\u2026 they&apos;ve got better accountants.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/smart-cities-sustainable-development-urban", "sentences": ["In Mumbai, Schneider&apos;s traffic management system has helped reduce travel times by 12%, while smart grid solutions in Singapore have helped the power utility respond more quickly to electricity outages.", "&quot;That is the same story in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-15T12:14:00Z", "title": "When sustainability becomes a duty", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Smart cities", "Strategy", "Cities"], "article": "Being smart means a lot of things to Annie Xu Hongyan, the senior vice-president for the Smart Cities initiative at Schneider Electric, a French energy management company that offers infrastructure solutions to new urban problems. It means not sacrificing long-term thinking for short-term wins, being pragmatic when it comes to managing the environment but also knowing when to get personal. &quot;We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children,&quot; says Xu, referring to a well-known idiom to explain why sustainability matters to her. An aeronautic engineer by training, Xu grew up in a mid-sized Chinese city that like many in the rapidly changing country has seen the impact of climate change first hand. Xu says the butterflies she once saw in droves as a child can now only be found in museums. But while the no-nonsense executive admits that sustainability is personal, it is also something she views as a duty. &quot;It&apos;s the right thing for any company to do,&quot; she says. In keeping with that approach, Schneider is working with more than 200 cities around the world to improve the management of power grids, traffic mobility and water systems through the use of new software. &quot;The end goal is to help cities worldwide become more sustainable, efficient and livable,&quot; says Xu, who is based in Hong Kong. She explains that, while cities make up only about 2% of the earth&apos;s surface, they account for 50% of the world population, 75% of global energy consumption and 80% of carbon emissions. The challenge, she says, is to &quot;tip the balance&quot; between increasing urban capacity and reducing carbon emissions. Schneider works closely with the European Commission&apos;s smart city working group to help further its research and development. It is also engaging smart city projects in places such as Chicago and Barcelona, says Xu. The challenge is getting involved with cities early. &quot;We&apos;re trying to promote a dialogue before the master plan even starts, to engage the technical players, because they can bring in their technical expertise to be part of the design process,&quot; Xu explains. That requires a change in behaviour, from one where the public sector handles all city developments to one where officials seek input from private players. It is also where leadership becomes important, says Xu, noting the need for government co-operation along with relevant policies that support smart cities and sustainable solutions. Support for the use of renewable energy, for example, would reduce production costs and make it more attractive for private sector players to invest in the industry. &quot;As a private sector player, we need to work very closely with the government to make sure we have a creative business model and a funding model behind that,&quot; Xu says. As an example, she cites how buildings could use technology, such as more efficient heating, cooling and ventilation systems and low-energy lighting, to improve their power use. Mass public transportation or tolling and congestion charges could produce a 15% reduction in gridlock, she explains. In Mumbai, Schneider&apos;s traffic management system has helped reduce travel times by 12%, while smart grid solutions in Singapore have helped the power utility respond more quickly to electricity outages. Xu says there are at least 10 active smart city projects in the planning phase in China. &quot;The Chinese government is very good in execution,&quot; she says. &quot;That is the same story in Singapore. They are relying on the private sector to come out with a business model which will push the city or the country&quot; towards sustainability. In emerging markets, however, the risk is the lack of technical expertise to ensure that whatever sustainable solutions the government implements are integrated and can work, she adds. Xu has plenty of experience to go on, having spent more than 10 years in Europe and also travelled to a range of urban areas \u2013 from mega-cities to cities so small their &quot;entire population could fit in one mall in Hong Kong&quot;, she says, laughing. While there needs to be more discussion about the costs and benefits of sustainability, Xu says she sees more smart city activities, such as blogs and other initiatives aimed at spreading awareness \u2013 which is a good sign people are getting conscious about the need for environmentally focused growth. &quot;I think sustainability lots of times is about common sense,&quot; she explains. &quot;It requires creativity, again coming back to the point of having a dialogue, to really discuss what are the options and not be afraid to talk about that.&quot; Sara Schonhardt is a writer at Eco-Business.com This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

If you&apos;re Eduardo Saverin, you might. A billionaire Facebook co-founder, Saverin renounced his US citizenship last year, although the decision was made public just days before the social network&apos;s anticipated initial public offering on Friday. Saverin, 30, is a 2% stakeholder in the company, according to the wealth intelligence provider Wealth-X, which would put his net worth in the neighborhood of $2 billion after the IPO. (Some reports put Saverin&apos;s stake as high as 4%, but any amount below 5% does not need to be reported.) Facebook increased the price of its stock Monday in what will be Silicon Valley&apos;s biggest ever IPO, valuing the company between $93bn and $104bn. In unfriending the US ahead of Facebook&apos;s big day, Saverin, who currently lives in Singapore, stands to save millions in taxes. &quot;Eduardo recently found it to be more practical to become a resident of Singapore since he plans to live there for an indefinite period of time,&quot; Saverin&apos;s New York-based spokesman Tom Goodman said Tuesday in a statement, downplaying the tax savings as a primary incentive. Goodman added that Saverin plans to invest in Brazilian and global companies that have strong interests in entering Asian markets. &quot;It made the most sense for him to use Singapore as a home base.&quot; But Wealth-X estimates his tax savings on his Facebook stake will be &quot;at least&quot; $39 million \u2013 1 percent of his worth. Saverin will still have to pay a large exit tax for renouncing his citizenship, but Singapore is a low-tax jurisdiction and has no capital gains tax. &quot;This situation provides insight into a larger trend that has to do with competitive tax regimes in the United States and a broader debate about innovation and attracting human capital,&quot; David Friedman, president and co-found of Wealth-X told the Guardian. The move is also winning him a conservative fan base in the US. Forbes published an editorial lauding Saverin as an &quot;American hero&quot; for decamping.  The Heritage Foundation&apos;s Mike Brownfield wrote a blog post unfavorably comparing the US&apos;s economic freedom to Singapore&apos;s.  Wealth-X&apos;s Friedman frets that the money Saverin saves by renouncing his citizenship will be more likely pumped back into the part of the world where he now resides. &quot;The Facebook IPO is going to create a massive wave of venture capital investment and a whole cluster of creativity,&quot; he said. &quot;I suspect the money he&apos;s saving in taxes is going to go into investments in companies that are innovating and going to create new jobs.&quot; Saverin&apos;s spokesman confirmed as much to the Wall Street Journal. &quot;His decision had nothing to do with dissatisfaction here, but with a strong desire to do business there,&quot; Goodman said. The irony here, however, is that Saverin&apos;s is a quintessential American story. The son of a multi-millionaire, Saverin was born in Brazil but immigrated to Miami at 13 after being threatened by kidnappers. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, where he met Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in his junior year, with a degree in economics. In a 2005 interview with his high school alma mater&apos;s magazine, he was quoted as saying &quot;basically, Mark is the tech guy and I&apos;m the business guy.&quot; The two had a falling out over the direction of the company and ultimately parted ways after Saverin sued for an undisclosed amount. The case was settled out of court, with Saverin reportedly receiving a 5% stake in Facebook, some of which he has since sold off. As a result, not everyone is calling him a &quot;hero&quot;, however: an editorial in the New York Daily News said a tax doge &quot;gives immigration a bad name.&quot;  So in the end, the country that gave his family sanctuary when they were in danger may have become too economically punitive once he was able to cash out."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/16/matches-delayed-defective-crossbars-knowledge", "sentences": ["&quot;In a recent game between Singapore Welsh and, ironically, our German counterparts, kick-off was delayed as neither team had a ball,&quot; wrote Gar Mogs last week."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-15T23:06:03Z", "title": "Which matches have been delayed by crossbars, corner flags and kitmen? | The Knowledge", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "&quot;In a recent game between Singapore Welsh and, ironically, our German counterparts, kick-off was delayed as neither team had a ball,&quot; wrote Gar Mogs last week. &quot;Has any game played at a slightly more professional level been delayed due to an equipment glitch?&quot;  Immediately the biggest game of them all springs to mind. The start of the 1974 World Cup final between the hosts, Germany, and Holland was delayed by the game&apos;s English referee, Jack Taylor, because the ground staff had forgotten to put the corner flags out on the pitch. Johan van Slooten provides some detail: &quot;They had been removed to accommodate the closing ceremony which took place before the final.&quot; Taylor himself later recalled how he couldn&apos;t believe how he found himself in the midst of such an amateur error in the biggest game of his career. &quot;It was so funny it wasn&apos;t true,&quot; he told Midlands paper Express and Star. &quot;As a local referee I remember doing a game where a guy came up to me and said &apos;you&apos;ve got to restart.&apos; I asked why and he said &apos;there&apos;s no corner flags&apos;. It&apos;s something I never forgot and so when you come to a World Cup final in Germany, such an efficient nation who never make mistakes, and there&apos;s no corner flags you can&apos;t believe it. There&apos;s millions of people watching and here I am, this one little guy, coming all the way around the pitch sticking corner flags in.&quot; The 1974 final is not the only big game to have suffered a somewhat farcical delay \u2013 in fact it isn&apos;t even the only World Cup final that didn&apos;t get under way at the scheduled time. Four years later in Argentina, when Holland again faced the hosts in the deciding match, the kick-off was again delayed, as Mal Perry explains. &quot;Before the start of the 1978 World Cup Final Ren\u00e9 van de Kerkhof caused a delay because the Argentinians objected to the fact he was wearing a plaster cast on his injured arm. The ref messed about for a bit, Van de Kerkhof went off and got some padding put on his arm and the game got under way. Of course, that was not the most contentious event in that competition.&quot; In fact there were so many delays during the 1978 World Cup that it&apos;s surprising matches aren&apos;t still being played. &quot;There is no higher professional level than the World Cup and even there &apos;equipment glitches&apos; have occurred,&quot; writes Richard Franks. &quot;I&apos;m thinking of the France v Hungary first round group game in Argentina &apos;78 when, due to some kind of communications breakdown, both teams turned up with only their change kits, both featuring white shirts. There was a lengthy delay (all covered live on TV) while officials went off in search of an alternative kit. They returned with the green and white striped shirts of a local fifth division side called Club Atl\u00e9tico Kimberley, which the French ended up wearing for their 3-1 win. Don&apos;t believe anyone who tries to tell you that the ad hoc shirt change was due to France&apos;s blue shirts and Hungary&apos;s red shirts looking indistinguishable on Argentine black and white TV \u2013 the visual evidence shows Hungary playing in white. Several of you provided the example of the 1997-98 Champions League semi-final first leg between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund the start of which was delayed for over an hour while officials scoured around for a new set of goalposts. Maurice S\u00e9ch\u00e9 takes up the story: &quot;Some Madridistas \u2013 being very excited with just a few minutes to kick-off \u2013 climbed the safety fence behind the goal which separated the pitch from the audience. Due to the weight of the supporters the fence cracked and so did the goal posts because the net of the goal was fixed to the fence. It was 20.44 (German time) with the game to kick off just one minute later. Any attempt to fix the broken posts failed and there was no spare goal available in the Bernab\u00e9u and a goal had to be brought from the training ground of Real Madrid \u2013 which took approximately an hour. The game finally kicked off with 76 minutes delay. &quot;The commentators on German TV were at their very best that night (and were granted a TV award afterwards), joking all the time and making fun of typical commentators&apos; phrases (at least on German TV) like: &quot;It has never been before that a goal would do that good to the match&quot; (ridiculing the standard phrase &quot;A goal would do good to the match&quot;) or a wordplay (working only in German): &apos;For those of you who just joined us: Das erste Tor ist bereits gefallen&apos; which has a double-meaning in German: the first goal has already been scored and (literally translated) the first goal has fallen down. Credit to Borussia, though they lost 0-2 they did not protest.&quot; There are examples of delays in European club football&apos;s greatest competition that would be more at home in your local pub league. This is example from Sean DeLoughry shows what the Champions League is all about: &quot;When League of Ireland champions Bohemians entertained Estonia&apos;s Levadia in the qualifying rounds of the 2001-2 Champions League kick off was delayed by about 20 minutes when Levadia took issue with the height of one of the crossbars at Bohemians&apos; Dalymount Park. A ladder and tape measure was duly produced and it transpired that the centre of the cross bar was an inch or so too low. Lacking the equipment or wherewithal to raise the height of the bar Bohs ground staff employed lateral thinking, got the pitch roller out and managed to press the goal area down the necessary inch. Bohs ignored the distraction and cruised to a 3-0 win.&quot; A DRINK TOO FAR &quot;Has a goalkeeper ever received two yellow cards in the same game for time wasting?&quot; tweeted RD1133 last week. You&apos;d have to push your luck to achieve such an ignominious dismissal, but Ljungskile goalkeeper Michal Slawuta managed it in an away game at Trelleborg that back in April 2008. &quot;With Ljungskile leading 2-1 in the 90th minute, he took too long during a goal kick and was booked,&quot; writes David Ekstrand. &quot;He then went over to the other post to drink water, and was promptly booked again. According to Slawuta himself, he just happened to be thirsty, and the water bottle just happened to be on the other side of the goal.&quot; The referee felt that heading off for a drink was &quot;incredibly unsportsmanlike conduct&quot;. Slawuta, though, was unrepentant: &quot;If I end up in a similar situation, I will do the same again,&quot; he told the Expressen newspaper. &quot;At least we won three important points so I am satisfied anyway. Shit happens.&quot; CHELSEA: RECORD BREAKERS? &quot;If Chelsea win the Champions League next week, they will have done so while finishing sixth in the Premier League,&quot; writes Josh Havers. &quot;Would this be the lowest league finish for a team winning the European Cup?&quot;  In a word, no. Three teams have matched or equalled that feat. Juventus finished sixth in Serie A when winning the European Cup in 1984-85, Bayern Munich were 10th in Bundesliga in 1974-75 when winning the second of three successive European titles, and topping the lot Aston Villa limped to an 11th-place finish in the First Division en route to their European Cup win in 1981-82. The full breakdown of European Cup winners by league position is: first (23), second (12), third (11), fourth (two), fifth (four), sixth (one), 10th (one) and 11th (one). KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;There&apos;s a story doing the rounds at my local that Blackpool once resorted to using a flamethrower to thaw out their frozen pitch,&quot; wrote Bill Winkles back in 2007. &quot;Would I be right to think it&apos;s total guff?&quot; Well Bill, it&apos;s not quite true, but it is closer to reality than you might imagine. The winter of 1962-63 was extremely harsh, and Blackpool suffered more than most as their pitch completely froze over to the point where they couldn&apos;t play a single home game between 15 December and 2 March. Some players even took to ice skating on the pitch, as revealed by the following gem, dug out of the West Lancashire Evening Gazette&apos;s archives by Seasiders historian Gerry Wolstenholme: &quot;At Bloomfield Road Jimmy Armfield and Tony Waiters ice skated on the pitch on January 8 1963 and two days later they were joined by Barrie Martin, &apos;Mandy&apos; Hill and two other players. On January 29 1963 Blackpool used a disc harrow to try to get the game against West Ham United played on February 2 1963 but that too proved ineffective and on January 30 1963 the players swept a heavy fall of snow from the pitch in a vain hope that it would be clear underneath, but the ice \u2013 one to four inches thick \u2013 was &apos;as formidable as ever&apos;.&quot; But it was actually Norwich who attempted, unsuccessfully, to defrost their playing surface with fire. Their scheduled FA Cup third-round tie at home to Blackpool had been postponed 11 times, and, as the same piece of archive reveals, they were willing to try just about anything by the end. &quot;In an attempt to get the game played, the Carrow Road pitch was treated with flamethrowers on January 22 1963 as, according to a Norwich spokesman, &apos;a last desperate effort&apos;. However they &apos;served no purpose whatsoever&apos; for &apos;as fast as the ice melted it froze again&apos;. An icebreaker was also used but it too proved ineffective.&quot; For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? David Williams poses a question regarding Ashley Cole: &quot;If Chelsea lose the Champions League final, Ashley Cole will have lost three Champions League Finals (2006, 2008 and 2012), but won seven FA Cup Finals (2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012), both of which will be records.

Our ability to visit far-off places and people, and their access to us, has always been at the heart of our ability to punch above our weight in the world, whether that&apos;s commercially, culturally or diplomatically. In the past we were dependent on ships, now we are reliant on commercial airlines, as well as the Channel Tunnel and secure data networks. This infrastructure is critical for our future, particularly as we look to major economies like India, China and Brazil for export opportunities. But it is also vital for sustaining our outward facing society and culture; one that&apos;s confident engaging with the world and welcoming of its diversity. Rail and video-conferencing will help, but air travel will remain absolutely essential and more people are going to fly, especially to and from a networked, diverse, outward-facing island nation like our own. We should embrace this, but we must also recognise that flying more will also have negative consequences, in particular greenhouse gas emissions. The positive progress on including aviation in Europe&apos;s carbon trading scheme this week is welcome, but neither that nor more efficient aircraft will deal with the industry&apos;s climate problem. As I will argue, only biofuels can do that. Aviation currently accounts for a relatively small proportion of global carbon emissions: 6% of UK, 4% of European Union and 2% of world. This will change fast though, with global aviation expected to grow at 5% a year for at least the next 15 years. If so, by 2050 aviation emissions will account for up to 20% of global emissions, making tackling global warming significantly harder. Though new airport capacity in the UK is essential, plans for it must convincingly address this important pollution challenge. Including aviation in the Europe&apos;s Emissions Trading Scheme is a step in the right direction, but at current carbon prices it will not spur the innovations needed to cut pollution. Some say the aviation sector has a good track record of improving the fuel efficiency of new aircraft, achieving an average annual improvement of about 1.5%. But these emissions savings will be completely overwhelmed by growing global demand for aviation. So we desperately need something that can deliver a step-change in emission reductions from existing fleets, particularly as planes built today will be in service for many years to come. The only option is to replace existing jet fuel (kerosene) with an alternative that can deliver deep emission reductions and be used to current aircraft. Fortunately, this technology exists: sustainable bio jet fuels. Made from advanced feedstocks and able to provide significant life-cycle emission reductions and meet other stringent sustainability standards, these fuels can be produced today and have already received certification for use in commercial jet aircraft. They can also be produced now at costs not far above the high and volatile price of jet fuel, with Bloomberg predicting that they could potentially reach price parity with kerosene in 2016. There is an opportunity for the UK to align its need to develop new airport capacity with the development of sustainable bio jet fuels at scale. We should work to ensure that any new airport provide airlines with the best biofuels available. Airport operators should have to provide airlines with a blend of jet fuel that has a significant and rising proportion of sustainable bio jet fuel. This would significantly reduce emissions from flights. The mandate should start at an achievable level, say where the blend would have to be 15% less polluting than jet fuel today based on the strictest sustainability standards. It could then ratchet up to reach a point where the blend was 60% less polluting within a reasonable time-frame. Airlines would benefit from a genuine and cost-effective emission reduction strategy, which might even attract environmentally conscious flyers. Not many hubs would need to follow the UK before the majority of international flights used sustainable bio jet fuel blends, perhaps only New York, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore need change, in addition to London. An ambitious blending mandate would send exactly the signal required to accelerate the development of sustainable bio jet fuels. Airport operators would be required to demonstrate they had a plan to meet the incoming mandate and would sign supply contracts with developers, which would spur innovation and investment. The UK government could also ensure that our leading biotech, aviation and university sectors work in unison to create solutions, through targeted research programmes and tax relief for collaborative work. The luddite wing of the environmental movement will think such proposals sacrilegious \u2013 their only solution is to stop flying. But the reality is that there will be and should be more international travel, particularly to and from the UK. The challenge is to make this as least polluting as is possible, while also minimising local airport impacts. By aligning the debate about airport capacity sensibly with environmental objectives, we can make a significant dent in aviation emissions globally as well as guarantee sufficient airport capacity to keep UK plc open for both business and pleasure. \u2022 Ben Caldecott is head of policy at Climate Change Capital and co-author of &apos;Green Skies Thinking: Promoting the development and commercialisation of sustainable bio-jet fuels&apos;  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/17/wiggles-change-line-up-kids", "sentences": ["Children (or parents) keen to see the classic line-up on more time should seek tickets for the Celebration Tour, which takes in the UK as well as the US, Canada, Singapore and New Zealand before a final round of home dates."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-17T08:45:04Z", "title": "Wiggles change line-up, but will the kids notice?", "tags": ["Australia news", "Children's TV", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Pre-schoolers the world over will not necessarily be in mourning, but they will at least need to adapt to a pretty big change: three-quarters of Australian post-toddler music supergroup The Wiggles are to retire, they have announced.

Blue Wiggle Anthony Field will remain, with a spokesman for the group saying: &quot;Anthony loves it too much.&quot; Formed in 1991 out of the ashes of an Australian pop outfit The Cockroaches, and informed by Field&apos;s university studies in early childhood education, the band&apos;s catchy music and colour-coded, broadly drawn personalities \u2013 Fatt&apos;s character falls asleep a lot, while Page drives the group&apos;s ubiquitous red car \u2013 made them increasingly successful to a point where their estimated joint annual earnings reached around \u00a320m. More than two decades of such hard work had taken its toll, Cook told fans in the farewell video: &quot;The touring and performing over the past 21 years has meant that we&apos;ve spent a long time away from our own families and friends. We miss them and want to spend more time at home, which is a major reason why three of us decided it was time to hand on our skivvies to a new generation.&quot; The three retiring Wiggles will still contribute songs, dances and other idea to the group, they stressed. Children (or parents) keen to see the classic line-up on more time should seek tickets for the Celebration Tour, which takes in the UK as well as the US, Canada, Singapore and New Zealand before a final round of home dates. While this is a dramatic lineup change it is not the first. A fifth founder Wiggle, Phillip Wilcher, left the group after their first album to become a successful classical pianist. Ill health forced Page to take six years off from the group, only returning in January this year. His stand-in, Sam Moran, has not been invited to take over again. Given that the group&apos;s highly age-targeted fanbase changes so quickly, it&apos;s likely to be parents who mourn the demise of the original Wiggles more than their offspring. In an interview last year Field noted that five years into Page&apos;s forced sabbatical many Wiggle fans had no idea who he was."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2012/may/17/fitzrovia-news-luxury-apartments-singapore", "sentences": ["From Fitzrovia News:  While tenants in the City of Westminster are struggling to pay their rent in the face of rising property values and housing benefit caps, luxury apartments due to be built on a plot in Fitzrovia are being sold off-plan in Hong Kong and Singapore for up to \u00a38,500,000 a piece.", "They learned this from Channel News Asia, which reported the developer of the future Fitzroy Place finding ferocious demand for prime location London properties in Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-17T13:53:00Z", "title": "London housing crisis: the Westminster bubble", "tags": ["Politics", "London politics", "Society", "London", "Housing"], "article": "From Fitzrovia News:  While tenants in the City of Westminster are struggling to pay their rent in the face of rising property values and housing benefit caps, luxury apartments due to be built on a plot in Fitzrovia are being sold off-plan in Hong Kong and Singapore for up to \u00a38,500,000 a piece.

The other way is lack of supply. Not much sign of either changing. Fitzrovia News adds:  Permission was given for the development in February after [Westminster] City Hall&apos;s planning committee agreed to a contribution of affordable housing provision, amounting to 17.4 percent of the total residential floorspace on-site plus \u00a35.94m towards the City Council&apos;s affordable housing fund. Planning policy normally requires that 25 percent of the apartments should be affordable housing, but a larger contribution of affordable housing was rejected by Exemplar who argued that it was not viable to provide any more. Westminster&apos;s planning committee agreed... The development...was given planning permission in the face of huge opposition from people living around the site.  More on that here. Meanwhile, Westminster&apos;s new leader Philippa Roe has strongly refuted the charge that government housing benefit caps are leading to the alleged &quot;social cleansing&quot; of poorer residents, despite its own research forecasting that these might oblige a fifth of the borough&apos;s primary school pupils to move to somewhere cheaper. As the Guardian reported in March:  Addressing the consequences from the cap in the private rented sector, she [Roe] retorts: &quot;Even in that sector we have a 45% &apos;churn&apos;, so even if the worst predictions are realised and every single person living in a property with rents above the cap had to move \u2013 it&apos;s less than 10% additional &apos;churn&apos; in one year.&quot; &quot;Furthermore, one-bedroom flats are readily available beneath the cap in Westminster,&quot; she says. &quot;Two-bed flats you can get in some of the less expensive areas. It&apos;s only the larger properties [three and four bed homes] where people are going to have to move, and 50% of the people affected by the cap are in one-bed properties. We are seeing rents coming down. We&apos;ve been negotiating with landlords, sometimes reducing rents from \u00a3800 to \u00a3400 a week.&quot; And she insists other nearby London boroughs can take up the slack. &quot;Even if people do have to move, they don&apos;t have to move very far - Camden, Brent, Southwark, Lambeth are on our doorstep and there are properties in those areas beneath the cap.&quot;  A Westminster council officer has explained to those affected: &quot;To live in Westminster is a privilege, not a right.&quot; No-one suggests that these issues are straightforward.

The directors of insurance giant Aviva were accused of being &quot;more concerned about their remuneration packages than growing our business&quot;. At Man Group, the hedge fund manager with a shrivelled share price, the highly paid chief executive was asked, witheringly: &quot;Sir, does it really feel like a $7m year to you?&quot; Yes, the boss-kicking season \u2013 aka, the spring round of annual shareholders&apos; meetings \u2013 has offered splendid sport. Private shareholders have lobbed memorable insults from the floor and, in a new twist, institutional investors have thrown their block votes around. Pay reports have been rejected at four companies (Aviva, car dealer Pendragon, miner Central Rand Gold, and on Thursday oil explorer Cairn Energy) and 25%-plus rebellions have been common. There have been trophies \u2013 the departures of three unloved chief executives: Andrew Moss of Aviva, David Brennan of AstraZeneca, and Sly Bailey of Trinity Mirror. &quot;To me it&apos;s capitalism renewing itself,&quot; says Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors. &quot;Those of us who believe in free markets ought to be shouting from the rooftops.&quot; It&apos;s true that something has changed this year: companies have discovered that token gestures don&apos;t work like they used to. Aviva volunteered Moss to take a \u00a346,000 cut in his salary, a laughably small reduction for a chief executive who had a pay-plus-perks package of \u00a35m in a year when the share price continued to fall. Sir Ian Gibson, chairman of Trinity Mirror, similarly offered a tweak to Bailey&apos;s package: a cut in her short-term incentives in exchange for a bigger long-term carrot. Shareholders concluded that they were being fobbed off. And rightly so: Bailey had earned \u00a314m in a 10-year spell in which Trinity Mirror&apos;s share price collapsed by 90%. Maintaining her basic salary at \u00a3750,000 a year looked plain arrogant. Time to celebrate a successful revolution, then? Not so fast. Scratch the surface and you&apos;ll see that radical reform to the way companies are managed and directors are paid still lies years away. There are at least four qualifications that make this revolt, at best, a work in progress. First, not all boardrooms are capitulating. Gareth Davis, chairman of William Hill, responded to a 50/50 vote on the bookmaker&apos;s pay report by saying the \u00a31.2m retention award for chief executive Ralph Topping was justified by unique circumstances. He blamed some of his shareholders for being led by a firm of US governance advisers. We&apos;ve also heard what might be called the &quot;Marcus Agius non-apology&quot;. The chairman of Barclays, presented with a one-third vote against the bank&apos;s pay report, said sorry for not having done &quot;a good enough job in articulating our case&quot;. Aviva, on the wrong end of 54% vote, tried that one too. &quot;We, and I personally, recognise that we can and should have done more to engage with our shareholders,&quot; said Scott Wheway, head of the pay committee. But communication is not the issue. One cause of resentment at Barclays was straightforward: bonuses totalling \u00a32.1bn towered over shareholders&apos; dividends of \u00a3700m. Agius says the bank is committed to &quot;realigning&quot; the split to suit the new era of low returns in banking but, on the speed of the adjustment, the position of Barclays&apos; board still seems to be, &quot;We&apos;re the best judges.&quot; Second, remember that votes that have teeth today concern the appointment of directors, and here there is little menace. This year&apos;s tally? Number of directors re-elected: a couple of thousand, or thereabouts. Number of directors removed by popular vote: nil. Moss, Brennan and Bailey \u2013 amazingly \u2013 secured 90%, 100% and 85% support respectively for their re-election. The manner of Moss&apos;s removal is instructive. Instead of voting against his reappointment, critics voted against Aviva&apos;s pay report \u2013 a vote that is currently merely advisory. The purpose, apparently, was to &quot;send a message&quot; to the board. The hint was taken: Moss&apos; resignation followed within days. But why such a dance round the houses? Because institutional investors plead that it is too risky to deprive a company of its chief executive, even one judged to have failed. Even company chairmen are baffled. &quot;I don&apos;t get it,&quot; says one. &quot;How can they vote for a director and then demand his resignation? It doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot; Indeed it doesn&apos;t. But it&apos;s the way institutions have always behaved. With a few honourable exceptions, they are rebels with reservations. We have to see how they behave when the government gives them new powers in the form of a forward-looking, binding vote on pay. Third, remember that we&apos;ve been here before. The last great pay revolt was in the mid-90s, when privatised utilities offering poor service and hosepipe bans were the chief villains. Some of those reforms stuck. &quot;Three-year rollers&quot; \u2013 contracts that gave a departing director three years&apos; salary, even in cases of failure \u2013 had disappeared by the turn of the century. But they were replaced by something just as advantageous to executives. &quot;The median total remuneration of FTSE100 CEOs has risen from an average of \u00a31m to \u00a34.2m for the period 1998-2010,&quot; began business secretary Vince Cable&apos;s consultation paper on executive pay last year. The mechanisms are well known. Pay schemes became more complex, medium-term incentive schemes flowered alongside long-term schemes, and the annual cash bonus became akin to a salary supplement. Executives could usually rely on one card coming up trumps sooner or later. Fund managers waved it all through. It&apos;s true that there has been progress in dismantling the complexity: greater simplification, at least in company reporting, is happening. But will executives simply find new ways to load the dice? That&apos;s what happened last time. Fourth, recall the shift in the makeup of shareholders. The National Association of Pension Funds \u2013 not a firebreathing body anyway, according to its critics \u2013 calculates that its members own about 11% of the UK stock market, down from almost 30% 20 years ago. Fragmentation of ownership, and the arrival of more foreign investors, is a problem. Simply put, fund managers in charge of pools of money in Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong or Singapore are less inclined to think about boardroom governance in the UK than their counterparts in London or Edinburgh. What&apos;s to be done? Lord Myners, a former Treasury minister, thinks the best solution lies in forcing shareholders to take responsibility for choosing directors. &quot;What&apos;s happening now is a seasonal phenomenon, probably accentuated by a concern to show Vince Cable that things are changing,&quot; he says. &quot;But these votes don&apos;t address the central issue that there is insufficient communication between the institutional investors and the independent directors and that will not be fixed until we have institutional investors being members of nomination committees that review the list of director candidates and take that sole preserve away from the chairman.&quot; He is describing the Scandinavian model, and its introduction in the UK would mark a definite shift in the relationship between boards and shareholders. Cable&apos;s other review - into short-termism - may have something to say. But it&apos;s hard to detect a grassroots demand from pension fund trustees and fund managers to place representatives on nominations committees. &quot;Interesting and may warrant further exploration&quot; is as far as the NAPF goes. For all the excitement this spring, one suspects next&apos;s year show will be a stale repeat. The audience is booing but the cast of non-executive directors who set pay remains the same."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/17/eduardo-saverin-tax-free-global-citizenship", "sentences": ["Now, he&apos;s home free, because in Singapore, where he&apos;s spent much of his time during the past several years, there are no capital gains taxes.", "Farhad Manjoo&apos;s blog post, entitled &quot;What Eduardo Saverin Owes America (Hint: Nearly Everything)&quot;, is one such blast against the Brazilian native who now professes allegiance, sort of, to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-17T20:13:00Z", "title": "Eduardo Saverin's tax-free global citizenship | Dan Gillmor", "tags": ["Facebook", "Equality", "US taxation", "US news", "Singapore", "Global economy", "Apple", "Business", "World news"], "article": "Eduardo Saverin imagines himself a &quot;citizen of the world&quot;. His is an unofficial description, but one that an elite class of super-rich people and multinational companies increasingly take for granted. Saverin&apos;s name stood out when the US government published its latest list of Americans who had renounced their citizenship. He is the co-founder of Facebook, owner of about 4% of the company; and with this week&apos;s public offering of shares, he is about to move from rich to super-rich. But apparently, not sufficiently rich. Despite his claim to the New York Times \u2013 an example of PR backfilling if ever there was one \u2013 it&apos;s blatantly obvious that taxes were deeply implicated in Saverin&apos;s move, which took place last year, but has only now been publicized. He&apos;s apparently paid some taxes on his windfall, based on a Facebook valuation from 2011 that is certainly much lower than the IPO price will be Friday; if he&apos;d stayed in the US and sold shares after the IPO, he&apos;d be required to pay capital gains taxes on the value at the time of the sale, which, based on prior speculation, is likely to be much higher than the offering price. Now, he&apos;s home free, because in Singapore, where he&apos;s spent much of his time during the past several years, there are no capital gains taxes. Perhaps the difference in capital gains and other taxes amounts to a mere $100m, as the Times suggested, or $600m \u2013 the latter based on the likely value of his shares this week (and on an assumption that he&apos;d sell them at once). To almost everyone, this is real money, even to someone who stands to have wealth in excess of $4bn. Saverin&apos;s self-serving move has drawn the contempt it deserves from a number of commentators, though much of the criticism has been inaccurate in some details. Farhad Manjoo&apos;s blog post, entitled &quot;What Eduardo Saverin Owes America (Hint: Nearly Everything)&quot;, is one such blast against the Brazilian native who now professes allegiance, sort of, to Singapore. Manjoo pointed out that Saverin would almost certainly be a nonentity had it not been for what he gained after his family&apos;s move to the US from his native land. Naturally, meanwhile, this new monument to selfishness is a hero to the crowd that loathes taxes in general, but especially progressive taxation. Saverin&apos;s case should be seen in context. Tax havens are not new. The super-rich have been relocating for decades. Increasingly, however, these people and any number of corporate entities are making it plain that they now belong to a new elite: a global class whose only serious obligation is to its own interests. And as beggar-thy-neighbor economic policies spread, these nomads can always find regimes that will cater to them. So, it is not remotely surprising that Apple, the most valuable company on the planet, is also a world-class tax avoider, as the New York Times reported recently. Apple is far from alone in using multinational operations and a variety of corporate fronts to reduce the taxes it pays, especially at home. But its strategies lend a certain hollowness to one of its slogans \u2013 that its products are proudly &quot;Designed by Apple in California&quot;, even if they&apos;re built in China. Like so many other global enterprises, Apple spends millions on lawyers and accountants whose sole job is to use various nations&apos; laws as gears in their own financial engines. It&apos;s pointless to suggest to the Apples and Severins of our world that they would never have achieved such heights of prosperity had it not been for, among many other things, America&apos;s economic and legal systems (among other benefits they&apos;ve enjoyed). Contrary to conservative dogma, the US has nurtured wealth creation. And our government, despite many misguided policies (including some tax policies), goes to extraordinary lengths to take care of the interests of the top 1% of the 1%. But why should the Apples and Severins care, when as &quot;global citizens&quot;, they can work the system and get more of what they want? Perhaps the rest of us should care. Not because these people and companies lack even a shred of loyalty to the nations that helped make them what they are. We should care because the rest of us, ultimately, bear the tax burdens the new global elite shirks. There&apos;s no easy way to do anything about this. But we should ask ourselves whether we&apos;re satisfied with a world where the global elite enjoys its special perks as it pursues wealth and power, but makes everyone else foot the bill."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/17/facebook-ipo-key-players", "sentences": ["Saverin spends most of his time in Singapore, and it recently emerged he has given up his US citizenship, though he has now insisted that this is not a tax avoiding move and he will pay the estimated $39m in US taxes on his windfall from the IPO."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-17T20:44:00Z", "title": "Facebook IPO: the key players and what they are worth", "tags": ["Facebook", "IPOs", "Technology", "Business", "Social media", "Internet IPOs", "Internet", "Technology startups", "Mark Zuckerberg"], "article": "Mark Zuckerberg, 28 Friday is probably the biggest day of Zuckerberg&apos;s career since he launched what was then The Facebook at Harvard in February 2004.

Fellow board member Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, has 20,000 unreleased shares but like Graham never dared to take a punt with his own cash. Zuckerberg&apos;s Harvard roommate Joe Green was one of the first to walk away from the company. He helped set up the network&apos;s predecessor FaceMash but decided to continue his studies instead of following his friend to California. Google, Yahoo! and US media giant Viacom were among the companies that failed to persuade Zuckerberg to sell. Even the $15bn offered by Microsoft in 2007 was rebuffed. The software giant does, however, have a small stake, worth a tidy $997m at the opening price."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/20/chinchon-ato-singapore", "sentences": ["The French-trained Chinchon, perfectly ridden by Olivier Doleuze, earned the biggest payday of his career at Kranji on Sunday when relishing ground softened by regular rain throughout the week to run away from a cosmopolitan field in the S$3m (\u00a31.4m) Singapore International Airlines Cup.", "A model of consistency who has not been out of the frame for over a year, the son of Royal Academy is a rarity in Singaporean racing in that he too is an entire."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-20T14:56:45Z", "title": "Chinchon and Ato win in Singapore as Krypton Factor loses power", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "The French-trained Chinchon, perfectly ridden by Olivier Doleuze, earned the biggest payday of his career at Kranji on Sunday when relishing ground softened by regular rain throughout the week to run away from a cosmopolitan field in the S$3m (\u00a31.4m) Singapore International Airlines Cup. Trained by Carlos Laffon-Parias, Chinchon had been heavily backed into second-favouritism at just under 5-1 He is a regular competitor on the international stage who was reckoned unlucky when finishing fifth in last year&apos;s SIA Cup. Chinchon put the record straight conclusively this time with an impressive three-length victory from the former British-trained Zaidan, now trained in Hong Kong by John Moore, and the local runner Flax. Zazou, representing the Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov, finished fourth. The other European runner, Dream Peace, finished eighth over the normally very fast 10 furlongs completed by the winner in a relatively sedate 2.04.3, with neither of the other two members of the Hong Kong trio, California Memory and Thumbs Up, able to make any impact in the straight. Godolphin&apos;s dismal run of luck since the Dubai World Cup meeting continued when the Mahmood al-Zarooni-trained City Style injured himself when rearing in the stalls and had to be withdrawn. It was a sad end to a carefully prepared Group One bid for what would have been Micka\u00ebl Barzalona&apos;s mount. Less than an hour earlier, the local sprinter Ato ran out a convincing 16-1 winner of the S$1m (\u00a3480,000) 6f Group One KrisFlyer Sprint. A model of consistency who has not been out of the frame for over a year, the son of Royal Academy is a rarity in Singaporean racing in that he too is an entire. He may well have earned himself a surprise stint at stud through this victory in his adopted country&apos;s major sprint. Ato provided huge compensation for his South African trainer Patrick Shaw and jockey Barend Vorster who had been expecting to take the race with local superstar Rocket Man, but found the comparatively modest Ato a more than able substitute. Ato beat another local, Mr Big, who had led into the straight and looked the likely winner before Ato emerged to cut him down and win going away by two lengths. Back in third and far from disgraced in his first attempt at coping with Oriental sprinters was the Jane Chapple-Hyam-trained Secret Asset, with another local, Captain Obvious, back in fourth. &quot;He ran an absolute cracker,&quot; said jockey George Baker of firm-ground performer Secret Asset. &quot;He had a lovely trip round the bend, then a gap opened for us and he kept on really well although the ground was softer than he&apos;d have liked.&quot; &quot;He ran a great race,&quot; said Chapple-Hyam. &quot;That was such a good effort in the conditions.&quot; The favourite Krypton Factor proved a serious disappointment as he failed to translate his Dubai Golden Shaheen form on Tapeta to the very different surface at Kranji. He kept on steadily but without anything resembling the kick that had taken him past Rocket Man at Meydan. &quot;I knew I was in trouble as soon as the gates opened&quot; said his rider, Kieren Fallon. &quot;In fact, I knew when it rained during the week.

The three buyers include BlackRock, an American multinational investment corporation. The deal cuts CVC&apos;s stake in Formula One from about 60% to 40%. The two other investors are the asset manager Waddell &amp; Reed and Norway&apos;s Norges Bank Investment Management, the asset management unit of the Norwegian central bank, known as Norges Bank. Whoever ends up owning Formula One will be unwilling to change what has been an outrageously successful product. But a management board could be formed with various teams being given seats on that board. It is unlikely, however, that the commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, will relinquish control, even though he will be 82 this year. Ecclestone has shown no sign that his appetite for the job is on the wane and \u2013 however strange some of his utterances have become \u2013 he remains a formidable deal-maker. The valuation of F1 at $7.5bn, however, is only as things stand. And without Mercedes, one of its biggest players, that would change substantially. Mercedes is the only major team not to have concluded a new Concorde Agreement and there has been speculation that they could walk away from F1 unless the matter is resolved. The Mercedes chief executive, Nick Fry, said during the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona this month: &quot;If CVC wish to float F1, I think they need this resolved fairly quickly \u2013 possibly more than we need it resolved. Discussions continue but progress is not as strong as I would like. &quot;F1 definitely would be much the poorer if Mercedes was not a participant and I am completely convinced in my mind that, if CVC wish to sell some or all of F1, the value they can derive from that would be severely diminished if Mercedes was not a participant.&quot; Meanwhile Lewis Hamilton has been told by his McLaren team principal that he deserves to win the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday. It would be his second F1 victory at the sport&apos;s most famous venue and, if he succeeds, it will be the first time six successive races have been won by different drivers. Hamilton, arguably, has been the best driver this year but has suffered misfortune in each of the opening five races of the campaign. Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team principal, said on Tuesday: &quot;Lewis is in that frame of mind and he deserves it [to win]. No doubt about it. So we have to work hard to make sure he has a good car, that we don&apos;t make any mistakes and he is in a position to fulfil his potential at a circuit where he would like to win again. &quot;We go into Monaco, somewhere where we&apos;ve been very strong, we&apos;ve won more grands prix there than anyone else, and we go there with the belief we can win. But anyone who makes predictions at the moment in this sport would be nuts. It is virtually impossible. &quot;Five races in, we&apos;ve had five different winners, five different constructors. After Monaco it could be six races, six different winners, but I hope not six different constructors. I hope we can take that one but we will see.&quot; McLaren are the most successful team in Monaco history, winning 15 grands prix there."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/may/24/schools-privately-financed-renovation-programme", "sentences": ["If you look across the worldat those countries that have successful education systems, yes, some of them are selective, like Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-24T13:56:54Z", "title": "Most schools miss out on privately financed renovation programme", "tags": ["Schools", "School building programme", "Private finance initiative", "Education", "Education policy", "Michael Gove", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Fewer than half of the schools that applied for renovation under the government&apos;s privately financed school building programme have been successful, it has been announced. The education secretary, Michael Gove, said just 261 schools out of 587 that applied would be rebuilt or refurbished under the \u00a32bn PFI scheme, despite widespread concern about the state of school buildings. A survey for the Observer revealed 39% of headteachers believed their school buildings were not fit for purpose, with complaints of overcrowding, leaking ceilings and poor ventilation. Gove admitted the manner in which he cancelled Labour&apos;s mammoth school building programme had been &quot;clumsy and insensitive&quot;. Within weeks of coming to power, the coalition scrapped the \u00a355bn Building Schools for the Future project, saying it was wasteful and bureaucratic. More than 700 school building projects were cancelled and Gove was forced to apologise after errors on a list of affected projects meant some schools thought their building work was going ahead when it had in fact been halted. Speaking on BBC Radio 4&apos;s The World at One on Thursday, Gove said: &quot;I think it was necessary to stop the Building Schools for the Future programme because it wasn&apos;t efficient, even if the way I made the announcement was clumsy \u2026 it was insensitive, and more than that, it left people in a state of uncertainty because they were led to believe by the previous government that schools desperately needed to be rebuilt and were left high and dry.&quot; The government announced the scheme to rebuild the most dilapidated schools, the Priority School Building Programme, last July. The deadline for applications was mid-October. The announcement of successful bids has been delayed for months, while a baby boom has put intense pressure on space in primary schools. An east London council is drawing up plans to convert an empty Woolworths store into a classroom and teach children in two shifts as part of emergency measures to cope with the rising number of primary age pupils. In a statement, Gove said rebuilding work would begin immediately and the new schools would be open in 2014. &quot;I recognise many of the schools that applied and have been unsuccessful will also have significant needs. Some will have their needs addressed through other funding we have made available for maintenance,&quot; he said. The government has commissioned a survey of the school estate which will detail the condition of every school in England by next autumn. There are 42 schools \u2013 those in the worst condition and all the special needs schools in the programme \u2013 that will be fast-tracked for urgent building work. Gove&apos;s statement added: &quot;I know many schools will be disappointed not to be included in the programme. We have had to take difficult decisions in order to target spending on those schools in the worst condition.&quot; PFI, which involves private contractors paying upfront for schools and hospital buildings, then leasing them back for up to 30 years, has become increasingly expensive since the financial crisis. Gove said the Department for Education was working with the Treasury to reform the PFI model and provide &quot;cost-effective and more transparent&quot; delivery of services. Under the school rebuilding scheme, schools will manage and control services such as cleaning, catering and security. Traditional PFI deals involve the automatic bundling of services such as cleaning into construction contracts. This has been criticised by the Treasury for failing to deliver value for money. Unions are concerned staff lose out on pay and conditions when such services are contracted out. Nusrat Faizullah, chief executive of the British Council for School Environments, an education charity, said: &quot;It&apos;s great to finally see some schools, at least, will be replaced or refurbished. &quot; It&apos;s also good to see that schools in the very worst condition will be fast-tracked.&quot; &quot;But this only is a beginning. Hundreds of schools have lost out after being told by the previous government their schools will be rebuilt; they too must have their building needs addressed.&quot; Steve Beechey, head of education at construction firm Wates, described the statement as &quot;light on the detail&quot; of how the new school buildings would be procured and the timeframes involved. &quot;Given that it typically takes at least two years from the time a decision is made to build a school until it is ready to open, it is essential that the government swiftly follows up today&apos;s announcement with more information on how it intends to prioritise projects for delivery.&quot; In the same interview, Gove denied the closure of grammar schools was responsible for a decline in social mobility. He said: &quot;Selection isn&apos;t a magic bullet. If you look across the worldat those countries that have successful education systems, yes, some of them are selective, like Singapore. Others, Finland, South Korea, Japan, aren&apos;t. &quot;So it&apos;s not the case that you need to have selection in order to have a successful education system which advances social mobility.&quot; He added the decline in social mobility had more to do with progressive teaching methods and softer subjects in state schools. &quot;In fact there were other changes occurring in education - a move away from traditional subjects rigorously taught in many cases. It would be wrong to look back at the 60s and 70s and say that the move away from grammar schools was the sole cause of adverse changes.&quot; The 200 schools are: Barking and Dagenham Eastbrook Comprehensive School Eastbury Comprehensive School Barnet Pardes House Primary School Birmingham Castle Vale Performing Arts College Hallmoor School Heathlands Junior and Infant School Kings Norton High School Plantsbrook School Turves Green Boys&apos;

Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  The Game: 1. This is intended to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too). 2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone&apos;s enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all. 4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 49 hours after publication.  The Rules: 1. Keep in mind that people live in zillions of different time zones, and some people are following on their smart phones. So let everyone play the game. Don&apos;t spoil it for everyone else by providing the bird&apos;s common or scientific names in the first 24 to 36 hours. 2. If you know the mystery bird&apos;s identity, answer the accompanying questions and provide subtle ID hints that may be helpful clues for less experienced players. Keep in mind that some hints, such as puns and anagrams, may read like &quot;inside jokes&quot; and thus, may discourage others from participating. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones. 4. Comments that spoil others&apos; enjoyment may be deleted. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

All eyes will be on F1&apos;s superstar drivers in Sunday&apos;s glamorous Monaco Grand Prix, but the deal makes their bosses the real winners as it will be the biggest single payment they have received from the sport. The Concorde Agreement commits the teams to race until the end of 2020, and getting them to agree to the contract has been a crucial part of billionaire F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s plans to float the business. &quot;It&apos;s a good deal for the teams, it&apos;s great,&quot; said Ecclestone. Around 30% of F1 will be listed. Private equity firm CVC, which took over F1 in a debt-financed buyout in 2006, will remain its controlling shareholder. Ecclestone, who owns 5.3% of F1, worth $530m, said he may increase his stake through the flotation (IPO). The present version of the Concorde Agreement expires at the end of the year but in March Ecclestone announced most of the teams had already committed themselves to the extended contract. A senior industry source said: &quot;There&apos;s some signing fees for the teams of around $180m.&quot; Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, the chairman of global food group Nestl\u00e9, will become F1&apos;s chairman and will be given an additional 0.2% of the business to add to the 0.3% he already holds for being one of its independent directors. Representatives from McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull will also join F1&apos;s board, providing the teams with a greater say than before. To tempt them further, Ecclestone has inserted clauses into the new contract which favour the best performing and most loyal teams. It convinced them to sign and the rest had little choice but to follow suit. The biggest risk to F1&apos;s finances would be the departure of the teams, but under the new deal, teams can only quit if their prize money fund falls substantially. Ferrari can only leave if there is a change of control and profits drop 25% over the next two years. Under the current deal the teams share 47.5% of F1&apos;s underlying profit, with Ferrari getting an additional 2.5%. &quot;The current deal pays the teams 50% plus some extras which means it pays them about 59%. The new deal is basically 60% plus a little bit more so it is going to be about 63%,&quot; says a person with knowledge of the IPO. The prize fund will stay at 47.5% but the top three teams from the past three years will get an additional 7.5%, which will come to a minimum of $100m. Ferrari will get a further 5% due its historic status. On average it means that every year &quot;the teams are going to get around $70m more,&quot; said Ecclestone. In 2011 the teams received $686m in prize money as F1&apos;s underlying profits came to $1.17bn on turnover which had grown 6% to $1.5bn. The new agreement will also allow Ecclestone to set up more races. There is currently a limit of 20, which has been reached this year. However, the F1 boss said under the new deal &quot;we have flexibility to go beyond 20 races. We have got four or five places waiting to do something.&quot; More races would provide a substantial boost to F1&apos;s revenue. Its biggest single revenue source is the fees from race promoters \u2013 who pay their hosting fees months in advance. More events would also boost income from trackside advertising and corporate hospitality. Ecclestone said that over the next few years F1 was likely to increase its calendar to 22 or 23 races. Since 2003, F1&apos;s revenues have grown 10% every year on average and the business has a very low level of capital expenditure. It is understood to invest under $10m annually and, outside the team prize money, total costs last year came to around $350m. F1 only employs just over 300 staff with their total pay coming to approximately $50m."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/may/25/short-term-home-letting", "sentences": ["&quot;It is a\u00a0bit of a\u00a0double life, but it does make you appreciate home.&quot; The overnight guests Alison and Tristan Pocock have played host to a trombone-playing physiotherapist from Sydney, a Sudanese-Russian doctor and a die-hard Manchester United fan from Singapore, among others, in their Victorian terrace in Trafford, Manchester."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-25T21:59:37Z", "title": "Cash in the attic: short-term home letting", "tags": ["Homes", "Life and style", "Renting property", "Property", "Money"], "article": "Sharing your home with\u00a0a\u00a0stranger on a\u00a0permanent basis is a\u00a0big\u00a0commitment.

An increasingly mobile workforce, and a continuing enthusiasm for &quot;real&quot; travel experiences, are both contributing to the growing demand for short-term lodgings \u2013 be that a\u00a0weekend away in a new city, a holiday in a &quot;real&quot; home, or a\u00a0Monday to Friday home-away-from-home. But if it&apos;s your own property, how does it work? What\u00a0are the logistics, is the bother worth the money, how do you go\u00a0about finding tenants \u2013 and, above all, how does it feel to have a\u00a0new face at the breakfast table? We\u00a0ask three homeowners who have\u00a0tried it out. The holiday let Anita Klein and her husband Nigel\u00a0Swift, both artists, live in a\u00a0sought-after apartment in London&apos;s Barbican. The building is\u00a0a\u00a0spiritual centre for lovers of British brutalism, and the couple&apos;s home reflects its modern lines, with extra-wide oak floorboards, white walls, Eames&apos; chairs and lime-green sofas. The pair have lived\u00a0here for two years, after selling their south London, Victorian family home and all their possessions when their children moved out. Since last summer they&apos;ve let their flat to visitors to London through One Fine\u00a0Stay. &quot;We did a lot of home exchanges when the kids were little, so the idea of having strangers living here doesn&apos;t bother me,&quot; Klein says. Both she and Swift were motivated to join One Fine Stay by the fact that, being self-employed, they&apos;d &quot;finally earn some holiday pay. It&apos;s nice to go away and get paid for it. The house would be standing empty anyway&quot;. The selling point, Klein says, is that the company does all the hard work.\u00a0&quot;I tidy up a bit before we leave, put important documents away, but they clean, provide linen\u00a0and bathroom products, and pack our things away to give guests a bit of space in the wardrobe. They put it all back before we get home and usually leave it cleaner than when we left.&quot; The couple had several guests while they were away for a month last summer, and made around \u00a31,500. One Fine Stay charges \u00a3189 a\u00a0night for the apartment and takes a\u00a0commission. &quot;We could make more if we let it ourselves, but I\u00a0already run my own business and I don&apos;t want the hassle,&quot; Klein says. &quot;This way, the booking, money and any issues are taken care of.&quot; The weekday lodger     Eileen Flinter (seated) and her Monday-to-Friday lodger, Gill Jones.     When Eileen Flinter&apos;s daughter went to university four years ago, she decided to rent out the empty bedroom in her west London home to a professional during the week. &quot;I&apos;m widowed and don&apos;t have a big family, and decided I\u00a0didn&apos;t want to live alone the whole time,&quot; she says. &quot;But I didn&apos;t want a\u00a0permanent lodger either, as it would feel like my home wasn&apos;t mine any more. This way, you&apos;re getting someone with a\u00a0house and a\u00a0life somewhere else.&quot; Flinter has had two long-term tenants, found through mondaytofriday.com: a contractor from Ipswich who stayed whenever his work brought him to London, and her current lodger, Gill Jones, an insurance broker. Jones was made redundant from her job in Norwich. There were no similar jobs in her home area, but she found one in London. &quot;Commuting wasn&apos;t feasible,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s not just the cost but the stress, too.&quot; Flinter provides bedding and towels, and earns \u00a3330 a month tax-free (so long as it&apos;s less than \u00a34,250 annually, you won&apos;t pay tax on the income). &quot;It&apos;s nice to have the extra money and a bit of company. It&apos;s handy if I go away, too \u2013 the house isn&apos;t standing empty and someone will feed the dog. We get on well. We sometimes eat together, or go to the cinema, but we don&apos;t intrude on each other&apos;s lives.&quot; For Jones, living part-time in someone else&apos;s home is less isolating\u00a0than a hotel. &quot;It is a\u00a0bit of a\u00a0double life, but it does make you appreciate home.&quot; The overnight guests Alison and Tristan Pocock have played host to a trombone-playing physiotherapist from Sydney, a Sudanese-Russian doctor and a die-hard Manchester United fan from Singapore, among others, in their Victorian terrace in Trafford, Manchester. They rent out the large spare room on their top floor for \u00a330 a night. &quot;It makes life more interesting,&quot; Alison says. Visitors stay for up to four nights.\u00a0Unlike a B&amp;B, the couple gets\u00a0to choose who stays, for how long, and how often. In the past three months, they&apos;ve had five people over 10 nights. Guests use the main bathroom, and help themselves to breakfast. Alison and Tristan supply fresh linen, and tea and coffee. &quot;I always offer to collect people from the station, too,&quot; Alison says. &quot;It&apos;s important to make sure the house is\u00a0clean and tidy, but you don&apos;t need\u00a0to pack stuff away or change your behaviour. People are staying with you because they want to meet\u00a0real people and see you how live. I was a bit hesitant to start with, but so far our guests have been\u00a0an\u00a0eclectic mix.&quot; She prefers the arrangement, run through AirBnB, to having a full-time lodger. &quot;It&apos;s less intrusive. People stay for only a few days, so if they get on your nerves they&apos;re always gone quite quickly.&quot; The practicalities 1 Ensure your agent has suitable liability insurance and that your contract does not leave you exposed if something goes wrong. It&apos;s worth having it checked by a solicitor. 2 Subletting your property may be forbidden under the terms of your mortgage \u2013 check with your provider. And check if your contents insurance is still valid. 3 Any rental income is subject to tax: if it&apos;s a room you&apos;re renting out, you can earn up to \u00a34,250 tax-free. Letting your entire house is different from the government&apos;s Rent A Room scheme, and the onus is on the owner to declare any income through self-assessment. On the upside, there are some allowable expenses (direct.gov.uk). 4 Apply (annually) for a Gas Safety Certificate, around \u00a365. 5 Check with your lettings company what additional charges there are \u2013 photography of the property is included with AirBnB, but is an\u00a0additional cost with One Fine Stay, for example. 6 Get spare keys cut (One Fine Stay asks for seven sets)."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/26/england-west-indies-live-obo", "sentences": ["My wife is about to fly home from Paris, where she has been on a conference, to Singapore, where we live.", "I&apos;ll explain when I land.&quot;  Your mission, in the 13 hours she will be in the air, is to figure out what the hell she can possibly have done to link Singapore Airlines, a skateboard, a tantrum and Nicole Kidman."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-26T17:13:00Z", "title": "England v West Indies \u2013 as it happened | Rob Smyth and Rob Bagchi", "tags": ["England v West Indies 2012", "England cricket team", "West Indies cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": " Preamble Morning. The trouble with good schtick is that it won&apos;t be your schtick for long. It&apos;ll either be copied or reinterpreted for purposes of uniform individuality. Remember the slew of imitations after Scream and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, look at this sartorial travesty, or consider that sales of toothpicks have gone up 4719 per cent in a post-Drive world. Sometimes the tributes are more worthwhile. At Trent Bridge yesterday, West Indies did unto England what England have being doing unto the world for the last two years: they punished a tiring, angsty attack in the final session of a long, hot day with an ultra-aggressive lower-order partnership. It was brilliant stuff from Marlon Samuels and Darren Sammy, and it has given this second Test a considerable makeover. What was shaping up as a routine England win is now something far more interesting. England will rightly feel they can score 500 on this pitch, but scoreboard pressure can do funny things to men. If West Indies are still batting at lunch, all bets are off.  The final word on shorts comes from New York. &quot;I am gutted to have missed this morning&apos;s fashion debate on the OBO,&quot; wrote Hadley Freeman last night. &quot;It is literally America&apos;s fault as that is where I am at the moment and America is perverse enough to insist on having a different time zone. America - tchuh! &quot;Yes to shorts! I don&apos;t know why so many British men fear shorts but embrace 3/4 length trousers which are clearly evil, wrong and possibly the source of all woes. Shorts - as long as they are not too short, mind - are very smart. They should, however, never be worn with a tie (whoever heard of such a godforsaken combination?) and I personally think the best shoes to pair them with are deck shoes, ideally in a navy colour. &quot;Incidentally, while it may be hot and sunny everywhere else in the world, it is raining in New York today and will continue to do so for the next seven days. So thanks for rubbing it in, OBO.&quot;  91st over: West Indies 305-6 (Samuels 108, Sammy 88) The first half an hour really is vital. The new ball is only 10 overs old, and England will feel one wicket can bring four. But West Indies will feel that if these two get their eye in again they should reach 400. &quot;Patience is the key for England,&quot; says Shane Warne. &quot;Just build up some pressure.&quot; Jimmy Anderson starts with an accurate over, just one from it.  &quot;I probably won&apos;t be awake for the start,&quot; says Simon Brereton, &quot;although I imagine Suzy will - even though she&apos;s in Atlanta for a international woman&apos;s T20 tournament. Yes, my girlfriend is now playing cricket in tournaments. I&apos;m officially a cricket widower. Anyway, she&apos;s nervous, so I was hoping you could wish her luck and a few wickets.&quot; Good luck, Suzy!! Break a leg stump.  92nd over: West Indies 305-6 (Samuels 108, Sammy 88) &quot;We&apos;ve seen enough,&quot; says Bumble on Sky of what looks like a belting pitch. &quot;If you don&apos;t make mistakes you can book in. Just bat.&quot; Samuels is trying to do just that. He has started again as if on nought and leaves a number of deliveries from Broad in that over. A maiden. &quot;Was Drive really that good though?&quot; says the OBO&apos;s resident cinephile Phil Podolsky. &quot;All this silent understatement is but the flipside of mawkishness, and the white jacket betrayed a lack of irony even before it got adopted by the idiots. Carey Mulligan? Nah. I liked the violent bits though.&quot; I thought it was brilliant, the most stylish film I&apos;d seen in years, although I am relatively simple folk. Has anyone seen The Driver? Any good? I must watch that.  93rd over: West Indies 305-6 (Samuels 108, Sammy 88) There was an interesting tweet (yes, I thought that was an oxymoron too, but apparently not) from Kevin Pietersen this morning: &quot;I am feeling every single one of the 11649 days I&apos;ve been alive this am!!&quot; Imagine how the bowlers feel, not just because of yesterday but also their workout at Lord&apos;s. Sky have just shown Jimmy Anderson&apos;s morning warm-up, which involved no bowling whatsoever, not much activity and a bit of pill-popping (anti-inflammatories, presumably). There&apos;s nothing happening for the fast bowlers at the moment, and Bumble and Shane Warne on Sky reckon England should turn to Graeme Swann. Sammy defends carefully against Anderson, and it&apos;s another maiden. West Indies have an outstanding chance to post a big score here.  94th over: West Indies 307-6 (Samuels 109, Sammy 89) Sammy flicks Broad for a single to move within 11 of his first Test century and only his second first-class century. England seem strangely flat in the field, as if they&apos;ve all just heard that One Direction have split up. &quot;One of the things about women and cricket (91st over) is, as revealed by Aggers&apos;s wife ironing shirts first thing in the morning, is that they are so organised,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;In past OBOs we&apos;ve had several instances of them planning, properly, how to enjoy themselves at a match e.g. exact ingredients for a picnic hamper. Unlike men whose planning seems to extend only to smuggling booze or group fancy dress.&quot;  95th over: West Indies 312-6 (Samuels 109, Sammy 94) The first attacking shot of the day comes from Sammy, who drills Anderson delightfully wide of mid off for four. He does play some gorgeous strokes, especially for a No8. Anderson&apos;s response is a big leg cutter that beats the edge.  96th over: West Indies 320-6 (Samuels 109, Sammy 102) Darren Sammy has made his maiden Test century! He was on 94 when he edged consecutive deliveries from Broad over backward point for four to move to 102. Don&apos;t let those moments of fortune obscure what has been a sparkling innings. There is no extravagant celebration, just a warm smile, a proud raise of the bat and a kiss of the helmet. This is such a lovely moment for a dignified man who has had to put up with a lot of criticism in recent times. It&apos;s also perhaps the strangest way somebody has reached a maiden Test hundred since Michael Vaughan got there with four overthrows against Pakistan 11 years ago.  97th over: West Indies 325-6 (Samuels 114, Sammy 102) Samuels steers Anderson through the slip cordon for four more and is then beaten by a full-length beauty as he attemps to drive on the walk. Anderson&apos;s got the face on! &quot;He&apos;s gone a bit McGrath here...&quot; chuckles Bumble. Aleem Dar had a word with Anderson at the end of the over.  98th over: West Indies 326-6 (Samuels 115, Sammy 102) It isn&apos;t happening for England this morning. Get Mallender on. &quot;Sammy&apos;s hundred is the first by a lower-order batsman (Nos 8-11) against England since Anil Kumble five years ago. Here&apos;s the full list, all 22 of them.  &quot;Did we do shout outs on the OBO, I&apos;m not sure, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen one?&quot; says Sean Boiling. &quot;Anyway, I just got a text message from my sister who&apos;s settling into her seat at Trent Bridge for her first ever day of Test cricket (or at least I think it&apos;s her first day and she is my sister). So how about a big shout out to Sarah? Just a shame she&apos;ll only see four wickets today.&quot; I have no problem with the idea of a shout out \u2013 have fun Sarah! \u2013\u00a0but the actual phrase &apos;shout out&apos;? Oof.  99th over: West Indies 331-6 (Samuels 115, Sammy 102) Tim Bresnan is going to replace Angry Anderson. His first ball swings away for four leg byes, and then there&apos;s a half-arsed shout for a catch down the leg side against Sammy. It just clipped the pad. &quot;When was the last time England had to bowl to two West Indian batsmen both of whom had scored more than 100 runs?&quot; wonders Peter Walker. I assume it happened at least a couple of times during that disgusting orgy of runs in 2008-09.  100th over: West Indies 336-6 (Samuels 115, Sammy 102) Four more leg byes, this time off the bowling of Broad. A no-ball brings up the 200 partnership, a stunning effort from Samuels and Sammy. They are 35 away from the highest seventh-wicket partnership ever made against England. &quot;West Indies they are currently 330 for six, Sammy has just got his century against probably the best bowling attack in Test cricket, the pitch is continuously drying out, and starting to have some variable bounce,&quot; tubthumps Matt Share. Kemar Roach would get in the England team, Shillingford is no mug at all, we will probably end up batting on a tricky day five pitch. I have a sneaky feeling for the Windies here. Not even sneaky \u2013 they are in the driving seat.&quot;  I wouldn&apos;t go that far \u2013 England will still expect to get a first-innings lead \u2013 but this is a very interesting game now. As the chaps on Sky have just said, Trent Bridge can get uneven on the last two days (remember James Kirtley torpedoing South Africa in 2003?), and that should certainly happen in this heat.  WICKET! West Indies 340-7 (Sammy c Pietersen b Bresnan 106) If you need a wicket, if the pitch is dead and nothing is happening, give the ball to Tim Bresnan. He has made a vital breakthrough with a good bouncer that Sammy pulled straight down the throat of Pietersen at deep square leg It was too wide for Sammy to be able to control the shot. He walks off to a standing ovation after a brilliant, swashbuckling innings: 106 off 156 balls, with 17 fours and a six, and a record seventh-wicket partnership of 204.  101st over: West Indies 340-7 (Samuels 116, Roach 0) &quot;Good morning Rob,&quot; says Chris Wright. &quot;I need the help of you and your readers. My wife is about to fly home from Paris, where she has been on a conference, to Singapore, where we live. She just sent this message:  &quot;Massive drama getting on board. I was in the middle of a fullblown tantrum about a skateboard when I was saved by Nicole Kidman... hang on, I&apos;m taking off. I&apos;ll explain when I land.&quot;  Your mission, in the 13 hours she will be in the air, is to figure out what the hell she can possibly have done to link Singapore Airlines, a skateboard, a tantrum and Nicole Kidman. Thanks.&quot;  102nd over: West Indies 341-7 (Samuels 117, Roach 0) Roach misses a windy woof at Broad. Pietersen is having a few words with Samuels. It doesn&apos;t look like BANTZ\u2122, at least not on Pietersen&apos;s side. I can&apos;t wait to see Pietersen&apos;s innings today. You wouldn&apos;t like (to bowl to) him when he&apos;s angry. &quot;Nice one Rob, thank you!&quot; says Sean Boiling. &quot;They are totes called shout outs aren&apos;t they? Aren&apos;t they?&quot; Stop it, or I&apos;ll totes do a Falling Down.  WICKET! West Indies 341-8 (Samuels c Anderson b Bresnan 117) Samuels has gone. The departure of Sammy affected him, and even though there were three wickets remaining he started playing in one-day mode. When Bresnan sent down a full inswinger, Samuels edged a big flash to Anderson at gully. He also walks off to a standing ovation; quite right too.  103rd over: West Indies 342-8 (Roach 0, Shillingford 1) &quot;First day being able to watch cricket this year and first thing said to me...in my own house...it&apos;s a bit weird that a lady likes cricket isn&apos;t it,&quot; says Lori McConnachie. &quot;Is it?&quot; No. Hope this helps.  104th over: West Indies 351-8 (Roach 6, Shillingford 4) Swann drops Roach at second slip. It was a difficult low chance off the bowling of Broad, although Swann would probably take it eight times out of 10. Roach pours some bleach in the wound with a glorious cover drive for four. That was the shot of a top-order batsman. That don&apos;t impress Broad much, and the next ball is a superb bouncer that thuds into side of the helmet. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen The Driver, but it&apos;s by Walter Hill so it will be good,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Like William H Macy, Walter Hill is one of those names who, if you mention them to the average Joe in the street they&apos;ll have no idea who you&apos;re talking about but mention them to a film lover and a smile of warm appreciation will spread over their features.&quot;  105th over: West Indies 355-8 (Roach 7, Shillingford 7) Shillingford morphs into Richard Ord, kicking the ball away just before it bounces back onto his off stump. As football/cricket mash-ups go, it wasn&apos;t quite up there with this piece of genius. Then Shillingford misses an almighty drive at a wider delivery. &quot;Morning Smyth, morning everybody,&quot; says Josh Robinson. &quot;Please inform John Starbuck (94th over) that the nine-course picnic I prepared for the first day of the Oval Test last summer (yes, the one where only about 20 overs were possible due to rain), a picnic that involved among other things brandade de morue, a shooter&apos;s sandwich and a dundee cake that had been fed with booze for several months, was planned over about six months. Planning how to get booze into the ground, in contrast, took no longer than replacing a quarter of a carton of tomato juice with vodka and adding the right combination of spices.&quot; Modern masculinity: discuss. I wonder if Gary Cooper ever prepared a nine-course picnic.  106th over: West Indies 355-8 (Roach 7, Shillingford 7) Anderson comes on for Broad and digs in a superb bouncer that Roach gloves just short of gully. &quot;Darren Sammy played at the same club Sam and I played at,&quot; says Jarrod Kimber, &quot;but not at the same time, and I&apos;ve never talked to him even though I am a massive fan of the shape of his head.&quot; All of which is an endearing and almost entirely unnecessary preamble to the bit where we link to the latest episode of The Two Chucks.  WICKET! West Indies 360-9 (Roach c Strauss b Bresnan 11) Another one for Bresnan, his fourth of the innings.  Shillingforth  Roach edged a shortish delivery low to first slip, where Strauss took a smart two-handed catch to his right.  107th over: West Indies 360-9 (Shillingford 12, Rampaul 0) This has been such a good spell from Bresnan, because West Indies could easily be 380 for six on this pitch. &quot;I do hope Darren Sammy becomes a specialist No8 \u2013 such a pivotal slot in the order,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Of course, the paradox is that if he does become a specialist No8, he&apos;ll probably bat at six, (or, in this West Indies team, maybe three). Cricket \u2013 I understand that it&apos;s a funny old game.&quot; Who told you that goddamn lie?  108th over: West Indies 364-9 (Shillingford 16, Rampaul 0) Shillingford clumps Anderson wide of mid off for four. &quot;Splendid moment on TMS just now,&quot; says John Leavey. &quot;Viv was talking about playing a Test the day after he got married. Aggers&apos; response: &apos;Did you get any? Runs I mean&apos;.&quot;  109th over: West Indies 370-9 (Shillingford 16, Rampaul 6) Rampaul misses a big swish at a short delivery at Bresnan and then squirts a drive wide of gully for four. &quot;So where are all those nay-sayers who said Finn should be bowling?&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;Bresnan&apos;s not doing badly is he?&quot; I&apos;m not sure a little burst of wickets changes anything. Some people prefer Finn, others prefer Bresnan, and there are compelling arguments in favour of both men. In a few years&apos; time it&apos;ll be largely irrelevant as we&apos;ll have full squad rotation. And although Finn has to wait his turn, at least he won&apos;t end up like poor Stuart Law.  WICKET! West Indies 370 all out (Shillingford st Prior b Swann 16) Graeme Swann ends the innings, and again takes a wicket in the first over of a new spell. Shillingford charged down the track to a wider delivery, angled across him from around the wicket, and completely missed it. Matt Prior did the necessary with a sharp stumping. West Indies are all out for 370, a brilliant recovery from 136 for six. See you in a few minutes for the England innings.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: England 1-0 (Strauss 0, Cook 0) There are 20 minutes to lunch, which we&apos;re contractually obliged to call &quot;a tricky little mini-session for England&quot;. Roach bounced Strauss out at Lord&apos;s and starts with a few short balls here, one of which smacks Strauss in the stomach. &quot;The Driver is a must-see,&quot; says David Kimber, &quot;especially Ryan O&apos;Neal&apos;s &apos;audition&apos; in the car park as he systematically demolishes his prospective employers&apos; car.&quot; Please don&apos;t use the word &apos;audition&apos; when discussing cinema, at least not on a nice day like today. Kiri kiri kiri!  2nd over: England 2-0 (Strauss 0, Cook 1) Ravi Rampaul will share the new ball. He&apos;s a decent bowler this chap, especially if the ball is moving, although there are slight concerns over his fitness. His first over is not the best \u2013 a few deliveries too wide or too short to make Cook play, and a dead ball that slips out of his hand halfway through his bowling action. &quot;I&apos;m going to the Test on Monday with Josh Robinson,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;My idea of a picnic is a few peanut butter sandwiches and a packet of Seabrooks salt and vinegar. I dont&apos; even know what a brandade de morue is. I fear I may be outclassed.&quot;  COOK IS CAUGHT OFF A NO-BALL! England 3-0 (Cook not out 1) What a start for the West Indies! Dinesh Ramdin has taken a sensational catch to get rid of Alastair Cook. Or has he? Aleem Dar wants to check the no-ball just in case ... and it was a no-ball! Cook survives! There was always a danger this would happen, because Roach bowled nearly 20 no-balls at Lord&apos;s and started with one in his first over here. The delivery was full and drew Cook into a defensive push before taking the edge. Ramdin, diving low in front of first slip, took a stunning one-handed catch. It was a moment of futile brilliance.  3rd over: England 4-0 (Strauss 0, Cook 2) &quot;Re: Chris Wright, 101st over,&quot; begins Sean Boiling. &quot;Hmm, it&apos;s not exactly skateboard but Nicole Kidman was in &apos;BMX Bandits&apos;. Maybe that helped? If it&apos;s not BMX I&apos;m going with Chris&apos;s wife donning a false nose a la &apos;our&apos; Nicole doing Virginia Woolf in &apos;The Hours&apos; and sorting her check-in dramas using her acting.&quot;  4th over: England 4-0 (Strauss 0, Cook 2) Ramdin saves four bye with a smart claim down the leg side off Rampaul. A maiden, and we&apos;ll have time for one more over before lunch.  5th over: England 8-0 (Strauss 4, Cook 2) Strauss slaps Roach over gully for four to get off the mark. It was in the air but flew off the bat. That&apos;s lunch, and West Indies walk off with the slight dejection of men who fear they have let the tortoise get away from them. They are still in a decent position, though, and it should be an interesting afternoon session. See you in half an hour.  LUNCH  Lunchtime treat I bloody adore Robin Smith. This is all.  6th over: England 12-0 (Strauss 4, Cook 6) Strauss and Cook have surprisingly modest records on this ground. Strauss averages 25 in Tests, Cook averages 14. In fact, Matt Prior is the only man in England&apos;s top seven who averages 40 here \u2013 and even his average is precisely 40.00. Cook improves his Trent Bridge average a wee bit with a square cut for four off Ravi Rampaul, and then he is beaten by a beauty. &quot;So Geoffrey Boycott in particular has been laying into Roach for the no-ball that gave Cook a life,&quot; says Patrick McGovern. &quot;It certainly affects the attitudes of the batsman and fielders, but I don&apos;t see how it&apos;s any worse than a dropped catch. In fact a drop is far worse, as there you have a chance created which is spurned. In the case of the no-ball there is technically no chance in the first place. Unless you&apos;re going to chastise Roach for every no-ball he bowls (and I realise there&apos;s a more important issue in that he does bowl a lot of them) it doesn&apos;t make much sense to do so for one that happens to get an edge.&quot;  7th over: England 12-0 (Strauss 4, Cook 6) Strauss and Cook are 35 runs away from becoming the fifth pair \u2013 and the first English pair \u2013 to add 5000 runs in Tests. No runs in that over, a maiden from Roach to Strauss.  8th over: England 14-0 (Strauss 4, Cook 7) It&apos;s all gone quiet. The crowd aren&apos;t drunk yet, and the England openers are, as usual, building their innings slowly. Just a single from Rampaul&apos;s over.&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; says James Mansfield. &quot;I&apos;m just about to embark on a road trip from London to Scotland, via Hull. The purpose is to reunite my Wisden collection: in London I have 2002-2009 as well as my grandfather&apos;s collection from the 60s and 70s. In my parents&apos; house I have 1991-2001, the bad old years, as I remember from being a teenager. Will be celebrating on Sunday with a pink gin. Oh, and I&apos;m going on just A-roads as the motorways are boring! Any other readers taken their Wisdens on a similar jaunt?&quot; That was the real point of Burroughs&apos; book, right? &apos;Drugs&apos; indeed. We all know that moreish yellow tome is the biggest drug of all.  9th over: England 14-0 (Strauss 4, Cook 8) Strauss is beaten, pushing at a good one from Roach. I like Roach&apos;s reaction when he beats the bat. No bristle and bullshit, he just spins on his heels and walks back to his mark. He&apos;s still getting dangerously close to the line, mind, and a couple of deliveries in that over could have been no-balled.  10th over: England 18-0 (Strauss 4, Cook 12) A short ball from Rampaul is blootered through midwicket for four by Cook, who is such a strong puller. Cook was on 1 when he was caught off that no-ball by Ramdin. Every run he scores will surely make West Indies think of this epic meditation on parallel universes.  COOK IS CAUGHT OFF A NO-BALL AGAIN! This is crazy. Cook edges Roach to the keeper, but Aleem Dar calls &apos;no-ball&apos; even before the ball is in Ramdin&apos;s gloves. Roach skulks back shamefaced to his mark.  11th over: England 22-0 (Strauss 5, Cook 13) So, to recap: Alastair Cook made 1 in his first innings, 11 in his second, and is 1 not out in his third. Two balls later Roach bowls another no-ball. This brings to mind Steve Harmison&apos;s attack of the yips at Perth (?) in 2002-03. He has completely lost his run up. &quot;He&apos;s gone&quot; says Mikey Holding on Sky.  &quot;Is it me or is Ravi Rampaul a good deal chunkier than last time he played a Test in England?&quot; says James Brown. &quot;There&apos;s more than a hint of Ian Austin about him now, as he reaches the crease.&quot; He is, yeah. He hasn&apos;t been able to train much for the last few months.  12th over: England 27-0 (Strauss 9, Cook 14) An inside edge stops Cook from being plumb LBW to Rampaul, and then Strauss plays a stunning extra cover drive for four. &quot;Is there a reason for the England batsmen having such low averages here in Nottingham?&quot; says Duncan Smith. &quot;Does it reflect in us losing more? It certainly seems like a decent batting strip.&quot; In short, swing. (And beastly turn from Murali in 2006, and mindtrickery from Warne in 2005.) It doesn&apos;t reflect England losing more \u2013 they&apos;ve won six of the last eight here I think, and have certainly won the last three by huge margins.  13th over: England 33-0 (Strauss 9, Cook 18) Roach&apos;s meltdown continues. He&apos;s strong mentally and won&apos;t duck a challenge, but this is a terrifying test for a young fast bowler \u2013 ten times worse than being smacked round the park. You have to feel for the kid. His seventh over includes two more no-balls, the second of which is square cut viciously for four by Cook. Darren Sammy surely has to take him out of the attack. &quot;Asad Rauf and Aleem Dar are very, very good at their jobs aren&apos;t they?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;It&apos;s not just the decisions, it&apos;s the way they make them, the way they create an appropriate atmosphere for Test cricket and the way they express authority without ego. Are there better officials anywhere in sport?&quot; Yes, that&apos;s a very good point. Aleem Dar, in particular, is outrageously good. And you wouldn&apos;t catch him or Asad Rauf doing this. There&apos;s one on the elite umpire who might, but he is also an exceptional decision-maker.  14th over: England 36-0 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 11, Cook 19) Strauss pushes Rampaul towards extra cover, where Shillingford does well to save a probable boundary.  15th over: England 37-0 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 12, Cook 19) Darren Sammy puts Roach out of his misery by bringing himself into the attack. His first over is so uneventful that it could have been an episode of The Wire. &quot;I&apos;m sure the lethargic cricket is not helping you maintain interest in OBO Towers when everyone else is no doubt enjoying fizzy disco juice in the sunshine,&quot; says Chris Langmead. &quot;Me? I&apos;m in the process of sorting our house before we move to Melbourne in two weeks, so my summer will be the sunshine we&apos;re getting now. We&apos;ll be leaving in the eastern suburbs \u2013 can any readers recommend cricket or running clubs in the area? I&apos;m looking to share my brand of flighted filth and wheezy jogging with our Australian cousins.&quot;  16th over: England 37-0 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 12, Cook 19) The new ball hasn&apos;t moved for Rampaul, but he&apos;s been pretty accurate after that sluggish first over. That&apos;s a maiden to Strauss, and his figures now are 8-2-18-0.  &quot;As you&apos;re receiving requests, I&apos;ll put one out there,&quot; says Rebecca Heller. &quot;Anyone in Edinburgh planning on watching the cricket this summer, and if so, where? And would you like company?&quot; I hear wedding bells ...  17th over: England 38-0 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 12, Cook 20) &quot;A cheeky stat for you,&quot; says Chris Wright. &quot;If Strauss gets to 17 he will pass Thorpe and enter the top 10 Test run scorers for England. Very possibly to be knocked out of it again by Kevin Pietersen later this innings.&quot;  WICKET! England 43-1 (Cook c Ramdin b Rampaul 24) Three strikes and you&apos;re out. After those two let-offs against Roach, Alastair Cook thin-edges a good delivery from Rampaul through to Ramdin. It was a perfect length and moved away enough to take the edge as Cook fiddled defensively around off stump.  18th over: England 47-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 12, Trott 0) &quot;Had Roach not overstepped for those no balls would there have been any difference in the flight of the ball?&quot; says Lorraine Reese. &quot;Enough for Cook to have hit them differently and therefore not been caught? In other words, no missed opportunity at all?&quot; I doubt it, because it&apos;s only a matter of millimetres with some no-balls. It&apos;s not like he was this far over the line. Actually, maybe that&apos;s a way to stop no-balls: get Walter Sobchak to scream &quot;OVER THE LINE!&quot; and threaten to shoot bowlers who overstep.  19th over: England 51-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 16, Trott 0) A lovely back-foot drive for four by Strauss off Sammy takes England past 50. Here&apos;s Cook&apos;s Test record at Trent Bridge by the way: he averages 15.20 from 10 innings.  20th over: England 55-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 18, Trott 0) So much for not being fit. Rampaul&apos;s spell continues into a tenth over and he almost picks up the wicket of Trott, who gloves a good short ball just short of the keeper Ramdin. At least I think he gloved it; we haven&apos;t seen a replay yet. &quot;What&apos;s the worst bowling yips you&apos;ve seen?&quot; says Mark Hooper. &quot;I witnessed Scott Boswell&apos;s 14-ball over at the 2001 C&amp;G final live. To start with the Somerset crowd was all beery (cidery?) jeers, by the end there was just an embarassed silence, poor fella.&quot; That was horrible. I didn&apos;t see it live \u2013 it was the morning after my first ever Cricket Writers&apos; Dinner, from memory, so I wasn&apos;t in a perky mood for cricket-watching that hour/day \u2013 so the worst would probably be Harmison losing his run-up in 2002-03. He showed a lot of character then.  21st over: England 59-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 18, Trott 4) Trott gets off the mark with a pristine cover-driven four off Sammy. &quot;I think Lorraine Reese has a valid point about Roach&apos;s no balls,&quot; says Albert Freeman. &quot;Yes it&apos;s only a matter of millimetres with the bowler&apos;s foot, but it&apos;s often also only a matter of millimetres that dictate whether a batsman finds an edge, and if he does, where the ball ends up.&quot; Maybe. I&apos;m not convinced, although I have no scientific or mathematical basis for that lack of conviction.  22nd over: England 61-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 20, Trott 4) Strauss is beaten by a storming delivery from Rampaul, very full and seaming past Strauss&apos;s attempted drive. That&apos;s eleven overs on the spin for Rampaul, which is an admirable spell in this heat, especially for a man who hasn&apos;t played for a ges.  23rd over: England 63-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 20, Trott 6) &quot;Please let Chris Langmead know that the best jogging track in Melbourne is situated in the Botanical Gardens, not five minutes from the city,&quot; says Neill Brown. &quot;I&apos;d be more than happy to start a running club with him, as long as he accepts that the pubs in the surrounding area are too good to resist for an amateur sportsman and therefore good work can (and will be) instantly undone. Regardless of personal physical fitness, Melbourne may just be one of the top five cities in the world to watch sport in. Welcome to sport nirvana, Chris. Two words: THE MCG.&quot;  24th over: England 64-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 21, Trott 6) Kemar Roach replaces Ravi Rampaul, who bowled a good spell of 11-1-28-1. He has switched ends, which might help with the no-balls. There are none in that over, which yields a single to Strauss.  25th over: England 68-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 25, Trott 6) Oof. That&apos;s right: oof. Strauss got away with one there, edging a big drive at Sammy just wide and short of the solitary slip Bravo. It flew away for four but could easily have been out.  26th over: England 71-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 25, Trott 8) Another no-ball from poor Roach, his seventh of the innings. He hasn&apos;t lost it completely and is actually bowling pretty well apart from that pesky front-foot problem. Trott drives him through the covers for a couple. &quot;Your correspondents arguing about whether a legal ball would have found the edge have obviously forgotten about quantum theory,&quot; says Luke Regan. &quot;It both would and wouldn&apos;t. We never experienced the reality of a legal ball so it&apos;s moot. The point is, he gave himself no chance whatsoever by overstepping.&quot;  27th over: England 79-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 33, Trott 8) Strauss plays a glorious stroke off Sammy, an elegant drive through mid on for four. He gets four more later in the over after a misfield at backward point from Samuels, who was flummoxed by a nasty bounce.  28th over: England 92-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 33, Trott 16) A sudden flurry of runs for England. Thirteen from Roach&apos;s over makes it 21 from the last two. The obligatory no-ball is followed by consecutive Trott boundaries, an emphatic cover drive and an edge wide of econd slip, and finally a short ball swings down the leg side for four byes.  29th over: England 96-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 37, Trott 16) Strauss inside-edges a cut stroke at Sammy just wide of leg stump for four. That brings up the fifty partnership. &quot;Agree with you on Robin Smith,&quot; says Peter McKean. &quot;&apos;The Judge&apos; was definitely my boyhood hero, and when I played for Bishop&apos;s Stortford College U14 B XI my best shot was a cut modelled on \u2013 but somewhat less effective than \u2013 his awesome efforts. I got to watch him score a hundred against the Indians (with a young Sachin Tendulkar in the team) at Trent Bridge in a Texaco Trophy match in 1990 (before pyjamas). Unfortunately we lost, but then came Goochie in the Test series, 333 and all that.&quot; And a forgotten hundred from Smith in the same innings. It&apos;s odd that, for a man who was so good against pace and so vulnerable to spin, Smith averaged more in Tests against Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka than against any of the other Test-playing nations.  30th over: England 97-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 37, Trott 17) The tall offspinner Shane Shillingford comes on for a short spell before tea. He was really impressive against Australia in the recent series and starts with an accurate over.  &quot;Just noticed there&apos;s a programme coming up next Weds on R5Live at 7.30pm,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;Mark Chapman will be in South Africa on the 10th anniversary of Hansie Cronje&apos;s death to analyse events preceding the plane crash. Should be a fascinating listen.&quot; That was definitely one of cricket&apos;s JFK moments.  31st over: England 110-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 37, Trott 30) England have scored 39 from the last five overs. Another expensive over starts when Trott times Sammy through extra cover for four to bring up the hundred. Trott looks in ominous touch for West Indies; he helps himself to two more boundaries later in the over, waving a couple of filthy deliveries through point and cover. When Chanderpaul threw the ball back after the third boundary it smacked into the hand of Aleem Dar, who was looking the other way. It broke the device he uses to count the number of balls that have been bowled; at least it didn&apos;t break his hand. It will certainly have hurt, mind.  32nd over: England 114-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 37, Trott 34) Aleem Dar at square leg is busy putting his device back together during Shillingford&apos;s over. Surely the ICC aren&apos;t that skint? Trott gets the seventh boundary of his impressive innings with a crisp flick through midwicket. &quot;Please say hello to Peter McKean from me,&quot; says Emil Fortune. &quot;We were in the same year at Bishop&apos;s Stortford and I hope he is well.&quot; I am Cilla Black.  33rd over: England 119-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 42, Trott 34) Strauss crashes another cut stroke for four, this one off Sammy. The umpires are going to sneak another over in befoer tea.  34th over: England 123-1 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 45, Trott 35) Strauss times Shillingford through midwicket for three, with Powell making an outstanding save on the boundary. That&apos;s the end of an increasingly good session for England, with 52 runs coming from the eight overs before tea. They trail by 247 and will hope to erase at least half of that in the 35 overs that remain. Rob Bagchi will be here for the afternoon session; he&apos;s on rob.bagchi@theguardian.com. Bye!  TEA Afternoon all. The atmosphere here on a Saturday is certainly different. Perhaps in homage to TMS, the Observer team have a table full of cakes, Jacob Steinberg has provided luxury ice pops and there&apos;s a chap on the first floor strumming an acoustic guitar, stopping every few chords to write down a few words. Speaking of the yips, my favourite ever was Gladstone Small&apos;s for Warwicks v Middlesex in 1982. He sent down 10 no-balls in the over and his skipper, Dennis Amiss, said afterwards: &quot;When I said give us three or four quick overs at the start, I didn&apos;t mean all at once.&quot; The OBO, increasingly, is only part of the service we provide. Here&apos;s Janet Stevens: &quot;If Peter McKean, in over 29 is the one I think he is, than could you please also ask him to say hello from me to his Mum, Mary, with whom I shared a flat for a while in 1972. Rob Smyth is not only Cilla, he is Friends Reunited - except that Mary and I are still in touch and do not actually need to be reunited, although it would be nice to see each other oftener.&quot;  Review!! Trott lbw Rampaul Out on umpire&apos;s call.  Wicket!! Trott lbw Roach 35 A three-card trick, two move out and one nips back. It looked as if it was sliding down but seing it would have clipped leg stump the third umpire upheld Aleem Dar&apos;s decision.  35th over: England 123-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 45, Pietersen 0) And we&apos;re back with 34 overs due in the session. What a glorious day for battin&apos;, and, as Ken Dodd would say &quot;for poking a cucumber through next door&apos;s letterbox and shouting &apos;the Martians have landed&apos;.&quot; Rampaul resumes, looking a little arthritic after his rest. He posts a first and third slip for Trott and gets him fourth ball with one that veered in. We had to wait for both Hawk-Eye which confirmed he was out then Hotspot to see if he&apos;d hit it, but he knew he hadn&apos;t and walked off. The last ball of the over definitely reversed in to Pietersen but he got a feather of an inside edge to strangle the appeal. Excellent over, apart from that stiff first ball.  36th over: England 123-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 45, Pietersen 0) Shillingford continues to Strauss around the wicket, getting dip towarsd off-stump but not the bounce that did for Australia in Dominica. You&apos;ll need to F5 for those wicket and review updates, as per the usual disclaimer for slack OBOing. Maiden. &quot;It may be fancy dress day at Trent Bridge but I bet there isn&apos;t anything there to match the (incredibly unpleasant) sight of a man in a luminous green mankini sprinting alongside the leaders at the Giro d&apos;Italia,&quot; writes Clare Davies. &quot;I thought I&apos;d take advantage of the Tea break to check on the men in lycra \u2013 seems their tough day in the mountains suddenly got a lot worse.&quot; The mankini joke surely has had its day.  37th over: England 125-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 45, Pietersen 1) Rampaul&apos;s bowling beautifully, reversing it in and mixing it up with a very sharp bouncer to Pietersen that leaps over his right shouler as he turns away. He sheepishly asks the question when Pietersen inside edges it on to his pad again and lets Pietersen get away with his usual harum scarum sprint when he taps it to mid-on and sets off. His line&apos;s not as good to the left-hander, a good foot too wide and too pitched up to bring his two gullies into play. Harsh wide given for his second bouncer of the over. Hars but in the regulations, apparently. Shame. Clare has an update from TMS: &quot;I reckon that [wicket] was MPV&apos;s fault! He just put the commentator&apos;s curse on Trott. Either that or Trott watched the Giro during tea and got distracted by the man in the luminous lime-green mankini! Not a good start for England at all.&quot; Who wouldn&apos;t be, Clare?  38th over: England 142-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 53, Pietersen 10) Hang on to your jazz hats. Pietersen trots down the pitch and larrups Shillingford for a straight six, not quite off the middle then gets two for a tight single when mid-off misfields, over-excited by the slight chance of a run-out. Strauss the plays a pleasingly deft late cut off his stumps for four. The last ball of the over jumps up more but Strauss decides to go through with the cut and hits it to the third man for another foiur and his half-century. 17 off the over.  39th over: England 147-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 53, Pietersen 15) I know writing &quot;Wow!&quot; is trite but possibly justified for Pietersen&apos;s beautiful leg glance for four. What strong wrists he has. It&apos;s reversing in for Rampaul and Pietersen is anticipating it well so far. &quot;Afternoon Bagchi, afternoon everybody,&quot; writes Josh Robinson. &quot;Peter McKean is much more fortunate than I am. Either that or Emil Fortune is much more pleasantthan the people who recognize my name on the OBO. The only time anyonewrites in to communicate with me it&apos;s to say what a \u00a2$#* they think Iam. Actually, on reflection, perhaps it&apos;s got nothing to do with fortune, or with Fortune.&quot; You should see my correspondence, Robinson.  40th over: England 148-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 53, Pietersen 16) A best of a nasty, spitting, fizzer from Shillingford forces Pietersen on to his back foot and hits his pad. Too high and down the leg-side to be out but it will put a few demons in his mind. It wouldn&apos;t have been given even if he was in line because Shillingford had overstepped. He gets off strike with a push. &quot;Can I suggest the 1988&apos;s Gatting-barmaid affair as one of cricket&apos;s other JFK moments? (Insert your own grassy knoll joke here),&quot; offers Russell Hope. It never made any sense at the time, Russell, but he had run his course with the TCCB and any excuse would have done, having stuck by him after Faisalabad.  41st over: England 149-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 53, Pietersen 16) With the ball swinging in and Pietersen playing it with a bat coming down from 11 o&apos;clock, the midwicket fielder saves a couple of singles. To one that goes straight he drives but only toes it to cover then artfully leaves one that cuts in three feet and passes over off and middle. Here&apos;s today&apos;s OBO sponsor, Peter McKean: &quot;I am rather startled by not one, but three mentions so far on OBO this afternoon (four if you print this). Greetings to Emil, who will no doubt thank me for reminding him of our happy (and not unsuccessful) joint association in the school general knowledge team on such a public forum as the Guardian OBO. That defeat against Maidstone GS in the national semis in 1994 still rankles ... I also feel compelled to confess that my top score in the aforementioned 1992 season in the U14 B XI was a lowly 13, despite opening the batting for most of the summer (before one of my erstwhile colleagues reveals my mediocrity to the wider world). Mind you, that 13 occupied 1 hour 20 minutes batting and included a glorious square cut for four ... off a beamer.&quot; I once, against Ashville College in Harrogate, put on 83 for the fifth wicket. I scored nine. Another wide for a looping bouncer off the sixth ball is the only run off the over.  42nd over: England 159-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 63, Pietersen 16) Fine shot from Strauss to a short one and he scores a second four with a top-edged lap sweep. Shillingford&apos;s length is erratic to say the least, bowling a full toss that Strauss turns gently to squre leg for two. He has bowled a couple of beauties but is giving away far too many runs to help Rampaul.  43rd over: England 160-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 63, Pietersen 17) &quot;Coincidentally, but in honour of Gatting, I have just finished eating a Wensleydale cheese &amp; chutney sandwich,&quot; writes John Starbuck. &quot;I&apos;d normally go for egg butties in this weather but they&apos;re too much trouble on a lazy sunny afternoon. In my younger days, this would be about the right time for my mum to be making an old-fashioned trifle.&quot; There&apos;s a good story in Simon Hughes&apos;s book Morning Everyone where he takes Gatt out to lunch and is berated by his former captain for going on about how big a trencherman he is. When the waiter dishes out the food, silver service style, Gatt says, mid-rebuke to Hughes: &quot;Is there a rration on greens?&quot; Close lbw shout for one that zips back into Pietersen and hits him on the flap above the knee. It would have hit the outside edge of the top of leg stump but there was no referral.  44th over: England 161-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 63, Pietersen 18) Pietersen takes two steps down the track and taps Shillingford to long on for a single. Short leg for Strauss is three feet further back than you&apos;d expect, presuming that a chance will come off the bat and not via bat then pad. Strauss rolls his wrists too early on a cut and bashes it straight into the ground by his toes. Better over, more control.  45th over: England 171-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 64, Pietersen 22) Rampaul has a well-earned and Roach takes over. It&apos;s not his day, the first ball, that dies on Ramdin after swinging a mile, goes for four byes. The second then goes for another to long leg when it swings three yards after it goes past off-stump. He&apos;s a poor lad. Strauss gets a thick inside edge to fine leg and takes one. Pietersen&apos;s off-drive flies over middle stump off an edge and goes for four. What&apos;s he done, smashed the black cat that crossed his path over the head with a mirror?  46th over: England 179-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 72, Pietersen 22) &quot;Food for cricket on a day as glorious as this one can be a bit tricky,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Havingonce endured an explosive bout of food poisoning from an egg mayo sandwich left too long in the sun, I&apos;m wary of the sandwich option. I favour samosas and bhajis from the splendid Pooja&apos;s of Tooting - wonderful finger food with nothing to go wrong. Add Pimms and lemonade decanted into bottles of Dandelion and Burdock to fool the stewards, and you&apos;re set fair.&quot; Pimms and lemonade? You theatrical types. Shillingford&apos;s big hands and technique give him tons of overspin and dip but Strauss is reading it well, dispatching fours to cover and midwicket off successive balls.  47th over: England 183-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 72, Pietersen 22) Roach is bowling well wide of the crease, almost in Colin Croft territory. Wary of feeding Strauss&apos;s cut he targets the pads and Strauss belts it through midwicket for four. Fine shot. That Gregos Traitorelli advert does my head in. Balls to BANTA. Shane Warne is licking an elaborate Zoom, crinkle cut version.  48th over: England 190-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 77, Pietersen 28) Marlon Samuels replaces Shillingford, dropping short and inviting Pietersen to rock back and smash him in front of square for four. &quot;Could I cheer Josh Robinson up by saying on the OBO that I&apos;ve met him and he&apos;s a lovely bloke,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;The fact that he had an extremely well stocked wine rack that he was very generous with in no way influenced my view of him. Well, a bit.&quot; Speaking of which \u2026 \u2026 that&apos;s drinks.  49th over: England 191-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 77, Pietersen 28) &quot;&apos;Shane Warne is licking an elaborate Zoom, crinkle cut version,&apos; shudders Clare Davies. &quot;Oh dear. Knowing the Warnester is there with the delicious Liz Hurley, Rob, that sounds like code for something positively obscene and more in keeping with Shane&apos;s earlier days.&quot; I was straining to identify the said lolly, having given up on sticked stuff back in the days of the deeply disappointing Lollygobblechocbomb. It is apparently a Fruit Pastille lolly. Roach continues, smiling ruefully as he tries to master his run-up, having gone a bit too wide and thinking about every step rather than it coming naturally. Strauss laps him off his hip to take the only run off the over.  50th over: England 192-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 79, Pietersen 28) Samuels is attempting to tie up this end and is coping pretty well but I would have thought Sammy should be bowling now.  51st over: England 192-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 79, Pietersen 28) Strauss goes paddling again for one to fine leg, overtaking Kenny Barrington in England&apos;s all-time Test runscorers&apos; list in the process. &quot;Could I trouble you to pass on a message to Sawyer via the OBO?&quot; asks Josh Robinson. &quot;I mean, if it&apos;s an inconvenience I could always email him myself, but using this route seems more in keeping with today&apos;s proceedings. Let me know in the next few overs if that&apos;s OK and I&apos;ll send you the message to pass on.&quot; Help yourself, Robinson. We&apos;re the copper wires, you&apos;re the electricity.  52nd over: England 193-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 80, Pietersen 28) Samuels round the wicket to Strauss, full length and not giving it any chance to spin very much even if he could. Len Middleton asks whether &quot;the percentage of wickets taken in Tests by spinners gone up or down in relation to those taken by other bowlers since the introduction of those jolly old reviews?&quot; Up, as Rob Smyth showed during the Sri Lanka tour. I&apos;ll dig out the figures.  53rd over: England 198-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 80, Pietersen 33) Pietersen gets the over off with a sublime on-drive for four. The angle of Roach&apos;s approach is positively inviting that shot. Here you go, Len. Pietersen farms the strike with a block to mid-off and the mad dash down the wicket.  54th over: England 199-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 80, Pietersen 34) Is this what they mean by open journalism? &quot;Regarding crinkle cut snacks, does anyone out there know if it&apos;s still possible to buy crinkle cut mini-cheddars?&quot; asks Jamie Kirkaldy. &quot;My wife is obsessed by the idea of finding them (she claims they are corrugated fragments of heaven) and I&apos;m hoping to locate a packet with the aim of gaining enough brownie points to earn a day pass to a day at one of the Eng-SA tests. Anyone?&quot; Paywall, pah. We&apos;re the fourth emergency service. Pietersen spends a minute gurning and stretching his lower back after a twinge.  55th over: England 202-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 82, Pietersen 35) Ah, Sammy decides to turn his arm over at last and has Ramdin standing up in a helmet. The captain asks the question with one that snakes in a mite too far and hits Pietersen on the shin. Angling the ball in allows Pietersen to milk the midwicket, mid-on area and he brings up the 200 with a tap there. Strauss then plays an ugly pull from outside off to wide mid on for two.  56th over: England 207-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 82, Pietersen 40) Dilshan scoop from Pietersen for four. However often you see it, it still looks daft. Samuels is buying time here for Rampaul, I guess, but is innocuous. Hence the Mexican wave in the crowd.  57th over: England 209-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 82, Pietersen 42) Sammy goes all conservative with his field, bowling short of a length, arrowing into Pietersen and setting a ring around the square. Trying to exhaustr his patience, no doubt. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure one of the vending machines in the main admin building of the University of Lincoln stocks crinkle cut mini-cheddars,&quot; writes Phil Sawyer. &quot;How much this is of use to Jamie Kirkaldy I&apos;m not sure. Or how long they&apos;ve been in there. Anyway, where&apos;s this message from Robinson? If I have to wait with bated breath much longer I&apos;m going to pass out.&quot; There&apos;s a message here from Clare Davies for you, too, but I&apos;m getting tired of being Postman Pat.  58th over: England 214-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 87, Pietersen 42) Good, Shillingford&apos;s back. Not good, for West Indies, Strauss belts him for four. Big bounce off the last ball as Pietersen comes down the wicket and it surprises him but he gets away with it and back into his crease before short leg can pounce to run him out.  59th over: England 222-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 94, Pietersen 43) Strauss enters the 90s with a cut over the top of point which flies for four, lovely expansive shot. A brilliant dive prevents another four in front of squre from a cut he had to crouch to play.  60th over: England 232-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 95, Pietersen 52) And that&apos;s the 100 partnership, reached when Pietersen sweep/scoops. Remarkably that&apos;s the first time in 34 partnerships that these two have put on a century. Everyone&apos;;s going mad here watching penalties in the League One play-off but I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. Much oohing and guffawing. Pietersen reaches 50 with a sumptuous shot then rides his lock with one that nips back and goes off the edge.  61st over: England 232-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 95, Pietersen 52) Sammy has the field in for Strauss, coming round the wicket with a middle and off line and keeps him dwon to a single off the over. Michael Holding thinks Shillingford&apos;s inability to keep the rate down means that he has to be replaced at the other end.  62nd over: England 232-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 98, Pietersen 52) But he continues with Shillingford, a slip and short leg. He blocks two then fine sweeps round the corner and takes two when the ball is stopped on the rope. Better from the spinner, pinning Strauss on his crease. &quot;Hey Rob, I&apos;ve just noticed on the BBC text commentary that they are now restricting contributions from readers/ listeners to SMS and Twitter. No email anymore. Have I been slow to realise this, or is it new? Why would they do this? I can only think that they have realized that they will never get the best quality emails because of course, all those go straight to the magnificent, surely by now award-winning, our very own Grauniad&apos;s OBO?&quot; No emails? No BBC Gary and BBC Phil and BBC Josh and BBC Clare, presuming they had their own versions, like the Costanza, Kramer and Elaine in Jerry and George&apos;s sitcom. How could they?  63rd over: England 244-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 98, Pietersen 61) Pietersen moves from regal to imperious, swatting two fousr with a magnificently high followthrough. He takes nine off Sammy&apos;s over and pinches the strike.  64th over: England 253-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 102, Pietersen 66) Bang, Pietersen steps back and pummels Shiillingford square on the offside for four but he gets cocky and takes two steps to on-drive over the top, pulls out of the shot halfway through and spoons it just short of the racing-in long-on. It puts Strauss on strike and he brings up his 21st Test century with his 18th four, clipped square on the leg side.. My, he&apos;s in good nick.  65th over: England 253-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 102, Pietersen 66) At last Rampaul returns and bowls a peach with his first ball, swinging in and straightening milimetres past Pietersen&apos;s outside edge. Keith Flett pays tribute to Strauss but wonder whether greatness eludes him while he remains clean-shaven. Should one say clean-shaven, Keith? Or is that beardist, implying uncleanliness among the BLF and its fellow travellers? It&apos;s a minefield. Maiden from Rampaul.  66th over: England 253-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 102, Pietersen 66) Shilingford has a slip and six fielders in the ring who keep Strauss runless.  67th over: England 258-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 102, Pietersen 71) &quot;If we&apos;re assigning Seinfeld characters, I want to be George Costanza&apos;s dad,&quot; writes Mac Millings. &quot;And even if we&apos;re not, I want to be George Costanza&apos;s dad.&quot; I had you down for the library detective, Mac. Pietersen works Rampaul&apos;s inswing away for four with his usual combination of flick and power. &quot;That anonymous email in the 62nd over would imply that BBC Phil would somehow be an inferior version of myself,&quot; writes The Sawyer. &quot;This is impossible. You can&apos;t get any more inferior than me.&quot; T&apos;was Clare Davies, Phil. Pietersen keeps stretching his lower back and swaying his buttocks, like bottom gurning.  68th over: England 259-2 (in reply to West Indies&apos; 370; Strauss 102, Pietersen 72) Last over of the day from Shillingford, milked early by Pietersen for a single to long-on. Strauss plays one off his toes with a flat-bat prod, then steers one along the ground to gully then defends the last. Centuries for both captains today. Tune in early tomorrow, you know how vulnerable Strauss is the morning after. Join Rob Smyth from 10.45pm. Thanks for all your contributions. See you after tea tomorrow.

Two days after completing a record partnership, the Fireman Sams need to do it again. If Marlon Samuels and Darren Sammy don&apos;t come close to repeating their fire-fighting heroics of the first innings, England will win this comfortably, perhaps even by lunch. West Indies resume on 61 for six, effectively three for six, after England&apos;s seamers bowled with murderous purpose yesterday evening. The big cheese was the magnificent Tim Bresnan, who took three wickets and bowled beautifully with the old ball. In two Tests at Trent Bridge he averages 70 with the bat and 15 with the ball. Not bad for a stout lad.  My patio&apos;s on fiiiii-rrrre... Weather? Bloody hell. The last few days have been absolutely gorgeous, or so I&apos;ve been told by those who have seen daylight. In the spirit thereof, let&apos;s put together an OBO Summer Playlist. All suggestions welcome \u2013 with YouTube links if you can \u2013 except Good Enough by Dodgy. Anyone who suggests Good Enough by Dodgy will have their IP address reported to the Karma Police. I&apos;ll start with Patio Song by Gorky&apos;z Zygotic Mynci.  &quot;Tails it is ... I&apos;ll have a bat&quot; For those who were exposed to daylight yesterday and didn&apos;t read the OBO, just look at this. Only Viv could turn the toss into theatre. (No Ron Jeremy jokes, please.)  10.54am &quot;Morning Rob,&quot; says Chris Wright. &quot;I see you received some queries as to the wife/skateboard/tantrum/Nicole Kidman puzzle? If anyone is still interested, this is what happened. She bought two small skateboards for our kids at the airport \u2013 airside \u2013 but was told by Singapore Airlines she could not take them on the plane as they were classed as weapons. (Yes, weapons.) She argued long and hard and got nowhere and was told that there was only one passenger left to board and that she would have to surrender the skateboards and get on. At that point the last passenger arrived: Nicole Kidman. My wife, sensing a last opportunity, said: &quot;Would you confiscate children&apos;s toys from her?&quot; and pointed at our Nicole. At this, the captain \u2013 who had come to greet Kidman personally \u2013 gallantly said he would take responsibility for the skateboards himself in order to avoid his star passenger being any further embroiled in the scene. So all&apos;s well that ends well. Moral of the story: if you are refused entry to an aircraft with your skateboards, simply locate Nicole Kidman.&quot;  OBO playlist-related competition For no reason other than it&apos;s sunny, we&apos;ll send a prize to the first reader who emails in this England XI in order of Test debut (so the most recent debutant, Bairstow, would be at No11). You can cheat if you like. Please put &apos;England XI&apos; or some such as the email subject and I&apos;ll check them at lunch. This is really exciting, isn&apos;t it? Isn&apos;t it?  27th over: West Indies 66-6 (Samuels 17, Sammy 1) Tim Bresnan is going to open the bowling. He has three for 10 in the innings and seven for 114 in the match. There are three slips in place, and Samuels gets going with a classy flick through midwicket for four. He is in wonderful touch. &quot;An absolute must \u2013 Teenage Fanclub&apos;s &apos;Neil Jung&apos;,&quot; says Ben Stanley. &quot;The guitar solo sounds like it was recorded three pints to the good while reclining in a pub garden deckchair.&quot; Yep, that&apos;s going in. In fact Grand Prix would probably make The Joy of Six: Summer Albums.  28th over: West Indies 66-6 (Samuels 17, Sammy 1) Jimmy Anderson beats Sammy with a textbook full-length delivery that moves past the edge. Not sure whether it was swing or seam movement. It moved; I know that much. This Pulitzer goes out to my parents, all my editors ... er, yes, anyway, that was the main event of a maiden over from Anderson. &quot;How about &quot;Mercury&quot; by Lowgold as the mercury certainly is rising (I&apos;ll get my coat)&quot; says Ben Powell. Yes that can go in. Nothing to do with the song, which is even worse than Good Enough by Dodgy, but the potty-mouthed travesty and stand-up comedian who is/was lead singer of Lowgold sometimes reads the OBO. Hi Darren!  29th over: West Indies 67-6 (Samuels 17, Sammy 1) Bresnan is trying to angle the ball in to the right-handers, as he did so effectively last night. There&apos;s a huge shout for LBW against Samuels from precisely that delivery, but Asad Rauf says not out and England decide not to review. It looked a bit high and Hawkeye shows he was outside the line as well. &quot;How about Summer in the City by the Lovin&apos; Spoonful,&quot; says Susan Perry. &quot;Always makes me think of hot pavements and short shorts.&quot; Yep. That should have been in High Fidelity.  30th over: West Indies 67-6 (Samuels 17, Sammy 1) Anderson beats Samuels with a stunning delivery that swings in a touch and then seams away past the edge as Samuels lunges over towards the off side. Another maiden. &quot;Looking forward to following today, but did have a second&apos;s heart failure when I went onto the OBO page,&quot; says Andrew Sharpe. &quot;England 66-6?&quot; Oh what a buffoon I am. I&apos;ve changed it now, thanks.  31st over: West Indies 70-6 (Samuels 17, Sammy 4) Sammy forces Bresnan square on the off side for a couple and then flicks a single to midwicket. &quot;How about &apos;Blister in the Sun&apos; by Violent Femmes,&quot; says Martin Race, &quot;as the title pretty much describes my left arm after a saturday pub garden session.&quot; It&apos;s also synonymous with Grosse Pointe Blank, so it&apos;s a must.  32nd over: West Indies 73-6 (Samuels 17, Sammy 7) Sammy gets turned round by Anderson and hits defensive push in the air but wide of Anderson. He looks a bit jittery this morning, Sammy, whereas Samuels is playing with the same serene certainty he showed in the first innings. &quot;I defy you not to want to sit in a beer garden and sink ale to this beauty by The Sundays,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;It even has an aoopropriate title. You couldn&apos;t get more summery than than this if you were sat sunburnt in your back garden with the paddling pool out, eating charred bbq fare, eyes streaming from rampant pollen clouds, wasps stings on your legs, bottles of continental lager at your feet and an Ian Ronald Bell century being purred over by Aggers on TMS.&quot;  33rd over: West Indies 79-6 (Samuels 18, Sammy 12) Bresnan gives Sammy a hint of width and is punished with a stonking cover drive for four. You have to be careful praising West Indies these days, lest you be accused of being patronising, but it&apos;s fair to say a few recent West Indies sides would have just thrown the bat this morning and given it away in the first hour. These two are playing with a lot of determination. Apparently Sammy was in the nets for ages before the start of play. &quot;How about Golden Skin by Silver Sun?&quot; says Peter Foster. &quot;Sun-drenched from its title to its Beach Boys-style harmonies, and almost certainly performed live on TFI Friday at some point in the late 90s. Perfect.&quot; Yes please!  34th over: West Indies 83-6 (Samuels 22, Sammy 12) Samuels gets four more with another beautiful flick off the pads. Has he ever played better than this in his Test career? He was really good in his debut series in Australia in 2000-01, although he didn&apos;t get that many runs. He was good in South Africa a few years back, too, but this might be his purplest patch. &quot;Pavement&apos;s Type Slowly would have to make a middle-order appearance, probably just above the tail. It starts off with a hazy, summery lightness, and then descends into a woozy confusion before coming out the other side in a happy, refreshing sigh. A bit like an afternoon session in a beer garden.&quot; Ah, I&apos;m glad somebody brought up the importance of the batting order of a mix-tape. We still need a Side 1 Track 1 song. When I&apos;m With You by Best Coast, maybe?  35th over: West Indies 85-6 (lead by 27; Samuels 22, Sammy 14) Bresnan is replaced by Broad, who starts shaping it back into Sammy from the first ball. There&apos;s a bit of uneven bounce, as you&apos;d expect on a pitch that has been burned by the sun, so England are bowling pretty full and very straight. Sammy jams his bat down on a bit of a grubber and then steers one to third man for two. &quot;Here&apos;s my nomination for favourite summmer song, and one of my favourites in any category: Super Furry Animals \u2013 Northern Lites,&quot; says Sean Clayton, a man after my own warm, sunkissed heart.  36th over: West Indies 90-6 (Samuels 23, Sammy 18) Sammy edges an Anderson outswinger through the vacant third-slip area for four, although the ball landed well short of the cordon. &quot;Can I give you a nudge towards &apos;Ike&apos;s Mood No.1&apos; by The Visioneers?&quot; says Adam Fletcher. &quot;There&apos;s a YouTube linky here although it&apos;s blocked at work so I can&apos;t check if it works sorry. Don&apos;t get me started on blocking YouTube at work.&quot; I agree. This merciless drive for productivity must be an infringement of human rights. A nice song, that. While we&apos;re in vague hip-hop territory, this can go in too.  37th over: West Indies 91-6 (Samuels 25, Sammy 18) Broad has one slip and two gullies for Samuels, who continues to play responsibly. He has 24 from 85 balls at a Nasser-approved strike rate of 28.23 runs per 100 balls. When he gets a single, Sammy evades a good bouncer and then jabs down on a follow-up grubber, ending up on all fours as a result. Broad&apos;s looking really dangerous with that uneven bounce. &quot;I think Bairstow is player number 652, which means that someone in the not too distant future is going to get the devil&apos;s number,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;Mine, by the way, is 466 which means it was a long time ago. Sunny Afternoon by The Kinks; In the Summertime \u2013 Mungo Jerry; Here Comes the Sun \u2013 The Levesons.&quot; Mungo Jerry!  Hang on, there have been 190 debutants in the last 35 years? I thought there were that many in 1989 alone.  38th over: West Indies 97-6 (Samuels 29, Sammy 19) An eventful end to Anderson&apos;s over. Samuels would have been run out by a direct hit from Bairstow, drove the next ball magnificently through the covers for four, and then was then struck by a superb short ball that hit top of the bat as Samuels turned his head away. It could have gone anywhere but landed safely on the off side.  39th over: West Indies 102-6 (Samuels 33, Sammy 20) Samuels drives Broad delightfully through extra cover for four more. He is in sensational touch! &quot;If you need some Chanderpaulesque solidity for the Boring Middle Overs, I&apos;d speedily direct you to this woozy, sprawling piece of magnificence,&quot; says Matt Biss. &quot;Actually, I don&apos;t think you could describe Shiv as either woozy or sprawling. Terrible metaphor shoehornery there, for which I can only apologise. Great tune, mind.&quot;  40th over: West Indies 110-6 (Samuels 36, Sammy 25) Bresnan comes back for Anderson and his first ball is an excellent short one that takes the splice of Sammy&apos;s bat before falling short of gully. The next ball is the same length but wider, and that allows Sammy&apos;s to smash a back cut for four. Samuels completes a good over for the West Indies with another pristine extra cover drive, this time for three. The lead is now 52.  41st over: West Indies 110-6 (Samuels 36, Sammy 25) Samurls is beaten by a good one from Broad that shapes away. Another maiden. Batting has been far from easy this morning, with a bit of movement and also the occasional low bounce, and these two have played extremely well. It&apos;s time for drinks. In other news, some of your suggestions have been awful. Live It Up by Mental as Anything! You know who you are, and we know where you live. &quot;As a closing song for the playlist, I suggest &apos;Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!&apos; by Do Make Say Think,&quot; says Andi Thomas. . Essentially, it&apos;s the sound of the sun setting on a perfect day, but in the opposite of a depressing way; it&apos;s reflective, it&apos;s contented, and it&apos;s utterly joymaking.&quot;  WICKET! West Indies 110-7 (Sammy LBW b Bresnan 25) It&apos;s deja vu all over again. Another inducker to the right-hander, another LBW for Bresnan. Sammy has reviewed the decision. It might just be too high \u2013 he&apos;s a tall man \u2013 but it him on the back pad and I reckon this will be umpire&apos;s call. Here comes the replay ... he&apos;s out! It was just hitting the middle bail, and Sammy goes for a proud little innings of 25.  42nd over: West Indies 110-7 (Samuels 36, Roach 0) Roach is beaten by his first delivery. A wicket maiden from Tim Bresnan. &quot;How about Sunday Morning by Velvet Underground?&quot; says William Hardy. &quot;Maybe not summery in sentiment, but certainly in sound?&quot; It&apos;s also synonymous with underrated late-1990s Aussie campus-based romp Love and Other Catastrophes, so yes please.  43rd over: West Indies 113-7 (Samuels 37, Roach 1) Broad&apos;s LBW appeal against Samuels is caught in the throat because of a late inside edge. Samuels arguably went into one-day mode a bit early in the first innings but there&apos;s no sign of that yet. &quot;Hey look now, I&apos;ve done this chart of England test debuts 1970-2010,&quot; says Paul Read. &quot;You may mock 1989 (5), but the really bad years were actually 1986 (11) and 1988 (10). Surprisingly, 2003 (10) was also pretty damn bad- and that was in the Fletcher years: James Anderson, Anthony McGrath, Richard Johnson, James Kirtley, Ed Smith, Kabir Ali, Gareth Batty, Rikki Clarke, Martin Saggers and Paul Collingwood.&quot; That&apos;s formidable knowledge. I suppose 1986 and 1988 were good examples of forward-planning. They wanted to line up as many people as possible with Test-match experience so that they could pick all of them during the 1989 Ashes.  REVIEW: West Indies 113-7 (Samuels not out 37) Samuels, trying an ungainly flick at a length delivery from Bresnan, survives a big LBW shout. It looked too high but England are going to review it. It was too high and would have bounced over the stumps.  44th over: West Indies 113-7 (Samuels 37, Roach 1) &quot;This is nickel-in-the-Wurlitzer-at-a-beachfront-diner incarnate,&quot; says Mike Gibbons, which sums up Here Comes Your Man by  The  Pixes perfectly. Thanks for all the suggestions. I haven&apos;t had chance to read most of them yet but will do, probably.  45th over: West Indies 125-7 (Samuels 37, Roach 13) Broad swings a full delivery back into Roach, who times an exquisite push through extra cover for four. Shot! Two balls later he gloves an attempted hoo just wide of Prior, diving down the leg side, and the ball scoots away for four. An extravagant, wristy flick/pull over leg gully for four more makes it 12 from the over. &quot;Regarding the approach of player number 666, there is in fact a compelling school of thought that holds that the number of the beast was mistranslated, and the earliest known fragment of Greek scripture has it as 616,&quot; says Stephen Davenport. &quot;This would be James Kirtley: four tests starting against South Africa at Trent Bridge in 2003, and ending against Sri Lanka in Colombo three months later as cover for James Anderson. Then Jones and Harmison came along \u2026 but he averaged 29.52 with the ball (and 5.33 with the bat). Kirtley was, of course, the bloke who was called several times over his action. Maybe some demonologist (there must be one) can tell us if the Old Nick had a taloned hand in that\u2026&quot;  46th over: West Indies 126-7 (Samuels 38, Roach 13) It seems Samuels has learned to stop worrying and trust Kemar Roach&apos;s batting ability. He hasn&apos;t changed gear since Sammy&apos;s departure. A strike-keeping single off the last ball of Bresnan&apos;s over is a bonus rather than a necessity. West Indies lead by 68. &quot;I had begun to doubt if Bresnan was the right man for the team but to stand out in a bowling attack when the others are Anderson, Broad and Swann is some task,&quot; says Damian Sefton. &quot;Then add his batting. So has the door closed on Onions and Finn?&quot; Crikey no. Not in an age of back-to-back Tests and burnout, and with a coach as enlightened as Andy Flower. If Finn doesn&apos;t take at least 250 Test wickets, I&apos;ll eat my shoe. But this is England&apos;s first-choice attack, though, as it has been for almost a year now. Meanwhile, a controversial but heartily OBO-approved suggestion from Neil Sharma: Don&apos;t Falter by Mint Royale with Lauren Laverne.  47th over: West Indies 135-7 (Samuels 47, Roach 13) It&apos;s surprising that England haven&apos;t brought on Swann to toss it up and widen some eyes. Anderson comes back instead, replacing Broad. Samuels squirts his first ball to third man for four and then edges a big drive just wide of the only slip Strauss, who was diving to his right. Samuels and Anderson have a flirty chat at the end of the over. Their respective bromantic interests, Nasser Hussain and Graeme Swann, might not like that.  48th over: West Indies 136-7 (Samuels 48, Roach 13) Kemar Roach&apos;s Test and first-class batting averages are in single figures, but he looks better than that. He has a decent defence and a few good-looking strokes, particularly the cover drive. He plays out a maiden from Bresnan. &quot;A lazily elegant tail-ender,&quot; says Terry Sullivan.  49th over: West Indies 136-7 (Samuels 48, Roach 13) Samuels is almost undone by a big inswinger from Anderson, but he gets enough bat on the ball to drill it to mid on. The next ball swings the other way to beat Samuels&apos; tentative grope. Masterful bowling, a really high-class maiden.  &quot;Re player numbers, I knew I was old when Bill Frindall split his book of Test Cricket into two volumes and I was in Vol1,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;I knew I was very old when it went to three volumes and I was still in Vol 1.&quot; At least you didn&apos;t have to cross out MD Moxon with a felt tip pen and write R A Smyth to get in there in the first place.  50th over: West Indies 138-7 (Samuels 49, Roach 14) Marlon Samuels is brilliant. According to the commentators on Sky, he was being gently sledged by the England cordon, at which point he turned round and told them to shut up because he&apos;s going to get another hundred. His personality and batting have enriched this summer enormously. Two from Bresnan&apos;s over.  &quot;Re: Pavement&apos;s &apos;Type Slowly&apos;: if you want a Pavement summer song then surely it has to be &apos;Gold Soundz&apos; with the glorious line &quot;So drunk in the August sun and you&apos;re the kind of girl I like&quot;,&quot; says Tim Marchant. &quot;Based on the current situation I would also suggest &quot;Babe Come Down&quot; by Sammy.&quot;  WICKET! West Indies 139-8 (Roach LBW b Anderson 14) &quot;That must be out!&quot; screams Mike Atherton as Roach flicks all around a straight one from Anderson that hits him on the back leg, but Asad Rauf says not out. England have got to review this. The only thing that can save Roach is if the ball is only shaving leg stump, but he&apos;s struggling. He&apos;s out! He moved a long way across his stumps and the ball would have hit leg stump halfway up.  51st over: West Indies 139-8 (lead by 81; Samuels 50, Shillingford 0) Earlier in the over Samuels got to fifty with a single off Broad. That&apos;s another extremely good performance, classy and responsible. He has faced 130 balls and hit eight fours. This is the first time in his 39-Test career that he has made three consecutive scores of fifty or more.  52nd over: West Indies 140-8 (lead by 82; Samuels 51, Shillingford 0) Anderson&apos;s wicket was the sixth LBW of the innings. England&apos;s seamers have become very good at reading wickets, particularly since David Saker became bowling coach. &quot;Wake up Boo! by The Boo Radleys,&quot; offers Simon Platt, not unreasonably. &quot;Summertime by Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince,&quot; suggests William Hardy. &quot;Anyone who says they don&apos;t like it is lying to themselves.&quot;  53rd over: West Indies 141-8 (Samuels 52, Shillingford 0) Samuels&apos; straight drive is diverted towards the stumps by the bowler Anderson; had it hit, Shillingford would have been out because although his bat was inside the crease he had not grounded it. The single puts Shillingford on stroke and he digs out an excellent yorker. That&apos;s lunch. Both teams fought really hard this morning, and West Indies go to the interval with a lead of 83. Thanks for all your playlist suggestions. My inbox is begging for mercy so don&apos;t send any more; I&apos;ll sort out the batting order of the worst playlist in the world and, erm, reveal it on next week&apos;s/tomorrow&apos;s OBO.  LUNCH See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.  54th over: West Indies 144-8 (Samuels 55, Shillingford 0)Graeme Swann, who surprisingly didn&apos;t bowl all morning, will start the afternoon session. He goes around the wicket to Samuels, who pushes a couple to third man and a single to cover despite being beaten in the flight. With two and a bit innings to spare, Samuels needs 26 more to make this the most productive series of his international career  &quot;Listening to TMS in the park, hearing Blofeld call people &apos;my dear old thing&apos; while chattering about buses, pigeons and wonderful cricket....&quot; coos Eva Broer. &quot;What other summer soundtrack can top that? Even Sir Geoff adds to the joy for sheer absurdity. Bliss. Now back to working on my tan.&quot; Why is Boycott known as Sir Geoff when he only has an OBE.? It&apos;s the same with Les Ferdinand, of course, and Tom Lutz.  55th over: West Indies 145-8 (Samuels 56, Shillingford 0) Anderson has a 7/2 field for Samuels. That&apos;s two slips and seven men on the boundary in an attempt to give Samuels a single. Mikey Holding is not impressed. Samuels turns down a single from the second delivery but takes it from the fourth, and Shillingford survives the rest of the over. &quot;Hmm,&quot; says Darren Ford of the entry in the 28th over. &quot;I&apos;ve been waiting two overs for the angry backlash as hordes of incensed Lowgold fans leapt to our defence. It&apos;s not coming is it?&quot; Are you serious? I&apos;ve just gone 12 rounds with Johnny Cigarettes over the merits of Mercury, which is still available from all good online stores.  56th over: West Indies 147-8 (Samuels 58, Shillingford 0) Samuels, on the walk, flicks Swann straight into the stomach of Cook at short leg. Sometimes they stick; most of the time they don&apos;t.  57th over: West Indies 147-8 (Samuels 58, Shillingford 0) Shillingford is a very tall man and has to get down a fair way to repel a couple of low-bouncing deliveries from Anderson. A maiden. Shillingford has 0 from 20 balls. Watch out Geoff Allott.  WICKET! West Indies 148-9 (Shillingford c Anderson b Swann 0) Samuels thought he could get two to third man, but good fielding from Bresnan kept him to a single. That gave Swann five balls at Shillingford; he needed only two. Shillingford pushed defensive at a drifting delivery that went straight on to take the edge, allowing Anderson at slip took a smart catch. That&apos;s his fourth catch of the match to go with his five wickets.  58th over: West Indies 148-9 (Samuels 59, Rampaul 0) West Indies lead by 90. &quot;No bobbies on the beat,&quot; scaremongers Mark Walsh. &quot;Dozens of pubs closing a week. Fruit ninja freak in No. 10. People picking a Teenage Fanclub track that isn&apos;t Your Love is the Place Where I Come From for a summer playlist. Hell in a handcart, Rob, hell in a handcart.&quot;  59th over: West Indies 149-9 (Samuels 59, Rampaul 0) Samuels has a zesty mow at Anderson, dragging the ball for a single. That gives Anderson one ball at Rampaul, who leaves it. &quot;After a particularly boring innings on Sunday \u2013 42* from 105 balls in 40 over cup cricket \u2013 a teammate of mine wondered what is the most dot balls ever faced in arow by a batsman \u2013 or indeed the most amount of dots in a row obtained by a bowler,&quot; says Damien Briggs. &quot;Any ideas?&quot; The great South Africa offspinner bowler 137 consecutive dot balls against England in the 1950s. That&apos;s definitely the Test record. Not sure about batsmen, though. The late Runako Morton made a 31-ball duck in a one-day final for West Indies in 2006.  60th over: West Indies 165-9 (Samuels 76, Rampaul 0) Samuels manhandles Swann&apos;s sixth over for 16! He started with a dragged drive for four and then drove two glorious sixes, one perfectly straight and the other over long on. He might well get that second century, although he was unable to keep the strike at the end of the over so Anderson will have an over at Rampaul.  WICKET! West Indies 165 all out (Rampaul c Bresnan b Anderson 0) Samuels won&apos;t get his century. Rampaul steers Anderson to third slip, where Bresnan takes a good two-handed catch to his right, and West Indies are all out for 165. Anderson ends with four for 43, while Marlon Samuels walks off to generous applause from the whole ground, including all of the England fielders, for a splendid unbeaten 76. England&apos;s target is 108.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: England 0-0 (target: 108; Strauss 0, Cook 0) Kemar Roach will have to bowl the spell of his life if West Indies are to win this game. He starts with a good but ultimately harmless over to Strauss, a maiden.  &quot;I properly loved &apos;Just Backward of Square&apos;,&quot; says The Bear. &quot;As did most of my friends at sixth form in Saffron Walden \u2013 if it&apos;s any consolation, we all thought that album was amazing (a small group though we were). I also liked &apos;Welcome to Winners&apos;. Can you get Darren to confirm whether the title of the first album is a cricket reference\u2026 I have always hoped it was.&quot; It can&apos;t have been any other reference, can it? Or am I missing something? I did like Just Backward of Square, too. They did really well for a poor man&apos;s Turin Brakes.  2nd over: England 0-0 (target: 108; Strauss 0, Cook 0) Ravi Rampaul also starts with a maiden, to Cook. England won&apos;t allow the West Indies to bowl for too long; they learned that lesson from Abu Dhabi. &quot;Following your England debutants riff earlier, I found myself wondering who would have made their England debut closest to the time I was born (much more interesting than who was no.1),&quot; says Andrew Benzeval. &quot;Statsguru informs me that it was Graham Dilley, may he rest in peace. Another excuse to watch Headingly &apos;81 highlights in his honour, methinks.&quot; Crikey, I&apos;ve got a feeling mine might be Mike Selvey. Ah no, a quick check tells me it&apos;s Graham Thorpe. Har. Har. Har. (It&apos;s Mike Brearley.)  3rd over: England 0-0 (target: 108; Strauss 0, Cook 0) Another maiden. I don&apos;t know what else to say. If England win this match they will win the series, which would ensure they stay No1 in the world for the series against South Africa later this summer.  4th over: England 2-0 (target: 108; Strauss 0, Cook 2) Cook is beaten, fishing for a Rampaul delivery angled across him, and then he gets England off the mark with a back-foot drive for two. At the current scoring rate England will win this game sometime on Wednesday afternoon. &quot;Ordinarily I might agree with Eva Broer (54th over) about Blowers on TMS,&quot; says Stephen Davenport. &quot;But this afternoon he sounds as though he has the best part of his lunchtime dessert (possibly junket or posset, or maybe a M\u00fcller Fruit Corner if he was in a rush) lodged in his throat, with a curious reluctance to clear it. As I&apos;m listening through earbuds it&apos;s a distressingly unpleasant experience, so I&apos;ve missed the last two wickets.&quot; It&apos;s a shame because you&apos;re missing all sorts of action at the moment.  5th over: England 14-0 (target: 108; Strauss 12, Cook 2) Twelve from the over. Strauss misses a pull at a delivery from Roach that goes away for four leg byes, although Asad Rauf gives them as runs. Those four runs make Strauss and Cook are the first English pair to add 5000 runs in Test cricket. Strauss takes the partnership to 5010 with a couple of storming pull strokes for four. &quot;I&apos;m sure the record for dot balls faced without scoring belongs to a lad called Timothy Appleyard who made a 59-ball duck whilst batting in a school match,&quot; says Martin Duckworth. &quot;The reason for such certainty on my part is that I was playing in it and our scorer, nicknamed &apos;Stormer&apos;, who was the sort of lad who couldn&apos;t hit/throw/catch a cricket ball to save his immortal soul but could recite pi to thirty decimal places, reckoned it must be &apos;some sort of record&apos;. When Tim was finally out we weren&apos;t sure whether to applaud when he came in or just stare at our boots. I think we opted for the latter.&quot; 59 balls? In a school match? That is deviant heroism of the highest order. It&apos;s not a record, though: New Zealand tailender Geoff Allott got an 77-back duck against South Africa in 1998-99.  6th over: England 14-0 (target: 108; Strauss 12, Cook 2) Cook is beaten by consecutive deliveries from Rampaul, the first short and the second very full. Rampaul is very impressive, especially with the new ball. &quot;Nearest new cap to my birthdate is Alec Coxon, number 334, who only played a single game,&quot; says Selve. &quot;He was, says Wiki, &apos;An ever-willing seam bowler, he was one of several tried in the search for a partner for Alec Bedser, but he did himself no favours with a brusqueness which could upset&apos;.&quot; In view of that last bit, it won&apos;t surprise many to hear he was from Yorkshire.  7th over: England 17-0 (target: 108; Strauss 14, Cook 3) Cook fences that nasty Roach short ball round the corner for a single. Three from the over.  8th over: England 19-0 (target: 108; Strauss 16, Cook 3) &quot;During a rather (read &apos;incredibly&apos;) dreary village game last season, I bowled a 20-over spell, the first nine of which were maidens,&quot; says Peter Harmer. &quot;I eventually conceded 14 runs. I got bored as the bowler, god knows how the guy the captain insisted having on the boundary felt! The match ended in a draw, unsurprisingly.&quot;  9th over: England 20-0 (target: 108; Strauss 16, Cook 4) &quot;Poser on TMS before Strauss got off the mark: how many batsmen have scored a century and a duck in consecutive Tests?&quot; says Brad McMillan. &quot;Vic Marks thought it would be poor form to tempt fate, and they gave up trying to answer it when he scored, so, do you have the answer?&quot; Strauss didn&apos;t make a duck at Lord&apos;s did he? Although the only two players in Test history to make a duck and a century in the same Test on three occasions are playing in this game: Strauss and Chanderpaul. After a quick scan of this list (all examples of a player making a century and a duck in the same Test), I&apos;m pretty sure it has never happened in consecutive Tests before.  10th over: England 23-0 (target: 108; Strauss 17, Cook 6) Rampaul moves around the wicket and beats Cook with a wonderful full-length delivery that tempts him into the drive before swinging and seaming past the edge. &quot;Not quite the record but I saw Peter Such make a 51-ball Test duck at Old Trafford against New Zealand in 1999,&quot; says Matthew Craven. &quot;It is about the only thing from the days play I can recall. He got a standing ovation when he was finally dismissed.&quot; That was, from an England point of view, one of the more miserable Tests in history.  11th over: England 28-0 (target: 108; Strauss 21, Cook 7) Darren Sammy replaces Kemar Roach (5-2-16-0). There are no slips and a tight off-side ring, so Strauss opens the face to steer four to third man.  12th over: England 33-0 (target: 108; Strauss 25, Cook 8) Cook takes a suicidal single into the covers and would have been out with a direct hit from Powell. That brings Strauss on strike, and he opens the face to steer Rampaul between slip and gully for four more. He&apos;s playing nicely and has 25 from 38 balls. &quot;Surely the most bizarre innings in ODI history must be Sunil Gavaskar&apos;s knock against England in the 1975 World Cup,&quot; says Greg Belton. &quot;Chasing 334 he proceeded to carry his bat and amassed a frankly outstanding 36 from 174 balls faced.&quot; That wasn&apos;t the only protest during his career.  13rd over: England 35-0 (target: 108; Strauss 26, Cook 9) Sammy has a slip in now. That stroke from Strauss in the previous over has reversed the usual norms of field manipulation; by playing it he brought a close fielder in rather than getting rid of one. &quot;Sam told me to email you, I&apos;m not sure about what,&quot; lies Jarrod Kimber. &quot;Anyway, here is the Two Chucks featuring the star of Bedazzled (the remake, not the original).&quot; Insert your own Brendan Fraser joke here.  14th over: England 37-0 (target: 108; Strauss 27, Cook 10) Darren Sammy turns to spin \u2013 but it&apos;s Marlon Samuels rather than Shane Shillingford. Samuels got some bite off the pitch in the first innings, when he bowled much slower than Shillingford. Two from a quiet first over. &quot;Now that we&apos;re in dead rubber territory with the Test series (almost), can I ask about ODIs?&quot; says Dave Adams. &quot;Taking my boy to the Rose Bowl next month \u2013 do you think the Windies will have any reinforcements by then?&quot; Yep, they should have Gayle, Pollard and Narine among others. That should be a cracking series.  15th over: England 42-0 (target: 108; Strauss 29, Cook 13) Cook back cuts Sammy towards the boundary, where the substitute Fudaddin makes an outstanding sliding stop to save two runs. Five from the over; England are cruising. &quot;Glad to see the Lord Selvey injecting some perspective into the Youth Club,&quot; says Adam Titmus. &quot;I think the my closest debut was Micky Stewart or Len Coldwell.&quot;  16th over: England 48-0 (target: 108; Strauss 29, Cook 18) Shillingford is on after that one over from Samuels. England went after him in the first innings \u2013 it seemed like a calculated assault \u2013 and it continues here with Cook cutting the first ball for four. England need 61 more to win.  17th over: England 56-0 (target: 108; Strauss 33, Cook 22) Strauss works Sammy for three to bring up the fifty partnership, and then Cook flicks fine for four. England have scored 33 from the last seven overs. &quot;A guy in our League, Stan Watts, once protested against a big total being scored by our side with no declaration forthcoming by batting through the 50 overs of their innings for 1 not out,&quot; says Michael Daniels. &quot;That was against his better judgement, being called for a run by his partner.&quot; Kim Hughes did that in a tour game once, although there is more than one way to express your displeasure, as the late David Hookes showed.  18th over: England 62-0 (target: 108; Strauss 34, Cook 27) Cook cuts Shillingford through the sliding Rampaul at deep point for four. Later in the over Shillingford beats Strauss with a jaffa that dips and then spits past the edge.  19th over: England 69-0 (target: 108; Strauss 39, Cook 29) Strauss edges a flashing cut at Sammy right between keeper and slip for four. They left it to each other, although the replay shows it was definitely the keeper Ramdin&apos;s catch.  20th over: England 69-0 (target: 108; Strauss 39, Cook 29) A maiden from Shillingford. I wonder whether England will rotate the side for the third Test now that it will be a dead rubber. It&apos;s a great chance to give Anderson and maybe also Broad a rest. Andy Flower is ahead of the curve on squad rotation so I&apos;d imagine they will consider it strongly.  21st over: England 74-0 (target: 108; Strauss 40, Cook 33) That&apos;s tea. It&apos;s taken longer than we might have expected, but England are almost home now. They need 34 more after the interval. See you in 20 minutes.  TEA  22nd over: England 76-0 (target: 108; Strauss 40, Cook 34) Shillingford starts after tea and bowls a huge no-ball, certainly for a spinner. Two from the over.  23rd over: England 79-0 (target: 108; Strauss 40, Cook 37) Cook steers Samuels past slip for two before being beaten by a flighted delivery that bursts a long way over Cook&apos;s attempted cut.  24th over: England 89-0 (target: 108; Strauss 45, Cook 38) A brute from Shillingford spits past everyone for four byes. That doesn&apos;t deter Strauss from coming down the track, though, and he clouts an emphatic boundary over midwicket.  WICKET! England 89-1 (Strauss c Darren Bravo b Samuels 45) Strauss drives inside out to extra cover and has gone for 45. Marlon Samuels&apos; excellent personal match has a little more gloss.  25th over: England 93-1 (target: 108; Cook 38, Trott 4) Trott carves Samuels for four to get off the mark. &quot;Prompted by the Cook/Strauss 5000 runs ... has there ever been a top Test team (WIndies 1980s; Aus 1990s, Eng 1950s) which hasn&apos;t has a brilliant pair of openers?&quot; says Navraj Ghaleigh. &quot;In other words, are openers a necessary condition for a top team?&quot; Like $47m, having a good opening partnership helps, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a dealbreaker. Look at the excellent, underrated Pakistan side of the late 80s and early 90s for example. They had some good openers but no settled partnership.  26th over: England 94-1 (target: 108; Cook 39, Trott 4) Trott bat-pads a nasty delivery from Shillingford just wide of short leg. &quot;Vic was most gratified to find that his birthday debutant was Fred Titmus,&quot; says Mike Selvey. Did he repeat the Half Man, Half Biscuit title upon discovery?  27th over: England 95-1 (target: 108; Cook 40, Trott 4) &quot;I have nothing to impart,&quot; says Sarah Morriss. &quot;Not a thing. Still, it&apos;s the thought that counts. Cracking job as ever my good man, will you use your day off tomorrow for anything lovely?&quot; Day off? Pah! No day off. I&apos;ll be writing The Spin: 4000 words on this Viv Richards video.  28th over: England 99-1 (target: 108; Cook 42, Trott 6) Four singles from Shillingford&apos;s over. England need nine to win. Consecutive flat-batted sixes from Jonathan Trott will do it.  29th over: England 103-1 (target: 108; Cook 42, Trott 10) Trott plays a high-class back-foot drive for four off Samuels to take England to within five of victory. Just one filthy heave to cow corner, Trotty, come on; get it done.  30.4 overs: England 111-1 (Cook 43, Trott 17). ENGLAND WIN BY NINE WICKETS AND TAKE AN UNASSAILABLE 2-0 LEAD IN THE SERIES Trott flicks Samuels to fine leg to seal the match and the series for England. As at Lord&apos;s there is honour in defeat for West Indies, but ultimately it was a comfortable win for England. The Test was decided by that blistering evening session yesterday. England&apos;s win means they hold on the No1 ranking ahead of the South Africa series later in the summer \u2013 and, for the first time ever, England have won seven home Test series in a row.

While companies presented their new achievements, TUM showed a prototype of its Mute, an electric car fully developed at the university. Two hundred staff and students from 21 departments had been involved in everything from the battery drive and body, to the design and market analysis. At the show, developers of large corporations inspected the car closely, and were impressed. Wolfgang Herrmann, president of TUM, likes to talk about the electric car, as it not only illustrates the capability of his university and its engagement with the real world of work, but demonstrates a crucial link between research, industry and society&apos;s challenges. TUM is one of the most dynamic universities in Germany. Since 2000, it has increased its student body from 19,500 to 31,000 and the number of professors has risen from 394 to 475. It was designed to be an &quot;entrepreneurial university&quot; and arranges its subject around a &quot;four-leaf clover&quot; of disciplines: natural and biological sciences, engineering and medicine (plus ancillary areas such as economics and teacher training). It has partnered with universities in Lausanne, Copenhagen and Eindhoven, and has eyes on Asia, opening a branch in Singapore. At the Munich headquarters there is the Chinese vice-president, Liqiu Meng, who is responsible for international alliance. But TUM has a &quot;historical deficit&quot;, says Herrmann: it lacks the humanities/arts subjects, such as those at the neighbouring Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich which also has elite status. Herrmann wants to counter this weakness by establishing the Munich Centre for Technology in Society. This will consist of seven professors who will analyse the consequences of technology on society. &quot;The fact that we train well within the technical subjects is to be expected,&quot; says Herrmann. &quot;But we need to broaden the horizons of our students beyond that.&quot; He wants to establish professorships in sociology of science and bioethics, and has already appointed a chair for business ethics. In May, the car industry announced that it would buy into the Mute. The university researchers will develop it for production together with BMW, Daimler-Benz and the tyre manufacturer Continental as well as a dozen other companies. The federal ministry for research work is funding the project in the next 30 months with a total of \u20ac10.8m (\u00a38.6m)."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rio-global-commitment-mandatory-reporting", "sentences": ["Meanwhile, several stock exchanges, from Istanbul and Johannesburg to Sao Paulo and Singapore, now require a serious commitment to environmental, social and governance issues from their listed firms.", "First, several countries, including China, Denmark, Ecuador, India, Norway, Singapore and the United Kingdom, have recently created laws, procedures, guidelines and standards in line with the proposed convention."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-31T13:22:00Z", "title": "Time is ripe for a global commitment on mandatory reporting at Rio+20", "tags": ["Business on the road to Rio", "Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability reporting", "Strategy"], "article": "When governments meet at Rio+20 in June, one defining, decisive and positive outcome for the planet and its people could be a global commitment to corporate sustainability reporting. Since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, increasing numbers of companies have been factoring environmental, social and governance issues into their operations and business models. Around a quarter of corporations surveyed by Bloomberg are now encapsulating and disclosing some of these elements in their annual reports side by side with cash flows, debts and liabilities. Meanwhile, several stock exchanges, from Istanbul and Johannesburg to Sao Paulo and Singapore, now require a serious commitment to environmental, social and governance issues from their listed firms. Dedicated sustainability indices have also emerged among some international rating agencies and exchanges including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the FTSE4GOOD and the NASDAQ Global Sustainability Index. This progress is welcome: it allows pension funds, shareholders and other investors to pick firms where sustainability is central \u2013 not least because there is good evidence that such corporations are better run, manage natural resources more efficiently, have reduced pollution footprints, are less prone to shocks in a globalised world and less vulnerable to reputational risk. It is also assisting governments across a wide range of challenges from meeting greenhouse gas targets to tracking health and safety improvements for workers across sectors and geographic regions. However, it is not enough: indeed the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Coalition, an alliance of pension funds and investors with assets under management worth $2tn, as well as UN agencies and NGOs, concludes that existing voluntary arrangements have hit their limits. The time is ripe for a global policy framework on corporate sustainability reporting that delivers the transparency and comparability needed to move forward and assist in fast tracking a transition to a global green economy. Why? First, several countries, including China, Denmark, Ecuador, India, Norway, Singapore and the United Kingdom, have recently created laws, procedures, guidelines and standards in line with the proposed convention. These are to be welcomed. But what business needs most is not many different standards, but a common global agreement on reporting. That will be more effective and lower cost. Second, many of the nuts and bolts underpinning a potential global framework already exist in voluntary efforts such as the Global Reporting Initiative, the Global Compact, the Carbon Disclosure Project and the International Integrated Reporting Council. Third, a survey of stock exchange respondents has found that 80% of those responding wanted a global approach to sustainability reporting; only 30% objected to this being mandated. Some countries and companies may fear that a global policy framework, such as a convention, could prove a bureaucratic straitjacket or a costly brake on profits. This need not be the case. Indeed, experience around the globe has provided a snapshot of how the benefits of corporate sustainability reporting can be reaped without becoming an extension of red tape. Similarly, having a global standard need not imply a one-size-fits-all approach. Governments can have the flexibility to implement in different ways, whether through new laws, existing company laws or via listing authorities such as national stock exchanges. Once adopted on a national level, compliance by individual companies could be done on a &quot;report or explain basis&quot;, effectively turning the tables on the current situation of opting in to corporate sustainability reporting to one where companies would have to opt out In other words, it would be for companies&apos; boards of directors to define what is material and needs to be reported, on the one hand, and what is immaterial and should be merely be explained to regulators and shareholders, on the other. Day in and day out, trillions of dollars flow in and out of investments across the globe, a proportion of which is assisting in generating the conditions for a transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient, job-generating green economy. A global commitment on sustainability reporting could dramatically assist in accelerating and scaling-up these positive investment flows and bridge what is a big gap between ambition and reality for a sustainable future. The momentum is rapidly gaining ground among responsible investors, an increasing number of corporations and forward-looking sectors of civil society. A range of commitments will be before world leaders in Rio in a few weeks&apos; time \u2013 evolving sustainability reporting on to a higher, more widespread and legally grounded level, ideally in the form of a future convention, should be firmly on their radar as one inspiring policy option guaranteed to deliver powerful and positive environmental, social and economic outcomes.

The sport&apos;s supremo, Bernie Ecclestone, believes that volatile markets and continuing problems in the eurozone make an initial public offering (IPO) unlikely until October at the earliest. Formula One&apos;s biggest shareholder, private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, had been expected to publish a prospectus on Tuesday, but Ecclestone said: &quot;We haven&apos;t got a date set yet, but with all the problems in the eurozone and the markets, we will be waiting until things have settled a little. Who would want to try and list now? I did see what Graff did, and it shows now isn&apos;t the right time.&quot; He added: &quot;This year, for sure, we are going to go through to market. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a big rush, but we plan to get it done by the end of the year. &quot;With the way things are at the moment, people are reluctant to invest. Look at the markets. If people aren&apos;t buying stock on companies that have been on the markets for 20 years, why will they come and invest in a new one now?&quot; The IPO had been expected in June, but Ecclestone&apos;s intervention is likely to influence any decision made by the board, which is due to meet this weekend. &quot;We&apos;ll wait until October or November when the Formula One season is over,&quot; he said, &quot;because at the moment we just don&apos;t have time to do an investor roadshow.&quot; The news came as London-based jeweller Graff postponed its IPO, which had been due to start on the Hong Kong exchange on Friday. But with seemingly endless fears over the eurozone&apos;s future and a slowdown in China&apos;s economic growth, the business could only manage to take orders on half the shares it hoped to sell. Graff admitted: &quot;Consistently declining stock markets proved to be a significant barrier to executing the transaction at this time.&quot; Shares in Graff were being offered at between HK$25 and HK$37 (\u00a32.08 to \u00a33.09), but this was seen as too high for a business that has just 20 customers accounting for nearly half of sales. A slowdown in luxury spending in China left analysts and fund managers questioning Graff&apos;s valuation, and Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index has plunged 12% since 7 May, when Graff executives and advisers started meeting with institutional investors. Rival jewellers Tiffany, which is listed in Hong Kong, has fallen 14% in less than a month and last week cut its sales forecast, blaming slower demand from key markets such as China. Three more major IPOs, worth a total of up to $1.37bn in Hong Kong and Singapore, have also been postponed and Facebook&apos;s post-flotation woes continue: the social network&apos;s performance on Nasdaq, which has seen shares trading below their opening value of $38, has led to some investors launching legal action against its advisers Morgan Stanley. On Thursday, Facebook was trading at around $27. Ecclestone said he hoped to avoid a similar fate. &quot;Facebook was obviously a problem,&quot; he said, &quot;but the price they put on it was ridiculous. How they ever got to that figure I&apos;ll never know.&quot; Analysts have warned that if Formula One were to list now, it could struggle to get investors. It currently has debt levels close to $4bn and plans to float using a complicated structure of a share issue and loan notes that mature in 2060. &quot;Appetite for new listings is pretty weak generally because of the macro situation,&quot; said Eugene Mak, an analyst at brokerage Core Pacific Yamaichi in Hong Kong."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/31/china-india-millionaires-global-rich-list", "sentences": ["Anna Zakrzewski, one of the report&apos;s authors, said: &quot;You have the oligarchs and also a lot of ultra high net worth families relocating to the UK from Middle East India, east Europe.&quot; In Singapore 17.1% of all households are worth more than $1m, while 11 out of 100,000 households in Switzerland are worth $100m or more."], "publicationDate": "2012-05-31T19:23:21Z", "title": "China and India swell ranks of millionaires in global rich list", "tags": ["Rich lists", "Business", "Global economy", "Economics", "China", "India", "World news", "US news", "Japan"], "article": "The eurozone plunged into crisis and unemployment soared across the globe, but 175,000 people still made enough cash last year to join the global millionaires&apos; club.

The US still boasts the most millionaires with 5.13m households in the top bracket, despite a fall of 129,000. China, which added 193,000 to 1.4m, is within touching distance of Japan, which is in second place with 1.58m. Britain is in fourth place with 411,000 millionaires. The influx of oligarchs and other wealthy foreigners enabled the UK to boast the second highest number of &quot;ultra high net worth&quot; [UHNW] individuals, with 1,125 households holding financial assets in excess of $100m (\u00a365m).     Households with a net worth of over $100m. Graphic: Paul Scruton    One in 25,000 UK households is now worth more than $100m, says BCG&apos;s report, which does not include property and other non-financial assets. If property were included, the number of UK millionaire and super-millionaire households would dramatically increase.

The world&apos;s richest people are also getting richer faster than everyone else. While the world&apos;s total privately held wealth increased by 1.8% to $122.8tn last year, UHNWs&apos; wealth increased by 3.6% to $7.1tn. The report predicts that UNHWs&apos; wealth will rise to $10.3m, or 6.8% of the world&apos;s total wealth, by 2016. The amount of money held offshore, which often attracts a much lower tax rate, increased by 2.7% to $7.8tn. &quot;The increase was driven partly by a flight to safe havens by investors in politically unstable countries, and partly by inflows from UHNW families based in rapidly developing economies. &quot;Still, offshore wealth management as an industry remains under intense and increasing pressure owing to greater regulatory scrutiny \u2013 particularly from tax authorities in the United States and western Europe,&quot; the report said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/01/britain-olympic-gold-moaning", "sentences": ["First, the Olympic bid was under-priced in that extraordinary seesaw week of July 2005, when London won the rights in Singapore, only to be ripped apart by the 7/7 bombings within hours."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-01T09:46:15Z", "title": "Britain wins Olympic gold for moaning | Michael White", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "UK news", "Politics", "Olympic Stadium", "Olympics & the media", "Media", "Queen's diamond jubilee", "Monarchy", "The Queen", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Within familiar partisan tramlines Polly Toynbee and Simon Jenkins are fighting it out in today&apos;s Guardian over the futility and/or magnificence of this weekend&apos;s Jubilee celebrations. Guess which one thinks it&apos;s all empty flummery, as pointlessly delusional as the monarchy? Let&apos;s leave them to it. What has intrigued me more this spring is the way upbeat coverage of the summer&apos;s other major celebration \u2013 the London Olympics \u2013 has had to compete with Cassandra-like gloom. What is it about the national character that is so desperate to turn what should be an enjoyable occasion into a maelstrom of doom, a narrative that parallels the 2012 royal saga. First, the Olympic bid was under-priced in that extraordinary seesaw week of July 2005, when London won the rights in Singapore, only to be ripped apart by the 7/7 bombings within hours. It followed that they were going to cost too much. The gloomsters were right about that, but a great swath of the East End has enjoyed a long-overdue makeover with the prospect of a substantial legacy that will serve the area for decades. The infrastructure seems to have been completed in good time and order \u2013 though brace yourself for last-minute &quot;it won&apos;t be ready&quot; dramas \u2013 so there was no fun there, although we did manage a lot of reporting from the rotting sports facilities in Greece, scene of the 2004 Olympics which helped bankrupt the country. But, as we keep reminding George Osborne, Britain isn&apos;t Greece; it&apos;s much better-run and it isn&apos;t anywhere near so corrupt. Its public finances are in better order (they really are) and its debt denominated in our own currency and mostly owed long term, not next month. So let&apos;s not jump under an overcrowded Olympic bus quite yet. Ah, buses, there has been quite a row over the gridlock predicted to grip the capital for the Games and Paralympics. London&apos;s transport network \u2013 the roads in particular have been less well improved than in other major British cities, don&apos;t forget \u2013 is always running close to peak capacity. Office workers who can work from home have been told to do so, thus switching the infrastructure bottleneck from trains, roads and buses to the internet which will become distinctly sluggish \u2013 as it does at peak times, only more so. But that&apos;s harder to film. There was a naughty report last month that London&apos;s Olympic planners impressed the International Olympic Committee by fiddling the traffic lights during their inspection visit to make the roads look better than they are. Never mind, there will be those VIP lanes for athletes and bigwigs during the games, another fruitful source of handwringing for the papers, as heart attack victims and heavily pregnant women have to wait while foreign dictators whizz past in their taxpayer-funded limos. You see how easy it is to get into the gloomster swing of things? Security? Don&apos;t get me started. The al-Qaida team is predicted to have been training for the London Games with a view to carrying off the gold \u2013 or at least making sure ours is tarnished. Personally, I was impressed that the military wanted a few anti-aircraft missiles on some apartment roofs in Stratford \u2013 those of us who regularly work within falling distance of Big Ben often contemplate these things \u2013 but some locals were pretty cross. And so it goes on. The price of food and drink is going to be even higher than at Wimbledon or Wembley; was that \u00a37.23 for a pint that I read about the other day? And Heineken has exclusive sponsor&apos;s rights, too? Scope there for both racketeering and a good moan. And the British Olympic team, it did so well in Beijing in 2008, it&apos;s bound to be a let-down this time. Did I say Beijing? Oh God, no. Poor old London can&apos;t compete with the display of economic power and cultural dazzle put on by the world&apos;s most populous nation; its ancient culture so much older than ours, we&apos;re doomed before we even try. That Boris Johnson, he&apos;s bound to make a mess of things, isn&apos;t he. All this may or may not be true. As it happens the British are often pretty good with the presentation of great events. Just look at the 1953 coronation, pretty daft in so many ways, but both admired and enjoyed by tens of millions. I didn&apos;t plan to watch last night&apos;s BBC TV programme, but ended up doing so (a bit like Diana&apos;s mesmerising funeral in 1997), not least because it brought back childhood memories. We all had cut-out crowns and coaches. In our village I won most of the under-8 races and got the coronation penknife and the paintbox. Happy days ! It may be that pomp has been used to mask growing impotence over the past 100 years or so and we have developed a talent for form over substance. The 1948 Olympics \u2013 as we&apos;ve been reminded by grainy TV footage in recent weeks \u2013 were a cheerfully shabby postwar affair, but the much-bombed city provided substance: London has resisted and prevailed. This time will be different. In its truculent way London will again resist the hoopla, will try to rip off the tourists while complaining about them as we do so. In the end London will prevail and go back to normal. It&apos;s going to happen, we might as well enjoy it \u2013 lie back and think of England, as the old joke goes.

Richard Fleming, UK head of restructuring for accountants KPMG, which is organising the deal for Fitness First, said: &quot;We estimate that the return to compromised landlords to be within a range of 23-28p in the pound, versus less than 0.5p in the pound in administration.&quot; A source close to the gym said a number of companies have expressed interest in the 67 sites that will be transferred to rivals over the next six months and it is thought the easyJet founder has been in discussions for the last few weeks. Sir Stelios opened his first pay-as-you-go gyms in north London and Slough last year and wants to expand. Fitness First&apos;s biggest lenders, investment houses Oaktree Capital and Marathon, have already agreed to write off more than \u00a3560m of debt in return for an undisclosed equity stake in the company. The company, which is owned by private equity firm BC Partners, has struggled recently to meet spiralling interest bills after it was loaded with debt following a series of acquisitions. Bosses had hoped to float the business in Singapore last year, but this was ditched and plans to sell failed. Landlords and unsecured creditors will vote on the proposed CVA, which must offer a bigger return than administration, later this month. Other plans include 57 gyms paying rents monthly rather than quarterly and five sites paying rent at a 65% discount. Another 18 gyms will be unaffected and the 67 set to go to rivals will get a 55% rent reduction until the transfers are completed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/05/black-caviar-lycra-suit-ascot", "sentences": ["There will be stopovers in Singapore and Sharjah."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-05T12:34:14Z", "title": "Black Caviar ready for flight to Britain in specially made lycra suit", "tags": ["Black Caviar", "Royal Ascot", "Horse racing", "Sport", "Royal Ascot 2012"], "article": "Black Caviar has made her final appearance in front of the Australian media before jetting to Britain, where she will compete at Royal Ascot a fortnight on Saturday. The mare, unbeaten in 21 races in her home country and the object of local adoration, modelled a specially designed Lycra compression suit which, it is hoped, will help her complete her journey round the world without injury. &quot;She&apos;s quite susceptible to soft tissue injuries, muscle tears,&quot; said her trainer, Peter Moody, according to a report by Australian Associated Press. He added that the idea of a compression suit had been recommended to him by the Australian 100-metre hurdler Sally Pearson, who will herself come to Britain to compete in the Olympics later this year. Black Caviar is expected to fly out of Melbourne on Wednesday and will spend most of the next two weeks at Abington Place Stables in Newmarket, formerly used by the trainer Geoff Wragg, with the possibility of a single exercise gallop at Ascot before she lines up in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes on 23 June. &quot;She is as fit as I&apos;ve had her at this stage of a preparation,&quot; Moody said. &quot;I don&apos;t want to have to train her for the next two weeks. She&apos;ll just go out on the gallops [at Newmarket], there&apos;ll be no need to do anything major with her.&quot; It is the flight, more than the race, that is the focus of concern for those close to the six-year-old, who has never travelled by plane before. &quot;It should be all right,&quot; Moody said. &quot;Flying is better than being in a truck for a horse.&quot; The mare will be accompanied by a vet and two attendants on the 30-hour journey. There will be stopovers in Singapore and Sharjah. Black Caviar has been in the habit of winning very easily, often being heavily eased down in the closing stages, and her odds have usually been 1-20 or shorter in her recent races. She is a 1-2 shot for the Ascot race, reflecting the expectation that she will meet better rivals than before and in unfamiliar surroundings, though defeat does not seem to be feared by her connections. &quot;The facts and figures tell you there&apos;s not a horse out there who can beat her,&quot; Moody is reported to have said. The Ascot race will be shown live on a big screen in Melbourne&apos;s Federation Square, it has been announced. Denis Napthine, the minister for racing in Victoria&apos;s government, said he hoped that as many locals and tourists as possible would &quot;come together to share this moment in racing history&quot; at an event which will apparently include free music, entertainment, a fashion competition and giveaways. &quot;Black Caviar&apos;s appearance in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes in front of the Queen is a landmark moment for Australian sport,&quot; said Rob Hines, chief executive of Racing Victoria, &quot;and this special broadcast at Federation Square is the perfect way for those unable to attend to share in a piece of history.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/jun/05/weekly-letters-8-june-europe", "sentences": ["David Stringer Singapore \u2022 Is there any truth to the rumours that those savvy British local councils who tried to maximise their income by investing their capital in Icelandic banks have grasped the opportunity to recoup those losses by buying Facebook shares (1 June)?"], "publicationDate": "2012-06-05T12:59:01Z", "title": "Guardian Weekly Letters, 8 June 2012", "tags": [], "article": "In Europe faces the inevitable and Old ways won&apos;t save the eurozone this time (18 May), important information is missing. Financial deregulation of the last 25 years, led every time by regulators in the US, allowed new forms of financial derivatives to be created, inflating credit and risk. Especially deregulation under the Clinton and Bush administrations allowed for toxic debt to be created. In the period leading to the financial crash in 2008, a lot of this toxic, mostly real estate-related debt, created by US financial institutions, ended up on the balance sheet of European banks and insurance companies. In fact, more then 40% of toxic real estate financing in the US was downloaded on Europe. These European institutions were lured into financing these derivatives as they were lucrative on the surface. European regulation would not allow this risk-bundling in empty derivatives the way new deregulation in the US did. European nations were managing all more or less within the rules of deficits not exceeding 60% of GDP, prior to the unfolding of the financial debacle. The toxic debts that all of a sudden showed up in European financial institutions forced European nations to rescue them from collapse, thereby bringing their own finances out of whack. It is ironic that subsequently &quot;international credit rating agencies and financial institutions&quot;, some rescued by public-sector bailouts, now have the power to downgrade credit values of national treasuries, force austerity on the public and pass moral judgment on levels of debt and social programmes. As long as we lack proper analysis, the crisis will continue to deepen. Jan Slomp Rimbey, Alberta, Canada \u2022 Gary Younge is right to link the Nato summit in Chicago to street killings on the ground and the chilling Friedman quotation about the military fist behind the invisible hand of the global market (Nato talks peace in a city at war, 25 May). And Friedman is right as long as we fall for a market that creates and exploits gross inequality within and between societies. It&apos;s not just a conspiracy by the rich \u2013 though there&apos;s plenty of that too. The rich are creatures of wealth, and the wealth that drives the market can also outgun any opposition: war is an extension of economics by other means. At the heart of the Friedman proposition, and the root of market inequality, is the self-serving fiction of the invisible hand itself: there was never a market magic that turned the sum of individual and corporate greed into common good. There never was an invisible hand, unless its the one that feeds us with such swill. Left to itself, the capitalist market favours wealth, the rich against the poor. Economically, socially and \u2013 when conflict erupts \u2013 by force. The myth of a benign, self-regulating market has absolved politicians, business leaders and the rest of us from common humanity, social responsibility for economic behaviour. It&apos;s not just piggy bankers but common practice to stick our heads in the trough, if we&apos;re lucky enough to have one in reach. (If we don&apos;t, we squeal, hit out, self-harm.) From squeezed middle to commanding heights, we help ourselves regardless and trust that somehow \u2013 in defiance of science, common sense and professed moralities \u2013 all will be well. It won&apos;t, of course. No peace in our time, no happy-ever-after unless we recognise what should be obvious. We&apos;ve only got each other and one fragile world. If we can&apos;t reach out and take back the common ground between us, we&apos;ve had it. Greg Wilkinson Swansea, UK Exploring Arctic for gain Anne Pelouas&apos;s article, Resolute explorers prepare for the Arctic, (18\u00a0May) struck me more for what it did not say. It evoked the romantic myth of scientists and explorers as selfless adventurers into the unknown. But explorers always were the vanguard of empires and corporations seeking to expand. If we follow the money, we come to a cynical Canadian government that, having backed out of Kyoto, is determined to exploit the opportunities presented by receding ice. The article specifically refers to geologists and geomorphologists, the vanguards of mining and oil companies. Our government, in its commitment to short-term economic growth at all costs, has the policy of supporting corporations. No doubt the richer the expedition the closer to corporate interests. What saddens me is that the rush to exploit resources revealed by the present effects of climate change will only exacerbate the problem \u2013 as well as polluting a pristine and delicate region. How will this juggernaut be derailed? Edward Butterworth Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Beware of carbon-credits Planting trees is generally a positive action to take, especially in areas vulnerable to anthropogenic degradation (Peru&apos;s coffee growers turn carbon traders, 25 May). Coffee production can also be a relatively benign agricultural pursuit as shade trees are retained and often leguminous, nitrogen fixing, species are selected so that supplementary inorganic fertiliser application can be reduced. However, the negative impacts of climate change and the destruction of the forest up-slope of the coffee producing areas are wreaking the inevitable, and by now familiar, devastation on agricultural production. Flooding is more frequent as erosion removes top soil and with it the capacity to store and gradually release intensive rainfall events. As population increase puts pressure on high-altitude forest, so the need to replenish the fragile resources becomes ever more immediate as the negative impact of natural resource degradation affects the livelihoods of producers lower down the hills. Pines are fast-growing species and will be planted with a view to harvesting in a decade or so. In such a situation it is difficult to see how participation in carbon-credit schemes can help the need for enhanced global carbon sequestration. It is fine to encourage reforestation with subsidies to smallholder producers, but to allow credits for this stored carbon, which will soon be released, to be used to &quot;pay for&quot; polluting carbon emissions elsewhere is, from the planet&apos;s viewpoint, nonsensical. Brian Sims Bedford, UK Darwinistic sculpture Cecil Balmond&apos;s and Anish Kapoor&apos;s Orbit sculpture is quite an apt conceit for the Olympics (&apos;They actually let us build this thing&apos;, 25 May). &quot;Grasping his opportunity with both hands,&quot; Boris Johnson has managed to reify his &quot;priapic fantasy&quot;, albeit somewhat diminished in actual consummation. Pace Mittal, they should have constructed it in bamboo. Tim Adams sees in the boondoggle a helter-skelter, but it strikes me rather more like the playground jungle-gyms or clusters of monkey-bars from my youth, replete with sky canopy. It represents the vain striving of primates to race to the top \u2013 social Darwinism or just plain Darwinism \u2013 clambering up the bloody-red maze to the pinnacle. But, like the recent concatenation of climbers on Everest during the night, for what exactly \u2013 the sublime vista? Or to pound the chest in bravado or slap the head in gibbering glee like the baboons we are? I&apos;m relieved to find Marina Hyde skewering and marinating all and sundry with her swingeing lampoonery. I am counting on her to chronicle the coming pratfalls, as here in US the media and general public regard the Olympics with a sober and reverent eye and won&apos;t suffer such levity. RM Fransson Denver, Colorado, US Briefly \u2022 Jessica Shepherd&apos;s article on education secretary Michael Gove&apos;s criticisms of private education (18 May) raises two questions. One: has he been ingesting Owen Jones&apos; fine book Chavs: the Demonisation of the Working Class, with which he sounds cleverly in tune? And two: if, as he says, &quot;For those of us who believe in social justice, this stratification and segregation are morally indefensible&quot;, can we anticipate his defection to a party truly concerned with those losing in Britain&apos;s class war? Assuming such a party exists. Christopher Griffin Rakiraki, Fiji \u2022 I am certainly no fan of Prince Charles, but I think Stuart Jeffries missed the point (18 May), in an otherwise interesting article, over Prince Charles&apos;s comment: &quot;when he visited Wordsworth&apos;s home last month, he was told the deer were eating the daffodils. &apos;Shoot them&apos;, he suggested&quot;, was brilliant tongue in cheek, knowing of his eco-friendliness!

Lloyd&apos;s Register (LR) could be a cheerleader for foreign secretary William Hague&apos;s exhortations &quot;to win our place in the world economy&quot; \u2013 except that chief executive, Richard Sadler, is strongly critical of Westminster policies. &quot;The government needs a long-term plan to protect the supply chain, whether we are talking about food or energy. If [shipping and oil capacity] is all in the hands of foreign governments we should not be surprised if they protect their own first if the need arrives,&quot; he argues. &quot;We are not looking ahead and taking an integrated approach like in China and Germany and that is poor policy. And if a government is not here to protect British society then what on earth is it here for?&quot; asks Sadler. The LR business is involved in the power production and maritime fields, so it is not surprising Sadler is interested in how to secure Britain&apos;s strategic interests through a kind of national shipping fleet or energy provider. LR, a &quot;classification society&quot; that assesses the mechanical safety and management systems of everything from ships to nuclear plants to food supply chains, does not rule out the concept of state-owned businesses needing to be established, though Sadler says other options need to be looked at first. &quot;There needs to be a national strategy in these areas. I am not talking necessarily about re-establishing commercial shipbuilding here but governments have been short-termist and we have to think how we need to support society in 2030 or 2050. How is the population going to keep warm and feed itself?&quot; LR is certainly patriotic. It boasts of being 100% British \u2013 in the sense it is located here and has no foreign ownership of any kind \u2013 but is actually busier in China than the City. Of its 8,500 staff only 1,500 of them are working throughout Britain with around 750 now in China. And there is little doubt it could happily wave goodbye to its City headquarters if it had to and still thrive. But LR is a very unusual beast to start with in that it is a not-for-profit organisation that ploughs all its excess cash back into its own operations or gives it to charity or academia. And it has no hesitation investing in new university-based technology centres, whether in Singapore or Southampton as well as handing out cash to run lifeboats through the RNLI. But there is little doubt where home is, given LR was a product of the same Lombard Street coffee shop as another famous maritime name, the Lloyd&apos;s insurance market. The two organisations were once one, and continue to provide services for each other but they have no ownership ties any more. LR is also at least 20 times smaller in revenue terms. The company employs fewer than 10,000 staff but has a turnover of nearly \u00a31bn and makes steady returns of 10% on that. About 40% of the revenues still come from roughly the same kind of maritime business that LR started in. It was formed in 1760 to provide third-party safety checks on the fleet of\u00a0merchant vessels that served the British empire from its base in London docks. But a current slump in shipping \u2013 following the 2008 credit crunch \u2013 and the growth of the energy sector has led to wind farms and oil refineries expanding to 30% of its business. So when EDF of France comes up with a new reactor design for Britain, it goes to Lloyd&apos;s Register. And yet the company is also active in the transport business helping certify the safety of a new metro links in Beijing and Bangkok as well as Dubai Many of its customers are governments or insurers but it has 50,000 current clients on the management systems side alone, mostly in the private business sector. One of the fastest growing sides of the business is assessing global food security so it provides advice to companies such as Coca-Cola, Cargill, and Mars. Some of LR&apos;s rivals such as Bureau Veritas, the French classification society, have floated on the stock market but Sadler says LR has no such plan \u2013 or need. But does it not miss the discipline that goes with having outside investors? &quot;Well, clearly you have to have a self-motivated CEO and management team. But we drive performance because we have a passion for what the organisation stands for and its history,&quot; he says. &quot;But just as Steve Jobs [of Apple] was passionate about not just what he made but how he made it, so are we in a different way. And we have a lot of success recruiting 25- to 35-years-olds who are fascinated by working for a company that is designed to add value to society and not just make a\u00a0profit.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/05/black-caviar-risks-flight-royal-ascot", "sentences": ["&quot;We started using Abington Place when a horse from Singapore called Bocelli came over [in 2001] for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-05T18:37:20Z", "title": "Lycra-clad Black Caviar ready to face perils of flight to Royal Ascot", "tags": ["Black Caviar", "Royal Ascot", "Horse racing", "Sport", "Royal Ascot 2012"], "article": "No greater test of Black Caviar&apos;s bid for a famous Royal Ascot victory may be found than in the next two days as the unbeaten Australian mare undertakes a 30-hour journey to Britain, soon to be followed by the sort of entourage that only a true diva could command. A travelling party of several hundred, including owners, supporters, friends, family and racing fans are set to hit the Royal meeting in time to watch her line up in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes on 23 June. On the transport plane that will bring Black Caviar across will be a vet and two attendants to monitor her wellbeing during the flight. Despite the fact that intercontinental travel is now undertaken on a regular basis in racing, as evidenced by a string of Australian-trained winners at Royal Ascot, there remain risks to sending horses around the world. Horses can lose weight at around 2kg to 3kg an hour during flight and quickly become dehydrated, while conditions such as shipping fever, a form of pneumonia, can develop if not identified and treated. &quot;We are much more educated to the dangers and aware of how to prevent horses from becoming vulnerable,&quot; said Peter Webbon, formerly the Jockey Club&apos;s senior vet and now the chief executive of the Animal Health Trust. &quot;There will always be a significant risk and horses must be monitored very carefully before, during and after such a journey but the attendants who travel with these horses will be extremely experienced.&quot; During her travels, Black Caviar will be wearing a Lycra compression suit, apparently recommended to her trainer, Peter Moody, by the Australian 100 metre hurdler Sally Pearson, herself due to travel to Britain in order to compete in the Olympic Games. &quot;She&apos;s quite susceptible to soft tissue injuries, muscle tears,&quot; Moody told Australian Associated Press. &quot;It&apos;s not exactly standard but neither is it unheard of,&quot; Webbon said. &quot;The idea is that it protects against changes in pressure in the air and any stress-related injury like swollen ankles that might result.&quot; Upon arrival in Britain on Friday, Black Caviar will be transferred to Newmarket to the Abington Place Stables that have in recent years become Britain&apos;s premier hotel for international runners. In charge of welcoming her will be the International Racing Bureau&apos;s Adrian Beaumont. &quot;It&apos;s my role to look after all of the horses and connections while they are over here and make sure that everything is the way they want it,&quot; he said. &quot;We started using Abington Place when a horse from Singapore called Bocelli came over [in 2001] for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Geoff Wragg was training there at the time and he had some isolated boxes which he kindly permitted us to use that allowed direct access from the yard to the Newmarket Heath without having to cross any roads or anything like that. &quot;The yard is now owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al Maktoum and used by Mike de Kock but they have allowed us to continue the arrangement. It&apos;s an ideal place and there is also a treadmill and a covered ride. All of the recent Ascot winners stayed there: Choisir, Scenic Blast, Miss Andretti.&quot; Black Caviar will be allowed a single gallop at Ascot in the buildup to the race but Moody appears to prefer the idea of staying in Newmarket. &quot;I don&apos;t want to have to train her,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;ll be no need to do anything major.&quot; Black Caviar regularly returns at odds of 1-20 or shorter at home, making the 1-2 available about her for Ascot seem almost generous, especially as the second-favourite, Bated Breath, is reportedly &quot;likely&quot; to go instead for the King&apos;s Stand Stakes on the opening day of the royal meeting. A procession might delight the travelling armies but British racing fans can only hope that the home challenge, likely to be headed by Hoof It and Society Rock, at least forces Black Caviar to find the top gear which the Australians believe makes her the best racehorse in the world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jun/06/olympics-2012-investigation", "sentences": ["You could, however, navigate by location (notably: only UK regions were provided, despite dozens coming from as far afield as China, Korea, the US and Singapore), name (at least three characters), or date."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-06T15:01:00Z", "title": "2012 Olympics investigation: the story behind the olympic sponsors", "tags": ["Data journalism", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic torch", "UK news", "Olympic Games"], "article": "When I stumbled across the section profiling the various torchbearers on the London2012 site (in search of route information and other Olympics data), I saw something that&apos;s essential in telling stories with data: human beings. People always help bring data to life, and the people carrying the Olympic torch, I thought, would provide a human angle to the Olympics. Who exactly were the 8,000 torchbearers? What picture did they paint of modern Britain? How did their stories compare to the &quot;inspirational&quot; legend painted by the Olympic PR machine? I also had a vague hunch. As sponsors play such a large role in the Olympics - from geographical &quot;exclusion zones&quot; where no other brands can be displayed to the renaming of stadia and signage - I guessed that they might get some of the allocation of &quot;inspirational&quot; torchbearers as well. But that was for later. First I had to get the data: the torchbearers data was published on a series of pages which were not linked in any easy way. You could, however, navigate by location (notably: only UK regions were provided, despite dozens coming from as far afield as China, Korea, the US and Singapore), name (at least three characters), or date. This last option allowed us to compile a list of links and go through those. The members of the Scraperwiki community - and Zarino Zappia in particular - chipped in and helped write a scraper that could gather the data effectively: firstly the basic data on each torchbearer (around 6,000), and later the linked &apos;nomination stories&apos; (around 5,900). With that data on hand, the first thing was to get a general overview. In Excel I generated a &apos;pivot table&apos; to total up counts of torchbearers&apos; ages - there seemed to be a lot of younger torchbearers, so I used an =IF formula to gather those into 10-year age bands. Indeed, it turned out that almost a quarter were in their teens.  I repeated the process for hometowns, and looked for outliers, discovering a 101-year-old torchbearer - two years older than the previously reported &quot;oldest torchbearer&quot; - who had only recently been named and not reported in the British media. That was my initial human angle, and I looked around for some more details on the individual to add some vital colour and context. Next: a local angle. Local media often celebrate their community, so I thought I&apos;d map the torchbearers of Nottingham, the most &apos;newsworthy&apos; of the top ten hometowns. This was done by simply importing the data into Fusion Tables after adding &quot;, UK&quot; to all the hometowns in Excel so that it didn&apos;t place any of the points in other countries. Later I used a list of Nottinghamshire towns to add another dozen or so torchbearers from the region. All this took less than an hour. With the simple colour stuff done, it was time to turn to the something a little harder. The Scraperwiki API allows you to ask questions of data in a more direct way, using queries. This is much quicker than using Excel (if you know how to write a SQL query - or even just how to search for tips), and allows you to see the results as a HTML table, or download them as separate CSV spreadsheets.  I tried looking for mentions of Olympic sponsors: McDonalds, Coca Cola, and so on. Then I browsed through the stories to see if anything jumped out. The first to jump out was a torchbearer whose nomination story was, unusually, written in the first person and appeared to largely consist of being &quot;engaged in the business of sport&quot; alongside the rather vague hope that by doing so they might have &quot;contributed to the development of sport in our country&quot;. This led me to focus my first efforts on the adidas dataset. And when I discovered that the same nomination story was actually being used by 7 of those torchbearers, I kept digging - the hunch being that, if they had all had the same story written for them, perhaps they shared something in common: for example, working for the company and being too busy to write their own story.  I managed to confirm that at least one did indeed work for adidas, as he had written on his LinkedIn profile about his nomination. Most of the others shared names with prominent and senior figures in the sports and retail business - and I passed those leads on to others in the Help Me Investigate Olympics network. Meanwhile, I wrote up the story of the adidas torchbearers, most of whose stories seemed to centre around their ability to sell product. While others chased responses from the sponsors, I continued to dig. Many sponsors had given torchbearer places to employees and others who had spent their lives raising money, volunteering, or who had achieved inspiring things in sport - which made the exceptions all the more striking: for ArcelorMittal, a billionaire who drew parallels between himself and an Olympian, and his son: nominated for his work in overseeing a corporate merger. For other sponsors: managing directors, CEOs and COOs; a PR strategist and a mobile phone salesman. A Brazilian food and drink magnate and a Russian deputy editor. The leads kept coming. Between the concerning stories were the quotidian ones: one BP nomination story appeared to suggest that the person was carrying the torch because of their hard work in marketing promotional items and &quot;[cleaning] the forecourt all the time&quot;; while Samsung&apos;s Jonghyuk Jeong had &quot;worked over 15 years at Samsung heavy industry shipbuilding yard in Geo Je do and he is doing hobby of taking a picture.&quot; But in the end these were the decoration around a much more serious story: of what exactly the Olympic torchbearers did represent, and how big corporations chose to interpret the &apos;Olympic spirit&apos;.

The first one was the more conventional: a typically blockbusting and spectacular story mission, in which you and your squad (in 2025, when the game is set), are escorting the (female) US president to a meeting at the Bonaventure Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles (in real life, a stone&apos;s throw from the LA Convention Centre where E3 takes place). Ambushed on the freeway (anyone who has ever been to LA more than once should know to steer well clear of the freeways in the vicinity of Downtown), your armoured vehicle hits an ambush \u2013 suddenly, helicopters are crashing around and over you, motorbikes are being catapulted to the ground level far below, and you and your party must proceed on foot. Amid the typical welter of chaos and gunfire \u2013 atmospherically speaking, Black Ops 2 throws kitchen-sink intensity at you, as is customary \u2013 your first task is to jump into another crashed vehicle and man a Stinger missile battery, in order to take down incoming hostile aircraft. Providing a first glimpse of the futuristic weaponry that Black Ops 2&apos;s 2025 setting allows Treyarch to have fun with, it was highly automated \u2013 you basically had to move it around until target-locks were achieved on incoming waves of fighter-planes, before unleashing a barrage of missiles.  The next portion of the mission introduced the element of choice which, while commonplace in other first-person shooters, is a first for CoD. Regrouping with your squad at the edge of the destroyed freeway, you&apos;re offered the option \u2013 simply by moving to different points \u2013 of staying on the freeway and providing sniper cover, or rappelling down to ground level for some more conventional CoD thick-of-the battle action. Choosing to snipe, another futuristic weapon was unveiled \u2013 a sniper with a scope that could heat-sense through metal and concrete, with the kick of a mule. We took out incoming enemies (directed to an extent by those on the ground) before rejoining the rest of the squad, proceeding with the president in tow on foot. General banter revealed that the villain behind the attack was called Menedez, and he had apparently achieved some sort of control over at least part of the US Army. All the while, the squad had been in contact with a woman called Anderson, flying an FA-38 hover-jet and providing air support. After commandeering another vehicle \u2013 cueing a sequence of on-rails shooting \u2013 another assault saw Anderson landing, before one of the LA Downtown skyscrapers came crashing down. With Anderson knocked out, it was up to us to jump into the FA-38, and fly around (again, a simple task of steering and targeting, with the computer controlling height-variations, making it much less fiddly to fly than, for example, the planes in Battlefield), taking out incoming planes. We ended up back on foot, amid an impressively wrecked Downtown LA \u2013 a fate that many would wish on one of the most unloved areas of the mega-city. Away from the story and into the sandbox     Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Photograph: Foo1;Foo2    Next up was a so-called Strikeforce mission \u2013 a complete (and therefore welcome) departure from anything we&apos;ve seen in the single-player element of a CoD game before. Indeed, it was much more reminiscent of the game&apos;s multiplayer side. Treyarch explained that is one of a number of missions that exist away from the main storyline arc, which can choose to play whenever you want. Not that they are totally separate \u2013 the single-player game&apos;s ending will vary according to whether you succeed or fail in the Strikeforce missions. And, for the first time in CoD, the Strikeforce missions (which are squad-based, so you have to work to keep at least some squad-members alive) introduce the concept of failure \u2013 no longer is it a case of merely respawning when you die. Set in Singapore&apos;s docks, the mission (entitled Keppel Terminal) set you and your squad the objective of working your way to a container ship, calling in an airstrike and destroying it. How you chose to achieve that was entirely up to you. You could take a completely hands-off approach, zooming out to an Overwatch view, setting waypoints for your squad (according to what enemies were incoming), and spawning items like machine-gun-equipped quad-copters, battlefield drones and the like to help them. Or you could zoom into any soldier or piece of battlefield kit and take direct control. Keppel Terminal may have lacked the cinematic Michael Bay spectaculars of the story missions, but it was every bit as intense, with waves of enemies and all the futuristic battlefield toys that you had access to thrown right back at you. The demonstrator jumped into battlefield drones, quad-copters and the like, and powered through multiple objectives, such as taking out missile defence systems in order to facilitate the air-strike at the end.  What was striking about Keppel Terminal \u2013 and presumably extends to all the Strikeforce missions \u2013 was that it required a strategic approach. Which, of course, has always been a feature of the various CoD games&apos; more sophisticated and elaborate multiplayer modes, but has never impinged on the single-player game \u2013 you&apos;ve always been told what to do and where to go in the past. If people still exist who play CoD strictly offline, the Strikeforce missions will introduce to the joys of online play. With the added bonus of adding a random element to the ending you&apos;ll get, which in turn adds another layer of replay value. Black Ops 2, then \u2013 even on the evidence of a mere two missions \u2013 adds a vast amount of gameplay diversity to the CoD blueprint, addressing the biggest recent criticism of the franchise. And it does so without letting the sometimes excruciating levels of intensity slip, even for a moment. In the past, Treyarch has been seen as the least talented of the two developers who take yearly turns at churning out CoD games, but it had to step up to the plate when Infinity Ward suffered its well-publicised meltdown. The added responsibility, it seems, suits it. If the rest of Black Ops 2 turns out as well as the two missions we saw, Infinity Ward will do well to match it. \u2022 Steve Boxer travelled to E3 with Activision"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jun/08/combating-procurement-fraud-africa", "sentences": ["Maybe that is why the UK is well behind Singapore and Hong Kong in Transparency International&apos;s national fraud league and not too far ahead of the United Arab Emirates, Barbados and Botswana."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-08T07:59:01Z", "title": "Combating procurement fraud in Africa and beyond", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Procurement", "Central government", "Local government"], "article": "Most African countries have a poor track record when it comes to combating procurement fraud. But there are signs that this could be changing \u2013 at least in South Africa. At the Global Africa Diaspora summit, held in Johannesburg in May, I ran a course on procurement fraud. One of the aims of the summit, which was supported by the African Union, is to encourage involvement in African affairs by Africans living outside the continent. Some of the delegates said that people were reluctant to invest in existing business \u2013 or to establish new ones \u2013 unless there was more certainty that money would be spent well and that procurement was based on the best suppliers, not corrupt systems. The first step in addressing procurement fraud is to admit that it is happening and to then take action against offenders. This appears to be happening in South Africa, where national newspapers have been highlighting alleged misdemeanours by senior officials. According to The Johannesburg Star, the Nehawu trade union has called for the temporary suspension of Humphrey Mmemezi, the member of the executive council for local government and housing in the Guateng province (which covers Johannesburg and Pretoria), pending investigation over alleged misuse of a corporate procurement card. The ANC is also calling for an investigation. While there have been some high-profile cases of individual abuse in the UK, a recent report from the National Audit Office said civil servants were able to abuse government-issued credit cards because of failure in oversight. South Africa&apos;s national police commissioner, General Bheki Cele, was suspended and a board of inquiry set up to investigate after he allegedly flouted tender processes in two lease deals for new police headquarters in Pretoria and Durban worth R1.7bn (about \u00a3125m) by influencing the outcome and ignoring the advice of the procurement personnel. The president of the South African Taxi Council, Jabulani Mthembu, was also expelled for claiming accommodation expenses in Pretoria when he already had a private residence there. Austin Liatu, the former Zambian business minister, was sentenced to two years for siphoning off $400,000 (\u00a3260,000) and burying it in trunks on his farm \u2013 he is on bail while appealing against the conviction. But we shouldn&apos;t get too smug. The National Fraud Authority reports that in the UK public sector, fraud is seven times more likely after contracts have been let than before. It is worth bearing in mind that the allegations against A4e, which has been cleared of fraud, related to the period after the contract was let. The UK public sector&apos;s inability to work in an integrated way when it comes to letting and managing contracts has been highlighted by the Office of Fair Trading&apos;s investigation into price fixing by construction companies. Local government, despite some excellent collaborations for construction remains far from having an overall co-ordinated approach and adequate contract management. The NHS seems even more fragmented. Even in central government, one senses that enthusiasm for genuine cross-working may be limited, despite the best efforts of the Efficiency and Reform Group. Why does this matter? Because fragmentation and a lack of independence of procurement organisations are a recipe for bad practice and corruption. Maybe that is why the UK is well behind Singapore and Hong Kong in Transparency International&apos;s national fraud league and not too far ahead of the United Arab Emirates, Barbados and Botswana. Despite the best efforts of the National Fraud Office, one senses some complacency among senior public officials \u2013 extending perhaps to the private sector \u2013 over this issue. In South Africa there seems to be increasing determination to stamp out fraud and corruption, and high-profile cases, such as the ones above, show that top officials are not immune from prosecution and disgrace. A good attendance and excellent participation from delegates from Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa and Mauritius on the combating fraud course was also an indication of how widely the issue is of interest.

The hugely popular mare, unbeaten in 21 races, was experiencing air travel for the first time when flown via Singapore and Sharjah, a trip that ended on Thursday night when she was led off a lorry into the stables at Newmarket, her home for the next fortnight as she is prepared for a race at Royal Ascot. &quot;She&apos;s very bright,&quot; said Peter Angus, the vet who travelled with her, in quotes reported by Australia&apos;s The Age newspaper. &quot;After a journey like this, they can be so tired that sometimes their eyes are dulled, but she&apos;s as bright as a button. &quot;She seems to have eaten and drunk on the flight and is in very good condition. She doesn&apos;t look to have lost much weight, looking over her hindquarters. The next couple of days will tell but she seems very settled and relaxed.&quot; Peter Moody, Black Caviar&apos;s trainer, remains in Australia for the time being but has sent two of his assistants with the horse and is receiving regular updates about her condition. &quot;That is what I think is the hard part of the trip out of the way,&quot; he told the local radio station RSN. &quot;She was a little tucked up there last night but nothing too bad. The vets were very happy with her feed and fluid intake on the trip. She didn&apos;t need anything intravenous, which was very pleasing. &quot;In previous trips with Magnus and Hinchinbrook [other Moody-trained horses who ran at Royal Ascot], we had to supply them with fluids when they arrived because they were a bit dehydrated, but she didn&apos;t appear to have that problem at all. Her temperature is good and she relieved herself quickly when she got there. &quot;She had a bit of a walk and [was] straight into her feed, a bit of water, a bit of hay and a good night&apos;s sleep, I&apos;d imagine.&quot; The odds against Black Caviar winning the Diamond Jubilee Stakes on 23 June have shortened to 4-9 from 1-2 in recent days. Though very short, those odds are still considerably longer than was available about her in her last eight races in Australia, when she has typically been 1-20 or shorter. There are doubts about the participation of Bated Breath, presently the second-favourite but more likely to contest the King&apos;s Stand Stakes at the Royal meeting. Hoof It, Society Rock and Krypton Factor are the most fancied horses expected to line up against Black Caviar, while the classy Moonlight Cloud may also take part."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/08/queens-jubilee-celebration-pure-fantasy", "sentences": ["The Queen&apos;s catchphrase \u2013 duty, not love \u2013 was smelted in the abdication crisis, when evil Uncle Useless married dirty Wallis, Duchess of the Singapore Grip, and they both went for tea with Hitler and toured a concentration camp."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-08T19:30:01Z", "title": "The Queen's jubilee was a celebration of pure fantasy", "tags": ["Queen's diamond jubilee", "The Queen", "Monarchy", "UK news", "Prince Philip", "Prince William"], "article": "The public discourse on the jubilee did not so much defy analysis as run screaming from it, presumably to hang itself on a string of bunting. Millions of words were written about a woman sitting for 60 years on an inherited throne, and most of them felt insane. The media eventually bashed itself round the head for its treatment of Princess Diana&apos;s mortification and deification \u2013 it wrote a story about the story \u2013 and this was the same but inverse: life, not death. Six million parties, said the Daily Mail \u2013 can that really be true? Who cares? It sounded true and most of the media felt like a manic depressive on an up day last weekend, so drunk with pomp that even the prime minister managed to look middle class. (Perhaps he planned it.) It was too much. Even HM looked embarrassed. How did they play it? The BBC chose light entertainment duh-speak and was punched by the rightwing press for lacking knowledge of every damp dignitary and seagull on the flotilla, which is fair comment if you want an intellectual framework poised over a reverse lynching. Where, they cried, were the superhero Dimblebys, flying through the air with their gravitas machines? That same rightwing press was so prostrate, so drooling, so repulsively horizontal that its coverage felt like a spoof, a four-day-long Chris Morris gag. When national newspapers and broadcasters fight over exactly how to kiss the royal arse, you wonder if the Enlightenment ever happened, and if we must really walk with the gods and monsters again. This courtier factionalism felt rather Tudor. Which Elizabethan age are we in, again? What is affection worth when it is so indiscriminate? I did pull one strand of meaning out, but it was entirely unconscious. When Prince Philip developed cystitis after standing in the rain \u2013 this was too much detail, although it passed for an international story in these crazy days, and I felt for him \u2013 the coverage swung, like a ghostly Britannia, from Beloved Queen to Cystitis Explained to Lonely Queen, positioned somewhere between Henry IV \u2013 &quot;Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown&quot; \u2013 and Ozymandias with big hair. Was it guilt? Because we did this to her? We placed a 26-year-old girl at the head of the state and made her a vessel \u2013 for what? Our own inadequacies, obviously. Even a perfectly sane friend of mine, when faced with the flesh-Queen as opposed to the dream-Queen said to her: &quot;I love you.&quot; It cannot be easy, reading your retrospective obituary at breakfast. Even so, the ecstasy accelerated. The phrase &quot;Elizabethist&quot; was coined. By Monday, no one looked more of a victim than the Queen. Some of this was marketing disguised as patriotism. Companies hurried to take out advertising, waving their products beneath a union flag. The demands of commerce have long been an argument for monarchy \u2013 Americans like it \u2013 and today the demands of commerce are all. It&apos;s a dud, though. By the same argument, you could institute a tyranny, because they make the bling canoes run on time. Whether it is really worth designing, or rather warping, a political system for tourist cash, I doubt, but if you are willing to commune around an elderly woman denied the company of her sick husband, why stop there? Why not reanimate King Arthur? Why not send for Merlin the Magician and the chick in the lake? Why not dance round a stone? More was sheer hack laziness: this was a bandwagon everyone was scared to jump off and, if you have a big story, your coverage must be madder than your rival. I awaited the headline &quot;Queen secretly invented string theory&quot;, but in the end had to live with &quot;Sex pest on Queen&apos;s barge&quot;, featuring a dude with a horribly intense stare. Republicans faced a silent enemy \u2013 as Michael White, who calls the Queen Sausage, wrote in this newspaper, wondering what the Queen read: &quot;With Sausage it is impossible to tell.&quot; Has she read The Art of War? So they were mocked. Not ignored, still less noted, but mocked, trounced. And why not, when so many republicans say stupid things, such as: Why can&apos;t David Attenborough be head of state since he looks a bit like the Queen in the dark? Better a real queen than a monarch manqu\u00e9. To embrace monarchy is to deny, absolutely, the very desire for equality. They are at poles, which is why the Queen always looks so odd when photographed with real \u2013 I mean merited \u2013 popular heroes, unless they are the ordinary glossy Wasps. I have never forgotten the shot of her with Ozzy Osbourne at the golden jubilee concert. It felt like worlds colliding, although Ozzy is perhaps not the best example. This, I think, is why equality has always sat so oddly in Britain and why it so easily ebbs away when we are not vigilant, which we are not. Inequality has been increasing for three decades and we are now one of the least equal countries in the developed world. That the Windsor family are unremarkable, except on or near a horse, is only more offensive. The Queen is not a fool; no wonder she said she felt humbled. There was much evidence of hierarchy during the jubilee weekend and there will be more at the Olympics, as we all squash behind the flag. (Best Olympic story so far: you can watch the private yachts on the river \u2013 for free!) The repulsive spectacle of jobseekers sleeping under bridges, the seven bridges on the Thames (out of the 13 the flotilla passed) closed except to &quot;invited guests&quot;, the alleys by the Thames closed too, except to the wealthy or well-connected, the wall of white wealth in the royal box and so on and on, all out of the past. The question, and it was not much asked, was why did this happen? Why were ordinary families, excepting charity representatives, the monarchy&apos;s goodness made flesh, excluded from the decent views? It was the wrong question. It should have been, given the circumstances: why doesn&apos;t it happen more often? If the person of the Queen were more frightening, the jubilee would be a cheap personality cult. But her good manners bespeak seeming reluctance, which is ever the aristocratic way in Britain. It is effective. It confuses us. If you prod the screaming, you see more evidence of regression \u2013 not the toys, which are obviously Georgian relics, but the behaviour. The vision of the Duchess of Cambridge practising wifely submission during her engagement interview while speaking in a fake posh voice haunts me; on subsequent engagements she spoke only of William, and then it&apos;s off to another \u00a33,000-a-night suite in paradise with a \u00a310,000 dress hanging off her shrinking frame. Of Kate&apos;s, or rather Queen Catherine&apos;s, future miseries, we can only guess: if you live by the mob, you will die by it. Prince Charles, with his 11 private secretaries and his fetish for interfering in government, is called Sir by everyone, except the Queen, whom he calls Mummy, in a parody of Little Britain dysfunction. We were all in on the joke at the concert; it got the biggest laugh of the night. Mummy? Really? The Queen is ever easy with autocrats. Last month she met the king of Bahrain, currently murdering his own subjects; this month it was the president of Sri Lanka, whose soldiers photograph their female Tamil victims naked and dead. People say you can guess the Queen&apos;s pleasure by the arc of her smile and so suppose she is some well-disguised agitator for human rights \u2013 read the signs! Well, she greeted this genocidaire as warmly as any. Forget the now-functioning monarchical press office, the brochures detailing good works, the announcement that William and Catherine&apos;s first child will inherit, girl or no, the faux friendship with the Beckhams and other newer gods; monarchy is always regressive. To have faith in it is to have no faith in our own reason and talent: we are, in Auden&apos;s phrase, &quot;children afraid of the night&quot;. The Queen&apos;s catchphrase \u2013 duty, not love \u2013 was smelted in the abdication crisis, when evil Uncle Useless married dirty Wallis, Duchess of the Singapore Grip, and they both went for tea with Hitler and toured a concentration camp. That most of the blame was laid at the divorcee&apos;s door is typical, a smidgeon of misogyny to a pinch of snobbery and xenophobia: better to say Wallis was a witch than admit that hereditary monarchy is inherently flawed and you do not always get what you pay for \u2013 allow me to present His Majesty the nutcase. Even Edward VIII&apos;s private secretary hoped the king would break his neck, which is not an endorsement of monarchy, from the inside. The jubilee was a moan, no more, for a benevolent autocracy, every bit as thoughtless and consuming as the celebrity culture, the anti-culture, that haunts the age. We face adult problems and, despite the vapid claim that the pageant cheered everyone up \u2013 how do you measure cheeriness? \u2013 we need adult solutions, not fantasies enjoyed from the age of plague and an heir who\u00a0says &quot;Mummy&quot;. Even so, the people came."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/08/mclaren-canadian-grand-prix-f1", "sentences": ["They also had a fuelling problem in Singapore last year, when Hamilton sat frustrated as his crew failed to get enough juice in the car to make a last run during qualifying, leaving him fourth on the grid."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-08T21:00:04Z", "title": "McLaren keep their cool in Canada despite spate of F1 problems", "tags": ["Formula One 2012", "McLaren", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport"], "article": "Agitation and fervour were in the air on Friday night in Montreal as students protesting against tuition fees and capitalism clashed with riot police, but this was in stark contrast to the calm at McLaren, a team under considerable pressure. A string of out-of -character errors have blighted their season, leaving them with much to prove here in Canada, at a circuit where they have cause to remember a mistake that came back to haunt them in Spain this year. The team, including drivers, have made 17 errors in the six races so far this season, from pit-stop problems, through clutch issues at Monaco to questionable strategy calls. But perhaps most damning was the failure to put enough fuel in Lewis Hamilton&apos;s car during qualifying at Barcelona. He had grabbed pole by almost half a second from his rivals but was dropped to the back of the grid for the fuel infringement. They had done the same at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve two years ago. Hamilton again aced pole but did not have enough fuel for the mandatory FIA test. He was reprimanded and the team fined but kept his position, going on to win the race, his second victory here. Soon afterwards, however, the rules were adjusted, stating that cars must return to the pits under their own power for a fuel sample to be taken, which the team fell foul of in Barcelona. They also had a fuelling problem in Singapore last year, when Hamilton sat frustrated as his crew failed to get enough juice in the car to make a last run during qualifying, leaving him fourth on the grid. The difference with where the team find themselves now, however, is that those were largely isolated incidents, not coming as part of a run of problems whose effects have been amplified to cost McLaren dearly. Before Monaco the team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, had said he was confident &quot;that the issues we&apos;ve had so far have been dealt with and are in the past&quot;. Then the clutch had Hamilton bogged down at the start, on a circuit where so often the car first into the first corner takes the win, as Mark Webber went on to prove. Hamilton, who has been coping with setbacks this year with far more aplomb than last, was beginning to show his frustration. &quot;I really dislike going backwards,&quot; he said. &quot;We haven&apos;t had a grand prix weekend where something hasn&apos;t gone wrong.&quot; Yet in the paddock at Montreal, there is no panic. There are no wholesale changes and the overwhelming impression is of a team going about their day job, confident that sticking at what they know will come good. Their course makes sense. F1 2012 is a different beast from the last two years. The diffuser ban has levelled the playing field between the top teams and the midfield while the ongoing quest to master the new Pirelli tyres has made that field all the more competitive. But it also means the margins are smaller. All the teams are looking at every aspect of their operations for any possible gains and at the sharp end these carry increased risk \u2013 walking a fine line between taking an advantage and the possibility of error. The harder they push the closer to the edge they go but while many crucial moments may go unnoticed after a win, failure is very public. The team&apos;s technical director, Paddy Lowe, is open about the team&apos;s problems but explains it is part and parcel of competing at the front end. &quot;Take the fuelling error in Spain, quite correctly we&apos;ve had a lot of criticism for that,&quot; he said, but with the qualification: &quot;If you want to find that final edge you&apos;ve got to run the car right on the limit, because there&apos;s not a lot of spare performance on the table. Not just McLaren but every team has had to move up a notch.&quot; Calm and considered, he epitomises the approach McLaren are taking to the difficult start to the season. The car is quick and the main problem, as with all the teams, has been optimising the car and drivers&apos; performance with the tyres. &quot;There&apos;s nothing fundamentally wrong with our philosophy, it&apos;s simply that we&apos;ve been caught out in one or two or three areas at a bad time,&quot; he said. &quot;We could not push things too hard and I don&apos;t think we would be who we are. It&apos;s in our nature to look for the very limits and that is the only way you can win and that inevitably involves taking some risks.&quot; His position is largely shared across the paddock. Just as there was widespread pleasure this year at Williams&apos;s win and Michael Schumacher&apos;s pole, McLaren&apos;s woes are widely seen as a fundamental part of racing. They have suffered more setbacks than usual, in a more concentrated period of time but rival team members also understand how hard they are pushing the risk-performance envelope and that sudden, drastic changes tend only to exacerbate the situation. Hamilton, who was fastest in both practice sessions on Friday in Canada, was over the Monaco disappointment and reflecting on the ethos that the team believe will, ultimately, bring the results to them but his team-mate, Jenson Button, suffered further frustration, managing only 12 laps in first practice and 14 in the second session due to a gearbox problem. &quot;I am just focusing on the racing,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;We are trying to improve our pit stops, trying to improve the car. There are areas where Jenson and I can improve. No distractions.&quot; Focus, fundamentals and for the moment at least, staying on track are crucial for McLaren, they will need them all this weekend."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jun/08/travel-writers-favourite-charming-airports", "sentences": ["I flew from London to Sydney with Singapore Airlines then boarded an Air Niugini jet after many vaccinations and a stiff brandy.", "Yet IPC has something that Heathrow and JFK and Singapore might envy."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-08T21:44:02Z", "title": "Travel writers' favourite tiny and unusual airports", "tags": ["Flights", "Adventure travel", "Travel", "Travel writing"], "article": "Anadyr airport, Russia, Marcel Theroux The most amazing airport I&apos;ve visited is Anadyr in Chukotka, northern Siberia. It was 1999, the pits of Russia&apos;s economic crisis. There were no baggage handlers. Instead, a group of small children helped carry our luggage from the grim arrivals hall to the dingy airport hotel. It turned out that 34 schoolchildren had been stranded at the hotel for more than a week. They sed to be on holiday in the Black Sea. There were 13 of them in one room, living on instant noodles and handouts from other passengers. I was trying to get to Provideniya, just across the Bering Strait from Alaska, but all my money was in dollars, which no one would accept. The head of the airline made a couple of phone calls and a man in a leather cap arrived carrying a brick of roubles wrapped in newspaper like a kilo of heroin. I&apos;m sure those children would have exchanged the chaos of the wild east for soulless corporate efficiency in a heartbeat, but Anadyr airport was a pretty accurate snapshot of where Russia was in 1999.\u2022 Marcel Theroux is a writer and broadcaster Nevis airport, Gary Buslik My favourite airport is on Nevis, a tiny eastern Caribbean island. It&apos;s not a shack any more. The terminal now has a separate customs room, so the agent, Reginald, can no longer chat it up with the ticket lady, Gloria. It also now has a little built-in snack booth, where Sandra sells potato chips, but this, too, is now out of chat range of her friends. In the previous terminal, which was indeed a shack, Sandra would just set up her card table next to Gloria, and everyone could see and talk to everyone else, including Osgood the taxi driver, who liked Sandra, and who would hang out there gossiping and occasionally buying a bag of chips. But the bureaucrats couldn&apos;t leave it alone. In their wisdom, a few years ago they decided to assert their collective manhood by building a two-storey control tower \u2013 ridiculous on the face of it, considering there&apos;s no other structure on the island taller than a goat \u2013 an expanded waiting and ticketing area, and a taxi-queuing area separated by a chain-link fence. Apparently they wanted a miniature version of New York&apos;s JFK International. But here&apos;s what happened. Gloria, Sandra, Reginald, and Osgood the taxi driver will have no part of that stupid control tower, or the expanded terminal, or the separate rooms \u2013 let alone the chain-link fence. They all still coalesce like wispy clouds around a Caribbean sunset in what was the exact layout of the old terminal, and to hell with bureaucrats. And sometimes a goat or two will wander in and join the little group, and Osgood will share his potato chips, and a perceptive stranger can almost see the outline of the former terminal shack and remind himself why he&apos;s here.\u2022 Gary Buslik&apos;s A Rotten Person Travels the Caribbean (Travelers Tales, \u00a38.99) won the Benjamin Franklin travel book of the year award in 2009.

Photograph: Alamy    Many Australian boys of my generation dreamed of an Errol Flynn moment of reckless macho adventure. My opportunity arose later in life when I abandoned &quot;Pudding Island&quot; (Britain) and set off for Papua New Guinea. Flynn had sailed there in 1926 at the age of 17 as a &quot;sanitation inspector&quot;, to teach the local people about personal hygiene. He would read Maeterlinck in the bath as a nubile sulky &quot;slave&quot; washed his back with fragrant herbs. Sounded intriguing. I flew from London to Sydney with Singapore Airlines then boarded an Air Niugini jet after many vaccinations and a stiff brandy. The approach to Port Moresby in the dry season is over arid, brown hills bereft of vegetation, and a polished turquoise sea. The old colonial terminal has faded lettering on the fibro huts; the modern terminal is enlivened by the emblem of Papua New Guinea, a bird of paradise over a drum and a spear. The walls are painted with spectacular murals of figures in tribal dress, the colours permanently assaulted by the claustrophobic heat. A Douglas DC-3 without engines lies abandoned beside a runway. The blast of desiccated air as you disembark is like a physical punch, gusts of the south-east trades instantly dry the mouth. These days you are no longer referred to as masta as your bags are unloaded. A sign in bold red lettering with an arrow reads: &quot;Travelling Passengers \u2013 All Weapons and Ammunition this Way.&quot; Welcome to modern Papua New Guinea, the greatest adventure and finest cultural experience of my life began at that unprepossessing airport.\u2022 Michael Moran is the author of Beyond the Coral Sea: Travels in the Old Empires of the South-West Pacific (HarperCollins, \u00a314.99) Landing strip, southern Ethiopia, Olivia Laing I don&apos;t know the name of my airport and I can&apos;t find it on a map. It&apos;s somewhere in the Borana rangelands of southern Ethiopia: a temporary landing strip hidden amid miles of thorn trees and dusty red earth. I came across it by accident. I&apos;d gone to Ethiopia in 2006 to report on a conference of global nomads. I travelled from Addis Ababa on a bus full of Irish journalists, Bedouins and Mursi tribesmen, all of them fizzing about Zinedine Zidane&apos;s head-butt in the World Cup final. Within hours, I had developed pneumonia and I spent the next week coughing and hallucinating in a nylon tent under an acacia. Eventually the conference organisers decided to ship me home. We drove into the bush to a clearing full of people gathered around a Twin Otter aircraft. The uniformed pilot gave me a Coke. Women were chivvying goats and children out of the way. As casual as a London cabbie, he turned on the engine and released the brake. We bounced down the strip, past greening trees. Already the people were walking away. Nothing about it was strange to them, though that flight has stayed with me ever since, unlikely as a fever dream.\u2022 Olivia Laing&apos;s first book, To the River (Canongate, \u00a38.99), was shortlisted for the 2012 Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje Prize Mal\u00e9 airport, the Maldives, Kari Herbert Mal\u00e9 airport in the Maldives is surely one of the loveliest in the world. The descent over the atolls set in an azure sea is breathtaking, as is the landing on the short strip of runway that sits just two metres above sea level. A short bus ride away is the seaplane terminal, which links Mal\u00e9 to most of the country&apos;s other islands. There you sit on white sofas in an open-sided lounge, overlooking the floating gangplanks to the &quot;gates&quot;. Barefoot pilots come and collect you and lead you to your brightly coloured seaplane. Magical.\u2022 Kari Herbert is the author of  The Explorer&apos;s Daughter (Penguin, \u00a36.99) an account of her childhood in the Arctic  Mataveri International, Easter Island, Pico Iyer A parking place is set aside for the island&apos;s judge, its governor. Otherwise, there&apos;s just about nothing outside this tiny terminal save a single totemic figure, looming above you in the dark. Three white crosses shine from a nearby hill. The rest is silence. A minibus waits to ferry a few passengers into the island&apos;s only town, with its 3,000 residents, nearby. Two men in flowered shirts and shorts hand out leis. I flew into Easter Island&apos;s Mataveri International \u2013 the remotest airport on the planet \u2013 in the last week of the old millennium. A handful of passengers stepped out of a LAN Chile jet, after a 2,300-mile trip, to be greeted by no shuttle buses, no glittery duty-free shops and no hotels. Only the wind whistling in our ears, the nearest inhabited settlement, Pitcairn Island (population 48), is 1,300 miles away. The runway at Mataveri was once meant to serve as an emergency landing strip for the space shuttle. Upon its opening, in 1968, the airport received exactly one flight a month. Yet IPC has something that Heathrow and JFK and Singapore might envy. Absolute peace and quiet \u2013 and no long lines at all at immigration.\u2022 Pico Iyer&apos;s latest book is The Man Within My Head (Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99) Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, Nepal, Isabella Tree Beneath the typical emerging-world chaos of Kathmandu&apos;s Tribhuvan International Airport in the Himalayas, there is magic \u2013 the dark undercurrents of the valley&apos;s tantric belief system seep through the red-brick facades of Arrivals and Departures, and that is why I love it. If there&apos;s a mechanical failure, engineers are summoned, of course, but if the problem persists a tantric priest is called too, to help rid the plane of mischief-making gremlins. During Dasain \u2013 the 15-day festival of the warrior goddess Durga \u2013 every Nepalese aircraft receives a sacrifice, its nose cone sprayed with jets of blood from the jugular of a black water buffalo or goat. Computers, fuse boxes, conveyor belts, escalators, every moving mechanical part receives a similar blessing in the belief that this will satisfy the bloodthirsty deities and prevent accidents in the year to come. Departing passengers are protected, too: they&apos;re loaded with amulets, marigold garlands and silk khatas. The foreheads of youngsters from the mountains, sturdy Gurkha men barely five feet tall, on their way to construction sites in the sandblasted deserts of the Arabian gulf, are stained with the gods&apos; vermilion farewells; clots of red rice tikas drop from their furrowed brows on to the check-in desk. And when dignitaries arrive they are garlanded by the pancha kumari, five beautiful young Nepali girls whose purpose is to bless the new arrival with the virtues of self-awareness and rightmindedness \u2013 prerequisites for a true appreciation of the treasures the Kathmandu valley holds in store.\u2022 Isabella Tree&apos;s latest book, Living Goddess \u2013 a journey into the heart of Kathmandu, is nearing completion after nearly a decade of research Belize City Municipal Airport, Kevin Rushby     Kevin Rusby (centre) at Belize City airport    We&apos;re lounging. A pair of pelicans float past, then a vulture family. It&apos;s a departure lounge where all airborne things are welcome. What seems amazing is that this is the capital city of Belize and we have three sofas outdoors under a sunshade next to a shimmering Caribbean lagoon. I love it. A local is talking to the pilot while we wait to fly to Ambergris Caye. &quot;Wha&apos;s goin&apos; down?&quot; &quot;Straight, man.&quot; Straight \u2013 with an incredible Caribbean dipthong \u2013 means &quot;fine&quot;. And it is fine. The pilot invites us to amble over to the plane. Someone fetches one more passenger from the small ticket office; another has to be called from the green wooden shack that is the bar, the Take-Off Tavern. I can see no other facilities. The pilot and I discuss green issues. He reckons we are burning less fossil fuel than if we went by road and boat. We board. The pelicans and vultures politely flap to one side. We depart and are immediately flying over the turquoise sea. Gander, Newfoundland, Canada, John Gimlette The dream of every Newfoundlander \u2013 that he sits at the centre of the world \u2013 is almost fulfilled in Gander. It&apos;s a strange cuckoo of an airport: a noisy intruder in a nest of bog and forest. Back in 1936, it was the biggest aerodrome in the world. But it was only ever a Transatlantic refuelling stop, and so there are no shopping plazas or fleets of hire cars. No one&apos;s ever wanted Gander for itself. That&apos;s a shame, in a way. Beyond the perimeter, you&apos;re in moose country, and amid tiny Victorian fishing villages, with icebergs clinking in the cove. These days, Gander is an emergency airstrip for the north Atlantic and often in the news. Its biggest moment was on 9/11, when 37 airliners arrived. Suddenly, there were another 7,000 mouths to feed, and Newfoundland ran out of nappies. The people have never forgotten that week when, just for a moment, the world had called by.\u2022 John Gimlette&apos;s books include Wild Coast (Profile Books, \u00a38.99) about his travels in Guyana South Pole Station, Antarctica, Sara Wheeler Is the South Pole the only airfield in the world where pilots can&apos;t shut their engines down? It&apos;s too cold. You land on skis on blue ice, and the plane&apos;s four engines blast away while the crew refuel wearing ear defenders \u2013 no joke at -45C. But the view! A glittering ice sheet that extends for 1,000 miles, and light like the inside of a fridge. At 2,850m, the airstrip stands on a layer of ice almost a third the height of Mount Everest. This, combined with the fact that the earth&apos;s atmosphere is at its most shallow at the poles, means that you only receive half your normal oxygen supply. This is an airport that makes your heart beat faster, literally as well as metaphorically.\u2022 Sara Wheeler&apos;s books include Cherry: A Life of Apsley Cherry-Garrard (Vintage, \u00a39.99)  Kabul airport, Afghanistan, Tahir Shah Daydreams and nightmares are the currency of Kabul airport, a realm awash with raw adrenaline, lost hope and off-the-scale corruption. For those flying out, the Afghan capital&apos;s airport has a warm hazy aura. Get to the ramshackle departure lounge and you&apos;ve run a terrifying gauntlet. By the time you reach the broken plastic chairs on the upper level, and the stall selling Marboros, flat Perrier and stale Pringles, you&apos;ve most likely been threatened and patted down hard. A stream of crooked officials are on standby, eager to coax stray weaponry from your underwear. And they&apos;ll gladly extract a few last dollars too (no worn bills, please) for the privilege of a boarding card. For those landing at Kabul airport, entering the squalid belly of the terminal building is like stepping into a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie: guns, guns, and more guns \u2013 most of them strapped to towering mercenary types with blonde ponytails and cast-iron jaws. The last time I flew out of Kabul, my film crew and I were relieved of all our Super 16 exposed film \u2013 a month&apos;s work. The reason? We didn&apos;t have $20,000 in cash for a last-minute bribe.\u2022 Tahir Shah&apos;s latest book is Travels With Myself (Mosa\u00efque Books, \u00a311.99) Bamako airport, Mali, Lindsay Hawdon It was 2am when I arrived at Bamako airport, a lone female stepping on to warm tarmac, the air hot and humid, the night so black I couldn&apos;t see the surrounding savannah grasses, though I could hear the tick of cicadas and the creaking of acacia trees. The airport looked like a bus shelter. Inside it smelt of sweat and earth and remnants of disinfectant. I was everyone&apos;s sister. &quot;You need nice place to stay, sister?&quot; the man at customs asked. &quot;You need good driver, sister?&quot; said the man at baggage claim. The conveyor belt broke down twice and we all waited with that insouciant timelessness that exists in sub-Saharan Africa. The luggage was tattered and worn, bursting at the seams, broken zips taped over to stop the contents spilling out. People jostled, pushed, heaved their luggage over each others&apos; feet. I headed towards the rowdy crowd at the entrance, where smiling touts, chaotic and loud, were fighting for space. A banana was shoved in my face, a slinky, an XXL T Shirt that read I \u2764 Mali. Music crackled out from a ghettoblaster. A man was dancing. &quot;Sister, sister \u2026 You want \u2026? You need \u2026? You like \u2026?&quot;\u2022 Lindsay Hawdon blogs about her travels in the Far East and Australia with two small children at lhawdon.co.uk Tempelhof, Tegel and Sch\u00f6nefeld, Berlin, Rory MacLean Berlin had three of the world&apos;s most iconic airports. Tempelhof was the vast &quot;mother of all airports&quot; according to architect Norman Foster. With its facades of shell limestone and vast arrivals hall flanked by cold stone eagles (beneath which Messerschmitt fighters had once been assembled) it remains the most stunning example of fascist monumental architecture. Orville Wright, Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Adolph Hitler and John F Kennedy plus a hundred thousand &quot;candy bombers&quot; all flew through it. It&apos;s now open to the public for walking and cycling on the runways. Tegel, the continent&apos;s cosiest and most convenient city airport, was built in three breathless months by 17,000 West Berliners to defeat Stalin&apos;s attempt to starve the city during the Berlin blockade. Sch\u00f6nefeld, an ugly and haphazard communist relic, limped into the modern age only because of landing fees paid by easyJet and Ryanair. For much of the past 50 years all three operated together but next year they will be replaced by glittering, efficient Berlin Brandenburg Willy Brandt, Europe&apos;s newest airport, with speedy transfers, posh shops and its own six-track subterranean railway station.

Let&apos;s double check.&quot; So off he pads down the hallway, opens his door and has a look. Waving the photographer off, he points in the distance across the Slovenian capital. &quot;Over there, that&apos;s a kind of counter-culture establishment \u2013 they hate me, I hate them. This is the type of leftists that I hate. Radical leftists whose fathers are all very rich.&quot; Most of the other buildings, he adds, are government ministries. &quot;I hate it.&quot; Now he&apos;s back in the living room, a clinically tidy little sliver of functional space lacking any discernible aesthetic, the only concessions being a poster for the video game Call Of Duty: Black Ops, and a print of Joseph Stalin. \u017di\u017eek pours Coke Zero into plastic McDonald&apos;s cups decorated in Disney merchandising, but when he opens a kitchen cupboard I see that it&apos;s full of clothes. &quot;I live as a madman!&quot; he exclaims, and leads me on a tour of the apartment to demonstrate why his kitchen cabinets contain only clothing. &quot;You see, there&apos;s no room anywhere else!&quot; And indeed, every other room is lined, floor to ceiling, with DVDs and books; volumes of his own 75 works, translated into innumerable languages, fill one room alone. If you have read all of \u017di\u017eek&apos;s work, you are doing better than me. Born in 1949, the Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic grew up under Tito in the former Yugoslavia, where suspicions of dissidence consigned him to academic backwaters. He came to western attention in 1989 with his first book written in English, The Sublime Object of Ideology, a re-reading of \u017di\u017eek&apos;s great hero Hegel through the perspective of another hero, the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Since then there have been titles such as Living in the End Times, along with films \u2013 The Pervert&apos;s Guide To Cinema \u2013 and more articles than I can count. By the standards of cultural theory, \u017di\u017eek sits at the more accessible end of the spectrum \u2013 but to give you an idea of where that still leaves him, here&apos;s a typical quote from a book called \u017di\u017eek: A Guide for the Perplexed, intended to render him more comprehensible: &quot;\u017di\u017eek finds the place for Lacan in Hegel by seeing the Real as the correlate of the self-division and self-doubling within phenomena.&quot; At the risk of upsetting \u017di\u017eek&apos;s fanatical global following, I would say that a lot of his work is impenetrable. But he writes with exhilarating ambition and his central thesis offers a perspective even his critics would have to concede is thought-provoking. In essence, he argues that nothing is ever what it appears, and contradiction is encoded in almost everything. Most of what we think of as radical or subversive \u2013 or even simply ethical \u2013 doesn&apos;t actually change anything. &quot;Like when you buy an organic apple, you&apos;re doing it for ideological reasons, it makes you feel good: &apos;I&apos;m doing something for Mother Earth,&apos; and so on. But in what sense are we engaged? It&apos;s a false engagement. Paradoxically, we do these things to avoid really doing things. It makes you feel good. You recycle, you send \u00a35 a month to some Somali orphan, and you did your duty.&quot; But really, we&apos;ve been tricked into operating safety valves that allow the status quo to survive unchallenged? &quot;Yes, exactly.&quot; The obsession of western liberals with identity politics only distracts from class struggle, and while \u017di\u017eek doesn&apos;t defend any version of communism ever seen in practice, he remains what he calls a &quot;complicated Marxist&quot; with revolutionary ideals. To his critics, as one memorably put it, he is the Borat of philosophy, churning out ever more outrageous statements for scandalous effect. &quot;The problem with Hitler was that he was not violent enough,&quot; for example, or &quot;I am not human. I am a monster.&quot; Some dismiss him as a silly controversialist; others fear him as an agitator for neo-Marxist totalitarianism. But since the financial crisis he has been elevated to the status of a global-recession celebrity, drawing crowds of adoring followers who revere him as an intellectual genius. His popularity is just the sort of paradox \u017di\u017eek delights in because if it were down to him, he says, he would rather not talk to anyone. You wouldn&apos;t guess so from the energetic flurry of good manners with which he welcomes us, but he&apos;s quick to clarify that his attentiveness is just camouflage for misanthropy. &quot;For me, the idea of hell is the American type of parties. Or, when they ask me to give a talk, and they say something like, &apos;After the talk there will just be a small reception&apos; \u2013 I know this is hell. This means all the frustrated idiots, who are not able to ask you a question at the end of the talk, come to you and, usually, they start: &apos;Professor \u017di\u017eek, I know you must be tired, but \u2026&apos; Well, fuck you. If you know that I am tired, why are you asking me? I&apos;m really more and more becoming Stalinist. Liberals always say about totalitarians that they like humanity, as such, but they have no empathy for concrete people, no? OK, that fits me perfectly. Humanity? Yes, it&apos;s OK \u2013 some great talks, some great arts. Concrete people? No, 99% are boring idiots.&quot; Most of all, he can&apos;t stand students. &quot;Absolutely. I was shocked, for example, once, a student approached me in the US, when I was still teaching a class \u2013 which I will never do again \u2013 and he told me: &apos;You know, professor, it interested me what you were saying yesterday, and I thought, I don&apos;t know what my paper should be about. Could you please give me some more thoughts and then maybe some idea will pop up.&apos; Fuck him! Who I am to do that?&quot; \u017di\u017eek has had to quit most of his teaching posts in Europe and America, to get away from these intolerable students. &quot;I especially hate when they come to me with personal problems. My standard line is: &apos;Look at me, look at my tics, don&apos;t you see that I&apos;m mad? How can you even think about asking a mad man like me to help you in personal problems, no?&apos;&quot; You can see what he means, for \u017di\u017eek cuts a fairly startling physical figure \u2013 like a grizzly bear, pawing wildly at his face, sniffing and snuffling and gesticulating between every syllable. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t work! They still trust me. And I hate this because \u2013 this is what I don&apos;t like about American society \u2013 I don&apos;t like this openness, like when you meet a guy for the first time, and he&apos;s starting to tell you about his sex life. I hate this, I hate this!&quot; I have to laugh at this, because \u017di\u017eek brings up his sex life within moments of our first meeting. On the way up in the lift he volunteers that a former girlfriend used to ask him for what he called &quot;consensual rape&quot;. I had imagined he would want to discuss his new book about Hegel, but what he really seems keen to talk about is sex. &quot;Yeah, because I&apos;m extremely romantic here. You know what is my fear? This postmodern, permissive, pragmatic etiquette towards sex. It&apos;s horrible. They claim sex is healthy; it&apos;s good for the heart, for blood circulation, it relaxes you. They even go into how kissing is also good because it develops the muscles here \u2013 this is horrible, my God!&quot; He&apos;s appalled by the promise of dating agencies to &quot;outsource&quot; the risk of romance. &quot;It&apos;s no longer that absolute passion. I like this idea of sex as part of love, you know: &apos;I&apos;m ready to sell my mother into slavery just to fuck you for ever.&apos; There is something nice, transcendent, about it. I remain incurably romantic.&quot; I keep thinking I should try to intervene with a question, but he&apos;s off again. &quot;I have strange limits. I am very \u2013 OK, another detail, fuck it. I was never able to do \u2013 even if a woman wanted it \u2013 annal sex.&quot; Annal sex? &quot;Ah, anal sex. You know why not? Because I couldn&apos;t convince myself that she really likes it. I always had this suspicion, what if she only pretends, to make herself more attractive to me? It&apos;s the same thing for fellatio; I was never able to finish into the woman&apos;s mouth, because again, my idea is, this is not exactly the most tasteful fluid. What if she&apos;s only pretending?&quot; He can count the number of women he has slept with on his hands, because he finds the whole business so nerve-racking. &quot;I cannot have one-night stands. I envy people who can do it; it would be wonderful. I feel nice, let&apos;s go, bang-bang \u2013 yes! But for me, it&apos;s something so ridiculously intimate \u2013 like, my God, it&apos;s horrible to be naked in front of another person, you know? If the other one is evil with a remark \u2013 &apos;Ha ha, your stomach,&apos; or whatever \u2013 everything can be ruined, you know?&quot; Besides, he can&apos;t sleep with anyone unless he believes they might stay together for ever. &quot;All my relationships \u2013 this is why they are very few \u2013 were damned from the perspective of eternity. What I mean with this clumsy term is, maybe they will last.&quot; But \u017di\u017eek has been divorced three times. How has he coped with that? &quot;Ah, now I will tell you. You know the young Marx \u2013 I don&apos;t idealise Marx, he was a nasty guy, personally \u2013 but he has a wonderful logic. He says: &apos;You don&apos;t simply dissolve marriage; divorce means that you retroactively establish that the love was not the true love.&apos; When love goes away, you retroactively establish that it wasn&apos;t even true love.&quot; Is that what he did? &quot;Yes! I erase it totally. I don&apos;t only believe that I&apos;m no longer in love. I believe I never was.&quot; As if to illustrate this, he glances at his watch; his 12-year-old son, who lives nearby, will be arriving shortly. How is this going to work when he gets here? Don&apos;t worry, \u017di\u017eek says, he&apos;s bound to be late \u2013 on account of the tardiness of his mother: &quot;The bitch who claims to have been my wife.&quot; But weren&apos;t they married? &quot;Unfortunately, yes.&quot; \u017di\u017eek has two sons \u2013 the other is in his 30s \u2013 but never wanted to be a parent. &quot;I will tell you the formula why I love my two sons. This is my liberal, compassionate side. I cannot resist it, when I see someone hurt, vulnerable and so on. So precisely when the son was not fully wanted, this made me want to love him even more.&quot; By now I can see we&apos;re not going to get anywhere near \u017di\u017eek&apos;s new book about Hegel, Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism. Instead, he tells me about the holidays he takes with his young son. The last one was to the Burj Al Arab hotel, a grotesque temple to tacky ostentation in Dubai. &quot;Why not? Why not? I like to do crazy things. But I did my Marxist duty. I got friendly with the Pakistani taxi driver who showed to me and my son reality. The whole structure of how the workers there live was explained, how it was controlled. My son was horrified.&quot; This summer they are off to Singapore, to an artificial island with swimming pools built on top of 50-storey skyscrapers. &quot;So we can swim there and look down on the city: &apos;Ha ha, fuck you.&apos; That&apos;s what I like to do \u2013 totally crazy things.&quot; It wasn&apos;t so much fun when his son was younger. &quot;But now, we have a certain rhythm established. We sleep &apos;til one, then we go to breakfast, then we go to the city \u2013 no culture, just consumerism or some stupid things like this \u2013 then we go back for dinner, then we go to a movie theatre, then we play games &apos;til three in the morning.&quot; I wonder what all \u017di\u017eek&apos;s earnest young followers will make of this, and worry they will be cross with me for not getting anything more serious out of him. But to \u017di\u017eek, Dubai tells us just as much about the world as a debate about the deficit, say, ever can. When his sweet-looking, polite young son arrives, I try to steer \u017di\u017eek on to the financial crisis, and to the role his admirers hope he will play in formulating a radical response. &quot;I always emphasise: don&apos;t expect this from me. I don&apos;t think that the task of a guy like me is to propose complete solutions. When people ask me what to do with the economy, what the hell do I know? I think the task of people like me is not to provide answers but to ask the right questions.&quot; He&apos;s not against democracy, per se, he just thinks our democratic institutions are no longer capable of controlling global capitalism. &quot;Nice consensual incremental reforms may work, possibly, at a local level.&quot; But localism belongs in the same category as organic apples, and recycling. &quot;It&apos;s done to make you feel good. But the big question today is how to organise to act globally, at an immense international level, without regressing to some authoritarian rule.&quot; How will that happen? &quot;I&apos;m a pessimist in the sense that we are approaching dangerous times. But I&apos;m an optimist for exactly the same reason. Pessimism means things are getting messy. Optimism means these are precisely the times when change is possible.&quot; And what are the chances that things won&apos;t change? &quot;Ah, if this happens then we are slowly approaching a new apartheid authoritarian society. It will not be \u2013 I must underline this \u2013 the old stupid authoritarianism. This will be a new form, still consumerist.&quot; The whole world will look like Dubai? &quot;Yes, and in Dubai, you know, the other side are literally slaves.&quot; There is something inexplicably touching about all \u017di\u017eek&apos;s mischievous bombast. I hadn&apos;t expected him to be so likable, but he really is hilariously good company. I had hoped to find out if he was a genius or a lunatic \u2013 but I fear I leave none the wiser. I ask him how seriously he would recommend we take him, and he says he would rather be feared than taken for a clown. &quot;Most people think I&apos;m making jokes, exaggerating \u2013 but no, I&apos;m not. It&apos;s not that. First I tell jokes, then I&apos;m serious. No, the art is to bring the serious message into the forum of jokes.&quot; Two years ago his front teeth came out. &quot;My son knows I have a good friend; none of us is gay, just good friends. So when he saw me without teeth, he said: &apos;I know why.&apos; My son! He was 10! You know what he told me? Think, associate, in the dirtiest way.&quot; I think I can guess. &quot;Yes! Sucking! He said my friend complained that my teeth were in the way.&quot; \u017di\u017eek roars with laughter, great gales of paternal pride. &quot;And you know what was tragicomic? After he told me this, he said: &apos;Father, did I tell this joke well?&apos;&quot; A 24-hour launch event for Less Than Nothing takes place on 15 June at Cafe Oto, London. versobooks.com."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2012/jun/11/datacentres-risks-implications", "sentences": ["&quot;This way, I don&apos;t have to buy and build infrastructure in Qatar, the Czech Republic or Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-10T23:01:00Z", "title": "Datacentres: risks and wider implications", "tags": ["Cloud", "Media & Tech Network"], "article": "Locals used to call it &quot;the white elephant&quot;: a giant semiconductor factory as large as Heathrow Terminal 5, lying just off the M4 motorway between Cardiff and Newport. The threestorey building was built back in the late 1990s by LG Electronics but never used by the firm, standing empty for over a decade. Today, it is one of Europe&apos;s largest datacentres, NGD Europe. Now in its third year of operations, the company that runs it, Next Generation Data, is seeing growing interest from cloud providers looking for a place to house the systems that power their services, says CEO Nick Razey. In February 2012, for example, BT announced plans to build a second 929 square-metres (10,000sq ft) data hall at the facility, due in part to rising demand among business customers for its cloud offerings. While giants such as Amazon and Google may prefer to build their own datacentres, says Razey, &quot;plenty of other cloud companies find that leasing secure, scalable space in third-party facilities is more economical, especially when they&apos;re testing the European market&quot;. He expects cloud services to be a major driver of business in the next few years. Despite its small geographic footprint, the UK is home to one of the largest datacentre markets in the world, boasting some 7.6 million square-metres of datacentre space, according to research conducted last year by analyst firm DatacentreDynamics. The company&apos;s analysts expect \u00a32.19bn to be invested in UK datacentres this year. But while cloud services are often presented as a &quot;greener&quot; alternative to running applications and services in house, it takes a lot of energy to keep the UK&apos;s datacentres running. DatacentreDynamics&apos; research also reveals that British datacentres consume 6.4 gigawatts of power annually \u2013 enough to power 6m homes \u2013 and that is set to increase by 6.7% over the next year. It&apos;s a major concern for environmental action charity Greenpeace, which recently scored a number of leading cloud providers on the amount of &quot;clean&quot; energy they use and their transparency about the ecoefficiency of their datacentres. &quot;Three of the largest IT companies building their businesses around the cloud \u2013 Amazon, Apple and Microsoft \u2013 are all rapidly expanding without adequate regard to the source of electricity, and rely heavily on dirty energy to power their clouds,&quot; says Greenpeace in the report, How Clean is Your Cloud?But Yahoo and Google were praised by the report&apos;s authors: &quot;Both continue to lead the sector in prioritising access to renewable energy in their cloud expansion, and both have become more active in supporting policies to drive renewable energy investment.&quot; A new Google datacentre in Finland, for example, is based in a former paper mill and the systems it houses are cooled by both the low ambient air temperatures in the region and a seawater cooling system fed by the Gulf of Finland. Facebook, meanwhile, is to spend $700m (\u00a3433m) on a datacentre in Lulea, Sweden, on a site just 62 miles south of the Arctic Circle. It makes sound business sense for cloud companies to prioritise datacentre energy use but, at the same time, they must also deliver premium levels of reliability, availability and security for the systems they house. For that reason, a tiering system from one to four is used to score datacentres. Tier four offers maximum levels of storage which entails, for example, having duplicated systems for cooling, power, network links with redundancy built into the infrastructure and compartmentalised security zones controlled by biometric access control methods. NGD Europe, which is a tier three facility, is based on a Californian earthquakeproof design and has triple-skinned walls, bomb-proof glass and anti-ram defences. The site is situated away from flight paths and flood plans and is patrolled by ex-military security personnel. &quot;We absolutely don&apos;t take any chances. We can&apos;t afford to as a business,&quot; says Razey. Private cloud: Global gains At recruitment company Reed, head of IT services Sean Whetstone is no fan of the &quot;marketing bandwagon&quot; that surrounds cloud computing. And he certainly isn&apos;t comfortable with the idea of storing confidential information about the company&apos;s clients and candidates on third-party systems.  But Reed is undoubtedly using cloud computing, in the form of a &quot;private cloud&quot;, based across three datacentres, two in the UK and one in Australia.  A private cloud is where a company uses virtualisation technologies to create a single, flexible &quot;pool&quot; of computing and storage resource within its own IT infrastructure \u2013 and it&apos;s a model of deployment that analysts at IT market research firm Gartner recently predicted would grow tenfold in 2012.  Using this private cloud, Reed employees at 400 sites worldwide can access all the applications and services they need using thin-terminal devices, which rely on more powerful computers and servers for processing power. &quot;This way, I don&apos;t have to buy and build infrastructure in Qatar, the Czech Republic or Singapore. I just need to send over thin terminals to plug into our network, provided by Azzuri, and they can access everything they need,&quot; says Whetstone. &quot;It&apos;s like a branch office in a box, a pop-off office.&quot; That includes all desktop applications and IP telephony services, too, so there&apos;s no software installed or maintained at remote branch offices.  &quot;In my view, the cost benefits of public cloud services for large, established companies are really only compelling if your existing internal infrastructure is very inefficient,&quot; says Whetstone.  Using virtualisation technologies to create a private cloud has enabled Whetstone to create huge economies that a third-party cloud provider would find hard to match, he argues, and underpinning that private cloud with a dedicated, managed network, means remote users experience good performance when accessing applications and services from that cloud.JT Mobile apps: Cloud cover By Tim Anderson Growing use of cloud computing means users want apps in order to tap into the power of the cloud on their increasingly powerful connected mobile devices. The result is that software developers are under pressure to come up with mobile apps, both for business users and for consumers.  Meeting that demand confronts developers, or those who commission the apps, with hard questions. Apple&apos;s iOS, the operating system for iPhones and iPads, is very different from Google&apos;s Android, and the systems in other devices such as RIM&apos;s Blackberry and Microsoft&apos;s Windows Phone are different again. It is not only a matter of converting the code, but also getting the design right.  &quot;A client asked us to take an iPhone app we&apos;d developed for them and make a version for Android. Our initial experiments showed us that we had to completely rethink the experience design from scratch to get a decent Android app,&quot; blogged Martin Fowler of software development company ThoughtWorks. This kind of friction has far reaching consequences, making it hard for smaller mobile platforms to compete and hard for businesses to support all their potential users. There is a significant mitigating factor though, which is that all smartphones and tablets have powerful mobile web browsers. The latest web specifications, called HTML 5, allow developers to create web apps that are almost as powerful as those written for the native code of each mobile platform. There are also hybrid approaches such as Adobe&apos;s PhoneGap, where web apps are packaged as native apps, reducing the effort of supporting multiple platforms.  Will web apps take over? &quot;Native applications can adhere to the norms and culture of a platform whereas non-native applications, such as web apps, cannot (although they may try to emulate them). Whether or not this is important for your app depends on what your app does,&quot; says mobile consultant Aral Balkan. Native apps are here to stay, but HTML 5 is increasingly viable as a cross-platform alternative.

Shares in London and major European markets moved sharply higher when trading opened and the euro climbed to a three-week high, at $1.2643. Spain&apos;s Ibex index initially raced ahead by more than 5% and the yield, or interest rate, on its government bonds also fell sharply, reducing the country&apos;s cost of borrowing. However, the euphoria was short-lived, with Spanish shares down 0.54% by the close and the Italian market down 2.79%. Spanish yields moved above 6.5% once more while Italy&apos;s rose to 6.03%. The pattern was the same in London, where the FTSE 100 index jumped nearly 100 points in the first minute of trading, gaining 1.8%, but closed down 2.71 points at 5432.37 as enthusiasm for the Spanish bailout subsided. Germany&apos;s Dax bucked the trend, edging up 0.17% but France&apos;s CAC closed down 0.29%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 30 points lower by the close of trading in London. In Asia, markets had also rallied, with Japan&apos;s Nikkei climbing nearly 2% to 8624.90. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng added 2.4% to 18,937.53 while the Straits Times index in Singapore rose 1.5% to 2779.97. Brent crude futures rose more than $2 to $102.21 a barrel, while US crude touched $86.64 a barrel. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK, had predicted that the market rally was &quot;likely to be no more than a relief pop&quot;. There remain &quot;a number of unanswered questions&quot;, he said, such as the problem of where the \u20ac100bn is coming from \u2013 the soon-to-be-retired EFSF or the new European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which is due to come into effect in July. &quot;This will be important given that if the money comes from the ESM any creditors will have preferred status, which will subordinate existing bond holders and thus have the unintended effect of making Spain&apos;s funding difficulties much worse, as investors will be reluctant to expose themselves to the added risk of finding themselves at the back of the queue, in the event of a potential future restructuring if Spain&apos;s problems get worse with a deteriorating economic outlook.&quot; Spain&apos;s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, attempted to portray the cash lifeline for Spain&apos;s troubled banking sector as a triumph. Speaking hours before flying to Poland to watch Spain&apos;s football team play its first match of Euro 2012, Rajoy proclaimed that the &quot;credibility of the euro won&quot; following Saturday&apos;s bank bailout, funded by eurozone countries. But with Greece returning to the polls on Sunday, the crisis engulfing the eurozone is far from over amid speculation that the absence of tough conditions attached to the loans being readied for Spain could give ammunition to attempts by Greece, Ireland or Portugal to renegotiate the terms of their bailouts. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: &quot;[Apart from Spain] the other major worry is not only the Greek elections this weekend which could be their last as a eurozone member, but Italy which is seen as the next in line for a possible bailout.&quot; Reports on Reuters that European finance ministers had looked at radical measures such as border controls or limiting cash machine withdrawals in the event of Greece leaving the euro also unsettled the markets."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/14/1", "sentences": ["P17Manchester United eyes US listing in blow to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-14T08:30:37Z", "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "tags": ["Media"], "article": "Top stories on MediaGuardian.co.uk     David Cameron to bring in new guidelines for how ministers and special advisers operate during quasi-judicial decisions.

All in a day&apos;s work for the millions of people in this country registered with online dating sites, but not something I ever expected to find myself doing in the pursuit of cycling fun. Yet there I was, stalking the &quot;recently joined members&quot; pages of cyclingbuddy.com, sending &quot;buddy requests&quot; out into the ether and trying to formulate non-suggestive initial emails to people whose profiles say things like, &quot;I enjoy long, hard rides.&quot; The idea of the website, which launched in March, is to link cyclists up with other cyclists in their area, whether for training runs, mountain biking or (and this is my particular area of interest) pootling around having a nice time. Once you&apos;ve met up with your new buddy, you&apos;re encouraged to log your ride, making it available for other members to view and download as a GPX file if they fancy following in your tracks. It&apos;s free and already has over 3,000 members in the UK (plus several hundred more in another 16 countries). As a Londoner, I&apos;m spoiled for choice when it comes to potential &quot;buddies&quot;, with hundreds of members based within a few kilometres of where I live. It&apos;s slimmer pickings in more remote places, as you&apos;d expect, but even so, you&apos;re likely to find someone to go cycling with wherever you are. I was keen to try it out because although recreational cycling is high on my to-do list, I tend to use my bike for getting around town and nothing else. Very few of my friends are interested in cycling for its own sake and the idea of heading out on long rides on my own doesn&apos;t really tempt me. Cycling Buddy, I decided, would spur me to action. And so it has proved. Over the past few weeks I&apos;ve gone cycling with three new people, meeting up on weekend mornings which I otherwise would have spent lazing around. With Jaron, a graphic designer from Singapore, I got lost in Leyton while exploring the area around the Olympic Park. Then financial advisor and tango aficionado Jeanne and I braved the rain to join the Go Dutch Big Ride in central London \u2013 like many people, Jeanne is nervous of cycling in the centre of town, so we met up in Hackney and travelled in together, taking it nice and slow and avoiding the busiest roads. My most recent meet-up was even more sedate: a couple of hours spent cycling around Hyde Park with Avril, a business advisor who also happens to be the mother of British road racing champion David Millar (the only British rider to have worn all the Tour de France jerseys, Avril tells me proudly, as we try to avoid irritating the stewards of the charity walk taking place in the park that day). Avril has been close to the world of cycling for years of course (her daughter and daughter-in-law are also involved in the sport), but has only decided to have a go herself very recently. Like me, she&apos;s hoping that Cycling Buddy will open up some interesting opportunities. The website, which is still in beta, is a touch glitchy and not quite as user-friendly as it could be, but it got me cycling outside of my regular routine and introduced me to some like-minded people, none of whom I would have otherwise met. Three trepidation-filled meet-ups with strangers; three successful cycling trips; three promises to do it again soon \u2013 and not a crazy stalker in sight.

But leaning over a shoebox, rummaging for a cherished letter he received from Nasa in 1961 asking him to help it discover more about the Martian atmosphere, Lovelock doesn&apos;t appear to be sentimental about his past. In fact, he appears relieved to be free of the burden and responsibility of self-storage. &quot;Adapt and survive,&quot; he says, when asked why he has decided to move. After more than three decades living amid acres of trees he planted himself by hand, he and his wife Sandy have decided to downsize and move to an old lifeguard&apos;s cottage by the beach in Dorset. &quot;I&apos;m not worried about sea-level rises,&quot; he laughs. &quot;At worst, I think it will be 2ft a century.&quot; Given that Lovelock predicted in 2006 that by this century&apos;s end &quot;billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable&quot;, this new laissez-faire attitude to our environmental fate smells and sounds like of a screeching handbrake turn. Indeed, earlier this year he admitted to MSNBC in an interview reported around the world with somewhat mocking headlines along the lines of &quot;Doom-monger recants&quot;, that he had been &quot;extrapolating too far&quot; in reaching such a conclusion and had made a &quot;mistake&quot; in claiming to know with such certainty what will happen to the climate. But Lovelock is relaxed about how this reversal might be perceived. He says being allowed to change your mind and follow the evidence is one of the liberating marvels of being an independent scientist, something he has revelled in since leaving Nasa, his last full-time employer, in the late 1960s. He says it will be the topic of his latest book, due out next year, which has the working title Adventures of a Lone Scientist. He smiles: &quot;My publisher keeps telling me: &apos;Can&apos;t you do a more cheery book this time?&apos;&quot; Moving house has handed Lovelock the chance to pore over the everyday objects resulting from his life&apos;s work, most of which have been in the attic for decades. He picks up an undated invitation to MI5&apos;s Christmas dinner at a restaurant in London. In his other hand, he holds an old envelope stamped: &quot;On Her Majesty&apos;s Service: Top secret.&quot; (As a freelance scientist, he&apos;s worked for many organisations.) There are get-well cards from the likes of the astronomer Carl Sagan, sent when he had heart problems in the early 1980s. He finally finds the letter from Nasa: &quot;I&apos;d read science-fiction since I was a small kid, so when I got a letter from the director of space flight at Nasa I was gobsmacked. I realised I didn&apos;t want to spend the rest of my life as a civil servant, and I didn&apos;t like the idea of having everything planned right up to my retirement. My boss [at the National Institute for Medical Research in London] said I&apos;d be a fool to ignore it and out of all that, ultimately, came Gaia.&quot; Lovelock is donating much of his archive, equipment and inventions \u2013 including the electron capture detector he made in the 60s that helped him to record CFC levels in the atmosphere, which later led to the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer \u2013 to the Science Museum, in time for an exhibition next year showing the working conditions of scientists through the ages. He says he largely dismantled his home laboratory 10 years ago when he ended his life as a practising scientist: &quot;I have become a thinker since then. There is so much more to do. I think retirement means death.&quot; The move, he says, has been forced on him. Three years ago, he received a heating bill for the winter totalling \u00a36,000. His age means he has to have the heating on full in his poorly insulted home and, with his disabled son, Tom, living in a house next door, his outgoings on fuel rocketed. Damp winters on the edge of Dartmoor were taking their toll, so in recent years he has overwintered in St Louis, his wife&apos;s hometown in Missouri. The experience altered his attitude to the politics and economics of energy. Having already upset many environmentalists \u2013 for whom he is something of a guru \u2013 with his long-time support for nuclear power and his hatred of wind power (he has a picture of a wind turbine on the wall of his study to remind him how &quot;ugly and useless they are&quot;), he is now coming out in favour of &quot;fracking&quot;, the controversial technique for extracting natural gas from the ground. He argues that, while not perfect, it produces far less CO2 than burning coal: &quot;Gas is almost a give-away in the US at the moment. They&apos;ve gone for fracking in a big way. Let&apos;s be pragmatic and sensible and get Britain to switch everything to methane. We should be going mad on it.&quot; Lovelock says the political fallout from the Fukushima disaster in Japan last year means that the chances of a surge in nuclear power generation are dramatically reduced. &quot;The fear of nuclear is too great after Fukushima and the cost of building plants is very expensive and impractical. And it takes a long time to get them running. It is very obvious in America that fracking took almost no time to get going. There&apos;s only a finite amount of it [in the UK] so before it runs out, we should really be thinking sensibly about what to do next. We rushed into renewable energy without any thought. The schemes are largely hopelessly inefficient and unpleasant. Fracking buys us some time, and we can learn to adapt.&quot; The reaction in Germany to Fukushima \u2013 which announced within weeks of the disaster that it was to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2022 \u2013 particularly infuriates Lovelock: &quot;Germany is a great country and has always been a natural leader of Europe, and so many great ideas, music, art, etc, come out of it, but they have this fatal flaw that they always fall for an ideologue, and Europe has suffered intensely from the last two episodes of that. It looks to me as if the green ideas they have picked up now could be just as damaging. They are burning lignite now to try to make up for switching off nuclear. They call themselves green, but to me this is utter madness.&quot; Nestled deep into an armchair, Lovelock brushes a biscuit crumb from his lips, and lowers his cup of tea on to the table: &quot;I&apos;m neither strongly left nor right, but I detest the Liberal Democrats.&quot; He delivers his mischievous bombshells with such rapidity and meekness that there is a danger one can miss the all-important clarification and context. &quot;They are all well-meaning, but they have mostly had little experience of power,&quot; he adds. &quot;The coalition has behaved disgracefully on environmental and energy policies. It would have been much better if they had been properly rightwing. I don&apos;t mean something like Thatcher; that was a revolutionary Conservative government. Just a regular one. Our political system works because they tend to self-correct each other.&quot; Even with politics, it seems, Lovelock&apos;s celebrated idea of a self-regulating organism applies. &quot;We get to our stable position through checks and balances. The whole of nature does that through natural selection. Proportional representation is a very bad idea and an absolute gift to ideologues.&quot; Lovelock does not miss a chance to criticise the green movement that has long paid heed to his views. &quot;It&apos;s just the way the humans are that if there&apos;s a cause of some sort, a religion starts forming around it. It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion. I don&apos;t think people have noticed that, but it&apos;s got all the sort of terms that religions use. The greens use guilt. You can&apos;t win people round by saying they are guilty for putting CO2 in the air.&quot; He displays equal disdain for those who do not accept science on climate change: &quot;They&apos;ve got their own religion. They believe that the world was right before these damn people [the greens] came along and want to go back to where we were 20 years ago. That&apos;s also silly in its own way.&quot; At times, Lovelock can cut something of an unsympathetic, cold figure. He talks about how, as animals, we&apos;re all &quot;naturally racist&quot;, but how &quot;we try to curb it and be sensible&quot;. So much of his talk seems to be underscored by the often brutal reality of natural selection and the self-correcting omnipotence of Gaia, with the result that there is little apparent concern for those \u2013 in the developing world, perhaps \u2013 who might not be able to adapt successfully to future environmental changes. But he also applies his strictly scientific outlook to his theorising about solutions, too. Lovelock is influenced at present by US biologist EO Wilson and his study of social insects. &quot;He&apos;s come up with an extraordinary theory that the nest is the unit of selection, not the individual insects. That has enormous consequences. Now consider that applied to humans. If we all move into cities, they become the equivalent of a nest. Then another thought comes immediately from that: if that&apos;s the way the flow is going, don&apos;t stop it, let&apos;s encourage it. Instead of trying to save the planet by geo-engineering or whatever, you merely have to air-condition the cities.&quot; This Logan&apos;s Run vision of the future \u2013 where we all live in megacities to better manage dwindling resources \u2013 might not appeal to all, he admits. &quot;But you don&apos;t even have to do the experiment. You only have to go to Singapore. You could not have chosen a worse climate in which to build a city. It&apos;s a swamp with temperatures in the 90s every day, and very humid. But it is one of the most successful cities in the world. It seems to me that they are treading the path that we are all going to go. It&apos;s so much cheaper to air-condition the cities and let Gaia take care of the world. It&apos;s a much better route to go than so-called &apos;sustainable development&apos;, which is meaningless drivel.&quot; Such talk will not comfort the global leaders gathering in Rio next week for yet another international conference aiming to fix our environmental woes and where calls for &quot;sustainable development&quot; are sure to still be in vogue. Lovelock says he&apos;s doubtful that internationalist efforts of this sort achieve much: &quot;Whenever the UN puts its finger in, it seems to become a mess. The burden of my thoughts are very much that the climate situation is more complex than we at present are capable of handling, or possibly even in the future. You can&apos;t treat it as a scientific problem alone. You have to involve the whole world, and then there&apos;s the time constant of human activity. Look at how long ago the Kyoto treaty was \u2013 15 years ago \u2013 and damn all has been done. The human time constant is very slow. You don&apos;t get major changes in under 50-100 years, and climate doesn&apos;t wait for that.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jun/15/james-lovelock-fracking-greens-climate", "sentences": ["You only have to go to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-15T16:00:00Z", "title": "James Lovelock on shale gas and the problem with 'greens'", "tags": ["Environment", "James Lovelock", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Gas", "Fracking", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Renewable energy", "Fukushima", "Mars", "Nasa"], "article": "When I last interviewed James Lovelock in 2010, I provided here online fuller quotes of his key points than the print edition of the interview would allow. As it proved popular with readers last time round, I have taken the time again to transcribe his responses... Lovelock on &quot;fracking&quot;:  Gas is almost a give-away in the US at the moment. They&apos;ve gone for fracking in a big way. This is what makes me very cross with the greens for trying to knock it: the amount of CO2 produced by burning gas in a good turbine gives you 60% efficiency. In a coal-fired power station, it is 30% per unit of fuel. So you get a two-to-one gain there straight away. The next two-to-one gain you get is that methane has only got half its energy in the carbon, the other half is in the hydrogen, so there&apos;s a four-to-one gain in CO2 output from the same amount of electricity by burning methane. Let&apos;s be pragmatic and sensible and get Britain to switch everything to methane. We should be going mad on it. The fear of nuclear is now too great after Fukushima and the cost of building new build plants is very expensive and impractical. And it takes a long time to get them running. It is very obvious in America that fracking took almost no time at all to get going. It happened without any debate whatsoever. Suddenly you found there was this abundant fuel source. There&apos;s only a finite amount of it [in the UK] so before it runs out we should really be thinking sensibly about what to do next. We rushed into renewable energy without any thought. The schemes are largely hopelessly inefficient and unpleasant. I personally can&apos;t stand windmills at any price. Hydro, biomass, solar, etc, have all got great promise, but they&apos;re not available tomorrow, or even in 10 years. There&apos;s a very good tidal stream farm that I&apos;ve come across using a sunken barge with a turbine on it. It&apos;s much more reliable. They should have gone ahead with the Severn Barrage.  On the urbanisation trend:  Almost all over the first world people are moving into cities for good. This intrigues me. EO Wilson in America is beginning to get a lot of interesting data about social insects. He&apos;s come up with an extraordinary theory that the nest itself is the unit of selection, not the individual insects. That has enormous consequences. Now consider that applied to humans. If we all move into cities, they become the equivalent of a nest. Then another thought comes immediately from that: if that&apos;s the way the flow is going, don&apos;t stop it, let&apos;s encourage it. Instead of trying to save the planet by geoengineering, or whatever, you merely have to air-condition the cities. But you don&apos;t even have to do the experiment. You only have to go to Singapore. You could have not chosen a worse climate in which to build a city. It&apos;s a swamp with temperatures in the 90s every day and very humid. It&apos;s almost an unliveable climate. But it is one of the most successful cities in the world. It seems to me that they are treading the path that we are all going to go. It&apos;s so much cheaper to just air-condition the cities and let Gaia take care of the world. They are much less vulnerable in their skyscrapers. It will not be impossible in the future to grow the food it needs within the city. It&apos;s a much better route to go that so-called &quot;sustainable development&quot; which is meaningless drivel.  On politicians:  I&apos;m neither strongly left or right, but I detest the Liberal Democrats. They are all well-meaning, but they have mostly had little experience of power. The coalition [government] has behaved disgraceful on environmental and energy policies. They haven&apos;t done at all well. It would have been much better if they had been properly rightwing. We haven&apos;t had one for a long time. I don&apos;t mean something like Thatcher; that was a revolutionary Conservative government. Just a regular one. Our political system works because they tend to self-correct each other. What you&apos;ve got to avoid at all costs is ideologues. Germany is a great country and has always been a natural leader of Europe, and so many great ideas, music, art, etc, come out of it, but they have this fatal flaw that they always fall for an ideologue and Europe has suffered intensely from the last two episodes of that. And it looks to me as if the green ideas they have picked up now could be just as damaging. They are burning lignite now to try and make up for switching off nuclear. They call themselves green, but to me this is utter madness. All ideologues are harmful. They are never right. We get to our stable position through checks and balances. The whole of nature does that through natural selection. Proportional representation is a very bad idea and an absolute gift to ideologues. The problem with ideologues from Marx onwards is that they tend to imagine that human nature is very different from what it actually is. We&apos;re still animals and we behave like animals and it doesn&apos;t take much to knock our &quot;civilisation&quot; away. People are very, very sensitive about territory and if you move a new lot of people into their territory, they don&apos;t like it one bit. Politicians are very stupid if they think they can get away with that sort of thing. You could easily get me to generalise about things that I&apos;m not really competent to talk about, but I do feel that&apos;s the case. It&apos;s not that people are racist per se. We&apos;re naturally racist, you can&apos;t get away from it. We try to curb it and be sensible. People are very rarely individually racist, but they don&apos;t want a large culture dumped on them. I don&apos;t know anyone personally who would be nasty to someone because of their colour or because they come from a different country. It&apos;s not in our style in these islands. Monarchy is a very good idea, I think. It means there&apos;s no way a politician can dominate. Monarchy ensures that there is someone you can&apos;t beat by being a crafty politician.  On science:  Science is going down the drain terribly fast. It keeps dividing itself up into expertises and these expertises probably don&apos;t know much about the others. I think in order to be a fully rounded person you have to learn to be a pro at one thing, but then you can become a generalist.  On the reaction to his MSBC interview in April in which he said he had made a &quot;mistake&quot; with some of his &quot;alarmist&quot; climate predictions:  I ignore the blogosphere. I don&apos;t know much about it other than an instinctive desire to keep out of it. It can be so rude from what I&apos;ve seen. It&apos;s not my scene at all. I&apos;m too old for that now. But the great thing about being an independent, though, is that you can afford to make mistakes. This is very important. You learn more from the mistakes. It&apos;s a natural part of the learning process. You should be allowed to make a mistake and suffer the consequences. I think the most outrageous example of climate scientists getting it wrong and not admitting it was the 2007 IPPC report. They happily accepted the Nobel prize, but their sea-level rise estimates, according to that very important Science paper by Rahmstorf (pdf), were 100% wrong. They didn&apos;t really answer this other than say it&apos;s a very complicated business and we&apos;ve only just started. The IPCC is too politicised and too internalised. Whenever the UN puts its finger in it seems to become a mess. But I wish I knew of a better model than the IPCC. The burden of my thoughts are very much that the whole climate situation is more complex than we at present are capable of handling, or possibly even in the future. You can&apos;t treat it as a scientific problem alone. You have to involve the whole world and then there&apos;s the time constant of human activity. Look at how long ago the Kyoto Treaty was now \u2013 15 years ago \u2013 and damn all has been done. The human time constant is very slow. You don&apos;t get major changes in under 50-100 years and climate doesn&apos;t wait for that.  On adapting to climate change:  You&apos;ve got to cut back on burning fossil fuels, but you&apos;ve also got to be sensible and reasonable. Like when in business, you&apos;ve got to adapt to each new situation and try to survive until things get better. The ideologues come along and say stop burning all carbon now. It was like with the whole CFC affair. I got into big trouble and I discovered the bloody problem. They started to call me a denier because I said you can&apos;t just stop making CFCs immediately because refrigerators all around the world would break down and they&apos;d be massive food poisoning. I said give the industry time to find safe alternatives. I said wave a stick at them to make sure they do it. That&apos;s the proper course of action. It&apos;s not all that different for climate.  On his archive being donated to the Science Museum:  I&apos;ve got wonderful letters from all sorts of people. Lots of Nasa letters from the early 1960s. My first contact from them was in 1961, just three years after they&apos;d been founded, just when they&apos;d opened up their JPL lab. People at that time were shooting off to America for three times the salary. The brain drain was dreadful. I had lots of offers to go, but I felt I would be deserting them. I&apos;d read science fiction since I was a small kid so when I got a letter from the director of space flight at Nasa I was gobsmacked. I realised I didn&apos;t want to spend the rest of my life as a civil servant and I didn&apos;t like the idea of having everything planned right up to my retirement. My boss [at the National Institute for Medical Research in London] said to me I&apos;d be a fool to ignore it and out of all that, ultimately, came Gaia. I have a letter from Chuck Capen, who was the resident astronomer at JPL at that time, who brought in the data into the room I was in with Carl Sagan and Diane Hitchcock, discussing life of Mars. I remember him coming in and saying, &quot;Here&apos;s the data we&apos;ve got on the atmosphere of Mars and Venus!&quot; I knew immediately by the levels of CO2 that they didn&apos;t have life. I&apos;d written a paper in Nature the previous year saying if you want to know if there&apos;s life on a planet you need to analyse its atmosphere. And this confirmed it exactly.  On sending rovers to Mars:  It&apos;s cronyism again. Science is now divided up into warring tribes of cronies. The biologists are just one big tribe and in America the only thing that matters about Mars is to discover life. But we&apos;re almost certain there isn&apos;t. But they say, &quot;if there&apos;s water, there must be life!&quot; Why? It&apos;s the other way round. You have water there not because you don&apos;t get life without water, but because you don&apos;t get water without life. The biologists fight it like tooth and nail. There&apos;s a better chance there might be fossilised traces of former life, but it&apos;s taking an awful lot of time for even that degree of common sense to come through. If you speak to other scientists, meteorologists, etc, and you ask them how they would have spent those hundreds of millions on rovers, they would say that should have been spent studying the Earth itself. The universities encourage all this separation.  On &quot;greens&quot;:  The greens use guilt. That shows just how religious the greens are. You can&apos;t win people round by saying they are guilty for putting CO2 in the air. We do now know what we are doing when it comes to CO2 [emissions], but you don&apos;t have to go right over the top like the greens and shouting, &quot;You&apos;re guilty!&quot; I don&apos;t like it.   On the Met Office Hadley Centre:  I keep contact with the Hadley Centre. They are one of the best climate centres in the world. Something to be proud of. They should be given credit. They are under enormous pressure from government and are not allowed to say what they really think. But there&apos;s some really good scientists there. I like Richard Betts very much and respect him. He couldn&apos;t be a scientist and not discuss the uncertainties [in climate science]. Three cheers for him.  On his advice to environmentalists:  I wish I knew. One thing being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything. You never know the truth. You can only approach it and hope you get a bit nearer to it each time. You iterate towards the truth. You don&apos;t know it. It&apos;s just the way the humans go that if there&apos;s a cause of some sort, a religion starts forming around it. It just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion. I don&apos;t think people have noticed that, but it&apos;s got all the sort of terms that religions use.  On climate sceptics:  The people who don&apos;t believe in the environment and climate science, etc, are the deniers. They are a totally different category [to the greens]. They&apos;ve got their own religion. They believe that the world was right before these damn people [the greens] came along and want to go back to where we were 20 years ago. That&apos;s also silly in its own way. I don&apos;t see how any true scientist could be either a believer or a denier. The term &quot;sceptic&quot; has been hijacked, too.  On taking action on climate change:  Just look at our own bodies and medicine. We don&apos;t understand everything and there&apos;s no point pretending we do. It&apos;s far too complex. But we can still take preventative measures. And the same applies to the Earth. I compare it with medicine at the time of the Battle of Waterloo where some poor bloke got half his leg blown off with a cannon ball and the only thing he could do was put the stump in a vat of boiling pitch to quarterise it and seal it. It&apos;s not that we have to do nothing, but you have to try and survive and adapt the best you can and keep your eyes open for the next solution. Avoid instant solutions. The greens are very bad at picking up things, such as homoeopathy. Prince Charles is like this. But it&apos;s absolutely rubbish. It has no scientific basis whatsoever. It&apos;s quackery. But there are some environmentalists who are swinging around now and moving away from all this. They&apos;re the sensible ones.  On nuclear power and, again, &quot;fracking&quot;:  I think the reaction to Fukushima was a turning point. It meant to me at least that it&apos;s almost probably pointless to support nuclear now. The opposition to it now is just too powerful. It&apos;s not rational opposition. It&apos;s religious opposition. But we&apos;ve got to survive and be pragmatic about this. If only society could think that way. OK, the greens are right that we shouldn&apos;t be putting CO2 into the atmosphere as it will knock us off in the long run. And, to be honest, it&apos;s probably too late now to change it. But we want to survive and for our children to have a future, so what do we do? The most sensible thing is nuclear, but I&apos;m afraid the great bulk of people are not going to have it after Fukushima. They think nuclear actually caused the disaster. It&apos;s so bizarre that&apos;s it&apos;s almost unbelievable to a scientist, but they do. They conflate the two together. But maybe we&apos;ve got enough shale [gas] under Britain. There&apos;s certainly lots of it. Now, that&apos;s not the complete answer, but it will carry us on for the next 20-30 years. It will be a bridging technology. I lived through the second world war and there was no way in 1939 that we could beat the Germans. But we were just bloody lucky to live on an island. That gave us time to pull our forces together so that we could hit back. We are in a very similar position now. Fracking buys us some time and we can learn to adapt.  On Europe&apos;s shifting weather patterns:  I think in Western Europe we&apos;ve seen a lack of warming, or, as some people would see it, a positive cooling. But it isn&apos;t cooling as you get episodes of unusually cold weather interspersed with warm spells. It seems to be all over the place. I think the reasons for that are not that difficult. You only have to look at a big weather map and you&apos;ll see that the Atlantic frequently fills up with a large high and when it does they say it&apos;s the jet streams that are affected. But I think this is using symptoms to explain the disease. What happens is the warm air goes up the east coast of America, melts the ice in Greenland, and the floating Arctic ice swings round beautifully, air conditions the air, and swings down on us. It&apos;s all part of global warming. One of the consequences of that cooler water is that it floats on the top of the sea surface and as it comes down it passes over where previously the warm salt water was which drove the ocean conveyors. The fresh water coming in stops it dead. If that stops, the Gulf Stream stops. People think this means we will become Arctic, but that&apos;s nonsense - 75% of our heat comes from the westerly winds, not the Gulf Stream. It would be unpleasant without a Gulf Stream, but it would mean we would be more like Vancouver on the Pacific coast of America. But they [climate scientists] still don&apos;t put any of the living parts of the planet into the climate models. They are trying to do that now down at the Hadley Centre. They need to put the living parts in [to the climate models] as a responsive part.

For more than a century though it&apos;s been known, at home and abroad, for its jewellery dealers and for being the centre of the British diamond trade. A magnet for Jews escaping pogroms across Europe and poverty in the capital&apos;s East End, remembered by old-timers as a tightly knit place where Yiddish was widely spoken, it was once\u00a0likened by a journalist to &quot;Little Jerusalem in England&apos;s green and pleasant land&quot;. The nexus of money and migration tends to breed rumours and myths. Hatton Garden, though never as demonised as Stepney or Whitechapel, often figures as a kind of upscale version of Sax Rohmer&apos;s Chinese Limehouse, one that&apos;s populated by clannish kinsfolk, mysterious brokers, ambiguous characters who look pauperish but may be loaded. Stories abound, as seductive as they are mostly unsubstantiated, of the street&apos;s underground network of secret chambers and corridors. Such fabulations and occult fantasias are manna for writers about London. For the oral historian Rachel Lichtenstein, one of the few prominent female figures operating within the fuzzily defined field of contemporary psychogeography, Hatton Garden is where her grandfather and her parents worked. As a student she helped out at\u00a0the family store, writing out price labels for jewellery and dropping off supplies for Orthodox and Hasidic diamond dealers. Lichtenstein&apos;s previous book, On Brick Lane (2007), was a contribution to the popular field of disappearing London studies. It evoked lives and communities rendered fragile by real-estate developers, City encroachment, and the neighbourhood&apos;s discovery by &quot;creatives&quot;. Shadows fall over Diamond Street too: the apprenticeship system that guaranteed high standards is on the wane, little polishing and manufacturing is carried out any longer in London, competition from companies in Singapore and Taiwan is\u00a0rising. Lichtenstein trained as a sculptor and takes relish in chronicling the craftsmanship of generations of polishers, setters and cutters. Forges, lathes, wooden pegs, turning machines, metal moulds: a poetry of production emerges from the long inventories of tools and equipment they wielded. In damp, sometimes ratty workshops, they handled gold, sapphire and precious gemstones, the calloused hands they ended up with contrasting with the smooth fingers and necks of the Russian tsarinas and Middle Eastern princesses for whose adornment their work is often bought. These craftsmen perform a hallowed form of manual labour whose tactility is to be savoured at least as much as it is bemoaned. One goldsmith announces: &quot;We will be the last people to handle many of the objects produced here with bare hands. They go into collections where they will be picked up with white gloves and spoken over in whispered tones before being carefully put back into a glass case.&quot; This goldsmith and his colleagues were responsible for Siren, Marc Quinn&apos;s life-sized 2008 sculpture of Kate Moss, thought to be the largest man-made gold statue since Egyptian times. But his expertise and his pride in his work aren&apos;t unusual; many of Lichtenstein&apos;s interviewees, though earning meagre salaries, carried on well after their retirement ages. Their collective eloquence about their graft and guile makes Diamond Street a timely companion volume to Richard Sennett&apos;s The Craftsman (2008) and Matthew Crawford&apos;s Shop Class As Soulcraft (2009). Streets are not islands. They get their meaning from the lanes and avenues around them. Hatton Garden is in a neighbourhood that used to be heavily populated by Italians. In the 19th century they worked as organ grinders, ice-cream sellers, glass blowers, magnifying-glass manufacturers. They often did business outdoors, creating public theatre out of their retailing nous, drifting away after German bombing and British internment during the second world war. In the company of Iain Sinclair, her co-author on Rodinsky&apos;s Room (1999), Lichtenstein tramps through the avenues and back lanes of nearby Clerkenwell and Farringdon, hearing stories of long-gone antiquarian booksellers who dealt with excessively grasping customers by ripping the titles they craved before their eyes. What she finds in the Hatton Garden workshops \u2013 filings and dust, scraps and broken pieces of precious metal \u2013 also describes the fragmented narratives that, allied with diligent archival trawls, she assembles into this fascinating and much-needed account. The longer Diamond Street goes on, the greater the tension between Lichtenstein&apos;s preferred mode of writing \u2013 polite, research recounted in the tone of extended journal entry \u2013 and more experimental approaches that include getting American artist Mary Flanagan to use Google Street View to conduct a hybrid of digital flanerie and cyber s\u00e9ance on Hatton Garden. Later she goes down into the sewers of the Fleet, the second largest river in Roman times, to divine the area&apos;s subterranean essence. There, in the echolalia of underground, she discovers that she had &quot;only just begun to scratch the surface&quot; of her subject. Perhaps that \u2013 when it comes to writing about London, or any place really \u2013 is all one can hope for."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/18/greek-election-boosts-markets", "sentences": ["In Asia, Japan&apos;s Nikkei closed 1.8% higher while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng and Singapore&apos;s Straits Times both added about 1%."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-18T07:44:50Z", "title": "Greek election market rally runs out of steam", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Business", "World news", "European Union", "Economics", "Euro", "Europe", "Greek elections 2012", "Greece"], "article": "The relief rally on world stock markets following news that pro-bailout parties in Greece had secured a narrow victory in the weekend&apos;s election re-run has quickly run out of steam.

Arriving for the G20 summit in Mexico, the Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, said: &quot;This allows us to have a more serene vision for the future of the European Union and for the eurozone.&quot; &quot;We hope that a strong government can be formed which confirms the commitments made with the EU.&quot; The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, hailed the result as &quot;good news for Greece, very good news for the European Union, for the euro and also for Spain&quot;. &quot;The [Greek election] results appear close to what the markets had been expecting,&quot; said analysts at Barclays Capital. &quot;The fact that the centre-right New Democracy has won the most votes will be viewed as market friendly because it reduces the likelihood of a near-term Greek exit from the euro area, and will be viewed as making successful negotiations with the troika somewhat more likely. &quot;Already on Sunday night euro area officials and the IMF have expressed their willingness to look at adjusting some elements of the programme, in particular its timing. Overall, however, we expect the effect on the euro and risky currencies and assets to be muted.&quot; On Sunday night the Eurogroup of finance ministers said it looked forward to the swift formation of a new government and reiterated its commitment &quot;to assist Greece in its adjustment effort in order to address the many challenges the economy is facing&quot;. It acknowledged the &quot;considerable efforts&quot; already made by the Greek citizens and said it remained convinced that continued fiscal and structural reforms are Greece&apos;s best guarantee to overcome the current economic and social challenges. &quot;The Eurogroup expects the troika institutions to return to Athens as soon as a new government is in place to exchange views with the new government on the way forward and prepare the first review under the second adjustment programme. European leaders had postponed their departure for a two-day G20 summit in Mexico in order to be able to digest the outcome of the ballot in Greece, which posed the most severe challenge to the EU and the euro. The fallout from the Greek election and the broader issue of how to avert a renewed European banking crisis and stabilise the currency will dominate the Mexico negotiations, with the US and the UK pressing the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Spain to ward off the risk of collapse by coming up with persuasive action by the end of the month. The G20 talks will be promptly followed by a flurry of EU summitry climaxing in a European council of heads of government meeting in Brussels at the end of next week. &quot;European leaders are expected to come under increasing pressure to deal more decisively with the financial crisis as many nations outside Europe like China and the US are being negatively impacted ever more by the ongoing turmoil in financial markets,&quot; said Mark Huber at ETX Capital."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jun/18/manchestermetropolitanuniversity-biology-diybio-madlab-fbi-california-conference", "sentences": ["They&apos;ve been talking to US-based biologists for the last few years, and this year, they&apos;ve extended those talks to include groups from France (La Paillaisse), Denmark (BiologiGaragen), Singapore, Germany, the Czech Republic and Canada.", "We&apos;ve seen presentations on collecting biological samples from the Arctic Circle, converting street food carts in Singapore into mobile public laboratories, experimental aquaculture in Indonesia, playing Pacman with bacteria and printing DNA with a modified inkjet printer."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-18T16:10:00Z", "title": "Manchester's MadLab spends time with the FBI", "tags": ["Manchester Metropolitan University", "Science", "Biology", "Technology", "FBI", "Manchester", "Lancaster University", "California", "University of Manchester", "University of Salford", "Greater Manchester"], "article": "At MadLab we&apos;re used to unusual requests. We run a 3,000 square foot community space for science, technology and art in the centre of Manchester, and as a consequence organise and play host to a wide variety of events - from &quot;hacking&quot; toy robots to play football to making kimchi or dissecting octopuses (and eating them). But back in May we received one of our most unexpected queries yet:  I wanted to reach out to everyone to invite you to an upcoming workshop being put on by the FBI. Please join us for the workshop, June 12-14, 2012 in California.  Wow! So first of all, a bit of background: one of our projects is called DIYBioMCR, a do-it-yourself biology (DIYBio) group originally set up in collaboration with Manchester Metropolitan University and supported by the Wellcome Trust. It&apos;s been a great success, and we&apos;ve introduced hundreds of people to biology over the past year through making fuel cells (powered by the bacteria in soil taken from NCP car parks), breeding snails and swabbing bus stops to count the number of bacterial colonies that grow there. More recently, we&apos;ve been building our own lab equipment and running experiments that would typically be done in an academic or commercial environment, like DNA barcoding sushi (to check what you&apos;re eating is actually yellow-fin tuna). So why the invite? What could the FBI possibly learn from a community space in Manchester? Here&apos;s Special Agent Nathaniel Head to explain:  It&apos;s the FBI&apos;s goal to work with the amateur biology community to safeguard science and those working in the field.  In non-FBI speak, they know they missed a trick (or several) prior to 9/11 by not being outward-looking enough. They&apos;re making an effort with the DIYbio community in order to understand \u2013 and keep up with \u2013 this fast-changing field. They&apos;ve been talking to US-based biologists for the last few years, and this year, they&apos;ve extended those talks to include groups from France (La Paillaisse), Denmark (BiologiGaragen), Singapore, Germany, the Czech Republic and Canada.

For the past three days we&apos;ve sat through presentations and panel sessions involving FBI agents and 60 or so of the most prominent members of the growing DIYbio movement from across the US, Europe and Asia. It&apos;s a diverse audience \u2013 scientists, artists, designers, journalists, activists and academics are all represented and the breadth of activity has been incredible. We&apos;ve seen presentations on collecting biological samples from the Arctic Circle, converting street food carts in Singapore into mobile public laboratories, experimental aquaculture in Indonesia, playing Pacman with bacteria and printing DNA with a modified inkjet printer. Amidst the frivolity, there are no illusions as to why we&apos;re all here. When you see the words &quot;amateur&quot;, &quot;open&quot; and &quot;biotechnology&quot; in the same sentence, a not untypical initial reaction might be one of shock and concern, followed shortly by a host of imagined possible nightmare scenarios. For our part, MadLab&apos;s been featured in a couple of BBC programmes that flit from smallpox to amateur biology (the so-called terror/ error debate) in a matter of seconds, inferring that a &quot;bunch of kids in a garage&quot; can accidentally bring down humanity with equipment bought on eBay.  On the final day we head into Silicon Valley for a hands-on session doing something that only a few years ago would have seemed inconceivable\u2026 In the middle of an unassuming technology park in Sunnyvale, a couple of blocks away from NASA HQ, sits the US&apos;s largest community biotechnology lab BioCurious. A world away from your typical commercial or academic lab, it&apos;s closer in feel to a makerspace or hackerspace with benches made of scaffolding and a fridge full of beer - although the biological-equation graffiti in the toilets reminds you that this space is a bit different. Anyone can sign up to become a member and sharing knowledge of what you&apos;re doing (and how) is positively encouraged. In fact, they&apos;ve taken transparency to such an extent that all the storage boxes they use are see-through.  Rather than buying the latest and most expensive kit, BioCurious reuse and remake old equipment (typically donated or bought at auction) to fit their needs. As co-founder Raymond McCauley explains, &quot;we needed a refrigerated centrifuge, so rather than buying one, we just put ours in the fridge. Obvious right?&quot; Raymond and fellow BioCuriouser Derek Jacoby guided us through some taster lab activities. After an introduction to basic lab safety our group \u2013 a mix of FBI special agents and DIY Biologists got to work on the &quot;hello world&quot; of modern biology \u2013 genetically modifying e.coli to glow green. Did it work? We&apos;ll find out when the photos come through (glowing e.coli does not go down well at UK Customs, unfortunately).     And look! BioCurious brew their own beer.

A close second is the strongly collaborative structure within which she works. It drew her to work in the north-west and is part of the daily reality of her life as leader of the Keys Federation in Wigan. Wigan is one of several local authorities that, in the face of a national drive for mass academisation and weakened local government, are evolving a new relationship with schools. It is also one of a number of authorities that may hold the key to the debate about what sort of &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;mediating&quot; tier should emerge between central government and local education in an increasingly fragmented market. Wigan&apos;s relationship with its schools started to change several years ago, following conversations with heads about how its school improvement service should develop. &quot;We knew we wanted to keep and build on our collaborative approach,&quot; explains Bruton. &quot;But we felt that school-to-school support was the best model for school improvement. The local authority helped to broker its 130 schools, which include just four academies, into five consortia. Each has its own leadership and is commissioned to deliver school improvement on behalf of the authority, which in turn holds the consortia to account. Bruton describes the authority&apos;s approach as innovative and forward-thinking: &quot;We have freedom, but we are not left to our own devices. Schools that weren&apos;t collaborating with each other before now are. Do we collectively think there is a role for the local authority? Yes we do.&quot; Her view is shared by fellow headteacher Roy Holford. His school, Hawkley Hall, recently converted to academy status, but has chosen to retain its relationship with the local authority. &quot;Wigan has a very strong community spirit and we want to be part of that. We still buy back some services because they are good value for money and we take part in the consortia. The local authority has facilitated and made a financial investment in that because they still have a role in schools that are underperforming,&quot; he says. Apprehension about how underperformance will be tackled in a world where there may be nothing between thousands of independent state schools and central government is now uniting policymakers and politicians. The chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, has expressed concern about the lack of an intermediate tier, telling the education select committee of MPs: &quot;If we do not think about this carefully, we could have a situation where Whitehall is controlling an increasing number of independent and autonomous schools, and finding it very difficult to do so.&quot; The select committee&apos;s Conservative chair, Graham Stuart, has spoken of the need to have somebody closer than the secretary of state to a local area, &quot;able to broker support where necessary and also help arbitrate where there are conflicts within an institution&quot;, and the shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg, has launched a consultation on what &quot;role, functions and power&quot; a future middle tier could have. Yet all focus is on the creation of new structures such as local school commissioners, superintendents, regional Ofsted offices or school boards, rather than developing or changing the role of the local authority, even though the functions outlined in the Twigg review look suspiciously like those for which councils still have statutory responsibility. This is a mistake, according to Alan Wood, director of children&apos;s services for the London borough of Hackney. He was brought into Hackney in 2001 to run the Learning Trust, which took over education services in the borough on the orders of central government because, as he puts it, &quot;most people thought Hackney was a basket case&quot;. Since then, Hackney has seen standards rise from well below to above the national average. In spite of being one of the most deprived authorities in the country, its mix of academy and maintained schools outperforms those in many more affluent areas. Half of Hackney secondaries are academies and all primaries maintained, but relations between schools and the trust are strong and Wood sees his role as challenging and supporting all schools, regardless of their status. He is currently overseeing the transfer of education services back to the council. &quot;There must be one body that acts for all the education institutions in a community,&quot; he explains. &quot;Eventually everyone will come round to this view because otherwise everything will end up at the door of the minister. And, in reality, only the local authority can perform this role. &quot;Local authorities have a democratic mandate, they can set a vision, plan places, intervene for school improvement, manage admissions, be bold about leadership and maintain a relationship between local and central government that doesn&apos;t rely on Soviet-style intervention,&quot; he says. &quot;This can&apos;t be done by a handful of chains. Local authorities that are actively trying to push their schools out and relinquish their role are in my view not confident about their moral purpose and responsibility.&quot; Nick Hudson, the director of children&apos;s services in Wigan, has worked hard with his schools to broker the &quot;Wigan solution&quot; and believes that much more is changing on the ground between schools and local authorities than government may realise. He admits that the main obstacle to a new type of middle tier is a perception that quality, especially when it comes to intervening with failing schools, has been too variable in the past, but believes this should not be insurmountable. &quot;I think it is unlikely that a complete market solution will deliver the outcomes the government wants. Finding a system for holding authorities to account and ensuring that we learn from and move towards best practice \u2026 is a simpler and cheaper solution than legislating and funding an entirely new set of structures.&quot; Jonathan Crossley Holland, an independent consultant recently commissioned by the Association of Directors of Children&apos;s Services to produce a report on the future role of local authorities in school improvement, says the evidence is clear that all successful school improvement models require a middle layer. &quot;Local authorities are uniquely placed to play this role. Many do so effectively, but too many do not. The challenge to those LAs is to restore confidence by raising their game, sharing good practice and being prepared to move to radically different models, such as regionally based commissioning of licensed school-improvement services, which may include academy chains and school-led partnerships. &quot;The challenge to government is to apply the same energy it does to the academy programme to enable all local authorities to be good.&quot; He thinks ministers should look at what is being done in high-performing countries such as Singapore and the Canadian provinces, where investment in school-improvement leadership is considered as important as high-quality school leadership and heads are trained alongside school-improvement staff. Steve Reed, leader of Lambeth council in south London and the lead member for children&apos;s services for London councils, puts it more bluntly. &quot;We aren&apos;t going to surrender. It is stupid to try and replicate what already exists. We know that school provision is changing and that we may need to create new ways of working. But the fact that our role needs to change doesn&apos;t mean we shouldn&apos;t have one. Quite apart from anything else, we provide so many of the other services that help children and young people to achieve. We don&apos;t need a new middle tier between national government and schools. It already exists and it&apos;s called local government.&quot; Of Lambeth&apos;s 82 schools, seven have converted to academy status. Gary Phillips, head of Lilian Baylis school, which saw rapid improvement as a local authority school but has recently joined the RSA academy group, endorses Reed&apos;s position. &quot;We have worked hard and shown we can make a difference and add value to the lives of the children we teach. But to make a real step change for some of those children we need support from other LA services. So, whether we are academies or maintained schools, we can&apos;t turn our backs on the local authority. We need and want to work in partnership with them, changing that relationship when necessary, but not reinventing the wheel.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/19/world-wealth-report-asia-america-millionaires", "sentences": ["It added: &quot;Also hard hit in 2011 were the [millionaire] populations of Singapore and Poland, which both suffered the direct effects of the eurozone crisis.", "Singapore saw a drop in exports, and Poland in foreign investment.&quot; George Lewis, group head of RBC wealth management, explained: &quot;The aggregate wealth of high net worth individuals declined overall, as market volatility took its toll."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-19T17:59:35Z", "title": "World wealth report: Asia overtakes America in millionaire stakes", "tags": ["Rich lists", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "US news"], "article": "The number of millionaires in Asia has overtaken North America for the first time in a sign of wealth shifting across the globe due to the economic downturn, according to a new report.

But the overall level of wealth in North America is still the highest in the world, with its millionaires, such as Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, controlling $11.4tn, while Asian businessmen control $10.7tn \u2013 although wealth levels declined twice as fast in North America as in Asia in 2011. Millionaires in the US, Japan and Germany still make up more than half the world&apos;s richest, but total world wealth levels fell for the first time since the worst of the economic downturn in 2008.

Jean Lassignardie, corporate vice president of Capgemini, said: &quot;Europe will be top of mind for investors, as repeated flare-ups [in the eurozone] are likely to keep markets on edge. Additional drivers such as the economic performance in China, mature market headwinds, global political leadership changes and policy decisions will all play key roles in determining whether 2012 drives increases.&quot; Several emerging markets saw wealth levels drop, in particular India and Hong Kong, which saw their number of millionaires fall by a fifth. Researchers calculated millionaires as individuals who have the funds to invest at least $1m, and revealed that 9.9 million have between $1m and $5m. This group grew slightly, 1.1%, but the richest section, with more than $30m at their disposal, dropped 2.5% to 100,000 people, with the value of their wealth also down nearly 5%. The drop is linked to some of their holdings in higher-risk investments such as hedge funds, private equity and real estate. India was worst hit due to &quot;a slump in its equity-market capitalisation and its currency in 2011 as a lack of faith in the political process and the slow pace of domestic reformed disappointed investors,&quot; according to the report.

At a sometimes heated hearing, congressman Sean Duffy asked Dimon whether the bank was too big to regulate, too big to manage and too big to fail \u2013 charges Dimon denied. &quot;Why should we allow you to be so big that if you go under, we are going to have to bail out your creditors?&quot; asked representative Brad Sherman. This was Dimon&apos;s second appearance in as many weeks before a Washington panel. Last week a Senate committee quizzed the JP Morgan boss on the still mounting losses at the bank&apos;s London offices. The House committee was far more combative in tone. Congressman Barney Frank, co-author of the Dodd-Frank regulations brought in after the last financial crisis, asked Dimon if his wages would be subject to &quot;clawback&quot; following the disclosure of the losses. Last week Dimon said staff at the bank who were responsible for the London losses could have their pay reclaimed under the bank&apos;s so-called clawback provisions. Dimon said that decision would be for the board to decide. Dimon has been Wall Street&apos;s fiercest critic of elements of the Dodd-Frank rules. Frank said Dimon had said the bank had a &quot;fortress balance sheet&quot; that would protect it from losses like those in London. &quot;What about institutions that are less impregnable, maybe a chain link fence, a picket fence or two?&quot; asked Frank. Dimon said &quot;all American banks are better capitalized&quot; after the financial crisis. &quot;Don&apos;t filibuster,&quot; said Frank. Politicians on both sides of the House are currently working on legislation aimed at tackling fears that after the collapse of their rivals in the credit crisis some financial institutions have become so large that their collapse could cause enormous damage to the US economy. Dimon was repeatedly asked about the too-big-to-fail concept. &quot;We can not have too big to fail. We have to get rid of too big to fail so that a bank can fail without doing damage to the economy.&quot; he said. But he defended JP Morgan&apos;s size. Dimon said a lot of banks were &quot;the port in the storm&quot; and the JP Morgan&apos;s size and diversification had allowed it to pull through the credit crisis and &quot;allowed us to do the things you wanted to do&quot; including buying failing banks like Washington Mutual, lending money to California and investing in Chrysler. The bank boss also fended off questions about the likely impact of the London losses or how big they would grow. He said JP Morgan would remain profitable after the loss. Asked if the losses could grow to $50m he said: &quot;Not unless the moon strikes the Earth.&quot; Dimon and regulators were quizzed by the panel about the role of London and its regulation in the losses. &quot;Every big trading disaster happens in London. I would like to know why,&quot; representative Carolyn Maloney asked regulators earlier in the day. &quot;It is a pattern.&quot; &quot;Our problem has nothing to do with London or any loopholes,&quot; Dimon said. But he said if regulation was tightened up for US banks operating overseas, US banks would lose business. &quot;We will lose a lot of business.

The country&apos;s biggest gym chain will also shed nearly half its sites and have about \u00a3600m of its debts wiped out. The agreement could set a precedent that sees fewer retailers slip into administration. It comes after the collapse of several high street stores in the past year, including Clinton Cards, Game and Peacocks, with an estimated 10,000 redundancies. Fitness First has agreed to a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) through KPMG, which will allow it to pay between 23p and 28p for every \u00a31 it owes, compared with 0.5p if it were to fall into administration. CVAs have been used before by struggling companies, but only to negotiate rents on empty sites. It means struggling retailers could impose rent reductions on all landlords, rather than having to negotiate with landlords individually. Barry Gross of law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner said: &quot;This is good news for the high street and gives more options to retailers to help them avoid administration. The biggest issue facing the retail market generally is that rents are high and in difficult trading conditions there is nothing they can do because it is a fixed cost. But iIf more retailers use these kind of CVAs, which is likely after its success at Fitness First, it should avoid future administrations \u2013 which are far more costly.&quot; He added that the gym chain&apos;s landlords had 28 days to appeal against the decision. Blacks Leisure and JJB Sports used CVAs, but their deals sought to cut rent in empty stores, while continuing to pay full rates in stores that were still open.

But the chain has struggled recently after its previous owners piled it with debt after a series of acquisitions, leaving it with spiralling interest bills. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jun/21/opportunities-in-transnational-education", "sentences": ["Nearly 100 million people will enter the consumer class (annual income of more than $5,000) by 2015 in six south-east Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group.", "High-quality collaborations, such as the one between Yale-NUS in Singapore, are also anticipated to attract glocals."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-21T09:10:00Z", "title": "The rise of 'glocal' students and transnational education", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "Student experience", "Higher education", "Education", "International students"], "article": "Nearly 100 million people will enter the consumer class (annual income of more than $5,000) by 2015 in six south-east Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group. Another report by the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that between 2005 and 2025, China and India will see their aggregate urban consumption increase seven-fold and six-fold, respectively. This growing consumer class in Asia will expand a new segment of students who are willing to pay for a global educational experience while staying in their home country or region. I call this segment &quot;glocals&quot;\u2013 global aspirations with local experiences. Glocals are characterised by aspirations that usually outstrip both their ability to afford a full fee-paying overseas education and their academic merit to gain admission to an overseas institution with financial aid. The traditional segment of international students go abroad for a combination of reasons such as career advancement, quality of education, immigration or the experience of living abroad. Glocals differ from this traditional segment as they look for career advancement and quality of education, without having to go very far from home. In addition to limitations regarding financial means and academic merit, glocals may also decide to stay within their country or region due to regional mobility initiatives. For instance, the ASEAN Economic Community, aims to transform the south-east Asian region into a common market with free flow of goods, services, investment and workers, which will benefit students as well. Glocals represent the segment of students who typically seek transnational education (TNE) including international branch campuses, twinning arrangements and online education. The growth of Dubai as a destination for many south Asian students through international branch campuses is one indicator of growth in this student population. According to the Observatory, with 37 branch campuses, One in five branch campuses in the world is hosted by the UAE. Malaysia recently announced that it received applications from 25 foreign universities to set up branch campuses, and that the country plans to reach a goal of enrolling 150,000 international students by 2015. China has also been proactive in offering 1+2+1 dual degree programmes for a decade. A recent announcement by Indian regulators to allow joint-degrees and twinning collaborations between Indian and foreign institutions are also expected to expand the base of glocals. High-quality collaborations, such as the one between Yale-NUS in Singapore, are also anticipated to attract glocals. Countries such as the UK and Australia have been pioneers in offering transnational education and are best positioned to serve glocals. Nearly half of all international education activity for the UK and one-third for Australia is through TNE or &quot;offshore&quot; provision. In terms of absolute numbers, more than 400,000 students were enrolled in the UK institutions through TNE. More than 100,000 students were enrolled in Australian institutions. Undoubtedly, students who seek overseas education will continue to grow at a faster pace. It is the glocal segment, however, that is likely to present the next big opportunity for institutions that want to increase their global profile. The needs of glocal students, combined with a changing institutional, demographic, economic and political landscape in emerging Asia calls for an innovative and strategic approach to engage with internationalisation in Asia. Internationalisation strategies need to move beyond student recruitment and target collaborative relationships of varying complexity and intensity, ranging from short-term exchanges to twinning international branch campuses. Undeniably, strategies will differ according to the priorities and resources of institutions, but higher education institutions need to be prepared to adapt to a major shift in student profiles and corresponding engagement strategies with Asia. To sum up, a new segment of students is expanding. These are students who have global aspirations but will find more opportunities of education and employment mobility within local regions. This presents a vital opportunity for foreign institutions to understand glocals and strategically engage them through innovative transnational education.

A furious deputy prime minister, who was not consulted on the reforms, has made clear that he will reject Gove&apos;s plans out of hand if a leaked internal education department document on the changes is correct. Clegg, who is in Brazil at the Rio+20 summit, instructed senior party officials in a transatlantic telephone call to condemn the plans and to denounce Gove in highly personal terms shortly after the education secretary outlined his plans to MPs in an emergency commons statement. &quot;The Liberal Democrats are in politics to remove barriers for all children and not to return to the 1950s education system,&quot; a senior party source said. &quot;We want a modern education system for the 21st century, not an acceptance of mediocrity. We want a system for the future rather than turning the clock back to the past with a two-tier education system that will let down our kids.&quot; The party source highlighted Clegg&apos;s anger with Gove by saying that neither the deputy prime minister nor the Lib Dem education minister Sarah Teather had been consulted about the changes. &quot;This is not cleared government policy,&quot; the source said. &quot;I doubt if these plans were known outside Michael Gove&apos;s private office. This looks like an attempt to bounce us \u2013 and that is not going to happen. Changes like this have to go through proper government procedures. We were left scrabbling around in the dark.&quot; The row between Clegg and Gove, one of the prime minister&apos;s closest personal and political allies, erupted after the Daily Mail reported that pupils across England would sit GCSEs for the last time in English, maths, physics, chemistry and biology in 2015. This would pave the way for a two-tier exam system, modelled on O-levels for academically gifted pupils and CSEs for less academically able students, to be sat from 2016. The move was signalled in an internal education department document leaked to the Daily Mail. The document said: &quot;The Department for Education expects that existing GCSEs will disappear. Those starting GCSEs in 2013 are the last pupils who will have to do them.&quot; Trade union leaders denounced the plans as ludicrous. Mary Bousted, leader of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, described the move as the education secretary&apos;s most &quot;ludicrous&quot; idea to date and warned that it signified a return to &quot;a rosy path that never existed&quot;. Gove was summoned by the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, to explain his ideas in an urgent question. The education secretary said: &quot;These are an attempt to ensure our education system stands comparison with the world&apos;s most rigorous. While there were undoubtedly improvements in our schools and by our teachers over the course of the last 20 years, those improvements were not sufficient to ensure that we kept pace with other jurisdictions.&quot; Gove rejected Labour claims that he was behaving like a Thatcherite as he depicted himself as an ideological heir to Tony Blair. But Lord Adonis, the former education minister who is seen as the father of the Blairite academies programme, rejected his reforms. &quot;I can hardly think of a worse education reform than &apos;bringing back the CSE&apos; \u2013 dead-end exams for children treated as second-rate,&quot; Adonis tweeted. Senior Tories also indicated unease with the Gove plans. Graham Stuart, the Conservative chairman of the Commons education select committee, said he was sceptical and suggested that the plans were designed just to help the elite. Stuart, who announced that his committee would summon Gove to explain himself, told BBC Radio 4&apos;s The World at One: &quot;This has come out of the blue. Just a year ago the government was ramping up its new GCSE target and now a year on we are having this change \u2013 back to the future, back to O-levels. &quot;How exactly will a move back to traditional O-levels and some as yet unspecified other form of examination for lower performing pupils help close the gap between rich and poor? How will it increase social mobility? These are the kind of questions we need to be putting to the secretary of state. &quot;I am sceptical that some return to O-levels is going to bring about some transformation. It is only the tiniest number of children at the very top who fail to be differentiated by the current GCSE system. &quot;It [the government] appears to be more focused on the children whom we serve relatively well, the brighter kids, and not focusing on the central problem we have which is doing a better job for the children at the bottom ... Why isn&apos;t the focus on the bottom 20%, the poorest and the least performing? &quot;I am disappointed about the way it has been leaked in the middle of the exam season. I hope the department can get better at stopping such leaks.&quot; Sources in Gove&apos;s department admitted that he had not informed Clegg or Teather. But they said Gove was determined to press ahead with the reforms, which could be done without Lib Dem support because there was no need for parliamentary legislation. The move by Gove and his failure to brief his Lib Dem ministerial colleagues will raise questions about whether Cameron loyalists are now adopting a more hostile approach to their coalition partners. Gove has always described himself as an enthusiastic supporter of the coalition, though many Tories were angry with the Lib Dems when they failed to support Jeremy Hunt in a Commons vote last week. Sources in Gove&apos;s department indicated that the new exams, which will have one board per subject, would only be introduced after rigorous scientific research. But Gove is attracted by Singapore, which has its O-level set by the Cambridge exam board. Most pupils (75%) in Singapore sit O-levels. The remaining 25% sit N-levels, which breaks down into two streams. Half do academic work and the other half follow a vocational route. Other changes would mean that pupils sitting O-levels would no longer be able to bring set texts, such as plays, into exams. &quot;Pupils should know the text,&quot; one source said. Dan Rogerson, the co-chair of the Lib Dem parliamentary committee on education, echoed Clegg&apos;s criticisms. He said: &quot;Liberal Democrats absolutely support reforms to improve standards where the evidence is clear, and we have done so in the coalition government. &quot;We want to raise aspirations for all children, which is why every child should have the chance to achieve good qualifications. A two-tier system, with all the upheaval and instability this would cause, is not the way to achieve higher standards across the board. &quot;Reform needs to be managed carefully and we should avoid creating a huge amount of turbulence and distraction in the education system for no real gain. Rather than harking back to an age when children started their adult life with qualifications that were seen as second-rate, we want to look forward and work with teachers and schools to give them the freedom and tools needed to stretch pupils, drive up standards and entrench a culture of high expectations in every school.&quot; Tim Farron, the Lib Dem party president, added his voice to the criticisms. He said: &quot;Returning to a two-tier exam system would be madness. The O-level/CSE system was divisive and dumped millions of young people into a second division from which they couldn&apos;t escape, providing a fixed limit on the expectations of those young people who were saddled with having to sit the CSE. &quot;By all means, lets look at the GCSE and consider reforms \u2013 Michael Gove is perfectly within his rights to do that. But let&apos;s kill off immediately any talk of returning to the divisive two-tier system that Mrs Thatcher wisely ended in the late 80s.&quot; Sources close to Gove said the Lib Dems were overreacting. They said Gove liked the Singapore system where the majority of pupils sat the equivalent of O-levels and a minority sat the equivalent of CSEs. The old English system was the other way round. The sources said the Lib Dems should read a blog by the Fields-medal-winning mathematician Tim Gowers for a &quot;flavour of what future might hold&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/21/nick-clegg-michael-gove-exams", "sentences": ["Gove is attracted by the system in Singapore where 75% of pupils sit O-levels set by the Cambridge exam board."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-21T19:10:45Z", "title": "Nick Clegg vows to block Michael Gove's plan to ditch GCSEs", "tags": ["Nick Clegg", "Michael Gove", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Conservatives", "Liberal Democrats", "Politics", "Education", "UK news"], "article": "Controversial plans by the education secretary, Michael Gove, to start scrapping GCSE exams before the next general election in favour of a two-tier system modelled on O-levels and CSEs, are expected to be shelved after a furious backlash from Nick Clegg.

In a sign of growing divisions among the coalition partners, the deputy prime minister interrupted his attendance at the Rio+20 summit to authorise a briefing by party officials criticising the plans and denouncing Gove. Clegg said: &quot;I&apos;m not in favour of anything that would lead to a two-tier system where children at quite a young age are somehow cast on a scrapheap. What you want is an exam system which is fit for the future [and] doesn&apos;t turn the clock back to the past and rewards hard work and effort for the many, many children in our school system who work hard and want to get ahead so it works for the many and not just for some and not just for the few.&quot; Clegg spoke out after the Daily Mail reported that pupils across England would sit GCSEs for the last time in English, maths, physics, chemistry and biology in 2015. The last GCSE courses in the core subjects would be taught from September 2014, paving the way for a two-tier exam system modelled on O-levels for academically gifted pupils and CSEs for less academically able students, from 2016. The move was signalled in an internal education department document leaked to the Daily Mail. The document said: &quot;The Department for Education expects that existing GCSEs will disappear. Those starting GCSEs in 2013 are the last pupils who will have to do them.&quot; Downing Street announced on Thursday that the government would launch a consultation on improving exam standards. Cameron would like to see the Gove policy implemented but he accepts that it will be virtually impossible to persuade the Lib Dems to sign up. &quot;David Cameron is a fan of this policy,&quot; one source said. &quot;But it was unhelpful that it leaked out in a way that allowed the Liberal Democrats to entrench themselves against it. This looks like Beecroft Mark II.&quot; This was a reference to the proposals by the Tory donor Adrian Beecroft, vetoed by the Lib Dems, that would have allowed companies to fire workers at will. The leak prompted some senior Tories to declare that Gove was &quot;on manoeuvres&quot; to burnish his blue Tory credentials as the party looks to a future after Cameron. Gove is planning to publish his plans in the week when Conservative MPs are to face a three-line whip to vote in favour of Clegg&apos;s plans to reform the House of Lords. There is no suggestion that the education secretary, who is one of the prime minister&apos;s closest political and personal allies, is moving against Cameron. But it is believed that he is trying to position himself as a strong successor amid a widespread feeling that George Osborne is struggling after his botched budget and the poor performance of the economy. Gove&apos;s best hope is that his policy, which would also see one exam board established for each subject, will be included in the Conservative manifesto for the next general election. &quot;This is a marvellous red-hot Tory policy but we have to live with the coalition,&quot; one senior Tory said. A delay in the policy would come as a deep disappointment to Gove, who wants to start scrapping GCSEs from September 2014 because he believes the reforms would become &quot;irreversible&quot; by the time of the next election. Gove is adamant that he will press ahead with his plans on 9 July, when he intends to publish a document proposing that GCSEs should no longer be used as the accountability mechanism and a competition should be held to devise a &quot;world-class&quot; exam system. Gove is attracted by the system in Singapore where 75% of pupils sit O-levels set by the Cambridge exam board. The remaining 25% sit N-levels, which break down into two streams \u2013 half doing academic work and the other half following a vocational route. One source close to Gove said: &quot;Nick Clegg has a strategic choice. Does he want to side with Labour and keep the annual debate about dumbing down or does he want to embrace reform and raise standards?&quot; The consultation announced by Downing Street last night was defined in wide terms to allow the Lib Dems to buy into the process while giving them confidence that GCSEs will not be scrapped. The prime minister&apos;s spokeswoman said: &quot;The consultation will contain proposals that will ensure we look at the current exam system, which Michael Gove said isn&apos;t working for pupils; it is going to tackle the culture of competitive dumbing down with regards to qualifications; and it is going to look at a curriculum that will prepare all students for success beyond the age of 16.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/22/lord-coe-sponsorship-london-olympics", "sentences": ["No organising committee alone is resourced to drive the legacy ambitions we set out in Singapore [when London won the bid in 2005].&quot; Sorrell asked whether Coe would have believed that the UK should host the Olympics \u2013 with the massive investment required \u2013 if he had known in 2005 what the state of the economy would be."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-22T16:46:28Z", "title": "Lord Coe defends sponsorship of London Olympics", "tags": ["Advertising", "Lord Coe", "Sport", "McDonald's", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Coca-Cola", "Media", "Marketing & PR", "London", "UK news", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics & the media", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Lord Coe has staunchly defended the sponsorship of the London Olympics by fast food and soft drinks companies, arguing that the investment by brands such as Coca-Cola and McDonald&apos;s is essential to making the event a success. The chairman of the London 2012 organising committee said he felt that some of the Olympic sponsors \u2013 which have invested more than \u00a3750m to associate themselves with this summer&apos;s spectacle \u2013 have been unfairly maligned. Coe pointed to the legacy that the London Olympics will deliver, including the regeneration of east London, as well as programmes of sports and health activities the sponsors have funded. &quot;Sponsors play a really important role to help that happen,&quot; said Coe, in conversation with WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell at the Cannes International Festival of Creativity on Friday. &quot;In large part it is easy to talk fast food and soft drinks but I&apos;m a great believer in input and output. No one is suggesting Coke and McDonald&apos;s are not doing a massive amount in terms of the legacy.

Other sponsors, such as BP, have come in for criticism for their business practices and ethics. Coe said the financial reality of hosting an Olympic Games meant that it is impossible to expect the event to be delivered without significant commercial support. &quot;Sport now is a very different landscape than it used to be,&quot; he added. &quot;Sport is doing so much more and is being asked to do so much more than crash, bang, wallop at Stamford Bridge on a Tuesday night. No organising committee alone is resourced to drive the legacy ambitions we set out in Singapore [when London won the bid in 2005].&quot; Sorrell asked whether Coe would have believed that the UK should host the Olympics \u2013 with the massive investment required \u2013 if he had known in 2005 what the state of the economy would be. &quot;I would have redoubled my efforts because of the economic benefits to the country, which has been massive,&quot; Coe replied. &quot;I don&apos;t think any games in history have been delivered in such a difficult environment, but the economic dividend around this has already been profound.&quot; \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

I clock a large colour photograph pinned up on the wall behind his desk which epitomises the cutting-edge and unforgettable work done by his department \u2013 hair and make-up \u2013 here at the National. The close-up portrait of actor Jonny Lee Miller as The Creature in the National&apos;s 2011 sell-out Frankenstein shows, in full gory detail, his brutally stapled-together head, bald but for some grisly tufts of hair. Frankenstein pre-dated Cannas&apos;s appointment last September as head of make-up and hair, but, as he whips me at staggering pace through the number of productions and future productions currently in rehearsal, I am under no illusion about the huge scale of the job. &quot;I oversee two current productions and one in the making for each of the three in-house theatres \u2013 the Olivier, Lyttelton and Cottesloe \u2013 as well as providing technical support for cast changes and touring for external shows such as One Man, Two Guvnors at the Haymarket and War Horse at the New London,&quot; he explains. &quot;So I typically have 11 shows to manage at once.&quot; The day-to-day work of theatrical make-up artists like Cannas and his team can be more &quot;bread and butter&quot;, but there is still plenty of variety, he explains. &quot;We work to the blueprint already given to us by the play&apos;s designers, which means we have to produce a creative and technically accurate visual representation which looks good under the strong theatre lights. Sometimes it&apos;s more basic make-up and, at other times, more complex period make-up or special effects. &quot;Often it&apos;s Shakespeare but with a modern, or unusual, take. Our work involves creating images and characters through make-up, hairstyles and prosthetics in accordance with the brief we have been given.&quot; On our way out he shows me the mind-boggling spreadsheet on the wall showing the schedule for technical and dress rehearsals in the run-up to opening nights, previews and press night; along with the locations of the actors&apos; dressing rooms on the floor below, where all but very technically complex make-up will be done. Given that all wigs are made in-house there is surprisingly little time \u2013 often days, rather than weeks \u2013 to get everything ready for productions. In the large airy hair and make-up studio on the fifth floor of the National (it looks out on to an internal courtyard with the feel of a scruffy 1960s&apos; office block) Cannas&apos;s colleague Sarah Lou is &quot;hand-knotting&quot; a multi-layered hippy-style wig for the actress Helen McCrory for her part in the new play The Last of the Haussmans, which opens in just a week&apos;s time. This could take at least 45 hours to complete. In the world of theatre and entertainment, the highly-skilled roles of make-up artist and wig-maker are intertwined, and most courses train people to do both. All the wigs used at the National are created from human hair and made especially for the relevant actors, which means that separate ones are also made for under-studies, too \u2013 even if they are rarely used. Coloured swatches, to help with orders, are stacked up in plastic boxes, and the wigs will usually be styled closer to the production itself, depending on what is required by the designer, Cannas says. Members of his team act as supervisors for individual productions. Cannas has a demanding managerial role at the National, where he reports directly to the Theatre&apos;s Head of Costume. Although he is in charge of a 10-strong department, with all the administrative and financial responsibilities that brings, he likes to keep his hand in, and enjoys &quot;putting on his blacks and grabbing his pouch&quot; to do make-up himself. Blacks \u2013 black clothing \u2013 are typically worn by staff backstage to reduce the chances of being seen by the audience. And Cannas is a big fan of hats \u2013 today he is sporting a black beret, but on other days he favours a sloppy woollen beanie or even a baseball cap. His style is &quot;casual but comfortable&quot;, with practical outfits he could wear to a meeting with director Nicholas Hytner or attending an opening night. Today he has come in especially over the Jubilee bank holiday to lend a hand with a series of workshops the National is running in its &quot;pop-up&quot; space as part of its summer programme, &quot;National Theatre Inside Out&quot;, to demystify and explain its activities to the public. Two members of his team have wig stands and pouches to hand, creating fifties-style makeovers for mums (as their daughters look on in wide-eyed wonder) and a plate of prosthetic &quot;stitches&quot;, warts and putrefying flesh fascinate the little boys. Cannas \u2013 who says he used to enjoy watching his own mother putting on her make-up in front of her dressing table mirror \u2013 unrolls the pouch and, with chuckles of laughter and great enthusiasm, he works some magic of his own. &quot;This is a great line of communication with the public&quot;, he says. &quot;There is something rather elitist about working in TV and the theatre, so we are trying to show what we actually do. People think this is glamorous but it is very long hours.&quot; Cannas&apos;s route to working at the National Theatre began in his native Sardinia where, after studying languages (including Latin and Greek) for his national diploma, he dropped out of an engineering course at university. After compulsory army service in Italy, he came to London at 22 and decided to stay. &quot;My mum said goodbye to me at the airport and gave me three months&quot;, he recalls. &quot;That was 20 years ago.&quot; Although he did not speak English when he arrived, he picked up the language by working as a pizza delivery boy and in a bar, before securing a place on a year-long beauty therapy course at the Hammersmith and West London College. That led him to an HNC and HND in make-up and hairdressing at the University of Westminster, including business studies and marketing &quot;which have been absolutely critical for what I am doing now&quot;. Initially, he did freelance work assisting on big-name advertising campaigns for the likes of designer Alexander McQueen, with whom he also worked on London Fashion Week. Keen to put something back into the English education system, a talent for teaching saw him returning to Hammersmith and West London College where he eventually became a full-time lecturer in hair and make-up for three years, while creating numerous specialist courses in make-up. In 2000 he went to Australia &quot;for love&quot; just as Disney&apos;s touring production of The Lion King was coming to south-east Asia. He became head of hair and make-up, working with a 60-strong cast and a team of six make-up artists to bring the famous two-dimensional characters to life. Cannas worked on The Lion King in Sydney, Melbourne, Shanghai, Johannesburg, Taiwan and Singapore. &quot;It was absolutely fantastic and it was very difficult to say goodbye to the team I had worked for. I think I was married to my job, albeit in not a very healthy way.&quot; Now only 40, he claims the biggest challenge of his working life to date has been stepping into the shoes of Joyce Beagarie, the NT&apos;s former head of wigs, who had been at the National for 38 years until she retired last year. &quot;I was thrilled to get the job but terrified at the same time,&quot; he admits. &quot;I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to do here, which is to make my own mark \u2013 to create another layer. I have an average of six meetings here a week. There is a lot of planning, scheduling and so on, but I am fortunate to have a great team.&quot; I sit in with Cannas on the dress rehearsal of The Last of the Haussmans just hours before the production&apos;s official opening, where about 50 staff, representing various departments including lighting, costume and hair and make-up, gather to scrutinise the final run-through and order changes if necessary. I see Helen McCrory in her (now finished) full-length wig, alongside Julie Walters whose long silver-grey wig - described by one critic as a &quot;mad grey mane&quot; \u2013 has been crimped to within an inch of its life. He thinks it obscures her face at times, so this will be fixed. All the makeup and wigs are applied and fitted one hour before the show in the actors&apos; dressing rooms, and when the make-up is minimal they are taught to do it themselves. Very specific show plots are written to allow a smooth run of quick changes backstage. Interestingly, Cannas says that the make-up and hair are as much for the actors, to help them to get into character, as for those watching the play. &quot;About 80% of the job we do is actually for the actors, not the audience.&quot; And with a chuckle, he is off backstage to touch up Julie Walters&apos;s make-up for the second half."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/24/dresden-drones-victims-of-war", "sentences": ["It is now none of these things.&quot; As the son of a refugee from Hitler, I for one am glad that the war against an enemy of unspeakable degeneracy and evil was prosecuted with such vigour and clarity.Adam KirbySingapore \u2022\u2008I find Richard Overy&apos;s claim that &quot;the military-industrial targets were a mere front for a deliberate policy of killing civilians&quot; insulting to all those involved in the WWII air war, and nonsensical in its implication that the whole Lancaster programme was undertaken to this end."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-24T20:00:09Z", "title": "Letters: Dresden, drones and victims of war", "tags": ["Second world war", "World news", "Royal Air Force", "Military", "UK news", "Drones (military)"], "article": "Richard Overy is right that bombing civilans raises real moral issues for which those directing it, rather than the airmen involved, are responsible (Bombing and the just war, 25 June). But these issues arise still more urgently over the use of drones. The use of unmanned weaponry necessarily has a corrupting effect on those directing it because it implies that war is being waged only against a few sinister individuals. The idea is that, once these are &quot;taken out&quot; (like bad teeth), the rest of the population will gladly submit to us. This ignores the widespread resentment and hostility \u2013 much of it produced by our own previous acts \u2013 which has produced these opponents in the first place and will surely produce other, quite possibly more extreme, champions to follow after them. The surrounding civilian deaths which even such &quot;surgical&quot; strikes necessarily involve will increase that bitterness. Thus, more especially when the nation attacked is one like Pakistan against which we are not even supposed to be at war, the practice is wholly disastrous. Bomber Harris&apos;s defence \u2013 that this is merely the most efficient path to victory \u2013 is the opposite of the truth.Mary MidgleyNewcastle upon Tyne \u2022\u2008As the 91-year-old widow of the pilot of one of the Halifax bomber crews who took part in the Dresden raid and survived, I support the view that those crews were also victims. It was one aspect of his service experience of which my husband never spoke. A man of high principles, as were many of those who volunteered for active service in the second world war, on demobilisation he trained as a teacher, and spent his professional life endeavouring to make life more satisfying and meaningful for the disadvantaged. The fact that it has taken over 60 years to honour mainly those whose lives were lost in that service gives cause for thought.Jean SealeyBelper, Derbyshire \u2022\u2008Like many I am conflicted about the memorial to Bomber Command in Hyde Park. A cousin in the RAF was shot down and died, his plane and his body never found, but my father, imprisoned for three years in Germany, was sent in to search the rubble of Dresden for the countless broken bodies left by our own ruthless assault. Perhaps instead we should have a memorial to all the powerless people who become victims of war by an accident of birth, a memorial to remind us that, in war, everyone loses.Alison PiercePembroke \u2022\u2008Two of my mother&apos;s three brothers were among the 55,573 airmen killed (shot down over enemy territory) while serving in Bomber Command. As I grow older, I become ever more awestruck and moved at the courage and commitment they and their comrades demonstrated, leading to their deaths in petrifying circumstances. But this has not prevented me from recognising that much of the strategic bombing of Germany by the allies was not morally (or probably even militarily) justifiable, given its targeting of civilians. The British establishment&apos;s inability to face this issue honestly is on a par with its cant about the manner in which we scuttled from our colonies. There is also a thread of continuity and development in western military thinking from this campaign via America&apos;s bombing of south-east Asia in the 60s and 70s to today&apos;s drone attacks. The development is not just in technical sophistication but in the moral slipperiness and cowardice that sees today&apos;s attacks on civilians dressed up as &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; and conducted outside of any theatre of war in a risk-free environment for the attackers.John L CrawleySkipton, North Yorkshire \u2022\u2008Perhaps we should allow Arthur Harris himself the final word on the pusillanimous handwringing over the bombing of Dresden some still feel necessary to indulge in, nearly 70 years on. As Harris wrote to the Air Ministry in the aftermath of the raid: &quot;The feeling, such as there is, over Dresden, could be easily explained by any psychiatrist. It is connected with German bands and Dresden shepherdesses. Actually Dresden was a mass of munitions works, an intact government centre, and a key transportation point to the East. It is now none of these things.&quot; As the son of a refugee from Hitler, I for one am glad that the war against an enemy of unspeakable degeneracy and evil was prosecuted with such vigour and clarity.Adam KirbySingapore \u2022\u2008I find Richard Overy&apos;s claim that &quot;the military-industrial targets were a mere front for a deliberate policy of killing civilians&quot; insulting to all those involved in the WWII air war, and nonsensical in its implication that the whole Lancaster programme was undertaken to this end. The deliberate destruction of cities may have become a motivation on some occasions when the allies refused to fight &quot;with one arm tied behind their backs&quot;, but this policy dated from April 1937 when the German air force bombed Guernica during the Spanish civil war, and three years later, on 14 May 1940, Rotterdam, destroying the whole city centre (when the Netherlands was not at war) before the Luftwaffe turned on Britain a few months later. Strategic bombing killed many allied as well as German civilians. In the months of preparation for the 1944 Normandy landings the RAF destroyed every bridge over the Seine downstream from Paris. Most bridges were in town centres; they were hard to hit with WWII technology. Most of the buildings on the river banks of all these towns were destroyed and French civilians killed. But these raids isolated the Normandy battlefield from the bulk of German forces in the Calais-Dunkirk area; they were a major contribution to allied success.Stuart WhyteCharing, Kent \u2022\u2008My father, Don Day, flew as a flight engineer with Bomber Command during WWII. Many years later he retired to Australia, and to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of that war the government of Western Australia invited those who were involved to write their stories, which are on the web at http://www.anzac.dpc.wa.gov.au/Pages/Default.aspx. My father had rarely spoken much about his wartime experience, and it could be that the words he wrote for that website explain why; &quot;At the end of the war we were allowed to take the ground crew of our airport and fly over some of the cities in Germany to let them see what had been achieved. The impact upon myself was terrible because even I had no idea of the devastation that had been caused, to fly over a city the size of Cologne and not see a single house that was not severely damaged. The only building that was still standing was the cathedral, how it survived I will never know because it was absolutely black with the smoke from the fires. The impact was life changing because I never want to see such devastation again because I realise that a lot of human suffering must have taken place.&quot; It may have been because of his love of flying, or maybe it was some sense of recompense, that made my father fly over a hundred missions into Berlin as part of the airlift which kept the people of Berlin alive during the blockade.Peter DayLondon"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/jun/25/welfare-reform-necessary-michael-white", "sentences": ["Rivals teams are doing better: notably in Asia \u2013 from the Gulf state oil economies whose sovereign wealth funds are now buying prime chunks of UK Plc through south Asia \u2013 India, Singapore, Thailand \u2013 and on to China."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-25T11:15:42Z", "title": "Welfare reform is clearly necessary, but let's not over-egg the pudding | Michael White", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Welfare", "Benefits", "Society", "Public sector cuts", "Housing benefit", "Communities", "Housing", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Conservatives", "Liberal Democrats"], "article": "As all sorts of people have rushed to point out, the political advantages of David Cameron&apos;s latest bout of welfare-baiting are obvious - a distraction from more immediate problems such as muddled Lords reform, Europe and tax avoidance by top Tories, and red meat to the restless party faithful, so desperate that some are even touting Michael Gove as a leader-in-waiting for a post-coalition age when they can upset the Lib Dems every day. But the political perils are pretty obvious too. It&apos;s one thing to try and shake up a doddery welfare system when the mood is optimistic, and economic opportunity and growth are plentiful; it&apos;s quite another when there are 2.6 million people looking for work and many more either working part-time or resigned to unemployment. Oh, and another thing: lots of voters suspect the Tories are talking this way because they want to use the recession as an excuse to cut back the welfare state and wider public expenditure. Labour&apos;s welfare spokesman, Liam Byrne (another citizen over whom joblessness hovers), was quick to issue a statement: &quot;It&apos;s now very clear that a welfare revolution was all talk. Out-of-work benefits are going through the roof. Each week we hear of another new initiative, another crackdown, another test. &quot;Meanwhile in the real world, the cost out-of-work benefit is up nearly \u00a35bn, housing benefit over \u00a34bn, the work programme is failing and the multibillion pound universal credit scheme is running late and over budget,&quot; he protested. All true, as far as it goes. The danger in a recession \u2013 so evident in stricken Greece \u2013 is that the economic slowdown, combined with official austerity that reinforces rather than counters private austerity, means that more people lose their jobs, stop paying taxes and start claiming benefit. Austerity-minded governments, our own included, find themselves borrowing more, not less, to pay for the consequences. An extra \u00a39bn has been spent on jobseeker&apos;s allowance and housing benefit since 2010, according to Byrne&apos;s figures. Meanwhile the economy flat-lines at best, and ministers&apos; hopes of getting the long-term unemployed back into work via the work programme are proving unfounded. No surprise there really. Labour in office had all sorts of ideas to tackle hardcore unemployment, which were made much harder by the rise in jobless figures in its third term between 2005 and 2010. The left&apos;s response is to say: &quot;Go easy on austerity. Borrow more to generate worthwhile investment and jobs and tackle tax avoidance by the rich before welfare benefits. Don&apos;t hammer the poor, they suffer enough and spend what they get, which helps the economy more than rich folk piling the stuff into offshore accounts.&quot; Ed Balls even advocates cutting VAT. All more or less true, but no one should think that such policy shifts would do more than marginally ease our collective plight and would probably create other problems \u2013 higher borrowing costs, for instance, if markets panic. We are suffering from a much bigger readjustment to our way of life than either Cameron, Nick Clegg or Ed Miilband&apos;s policy initiatives or political manoeuvres can easily accommodate. Some are our own fault - the collapse of skills in many sectors, the sell-off of key British manufacturing and service companies to the highest foreign bidder (who may then asset strip jobs and research capacity), decades of under-investment and too much focus on the City. It&apos;s as if a football team, full of potential talent, was hopelessly ill-prepared to win a major competition (obviously I&apos;m just making this up) and is left outclassed and defeated again. But it&apos;s not all because Wayne Rooney (obviously I&apos;ve made the name up) is ill-disciplined, overpaid and out of condition to manage 90 minutes, let alone 120. Other fundamental changes to our relative status are way beyond our control. Rivals teams are doing better: notably in Asia \u2013 from the Gulf state oil economies whose sovereign wealth funds are now buying prime chunks of UK Plc through south Asia \u2013 India, Singapore, Thailand \u2013 and on to China. The 20th century rise of Japan turned out simply to be a foretaste of things to come. In that context, we can forget about dodgy Lords reform or the determination of Eurosceptic Tories to make a bad situation worse. Cameron \u2013 Clegg, Miliband and Co too \u2013 have a duty to consider the long-term imperative that ensures we have an affordable welfare system, a better-educated and motivated workforce (I mean you too, Rooney, as well as those offshore City spivs and welfare professionals) and much else needed to keep us afloat and relatively solvent. &quot;You Europeans have become lazy,&quot; say all sorts of Asian analysts. So I don&apos;t think Cameron is necessarily out of order to say some of the things Patrick Wintour&apos;s report this morning suggests are in today&apos;s big speech, challenging entrenched assumptions about payment levels to single parents with large families, or the way in which the average age at which young people now get social housing (if they&apos;re lucky) funded with housing benefit has dropped to 21. It&apos;s automaticity he&apos;s challenging. He&apos;s not putting everyone under 25 on the street, though I wish he&apos;d wait for one set of interesting-but-unproven IDS reforms to bed down before he muddies the pond by launching another set, even if they&apos;re for the 2015 Tory manifesto. It makes it all sound more omnishambles, not blue sky thinking. Family fragmentation at all levels of society is a cause of grief, but when bad habits were confined to the upper classes it was usually kept quiet and they paid for their own vices. It&apos;s much more complicated now, a highway to middle class impoverishment. As for the bottom of society where the underclass lives, society is expected by many to pick up their bill. I got some stick when I wrote about it recently , though the way things turned out make me think I called that one right. It may not be a huge problem, but the cost of problem families to the taxpayer is huge, and collecting the tax-avoiders&apos; fair share of tax \u2013 footballers as well as bankers are in K2-style rackets of the kind that Jimmy Carr has just abandoned \u2013 will only offset the costs. In any case, they are not simply about money. There is a social and economic cost too, mostly borne by the problem families, their neighbours and (in some cases) their victims. We should do better, as many of our European neighbours do. And before you tell me it&apos;s class warfare, I draw your attention to a Prospect magazine poll, which the BBC&apos;s Nick Robinson mentioned today. Some 74% of voters, including 59% of Labour voters, think we spend too much on welfare, and 51% of those in the lowest income groups think the same. Two-thirds of voters believe &quot;a substantial minority&quot; of claimants are scroungers. That&apos;s probably too high and reflects the diet of welfare stories in the rightwing tabloids, most of which Guardian reading, BBC-watching folk never get to hear about. The unemployed and never-married single parents are the chief targets of their disdain, not pensioners. Fair or not, I expect you would probably have got that sort of polling result at any time in the past 500 years, and anywhere too. It&apos;s not going to get any easier in the next 500, so we&apos;d better try and rebalance the equation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jun/25/profit-making-threatens-moral-purpose-education", "sentences": ["Last week&apos;s O-level proposal seems to come straight off the shelves of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-25T18:15:01Z", "title": "Profit-making schools threaten the moral purpose of education", "tags": ["Free schools", "School funding", "School privatisation", "Schools", "Education", "Education policy", "Politics"], "article": "Education ministers have embarked on a worldwide shopping spree for ideas. Last week&apos;s O-level proposal seems to come straight off the shelves of Singapore. There is, of course, a risk that politicians become selective shoppers, only attracted to those policies that reflect their own political ideology, but, despite this, learning from international best practice has to be right and we need to develop a framework that enables us to do so more effectively. Meanwhile, there is one policy that is unlikely to be imported this side of the next general election but could be a political dividing line and a source of tension within the coalition. Whether or not there is a place in our school system for those who want to run schools for profit has not, I sense, yet been settled. Thirty years ago, &quot;not for profit&quot; would have been assumed to be at the core of a key public service like education \u2013 part of its reason for being. Yet, in recent years, there has been enough overlap of the public and private sector in the running and management of state schools for some to claim that schools returning a profit would be a next logical step. The role of the private sector has already been contentious. It&apos;s certainly easy to make the case that it has not been a universal success \u2013 some school meals services and messy PFI contracts, for example \u2013 but the new &quot;mix&quot; ought to be welcomed. There is a wider and more diverse range of service providers, many bringing new ideas as well as experience, as schools increasingly control their own budgets. There is, however, a world of difference between private providers being paid to do a job or deliver a service and being allowed to make a profit. The encouragement of new providers accelerated through the free schools programme provides a structure in which, for the first time, &quot;for profit&quot; schools are possible. At the moment, opposition from the Liberal Democrats within the coalition keeps it off the government agenda, but pressure for change will come from two sources: from those on the right within the government and from the need to attract growing numbers of organisations to drive the flagship free schools policy. Governments have already encouraged schools to form partnerships with both the private and voluntary sector. However, this has not been about setting the scene for profit-making schools, and any suggestion that should now be the case should be strongly resisted. There are compelling reasons. At times of falling school budgets any surplus cash should be reinvested in schools rather than into people&apos;s bank accounts; this is irrefutable but it is not the core of the argument. Profit can drive improvement. But the financial bottom line will never provide the motivation to deliver what we want and need from schools. There is a moral purpose that underpins education and, although by itself it is not enough, it must be the driving force. Without it, it&apos;s too easy to accept that it&apos;s not worth trying, yet again, to help a child to master a skill, or to rationalise that the social class divide is something we&apos;ll just have to live with. Understanding this moral purpose for education is not the preserve of those in the public sector; others bring the same passion and determination and share in the same joy success brings, but all this feels strikingly at odds with the drive for profit. Value for money, certainly; careful management of resources, essential; but there can only be one set of shareholders \u2013 and that is the children. The relationship between politics and\u00a0education is often difficult, and can lead to mistrust and uncertainty, but as for the core purpose of education, let us\u00a0all agree not to muddy these particular waters."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/25/lib-dem-fugitive-dog-medicine", "sentences": ["Bill Chua, a businessman from Singapore who is owed $140,000 (\u00a390,000) by Brown, claims he sent medicine for Charlie.", "Chua, an energy trader from Singapore, said that he informed police after Brown sent a fake cheque to repay a $140,000 loan."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-25T18:16:01Z", "title": "Lib Dem fugitive donor caught after plea for dog medicine", "tags": ["Michael Brown", "UK news", "Liberal Democrats", "Politics", "Party funding", "Crime", "Singapore", "Dominican Republic", "World news", "Charles Kennedy"], "article": "The Liberal Democrats&apos; fugitive donor was located by police in a Caribbean hideaway because he was desperate to receive medicines for his dog who is named after the party&apos;s former leader, Charles Kennedy.

Bill Chua, a businessman from Singapore who is owed $140,000 (\u00a390,000) by Brown, claims he sent medicine for Charlie. But he also told City of London police the address, enabling detectives to close down bank accounts and forcing Brown to leave his villa. The disclosure explains for the first time how detectives came to know the whereabouts of one of Britain&apos;s most-wanted fraudsters and pass them on to the Dominican Republic authorities and Interpol. Brown, who had been sentenced to seven years for fraud-related charges in his absence, was forced to go on the run in the Dominican Republic without access to money.     Michael Brown's pet dog, Charlie.     On Monday, Brown, 46 was handed a further six months in jail for fleeing the UK ahead of his trial. He has started serving his sentence. Chua, an energy trader from Singapore, said that he informed police after Brown sent a fake cheque to repay a $140,000 loan. &quot;Brown gave me his address because he loved Charlie the dog and wanted medicines which I sent to him. But he deserves to go to jail because he is a cheap fraudster,&quot; Chua said. The Liberal Democrats have faced calls to repay the donation but Nick Clegg has refused to do so, saying it was received in good faith. The high court ruled in 2006 that the money was only given to the Liberal Democrats so that Brown could give himself a veneer of respectability while defrauding victims of their savings. Brown emerged from nowhere in 2005 when he gave the money to Kennedy&apos;s general election campaign. He was not registered to vote, lived abroad and was not a party member but was welcomed with open arms when he offered the party its biggest ever donation. Brown told reporters at the time that he was backing Kennedy, not the Liberal Democrats. During the election campaign, Kennedy flew around Britain in Brown&apos;s private jet, sometimes with the donor. At the birth of Kennedy&apos;s child, Brown and his wife, Sharon, sent them a hamper. But months after the election, the truth about Brown began to emerge. He had set up a fraudulent scheme to entrap high-yield investors by claiming he had guaranteed bonds. Investors including the former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards parted with up to \u00a336m. Brown went on the run in July 2008 while awaiting trial for theft and false accounting having changed his name to Campbell-Brown and altered his appearance. Chua, 62, said he first came across Brown when the Glaswegian posed as an oil trader called Michael Campbell-Brown in spring 2008. Unbeknown to Chua, Brown was on bail, but still attempted to sell Chua 100,000 tonnes of diesel for $42m. Even then, Brown&apos;s associates were boasting about Brown&apos;s Lib Dem connections. &quot;I was told by the guy who set up the deal that Brown was an influential guy who had funded a political party. He was some sort of kingmaker,&quot; Chua said. The pair met in London, but the phoney deal fell through. Chua said he then did not hear from Brown until the end of 2010 when Brown again contacted him offering to sell diesel. By this time, he was living in the Dominican Republic but refused to give his exact address. Chua said he began to Skype with Brown regularly. They would often talk of their mutual love of dogs. &quot;Brown would talk about Charlie all the time. Charlie&apos;s picture was his Skype identity and he told me about how they would go for long walks on beaches,&quot; he said. But in February 2011, Brown contacted Chua and made a claim that, at the time, seemed plausible to Chua. Brown claimed that he had been kidnapped and said that his life was in danger if he could not raise $140,000 in ransom, Chua said. &quot;I was stunned. I even spoke to a kidnapper. At that point I said OK I will pay,&quot; Chua said. Chua sent the money to bank accounts in the Dominican Republic and the US. In May 2011, Brown again called Chua in desperation. Brown&apos;s beloved dog, Charlie, had fallen ill. &quot;Brown told me that his dog was ill, had terrible tics and could hardly see. He wanted me to send him some medicine. And so he gave me his address.&quot; Brown&apos;s Skype identitity was Charlie the dog, Chua said. Brown, it emerged, had been living in a luxurious three-bedroom villa in the exclusive resort of Punta Cana, on the eastern most tip of the country with his dog and a housekeeper. Chua the sent the medicine to Brown, but became became increasingly irate that Brown had not repaid the &quot;ransom&quot;. Brown eventually sent him a cheque, but it bounced. Chua was then contacted by a businessman who told him that the man posing under the names of Campbell-Brown had escaped the UK using the name of Darren Nally and was actually Michael Brown, a wanted fraudster. Chua then contacted the British police and told them of Brown&apos;s address. Detectives closed down some of Brown&apos;s bank accounts and told the Dominican Republic police of his whereabouts, forcing Brown to flee. On Monday, at Southwark crown court, Brown was jailed for a further six months, to run consecutively with his seven-year jail term.

The very concept is down there with ski-jumpers from Essex and swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, especially when you consider that the Saudi is likely to have to wear a veil, and be accompanied by a chaperone. Novelty-value men have been competing for years, of course, while women from the Gulf Kingdom have been excluded from international sporting competition. Until now, that is. In a startling development within arguably the most despotic and reviled Arab country in the world, western media such as the BBC reported that a 20-year-old equestrian would compete for Saudia Arabia and light up the London Olympics with her talent, charisma and \u2013 most important of all \u2013 faith in feminist progress. Not only is Dalma Malhas a fine horsewoman, but she apparently believes in the potential of autocratic Islamic monarchies to adapt and change. Or, as a gushing profile by one journalist put it, Dalma is &quot;now emerging as a torch for women in Saudi Arabia by showing how freedom to perform can allow women to achieve their goals&quot;. So far, so very Olympic-spirited, but the same glowing write-up later adds: &quot;Though equestrianism means a lot to Saudi Arabian culture and religion, it is not an easy sport for anyone to practise in the Kingdom, especially because sport is not encouraged for women, due to traditional and cultural restrictions.&quot; Such euphemisms fail, unfortunately, to convey the full horror of the female condition in a country defined by ultra-conservative Wahhabi Islamic orthodoxy and equally patriarchal tribal customs. Saudi women are currently barred from voting or standing for office, are not allowed to expose any part of their body beyond eyes and hands, and have to have a &quot;male guardian&quot; with them at all times. They have separate entrances for public buildings and are not allowed to drive a car. The black humour that underpins state policy was inadvertently summed up in a recent speech by King Abdullah, who said: &quot;I want women to drive when society is ready for it.&quot; Which perhaps makes it less surprisingly that less than 24 hours after the BBC reported Malhas&apos;s inclusion in the team, the Olympic federation denied that she would compete. In fact her horse has been out of action for weeks. Why then were the Saudi authorities keen to tell the BBC that she would? The answer lies, as with so many developments in the Middle East and North Africa, in last year&apos;s Arab Spring. As dictatorial regimes toppled from Cairo to Tunis, the surviving ones have tried to present a slick PR sheen, hiding their oppression with a sense of glowing achievement. Malhas fits the bill perfectly \u2013 not, unfortunately, because she is representative of downtrodden Saudi women, but because she is an American-born, London-educated multi-millionaire&apos;s daughter who conforms to the glamorous, internationalist image her massively wealthy country strives to portray abroad. The blond, blue-eyed sportswoman touched on the deceit herself when, interviewed during the youth Olympics in Singapore in 2010, she admitted: &quot;I\u00a0didn&apos;t care much about me being there as a representative of Saudi Arabia, because anyone could probably do that.&quot; Her links with the country were, at best, nominal, with no official sponsorship from Riyadh nor national competitive trials. It is no coincidence that earlier this year the International Olympic Committee said it was preparing to ban Saudi Arabia from London 2012 altogether unless the country sent women to the Games. Tessa Jowell, Britain&apos;s former Olympics minister, led the outcry in February, saying that the Saudis were &quot;clearly breaking the spirit of the Olympic charter&apos;s pledge to equality&quot;. In turn, a terse response from the Olympic committee in Saudi Arabia was that it would &quot;oversee participation of women athletes who can qualify&quot;. Yet only one woman was identified as likely to qualify in any report so far and that was Malhas. It is hard to understand how any woman could have qualified, given the range of repressive measures affecting female participation in sport in the Gulf Kingdom, including the fact that physical education is banned in girls&apos; state schools and a 2009 decision to close all private gyms to women. A prominent Saudi religious scholar highlighted the still prevalent orthodoxy by saying that &quot;opening sports to women and girls will lead to immorality&quot;. Despite chronic obesity levels and related diseases among Saudi women, a recent human rights report relates a widely held belief in the desert state that &quot;once women start to exercise they will shed modest clothing, spend unnecessary time out of the house, and have increased possibilities of mingling with men&quot;. The political tokenism prevalent in Saudi Arabia is certainly summed up by the Malhas case. Other gestures include the fact that in three years time women will technically be allowed to vote in local elections for the first time \u2013 as long as they get a male guardian&apos;s permission to do so. As with the minuscule political reforms, letting Malhas compete in London gives the impression that the Saudis have appreciated the spirit of the Arab Spring while in fact not acting upon it.

Under pressure from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which insists that every country should field female athletes, the Saudi government announced on Sunday its willingness to let women athletes compete. Dalma Rushdi Malhas, who won bronze in the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore in 2010, was seen as the country&apos;s most likely representative. But her mother, Arwa Mutabagani, told the Guardian she would not be able to compete because her horse, Caramell KS, was injured. &quot;Unfortunately her horse got injured, and there is no chance of her getting to the Olympics this time,&quot; said Mutabagani, herself a former showjumper. &quot;You have to have the combination. It would be like a Formula One driver going to the track without their car.&quot; Caramell was bought from Sweden for a substantial sum at the end of last year to help Malhas&apos;s Olympic bid, but an injury to its back was diagnosed six weeks ago and it will not have recovered in time for the Games. It would, in any case, have been premature for the IOC to pitch Malhas into Olympic competition. As the Youth Olympic Games, in which she won her bronze, was a relatively underpowered event, she had not reached the qualifying standard, so the IOC would have had to give her a wildcard. Such a manoeuvre, convenient though it would have been in ending the standoff between the Saudi authorities and the IOC, would have proved controversial, with other countries asking why Saudi competitors should receive special treatment. The equestrian world governing body, the FEI, confirmed that Malhas would not be competing. &quot;However, we understand that the IOC has a number of other female athletes from Saudi Arabia in other sports who are currently under consideration,&quot; said its secretary general Ingmar De Vos. While ruling out her daughter&apos;s participation in London, Mutabagani \u2013 a key figure in the development of equestrianism in Saudi Arabia and the first female member of the country&apos;s Olympic committee \u2013 welcomed the Saudi decision to allow women to compete. &quot;It gives an opportunity to women in the country who love sport,&quot; she said. Mutabagani was not allowed to compete alongside men in domestic competition, so had to go abroad where she was registered as a Saudi rider, but never able to compete as part of an official team. To further her daughter&apos;s career, she has spent much of the past decade in Italy, where her daughter trained, and now runs an equestrian centre in the French town of Chantilly. She describes her daughter as &quot;a talented rider and a fast learner&quot; and says she hopes she will compete at a future Olympics. The Saudis are putting huge efforts into developing showjumping; the men&apos;s team is expected to perform well in London But their women \u2013 and Malhas is not the only female rider with potential \u2013 may have to wait until Rio in 2016 to clear this historic fence."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jun/26/best-time-lapse-travel-videos", "sentences": ["The vast number of time-lapse films out there range hugely in scope, from the truly epic like Terra Sacra, a beautiful film of remote, empty landscapes and ancient monuments photographed in 24 countries over six years by film-maker Sean F White, to films focused on a single location, like this video of Saigon&apos;s frenetic roads by Singapore-based photographer Rob Whitworth."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-26T09:27:00Z", "title": "Best time-lapse travel videos", "tags": ["Travel", "Festivals", "United States holidays", "Travel photography"], "article": "Around the world in six years \u2013 and six minutes    Terra Sacra Time Lapses from Sean F.

British Airways will run four services a day between Leeds Bradford and Heathrow from 9 December, ending a period of uncertainty that has seen the link broken twice in as many years. Ticket sales opened on Wednesday with a single fare costing \u00a342. Andy Lord, BA&apos;s director of operations, who unveiled the link at Leeds Bradford, said the airline was sure that its network would not face the problems which led first BMI and then Flybe to withdraw from Leeds in 2009 and 2011. But the move was condemned by environmental groups including Greenpeace, whose senior campaigner, Joss Garman, said: &quot;You can hop on a train to do this journey. It&apos;s exactly these kind of short-haul flights, easily reachable by other less polluting ways to travel, which clog up Heathrow. The aviation lobbyists look as disjointed as the government&apos;s transport policy if they&apos;re going to applaud needless flights like this and then complain about Heathrow being full.&quot; The new service follows BA&apos;s acquisition of BMI and its Heathrow landing and take-off slots in April and will see streamlined connection services aimed at the business and tourism sector. Travellers will be able to check in bags and get boarding cards at Leeds-Bradford for onward flights from London and timings will be linked to BA services to destinations including New York, Singapore, Johannesburg and Hong Kong. Yorkshire pitched vigorously for the new link, one of three confirmed by BA with others introducing direct services between Heathrow and Rotterdam and Zagreb. Lord said: &quot;This is our first new service to a regional airport for some years and it&apos;s a tribute to the persistence of Leeds Bradford and the case which people in Yorkshire and the Humber have made. It&apos;s also a welcome return to Yorkshire for British Airways and we are very excited about flying from this excellent, commercially important airport once again. &quot;Leeds Bradford has a significant catchment area and we are delighted to offer not only direct flights to London but a well timed schedule that will allow customers from this region to connect with our extensive short haul and long haul flights from Heathrow.&quot; A report for BAA Airports from Oxford Economics last year underlined the importance of better air links to manufacturing and other businesses in Yorkshire and the Humber. It estimated that \u00a33.3bn of exports from the region annually depend on international flights and two-thirds of the foreign investors, who account for 11% of jobs, rely on air transport to reach their main markets. The study also emphasised the importance of tourism to Yorkshire and the Humber and suggested that 3,800 jobs in the region depend directly on access to Heathrow. Overseas visitors spent \u00a3417m in Yorkshire and the Humber in 2010 and 749,000 of the estimated 1,000,000 total arrived in the UK by air. Mark Goldstone from Leeds Chamber of Commerce said: &quot;This is a real issue for Leeds city region as we have dozens of members that trade with or aspire to do business with the likes of Brazil, India and China. To support trade and the city region&apos;s economy, it is vital for our firms to be able to make connections to these emerging markets.&quot; Brian Dunsby of Harrogate Chamber of Trade &amp; Commerce said: &quot;We have been lobbying for a restoration of the scheduled service between Leeds Bradford and Heathrow ever since BMI withdrew the service in 2009. &quot;Whilst the East Coast trains from Leeds and York to Kings Cross are ideal for visits to central London, the onward connection to Heathrow can take more than an hour, which means that the new flights will be much more convenient \u2013 given an adequate flight schedule.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/28/david-beckham-london-2012-team-gb", "sentences": ["Beckham, 37, played a key part in securing the Games for London as part of the delegation that travelled to Singapore in 2005, and worked with the London 2012 chairman Lord Coe as part of the failed bid to land the 2018 World Cup."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-28T12:37:07Z", "title": "David Beckham set for London 2012 role after Team GB squad omission", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: football", "David Beckham", "Olympic Games 2012", "LA Galaxy", "Team GB", "Football", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "British Olympic officials are keen to find a significant role for David Beckham at the Games after the former England captain was left out of the Team GB football squad by the coach Stuart Pearce.

He is from east London and knows how important the Games and sport are to young people. He is a great role model and we are lucky to have such an advocate. I will be talking to him about a Games-time role.&quot; The LA Galaxy midfielder has previously spoken of his pride at performing an ambassadorial role, and recently told a delegation of young aspiring sports stars at a Jaguar Academy day that he planned to be in London regardless of whether or not he was picked. He is believed to be making arrangments to bring his family to London during the Games and has spoken of his excitement at watching basketball and other events in his hometown, having been brought up in Leyton near the Stratford site. &quot;As a Londoner, I have been really proud to have played a small part in bringing the Olympics to my home town, and I can&apos;t wait for the Games to begin,&quot; he said. The absence of the former England captain from Pearce&apos;s final 18-man squad, expected to be unveiled in full early next week, also increases the likelihood that he will be involved in Danny Boyle&apos;s opening ceremony. Bookmakers have slashed the odds on him lighting the Olympic flame. Meanwhile, the London 2012 organising committee is also considering whether he should have an official role, and Olympic sponsors Adidas and Samsung are likely to require his presence in London. The Team GB men&apos;s football side are due to start their campaign at Old Trafford on 26 July, the day before the opening ceremony, before facing the United Arab Emirates at Wembley three days later. Ryan Giggs, Craig Bellamy and Micah Richards are believed to have been selected as the trio of overage players in the 18-strong squad, meaning that other potential contenders such as Joe Cole, Frank Lampard and Michael Carrick have also been overlooked. &quot;Everyone knows how much playing for my country has always meant to me.

The London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe, and British Olympic Association officials will now seek to ensure the former England captain has a high-profile official role at the Games, but it will not be on the field. Pearce could not find space for Beckham in his 18-man squad after a lack of defensive and attacking options led him to select Manchester City&apos;s Micah Richards and Liverpool&apos;s Craig Bellamy as two of his three overage players. That left the coach with a straight choice between Beckham and Giggs, with the latter&apos;s more recent Premier League experience believed to have been a deciding factor. Beckham will therefore be denied the final bow he craved in his home city, after a career that has taken him from Manchester to Madrid then Los Angeles, and earned him 115 international caps. Coe said that Beckham had been the &quot;number one supporter&quot; of the London Games and the BOA, which was given no warning of his omission, is also keen to involve the 37-year-old in an ambassadorial role. He is likely to play a part in the opening ceremony on 27 July. Admitting he is &quot;very disappointed&quot;, Beckham revealed Pearce called him on Wednesday night to break the news. Given the number of defenders who are unavailable, either because they went to the European Championship or are injured, Pearce felt he needed extra cover at the back and so plumped for Richards. Among those ruled out of the reckoning were Phil Jones, Martin Kelly, Kyle Walker and Chris Smalling. Pearce is a longstanding fan of Richards and brought him back into the England squad for his only match as caretaker manager, against Holland, before the Manchester City defender missed out on the Euro 2012 squad chosen by Roy Hodgson. The England manager&apos;s decision to take Daniel Welbeck to Euro 2012 also led Pearce to the conclusion that he needed to use one of the overage slots for a striker. Pearce&apos;s decision, which he always insisted would be based on &quot;form and fitness&quot; alone, also ruled out Joe Cole, Adam Johnson and Frank Lampard. Among the 15 players under 23 believed to have made the squad are the Spurs wide player Gareth Bale, the Chelsea forward Daniel Sturridge and the Birmingham City goalkeeper Jack Butland, for whom the Football Association&apos;s promise not to select any players who went to Poland and Ukraine will be waived. Jack Rodwell, the Everton midfielder who launched the Team GB kit, has missed the cut after a series of injury problems. The full squad of 18, plus four reserves, will be announced early next week.

The British Olympic Association is expected to name the choice on 23 July, four days before Danny Boyle&apos;s opening ceremony, a secret rehearsal of which involving 2,000 performers was understood to have taken place at Olympic Park yesterday.

The lawsuits allege the fraud was extensive, spanning at least three continents and involving trades worth tens of billions of pounds. The allegations raise further serious questions about the banks&apos; ability to police themselves and the role of senior management in monitoring the activities of their employees. In a 28-page statement of facts relating to last week&apos;s revelation that Barclays had been fined a total of \u00a3290m, the US Department of Justice discloses how a network of traders working on both sides of the Atlantic conspired to influence both the Libor and Euribor interest rates \u2013 the rates at which banks lend to each other. It was, in effect, a worldwide conspiracy against the free functioning of the market. The size of the fines was significant and the opprobrium heaped on Barclays unremitting. &quot;This is the most damaging scam I can recall,&quot; said Andrew Tyrie, chair of parliament&apos;s Treasury select committee. &quot;It appears that many banks were involved and Barclays were the first to own up.&quot; Indeed, as politicians bay for his blood this weekend, the one source of comfort for Bob Diamond, the embattled Barclays chief executive, is that his bank appears to have been merely one of several involved in the scandal. For their own sake, many of his fellow senior bankers will be hoping this weekend that he does not go the way of Northern Rock&apos;s Adam Applegarth and RBS&apos;s Fred Goodwin \u2013 ousted by a tidal wave of public fury. Until last week few people outside the world of banking would even have been aware of Libor and fewer still would have appreciated that it can exert a significant influence over their lives. But many people have mortgages linked to Libor and fluctuations in its rate can affect the size of their monthly home loan repayments. More significant, however, is the effect manipulating Libor would have on investment and pension funds who buy complex financial products \u2013 commonly known as derivatives \u2013 linked to interest rates. At least one major financial institution \u2013 the US broker, Charles Schwab \u2013 alleges in a lawsuit filed in April that its &quot;funds did not receive their rightful payments on those instruments&quot; suggesting a plethora of similar lawsuits seeking compensation could soon be issued. The Department of Justice document states that the collusion between traders across a range of banks, including Barclays, took place from at least August 2005 through to least May 2008. It states: &quot;Those interbank communications included ones in which certain Barclays swaps traders communicated with former Barclays swaps traders who had left Barclays and joined other financial institutions. &quot;The likelihood that the Libor or Euribor fix would be affected increased when other\u2026 banks also manipulated their submissions as part of a coordinated effort.&quot; It is understood at least 16 banks in addition to Barclays are being investigated. Inquiries into alleged market manipulation are being carried out in the UK, the US, Japan, Canada, the European Union and Singapore and involve nine government agencies. The lawsuit filed by Charles Schwab against a number of banks including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS, whose chief executive Stephen Hester is under fire over June&apos;s IT problems that left customers unable to withdraw cash, shines light on the scale of the alleged scandal. Schwab&apos;s lawyers hired independent experts to examine the banks&apos; trades during the &quot;critical two-week period following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers&quot;. The experts looked at submissions each of the banks made to the Libor Panel of the British Banking Association \u2013 which oversees the interbank lending rate. A high Libor rate submission indicates a bank is struggling to borrow from other lenders. A low rate indicates the opposite. Submissions are therefore viewed as a sign of a bank&apos;s financial health. According to the lawsuit, each bank studied by Schwab&apos;s experts &quot;dramatically increased its collusive suppression of Libor&quot; \u2013 effectively conspiring to keep rates low. The lawsuit cites claims that the &quot;underreporting of Libor had a $45bn effect on the market, representing the amount borrowers [the banks] did not pay&quot; investors who had bought its financial products. The focus now is on who participated in the collusion. Last May Canada&apos;s Competition Bureau filed an affidavit against a number of banks, including HSBC Bank Canada, and Royal Bank of Scotland NV, demanding staff hand over emails and other documents. Bureau investigators want to determine whether the banks conspired to fix derivative interest rates, a major form of market manipulation. According to the affidavit, one bank which has turned whistleblower and agreed to help the Canadian authorities with its investigation, the banks &quot;communicated with each other... to form agreements...&quot; which &quot;was done for the purpose of benefiting trading positions&quot;. One trader at the whistleblower bank is alleged to have communicated with traders at HSBC, Deutsche Bank, RBS, JP Morgan and Citibank. The crucial question is whether the traders were acting on their own or were doing so with the backing, or at the very least, the knowledge of senior managers. Certainly there are allegations senior management at at least one bank was aware what was happening. A lawsuit filed in Singapore by a former RBS trader, fired by the bank, alleges it was &quot;common practice&quot; among RBS&apos;s senior employees to make requests for the Libor submissions to be set at certain rates. RBS rejects the claim. Barclays too denies that senior management were aware of what was happening on the trading desks. Diamond accepts only that a &quot;small number&quot; of Barclays&apos; traders were aware of efforts to rig a series of short-term interest rates to benefit their own desks&apos; trading positions. In a clear damage limitation exercise, Diamond wrote to finance committee chair Tyrie last week seeking to clarify the settlement Barclays had agreed with US and UK regulators. Diamond sought to separate the actions of the traders over a sustained period of years from those of the bank during the momentous days following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. He stressed Barclays lowered its submissions to the Libor panel during the height of the financial crisis to &quot;protect the reputation of the bank from negative speculation&quot;. A higher Libor submission would have indicated that the bank was in financial trouble, a suggestion Barclays denied at the time, blaming ill-founded media reports. Diamond wrote: &quot;The inaccurate speculation about potential liquidity problems \u2026 created a real and material risk that the bank and its shareholders would suffer damage. It was, as you will recall, a period of extraordinary turbulence and uncertainty.&quot; Or, as the FSA&apos;s report explains, a Barclays manager ordered an employee to lower his Libor submission &quot;to send the message that we&apos;re not in the shit&quot;. It appears Barclays was by no means alone in trying to protect its reputation. As the financial crisis raged, several Barclays&apos; employees told the City watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, the BBA and the Bank of England that all the banks that comprise the Libor panel &quot;were contributing rates that were too low&quot;. The revelation has raised questions about whether the authorities should have acted sooner. A spokeswoman for the BBA said: &quot;We are looking into claims about when this was brought to our attention.&quot; Yesterday, Treasury sources confirmed there is to be an urgent review into how Libor operates and suggested there could be criminal sanctions for those who abuse it. Critics of the system have claimed that the scandal was the inevitable consequence of a casino-style culture that has thrived so aggressively across the City over the last decade. But if so politicians must share the blame. It was Gordon Brown who in his Mansion House speech in 2006 boasted how he had resisted a &quot;regulatory crackdown&quot; following the accounting scandal that brought down telecoms giant WorldCom. Brown promised the City a &quot;predictable and light touch regulatory environment&quot;. As he prepared to question Diamond this Wednesday, when the UK&apos;s highest paid businessman appears before the Treasury select committee he chairs, Conservative MP Tyrie warned: &quot;The public&apos;s trust in banks has been even further eroded. Restoring the reputational damage must begin immediately.&quot; For this reason, the Barclays chief executive remains very much in the line of fire. &quot;Diamond must go,&quot; said the former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott. &quot;The criminals must be charged and convicted whether in Barclays or other banks, brokers or hedge funds.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/30/vince-cable-shareholders-bank-cheats", "sentences": ["With investigations in the EU, the US, Switzerland, Singapore and Japan, the scandal is threatening to go global."], "publicationDate": "2012-06-30T20:07:00Z", "title": "Vince Cable tells shareholders: throw out bank cheats", "tags": ["Banking", "Vince Cable", "Banking reform", "Politics", "Financial sector", "Barclays", "Bob Diamond", "Libor", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Vince Cable has urged shareholders in UK banks to rise up and purge their companies of corrupt executives, who he says have allowed &quot;systemic abuse&quot; to take root in the banking system. The business secretary, writing in the Observer, says it is now clear that no one at Barclays Capital, the investment bank that triggered the market-rigging scandal, is prepared to take responsibility for endemic corruption, so the ultimate owners of banks must take matters into their own hands. Describing the problems in UK banking as &quot;a moral quagmire of almost biblical proportions&quot;, Cable says the government is taking urgent action, including creating a clearer separation between &quot;casino-style investment banking&quot; and retail banking on the high street. Ministers will this week begin a review into the Libor system under which banks lend to each other and Cable hints that US-style criminal sanctions, such as the threat of prison terms, could be considered against those who abuse it. But he says shareholder power will be crucial. &quot;Regulators are a backstop: they don&apos;t own banks,&quot; he writes. &quot;The governance at the top of our leading banks has been shown to be lamentably weak. No one at the top of Barclays will take responsibility for systemic abuse. &quot;Shareholders, the owners, have a major responsibility here. I am bringing in legislation to strengthen their control over pay and bonuses, through binding votes, but shareholders have to get a stronger grip on weak boards and out-of-control executives.&quot; Shareholders have already opposed the pay package of Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of advertising giant WPP, while Trinity Mirror boss Sly Bailey and Aviva&apos;s chief executive Andrew Moss quit following opposition from investors. Cable says he is determined to encourage &quot;cultural change&quot; throughout the system. He cites the takeover by the not-for-profit Co-operative Bank of a large chunk of the Lloyds bank network as a model for a future system. It was announced on Saturday that the Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, who has faced calls from Labour to quit, will be summoned for questioning in front of the Commons Treasury select committee on Wednesday to explain the \u00a3290m fine imposed by US and UK regulators on Barclays Capital for rigging a key interbank lending rate. Non-executives, including chairman Marcus Agius, will appear on Thursday. &quot;The Libor interest rate benchmark \u2013 crucial to transactions right across the economy and affecting millions of people \u2013 was systematically rigged over a period of years,&quot; said the committee&apos;s chairman, Andrew Tyrie. &quot;This is the most damaging scam I can recall. The reputation of Britain&apos;s financial services industry has been severely tarnished, albeit unfairly for the overwhelming majority unconnected with the scam. The public&apos;s trust in banks has been even further eroded. Restoring the reputational damage must begin immediately.&quot; There are signs that Agius could be replaced to address demands for the bank to demonstrate accountability at the top. But it is far from clear that the idea has the support of the bank&apos;s board. If such a plan were implemented, one option might be for Agius to be replaced temporarily by the former top accountant Sir Michael Rake, who holds a key role as the &quot;senior independent director&quot;. Barclays issued a statement on Saturday saying it was &quot;categorically wrong&quot; to suggest Agius had plans to step down. Ed Miliband \u2013 in a speech to the Fabian Society on Saturday \u2013 attacked the government&apos;s failure to launch a public inquiry. &quot;I have news for David Cameron: the people want a moment of reckoning for our banks,&quot; he said. &quot;The British people will not tolerate the establishment closing ranks, saying we don&apos;t need an inquiry. They want a light shone into every dark corner of our banking system. They want bankers held to account.&quot; Meanwhile, legal action being brought across the Atlantic suggests the scandal is spreading. A lawsuit filed by the US stockbroking firm Charles Schwab alleges that Barclays was one of 16 banks whose manipulation of interbank lending rates &quot;artificially depressed the value of tens of billions of dollars&quot; in funds held by investors. It alleges the defendants, which include Lloyds, HSBC and RBS, &quot;knowingly colluded&quot; to keep the rates low and &quot;engaged in a media strategy&quot; to deflect attention from their actions. The banks are contesting the allegations. An affidavit filed by the Canadian Competition Bureau last year reveals that investigators are examining allegations that traders at a number of banks, including the Canadian arms of RBS and HSBC, colluded to set interest rates. The claims are denied by the banks. With investigations in the EU, the US, Switzerland, Singapore and Japan, the scandal is threatening to go global. Sources suggested hedge funds and brokers could be drawn into the affair. Cable&apos;s call for US-style penalties could see those found guilty of white-collar fraud serve long stints in jail.

Up until the last couple of weeks, I thought the one person who would know the answer to this would be you. Now I have my doubts. Can I run past you the chronology on how we parents heard about something that will fundamentally affect the education of all our children \u2013 in my case, my two youngest? You&apos;ll remember that on 20 June, Tim Shipman of the Daily Mail landed a sensational scoop: precise details of how GCSEs were to be scrapped from September 2014 to be replaced by O-levels, set and examined by a single exam board, alongside &quot;simpler exams, similar to the old CSEs&quot; for &quot;less intelligent pupils&quot;. What we don&apos;t know here is whose words are in quotation marks. Are they yours? One of your officials&apos;? Or Shipman&apos;s? All we can say is that it must be very convenient for you that we don&apos;t know. That way, you can always lay claim to the words that people praise and disown the ones that people dislike. When the story broke, we noticed, first, that you didn&apos;t deny it, and secondly, it appeared as if you were the only person in the world who had heard of this plan. Will you ever clear that matter up? The reason I ask is that there is a feeling in and around schools and universities that education is too important and too complex to be left to one person, his pencil and the back of an envelope \u2013 even someone as wise and thoughtful as yourself. What happened next wasn&apos;t the most successful day in your career, with hardly a voice anywhere congratulating you on what was clearly a two-tier system, which would entail streaming pupils from the age of 12 or 13. With the rage and contempt you brought on yourself, you might just as well have been talking about bringing back dip-pens and ink-wells. (Now there&apos;s an idea for you.) A few days later, the BBC website told us of a speech you gave at a Spectator conference. Now we learned that it most certainly wasn&apos;t going to be a two-tier system: everyone was going to take the new O-levels. In other words, it was going to be the GCSE but harder. Do you have any evidence that making exams harder makes students better at anything? I&apos;m sure you could put yourself in charge of raising the high-jump bar in the Olympics, but that would ensure that fewer high jumpers could clear it. In so far as anything resembling a policy is emerging here, that&apos;s about the only one I can discern: make the exams harder in order to get more students failing. Then, on 28 June, the seemingly well-informed Shipman was back with confirmation that neither the prime minister nor the Lib Dems had known anything about your original announcement. He had something else up his sleeve: &quot;Mr Gove made the case that he can tear up the exam system and bring back O-levels with the stroke of a pen, and since no legislation is required Mr Clegg can be ignored.&quot; Do you know, that&apos;s precisely what is worrying many of us? It&apos;s the image of you roaming round the Department for Education working out where you&apos;re going to deliver your pen-stroke next. Meanwhile, we know that though this flourish of the pen will affect our children&apos;s education, the matter need not pass through the mechanisms of government. It&apos;s Govement, not government. You&apos;ve let it be known your inspiration for this harder exam is Singapore. The great advantage in invoking other countries is that few of us are well enough informed to question whether you&apos;re having us on or not. But some people are. On 25 June, David Price OBE (for services to education), director of learning for the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, told us on his blog: &quot;Three weeks ago I was in Singapore, invited by the ministry of education ... to share the innovation of the educational projects I&apos;ve led. While Gove&apos;s proposed reforms are set to follow Singapore&apos;s exam system, their aspirations have already moved on. Singapore&apos;s minister of education has given officials 18 months to rebuild the system so that it can produce students who can create, collaborate, think critically and compete globally in our unpredictable future. Among many other initiatives, they have instigated a pilot programme based on my work&quot; \u2013 Price&apos;s specialism being &quot;re-engaging learners weary of the exam-factory culture&quot;. From inside Westminster, and indeed inside your brain, it may seem as if you move like lightning: scrapping one exam, inventing another, getting a story out, then another, but the substance of what you have in mind is yesterday&apos;s dinner. As an experienced professional like Price is telling you, the world is moving on. Singapore has noticed but you haven&apos;t.

As one of the main attractions at a new annual arms fare designed to boost Russia&apos;s standing in the global arms trade, they swayed and waved their gun turrets like limbs to the thumping beat of a Carmen aria souped up on techno . President Vladimir Putin said on Monday Russian arms export deliveries for the first six months of 2012 had reached over $6.5bn (\u00a34.1bn), a 14% increase on the same period last year. That figure put Russia on track to beat last year&apos;s record-breaking total sales of $13.2bn, analysts said. In 2005, Russia&apos;s arms exports stood at just $6bn, Putin said at a meeting of his military-technological co-operation commission in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. &quot;We definitely must keep this positive trend.&quot; With a 24% share of the global arms trade, Russia was the world&apos;s second largest arms exporter, lagging only behind the United States, with its 30% share, Putin said. Moscow delivered arms to 55 countries in all, he added. While some 150 countries at the UN are trying this month to hammer out a global arms trade treaty, Putin shows no sign of reining in Russia&apos;s ambitions. &quot;We must focus on expanding Russia&apos;s presence on the global arms market,&quot; he said. &quot;This applies to the geography of our deliveries and to the list of products and services.&quot; Russia&apos;s role in the global arms trade has come under increased scrutiny as the Kremlin pushes back against western accusations that its deliveries to Syria are fuelling Bashar al-Assad&apos;s violent crackdown on the opposition. Russia says it is merely fulfilling contracts signed long ago. Bringing the arms trade under centralised control was one of Putin&apos;s main tasks during his first round as president. He created Rosoboronexport, the state arms dealer, in November 2000, less than a year after ascending to the presidency. By 2007, he had signed a decree giving it a monopoly over the arms trade. Igor Korotchenko, director of the Centre for Analysis of World Arms Trade, a Moscow-based thinktank, said: &quot;Putin named people close to him to control the export of arms \u2013 either FSB officers or spies with whom he had worked in the past whose business qualities and loyalty he was sure of. &quot;This allowed Russia to quickly increase its share on the global market and the amount of its sales.&quot; Russia&apos;s main customer remains India, its Soviet-era ally against US-armed Pakistan. Korotchenko said India accounted for over 50% of Russian arms sales last year, including tanks and aircraft. Yet increased competition from the west means it has looked to diversify. One key market has become Venezuela, with Russia lending the government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez billions of dollars to buy Russian-made tanks, anti-aircraft rocket systems and mortars, a move reminiscent of the Soviet-era practice of arming allies and client states instead of giving them cash. Other top clients include Algeria, Vietnam, Malaysia and Syria. Korotchenko said arms sales to China were down as Beijing had begun producing its own military hardware, and former markets such as Libya and Yemen had dried up entirely. Russia remained focused on tapping markets in Africa and Asia, he said. &quot;There is potential for anyone who has territorial problems with China: Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia \u2013 they are all increasing their military budgets.&quot; Putin said Russia had signed a total of $5.7bn in export contracts this year, bringing the total value of Rosoboronexport&apos;s deals to around $43bn."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jul/04/manchester-united-glazers-shares-debt", "sentences": ["After so many months of testing the flotation waters in Singapore, then New York, we can now see the scheme that Manchester United&apos;s owners, the US-based Glazer family, have been paying an army of bankers to orchestrate."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-04T13:10:14Z", "title": "Glazers' plans to float Manchester United make the heart sink | David Conn", "tags": ["Manchester United", "The Glazer family", "Football", "Business", "Sport"], "article": "After so many months of testing the flotation waters in Singapore, then New York, we can now see the scheme that Manchester United&apos;s owners, the US-based Glazer family, have been paying an army of bankers to orchestrate. United&apos;s debt, loaded on in 2005 for nothing more constructive than the Glazers&apos; takeover itself, remains a sorry \u00a3423m burden, even after the club has paid out more than \u00a3500m interest, bankers&apos; fees and charges, to service it. Now the Glazers have hit on their preferred solution: find other people prepared to pay some of it off, while the family remains in complete control. The 231-page registration document filed with the New York Stock Exchange in preparation for a float of the famous Manchester United is the latest Glazer candidate for the most depressing document ever produced containing the word football. It features an introductory &quot;reorganisation&quot; map, so potential investors can navigate themselves through the tax havens within which Manchester United is to be harboured.The Glazer family will retain control, via their company, Red Football LLC, registered in the low-tax US State of Delaware: &quot;Upon completion of this offering, Red Football LLC will remain our [Manchester United&apos;s] principal shareholder and will continue to be owned and controlled by the six lineal descendants [five sons and one daughter] of Mr Malcolm Glazer.&quot; The Manchester United company to be floated has been registered in the Cayman Islands. Investors will be invited to buy class A shares in that company, which will carry 10 times less the voting rights of the B shares the Glazers will issue to themselves. Nor is there a plan to pay dividends to the investors. They are asked to buy shares in the expectation their value will increase as Manchester United, described in the document as &quot;one of the world&apos;s leading brands&quot;, further exploits its commercial potential. Below Red Football LLC, the Glazers&apos; vehicle in Delaware, and the public investors in the Cayman Islands-registered Manchester United Ltd, are five further holding companies, in a graphic which looks like a robot with a wonky hip. At the bottom of the chart are &quot;various operating subsidiaries&quot;, not itemised in any further detail. Somewhere within that assortment, at the bottom of the corporate structure leading via the Cayman Islands ultimately to Delaware, is Manchester United, the football club of Sirs Matt Busby, Bobby Charlton and Alex Ferguson, still with its 0161 telephone code somewhat quaintly noted on the New York Stock Exchange document. Some eyewatering detail is provided in the necessary information for investors, besides the already famous admission that United&apos;s debts risk &quot;adversely affecting&quot; the club. Indeed a legendary club, and with 20 years success in the Premier League era, United make huge money, from 76,000 supporters at Old Trafford, TV sales and all the sponsorships and commercial income the Glazers&apos; executives wring from the &quot;brand&quot;. Yet over the years, \u00a3500m has gone out to service the debts, and some of that is broken down. In the nine months to 31 March this year, finance costs were \u00a335m; in the year ended 30 June, 2011, United paid out \u00a351.3m interest. That followed the hideous \u00a3108.6m paid out, in the year to 30 June 2010, when the Glazers last refinanced. That included \u00a316.4m and \u00a319.3m lost on dollar-to-pound exchange rates, and &quot;a \u00a311.9m one-time charge related to terminated interest rate swap agreements&quot;. Supporters asking why Ferguson has not signed top European players to complement his still admirable faith in youth, can peer at that to see where some of their club&apos;s money has gone. This stock market move is intended to reduce the debt and put United in a healthier position, but supporters see the financial interests of the Glazers at the heart of it. One wider point should be considered, among many. This is the most momentous event at an English club since the England team tumbled out of the European Championship. Roy Hodgson&apos;s team of triers was accompanied by the age-old call for a revolution in how we think about football, for Premier League clubs, the Football Association and the whole game to the grass roots, to pull together for the common good. Days later, English football&apos;s greatest name is being re-routed to the New York Stock Exchange via the Cayman Islands, to pay debts a US family was allowed to load on, to buy one of our great clubs in the first place. That hocking of clubs in the global marketplace has always seemed at odds with a coherent approach to building a great sport, a waste of the great opportunities the modern era is providing."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/04/wealthy-travellers-airport-sales-luxury", "sentences": ["The jeweller Tiffany &amp; Co has just six airport stores but is looking to open a store in Singapore&apos;s Changi this year and another at Berlin&apos;s new airport next year."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-04T16:07:32Z", "title": "Wealthy travellers boost airport sales of luxury brands", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Airline industry", "Business"], "article": "A rising number of wealthy travellers from China, Russia and Brazil are driving sales of luxury brands in the world&apos;s leading airports, triggering to a rise in the number of upmarket stores.

It expects them to rise another 25% to $44.5bn (\u00a328.5bn) in the next two years. By contrast, overall sales of luxury goods are expected to rise just 14.5%, according to Boston Consulting Group. The sector took a knock in the fallout from the financial crisis in 2008 but has bounced back. Patrick O&apos;Brien, retail analyst at Verdict Research, said: &quot;There was definitely a step back in its growth then.

Retailers are cashing in on the boom. As sales at airports outstrip other outlets, they have rushed to open more stores in this unusual atmosphere, where shoppers are more relaxed and apparently happier to part with their cash. The jeweller Tiffany &amp; Co has just six airport stores but is looking to open a store in Singapore&apos;s Changi this year and another at Berlin&apos;s new airport next year. The Swiss luxury watchmaker Hublot, part of LVMH, is reported to be eyeing Frankfurt&apos;s airport.

Bigger chains with stores in all the major airports, meanwhile, are looking at the new transport hubs springing up in the emerging economies. They have plenty to choose from; the Global Business Travel Association says there are plans for 100 new airports in China in the next decade. Est\u00e9e Lauder, which has nearly 1,000 branded airport stores, including Mac and Jo Malone, said it was on the hunt for Asia&apos;s playground for millionaires.

A pillar of English football is being re-routed to New York, via a holding company in the Cayman Islands, in order to reduce the \u00a3423m debt mountain which the American Glazer family loaded on to United to buy the famous old club in the first place. Against heartfelt protests from thousands of United supporters who saw the Glazers&apos; leveraged buyout for what it was, the American speculators borrowed \u00a3525m to buy the Old Trafford club in 2005 when United were debt-free, and had gathered the money for the expansion of their stadium to a formidable 76,000 seats without borrowing a penny. When their hostile takeover was done, the Glazers saddled the club with their own borrowings, and neither the Football Association nor the Premier League has ever expressed a murmur of disapproval about it. Seven years on, the cost of servicing that debt and of two refinancings which have involved enormous bankers&apos; fees, has been more than \u00a3500m. Yet as the latest financial figures declare, United&apos;s debt, the legacy only of paying for the Glazers&apos; takeover itself, remains \u00a3423m. Sir Alex Ferguson has repeatedly described the Glazers as &quot;excellent owners&quot; to the dismay of clear-sighted supporters. The club&apos;s chief executive, David Gill, has insisted the debt and interest burden has not damaged the club&apos;s ability to invest in Ferguson&apos;s team, or its sense of itself as the grandest of clubs. Those blandishments have worn thin. Last season United were pipped to the Premier League title by Sheikh Mansour&apos;s lavishly funded Manchester City, knocked out of the Champions League in the group stage, and dispatched by Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League. Hauling the 37-year-old Paul Scholes out of retirement to anchor the midfield was not the sign of a club in its confident prime with a large war chest at its disposal. Now, after a proposed float in Singapore was pulled last year, the Glazers have revealed the preferred scheme their army of bankers have orchestrated: find other people prepared to pay off some of the debt while the family retains complete control. The $100m figure widely cited as all they intend to raise is not correct; in fact the Glazers will try to get investors to cover as much of their \u00a3423m debt as possible. The 231-page registration document filed with the New York stock exchange in preparation for the United float is the latest Glazer candidate for the most depressing document ever produced containing the word football. It features a &quot;reorganisation&quot; map, so investors can navigate themselves through the tax havens within which Manchester United is to be harboured.

Investors will be invited to buy A shares in the Cayman Islands holding company. They will carry 10 times less the voting rights of the B shares the Glazers will issue to themselves. Also there is no plan to pay dividends to the investors. They are asked to buy shares to trade, perhaps on a daily basis, in the expectation their value will increase as Manchester United, described as &quot;one of the world&apos;s leading brands,&quot; further exploits its commercial potential. This stock market move is intended to reduce the debt and put United in a healthier position, which may provide Ferguson with more money to spend on building a side to compete with the cash-rich likes of City and Chelsea. Supporters, savvy from the start, see the financial interests of the Glazers serving themselves at the heart of it. After an England team of triers \u2013 outshone by more sophisticated football cultures \u2013 tumbled out of the Euros, there followed the now regular two-year call for a revolution in how we run the game in England. The Premier League clubs, the Football Association and the whole game down to the grass roots, the argument runs, must pull together for the common good. Days later, Manchester United \u2013 English football&apos;s most famous name \u2013 is to be flogged off in New York via the Cayman Islands, boasting to investors of its &quot;brand&quot;. This hocking of legendary clubs has always seemed at odds with a coherent approach to building a great sport, a waste of the great opportunities the modern era has served up."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/05/acta-anti-counterfeiting-treaty", "sentences": ["The European Union and Canada pitched in the same year; official negotiations began in 2008, also involving Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico and Morocco."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-05T08:41:56Z", "title": "Acta didn't stand a chance in the age of the social internet | Charles Arthur", "tags": ["Internet", "Acta", "World news", "Intellectual property", "Technology", "Privacy", "UK news", "European Union", "Europe"], "article": "The dismissal of Acta, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, by the European parliament has left the treaty&apos;s opponents delighted, and its supporters \u2013 who principally work in the industries that rely on copyright and trademarks, whether virtual or physical, for their living \u2013 downhearted. Acta&apos;s creators had the poor luck \u2013 or lack of foresight \u2013 to create their baby in what feels like the Jurassic age of the social internet. They also made the bad decision to negotiate it in secret \u2013 the sort of thing that drives conspiracy theorists wild, but which is also sure to get anyone&apos;s antennae a bit twitchy. After all, if an agreement is for everyone&apos;s good, then why do its terms have to be kept secret? (The answer \u2013 that multipartite negotiations are kept secret because many sides adopt extreme negotiating positions they might not want publicised just in order to, well, negotiate \u2013 is inconvenient, but true.) What is, or was, Acta? In essence, it wants to be a subset of the World Trade Organisation, but dealing only with copyright and trademarks. Some people have the idea that it was solely about shutting down internet sites and trying to stop content piracy; that&apos;s only a sliver of it. Acta wanted to deal with physical goods too \u2013 pharmaceuticals, bags, shoes, anything that gets counterfeited and moved across borders (most countries have their own laws to deal with counterfeiting inside their borders.) Acta began its life in 2006, as part of a bipartite conversation between the US and Japan. The European Union and Canada pitched in the same year; official negotiations began in 2008, also involving Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico and Morocco. We got wind of it at the Guardian and \u2013 using a draft that appeared on WikiLeaks \u2013 pointed out that as far as could be understood (because of course the negotiations were still secret), Acta&apos;s strictures on cross-border intellectual property theft might mean that customs agents would have the right to examine your iPod, and the songs on it, as you entered any signatory country. Absurd? Overblown? The supporters of Acta said that such ideas were crazy, nobody would take things to those extremes, you&apos;d never get your iPod searched and seized just because you might be carrying a few counterfeit songs. Then again, I&apos;m sure that much the same was said when the UK signed the extradition treaty with the US. Perhaps someone could ask Richard O&apos;Dwyer and Gary McKinnon. There were good intentions behind Acta. No, really. This will be hard for some to countenance, but it is useful to be able to co-ordinate the prosecution of the production of fake pharmaceuticals that have arrived in one country, after being shipped from another, and made in yet another. Acta could give that sort of case coherence, and simplify prosecution. You don&apos;t have to have watched The Third Man to know such fakes are bad. But Acta ran into problems there too; countries such as India were concerned that the big pharmaceuticals companies, which protect their profits aggressively, would have banned the production or import of cheap &quot;generic&quot; drugs which have the same chemical formula and effect as the branded ones. However, it was over the measures applying to the internet that things really got hairy \u2013 and that has been building up in a manner that Clay Shirky, the guru of the social, is doubtless nodding his head at. Shirky, author of Here Comes Everybody, would recognise what happened: a social crowd formed online with one aim, of killing Acta. The treaty&apos;s aim regarding the internet was that sites in one country that infringed the copyrights of rightsholders (people, companies) in another could easily be shut down. At present, it&apos;s pretty difficult; some countries just don&apos;t have laws to that effect, creating the net equivalent of offshore tax havens, housing sites that profit by selling ads and let anyone download the (ripped-off) content. Acta wanted a simpler way to shut those down. Similarly, as far back as 2008, the US trade representative Sean Spicer was saying that the cross-border content inspection stuff that opponents said could be applied to your iPod was really about large-scale copyright infringement \u2013 &quot;which can frequently involve criminal elements&quot;. But of course if you stick together, the idea that you&apos;re stopping people copying stuff, and that you&apos;re looking to close down websites, you&apos;re going to make yourself unpopular with the easily mobilised online groups of \u2026 well, lots of people. Especially the ones who like getting stuff for free. Thus it was that Anonymous came out very strongly against Acta, and the lobbying against Acta turned ferocious. It was comparable to Sopa (the Stop Online Piracy Act), except that was US-based, debated in the open, and had only one aim \u2013 to shut down sites outside the US infringing US copyrights. That it only took a day of protest to kill it shows the US political system&apos;s weakness, and the internet&apos;s strength. Acta, by contrast, is much more complex, and the European parliament&apos;s sudden discovery of democratic accountability to all the people who have protested, while welcome, shows that it&apos;s still not a very effective theatre for politics. Effective politics would have watered down or changed Acta long ago, to make the internet strictures less strong. But high-level secretly negotiated treaties don&apos;t work like that. They&apos;re all or nothing, and in the past it used to be simple: they got pushed through, and it was all. But we&apos;re in a different age now. If you can&apos;t get your laws passed with some consent, and there&apos;s any way of routing around them online, then people will. (See: Pirate Bay.) Acta didn&apos;t have to die, but its creators never stood a chance against the internet tidal wave. \u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/05/aviva-chairman-reassures-city", "sentences": ["He singled out the UK, France, Canada, Poland, Singapore and Turkey as particularly strong."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-05T16:55:00Z", "title": "New Aviva chairman reassures City with radical overhaul of insurer", "tags": ["Aviva", "Insurance industry", "Business", "Management"], "article": "There was no bazooka or &quot;big bang&quot; disposals but Aviva&apos;s new chairman, John McFarlane, managed to reassure the City with a radical overhaul of the insurer. The company, which has been without a chief executive since a shareholder revolt forced Andrew Moss to resign in May, will sell 16 low-return businesses and focus on the UK and a few international markets, as well as laying off an unspecified number of middle managers. Aviva shares, which have lost a third of their value in the past year, closed up 3.2p, or 1.1%, to 284.6p. Deutsche Bank analyst Oliver Steel said the new strategy, outlined at an investor day on Thursday, was &quot;more ambitious than expected&quot; although he questioned &quot;how quickly the improved capital position can be achieved, and whether the cost-saving plans are realistic&quot;. Aviva aims to make bigger-than-expected savings of \u00a3400m, partly by stripping away management layers between the chief executive and frontline staff from nine to five levels. Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon said the new strategy &quot;appears logical and sensible&quot; and &quot;could well prove to be the turning point for long-suffering shareholders&quot;. McFarlane, who is running the insurer until a new chief executive is appointed \u2013 which is not expected to happen until early next year \u2013 has been meeting Aviva&apos;s main shareholders over the past few weeks. He said they had told him that Aviva has &quot;weaker capital levels, higher external and internal leverage, and more volatile capital&quot; than its peers. They also feel the company is too exposed to the eurozone and traditional capital-intensive life insurance products, and has had &quot;too many changes of strategy,&quot; resulting in \u00a31.3bn in restructuring charges over the past five years \u2013 &quot;and yet we are perceived to be bureaucratic and inefficient&quot;. Shareholders are also nervous that Aviva may need to find new equity or cut the dividend, neither of which is on the agenda as long as economic conditions do not worsen, McFarlane indicated. &quot;There are things we would do before we would do those things \u2013 for example, we have very good businesses we could sell.&quot; In an attempt to reduce its exposure to troubled eurozone economies, the insurer cut its Italian sovereign bond holdings by \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn) to \u20ac5bn last month. Despite investors&apos; concerns, McFarlane declared that Aviva would remain a composite insurer like its continental European rivals, mainly operating in developed markets along with some growth markets. He singled out the UK, France, Canada, Poland, Singapore and Turkey as particularly strong. They are among 15 businesses that are showing high return or growth. A further 27 units, including the Irish general insurance business, need &quot;significant improvement,&quot; while 16 divisions involving \u00a36bn in capital will be shed. They include South Korea, UK large-scale bulk purchase annuities and small Italian partnerships. Aviva announced plans to sell a further 14% of its Delta Lloyd subsidiary for \u20ac250m on Thursday, lowering its stake to 27%, but refused to say whether its US life arm, bought for \u00a32bn in 2006, was also on the block. Berenberg analyst Matthew Preston said: &quot;There is a refreshing honesty about saying that many of your businesses are underperforming and must be fixed with urgent actions to improve or exit. Too often these companies fudge their issues \u2013 there appears to be little fudging of the issues here. It is also clear that the acting CEO/chairman, John McFarlane, is not going to hang around waiting for a new CEO to get this show on the road.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jul/06/education-pisa-maths-reading-grammar-schools", "sentences": ["26.6% of their peers in Shanghai municipality achieved a level 6, 15.6% in Singapore and 11.3% in Chinese Taipei.", "In reading tests, New Zealand&apos;s pupils scored highest, with 2.9% achieving level 6, followed by Singapore with 2.6%.", "Scores in science tests - not included in the study but also recorded by PISA - showed a similar pattern, with 1.9% of England&apos;s teenagers attaining a level 6, against 4.6% for Singapore and 3.9% for Shanghai."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-06T13:27:26Z", "title": "England's brightest pupils 'let down by failing policy'.

Pupils at England&apos;s secondary schools are just half as likely to score highly on international maths tests than those in the average developed country, according to a report from the Sutton Trust. The study shows that the majority of England&apos;s pupils achieving the highest marks are from independent and grammar schools, with &quot;almost no pupils&quot; achieving top levels from non-selective state schools. Just 1.7% of England&apos;s pupils achieved the top proficiency level in maths (level 6), compared to an average of 3.1% for countries within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED). Pupils are assigned a level based on their score on Programme for International Student Asessment (PISA) tests, needing 707.93 or above to qualify for level 6. Pupils at England&apos;s grammar schools outscored their state-educated peers in both maths and reading - on average - by 546 to 490 and 553 to 492 respectively. Across the UK as a whole, 1.8% of all pupils achieved a level 6 in maths, with this figure falling to just 1% for reading skills. England&apos;s failings are thrown into sharper relief when the scores of non-OECD regions are also included. 26.6% of their peers in Shanghai municipality achieved a level 6, 15.6% in Singapore and 11.3% in Chinese Taipei. In reading tests, New Zealand&apos;s pupils scored highest, with 2.9% achieving level 6, followed by Singapore with 2.6%. Scores in science tests - not included in the study but also recorded by PISA - showed a similar pattern, with 1.9% of England&apos;s teenagers attaining a level 6, against 4.6% for Singapore and 3.9% for Shanghai. The report recommends that the most able children should be identified in tests at the end of primary school, and their progress and performance monitored in published secondary school tables. It also advocates that national tests should include tougher questions, allowing the highly able to demonstrate the extent of their abilities. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said:  These are shocking findings that raise profound concerns about how well we support our most academically able pupils from non-privileged backgrounds.  Professor Alan Smithers, co-author of the report, emphasised the need for schools to take responsibility for the progress of their brightest students, saying:  The key issue is that secondary schools should be held to account for the progress of the highly able. The Government should signal to schools the importance of educating the brightest through how it holds the schools to account. At present the accountability measures are pitched at the weakest and middling performers.  Education Secretary Michael Gove was quick to link the report&apos;s findings to his ambitions for reform of Britain&apos;s examination system. He said:  This report underlines why the Government is determined to act decisively to restore academic rigour to schools and ensure our exams match the world&apos;s best.

The McLarens of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button qualified eighth and 18th respectively for Sunday&apos;s British Grand Prix, while Paul di Resta is back in 11th place. At the moment, the tennis is two sets and a break up in its head to head with the motor sport&apos;s showpiece occasion, with only the proven skills of Hamilton and Button in the expected wet conditions offering any encouragement. The session was interrupted for more than an hour and a half when the rain that had devastated Friday&apos;s practice sessions returned with six minutes left in Q2. When the drivers were allowed back on the track, Fernando Alonso won his 21st pole, his first since Singapore in 2010. He is followed by Mark Webber, Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel, Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen. The conditions and the strong possibility of the introduction of the safety car, not to mention this season&apos;s exaggerated sense of unpredictability, make all things possible. But it is hardly the most promising of starts. This is the track, more than any other, where McLaren must make a statement. It is their home grand prix and the fast corners should be to their liking. Hamilton can draw from a well of wet wins. He triumphed in these conditions in Fuji (2007), Monaco and Hungary (2008) and Belgium (2010). Since Hamilton arrived in F1 in 2007, Button has also had a damp smile on his face in Malaysia (2009), Australia and China (2010) and Canada and Hungary (2011). Both looked bravely chipper on Saturday night, when Button said: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be dry tomorrow. It&apos;s going to be inters, wets pretty much all day. &quot;I&apos;m a long way back, but a lot can happen in those conditions. There is also a possibility of a safety car, so it&apos;s definitely not done. We&apos;re looking forward to a good result. It&apos;s tricky. There has been so much rain here for the past 300 years. It&apos;s been such a wet summer that the rain doesn&apos;t soak into the ground, it sits on top. The rivers form very quickly, even if the circuit isn&apos;t that wet. Especially coming out of Becketts on to the straight. It&apos;s very wet there.&quot; Despite the atrocious conditions Button remained positive. &quot;I want to be aggressive through the race. There are lots of opportunities. I&apos;ve got to race clever. But you need to be there at the end and if you finish the race there is a very good chance of scoring points,&quot; he added. Hamilton nodded with a grim sort of optimism. &quot;It&apos;s going to be tough for us, but we&apos;re going to be fighting as much as we always do,&quot; he said. &quot;Jenson has shown in the past that he can come right from the back and Fernando Alonso showed that in the last race.&quot; When asked about the pair&apos;s prowess in the wet, he added: &quot;It does help that we grew up in a country with lots of rain and we&apos;ve done lots of wet races. So we have more experience than many other people in wet races and can use those skills when they&apos;re out there. Anything can happen tomorrow.&quot; This was the first time for 44 races that Button had failed to make it to Q2. He has not had a good time in qualifying in recent races. His sequence since Bahrain reads: 10, 12, 10, 9 and 18. On Saturday, once again, he struggled to get heat into his front tyres. &quot;I got stuck behind a Caterham. I backed off for a couple of laps to find some space and then I pushed again. But when I pushed it was already too late because the water had started falling.&quot; There was a tone of resignation in his voice. Professional optimism does not come easily when you have scored just six points in five races.

Pirating is not exclusive to Britain, but we have always been adept at stealing and extorting under the guise of free trade. Britain&apos;s merchant class created the largest empire the world has known using the techniques learned on the high seas: much of the booty our forebears crowed about was money deftly stolen from others (who mostly stole it themselves). The East India Company gave the lead and successive governments followed. In a recent BBC4 documentary, our history was characterised as a tension between roundheads and cavaliers. Cavaliers, from Sir Walter Raleigh onwards, rarely relied on efficiency or productivity or having the largest ships, but skirmished with frigates to bamboozle and destroy the enemy. In the modern business world, that equates to waking up each day with a determination to live on your wits and deploy every tactic in your bag of tricks to sell whatever you have to hand. David Cameron was cast as the inheritor of the cavalier tradition. Bob Diamond, the deposed Barclays boss, is less colourful but represents an industry that revels in dealmaking and bamboozling its clients. Each day is another opportunity to invent a form of words, a complex scheme, that can command a premium over the simpler fare offered by rivals. That doesn&apos;t mean there is a total absence of strategy. There are the sloggers who keep the economy moving even when cavaliers prefer a day at Cowes or Henley, or time on the golf courses of the Algarve. These are the roundheads: the civil servants, farmers, unflashy yeomen and women of the shires who piece together the business and social fabric of the nation and diligently maintain it. In politics, Vince Cable would be their leader. In a recent article, Matthew Parris, the Times columnist and former Tory MP, said people who decry the activities of the banks need to throw off their naive view of Britain. He argues that a trading nation needs to live on its wits \u2013 and, more than that, fight dirty. Financial services, the arms industry and the pharmaceuticals business can lay claim to being the UK&apos;s biggest net exporters. The balance of payments is bad at the moment, but would be much worse without them. Yet they all have one foot in the gutter. Arms manufacturers are among the UK&apos;s biggest employers. Greece, until recently the world&apos;s sixth-largest importer of arms, is a long-standing client; so are many other nations who cannot really afford to tool up for wars they may never fight. The arms trade tops the list of corrupt sectors, according to Transparency International, the non-governmental organisation that monitors global bribery and corruption. Britain&apos;s arms sector is the second-largest in the world. Surely that means we are winning contracts because we grease more palms? The antics of GlaxoSmithKline fit less easily into the pirate image. It takes a lot of planning to bring a new drug to market: lots of diligent roundheads must toil in the laboratory for years before submitting their efforts to the regulators. But shareholders love a buccaneering boss. They deny it, but throw huge rewards to executives who can show the biggest returns. Pharma bosses may not look much like pirates, but they have adopted the same tactics as the banks and the arms traders when it comes to selling their wares. There are plenty of instances of drugs trials that are less than rigorous, and marketing campaigns that target vulnerable customers, including the latest scandal at Glaxo. New Labour ran scared of cleaning up naughty industries. Each one was characterised as a golden goose. But the time has come to throw off 400 years of history. A country run by roundheads may be less exciting, but fear and corruption breed economic instability, not success. If we can tame the cavaliers, more people, not fewer, will want to do business here. Unpromising away fixture Roll up, roll up: who wants to buy shares in a famous Cayman Islands-incorporated company? It doesn&apos;t pay a dividend, or have plans to do so, since it&apos;s currently got \u00a3423m of debt, which is \u00a390m more than last year&apos;s revenue. And your shares will carry only one tenth of the voting power of the insiders&apos;, so don&apos;t get fancy ideas about your importance. Not tempted? Come on, this is Manchester United, arriving on the New York Stock Exchange soon. There&apos;s a price for everything, of course, so, after a false start in Singapore, the Glazer family should achieve a public listing for their football club as long as they don&apos;t get greedy on valuation. Would-be investors, however, should understand what they would be buying into. First, this float is happening in the US because dual-voting structures have been deemed unacceptable by UK investors for about two decades. There&apos;s an excellent reason for that \u2013 equal economic risk should carry equal votes. The likes of Google and Facebook might be able to argue that the entrepreneurial talents of their founders are best retained through a form of benign dictatorship. But the Glazer/Man U combination doesn&apos;t fit that description. The voting structure here is about control, pure and simple. Second, the stock won&apos;t be actively traded, even if the Glazers issue as much as \u00a3200m of new shares (and the rumour is it will be less than half that). Illiquid stocks tend to suffer a discount to fair value, other factors being equal. And most UK private shareholders will have to pay top-tier dealing fees to dabble in a US-listed firm. Third, the only point in owning a non-dividend-paying share is the hope of capital appreciation. At Man\u00a0U, the big event for shareholders (and fans) will come on the day the Glazers decide to exit. When&apos;s that? Next year? Next decade? Some time after that? Until it arrives, outside investors are back-seat passengers who won&apos;t know the destination. To be attractive, the pricing of this flotation needs to be well below premier league. Grand gesture at Ulster Bank Two and a half weeks have passed since the NatWest computer blackout left thousands of customers without access to their money. At Ulster Bank, the problems rumble on and might continue, it admits, for another two weeks. Ulster Bank&apos;s chief executive, Jim Brown, told an Irish parliamentary committee on Friday that there would now be a full inquiry into what has been described as a &quot;glitch&quot; \u2013 though that is far too small a word for a problem that will have affected more than 500,000 Irish customers for up to a month. Compensation will be paid to any customer who has lost out. What&apos;s more, Brown said, he had decided to waive his own annual bonus \u2013 an &quot;I feel your pain&quot; gesture to identify with customers who have been unable to find out if their salaries have been paid in or make bill payments. Is he expecting applause for such a magnanimous gesture? A more apt response would be to question why any bonus might have been payable in the first place when Brown&apos;s job is to offer a banking service, and the service completely broke down."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/09/school-choice-league-tables-ofsted", "sentences": ["Last month, it was Singapore (with a bit of Kenya thrown in for good measure) in justification of a two-tier exam system.", "So Singapore apparently gets 80% of its pupils through O-levels.", "Children are put into exam tracks at the end of primary school (the antithesis of parent choice) and even the Singaporeans are worried about the rigidity of their system, the self-esteem of the children in the lower streams and the excessive focus on exams over wider skills."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-09T18:00:01Z", "title": "The dead hand of central government is weighing down on children and schools", "tags": ["Secondary schools", "Primary schools", "Curriculums", "School tables", "Ofsted", "Schools", "Education", "Education policy", "Michael Gove"], "article": "Last month marked another milestone for me. Our last child did her last school exam. It is the end of an era for us and on balance I am glad our children grew up in the last 20 years rather than the next. The first one started school in 1992. &quot;Choice&quot; was in its infancy. We didn&apos;t look at any schools beyond those that were geographically closest to where we lived and have never regretted that. Our children have always walked to school; one has never worn a uniform. They have achieved well, but their education has extended way beyond test and exam results because of the values of their schools, the relationships they made and the children they have been educated alongside. Despite the public rhetoric of those two decades, choice for most parents has narrowed. One of the greatest myths perpetuated by &quot;reformers&quot; about the English school system is that it has been too weighed down by the dead hand of uniformity. In fact, the reverse is true. English schools have always been diverse (and unequal), embracing an abundance of private, selective, non-selective, faith, non-denominational, single-sex and co-educational schools with different atmospheres and outlooks. A few more school types may have been invented, but now it is the dead hand of central government, league tables, Ofsted and the four or five data sets that determine institutional success that weigh heavily on all children. Want your children to enjoy an early education dominated by creativity and play? Forget it. A secondary school without a uniform? No chance. Education for education&apos;s sake? Dream on. Soon it won&apos;t really matter which school you &quot;choose&quot;. The same factory line will follow, as the accountability structure, designed honourably to help schools improve, increasingly constrains their ability to be creative or different. But perhaps the greatest paradox of choice is that parents seem more anxious than ever \u2013 caught between their desire to do their best for their children and the increasingly negative messages churned out by a secretary of state who appears to be taking a virtual world tour from his desk in Whitehall. Once you only had to worry about what went on in the local school. Now you need to be an expert in at least four different foreign jurisdictions to understand what you might be choosing. One minute it was Sweden \u2013 home of the flat-pack school and children designing their own curricula; then it was downtown Harlem for the dawn-to-dusk boot camp approach. Last month, it was Singapore (with a bit of Kenya thrown in for good measure) in justification of a two-tier exam system. And no matter which country we have landed in for the latest speech or press release, information is used in a selective and misleading way, making it even harder for parents to reach an informed judgment. So Singapore apparently gets 80% of its pupils through O-levels. But does it? Actually only two thirds of a very small cohort take O-level so, in fact, a slightly lower proportion pass five O-levels than achieve five good GCSEs here. Children are put into exam tracks at the end of primary school (the antithesis of parent choice) and even the Singaporeans are worried about the rigidity of their system, the self-esteem of the children in the lower streams and the excessive focus on exams over wider skills. The American academic Dr Yong Zhao, a sceptic about the import of tiger economy education policies, ran a comparison between the Pisa maths tables and another international study, which ranked countries according to entrepreneurial spirit, with surprising and counterintuitive results. The countries with the stellar Pisa scores had the fewest people who were confident in their entrepreneurial skills. The poorer Pisa performers, like America, scored best. America is the latest country to be riven by dissent over reforms to its traditionally more liberal, laid-back approach to schooling, but the dissenters are right to worry about the trade-off between high-stakes testing and creativity, individuality and wider skills for life. I feel passionate about the need for all my local schools to be as good and rigorous as possible, but I also know my own children&apos;s wider education was down to something beyond that which can be easily measured. Parents, and pupils, should have the right to choose those other intangible, but equally important, qualities as well."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/09/education-in-brief-exams-gove", "sentences": ["Michael Gove&apos;s leaked plans to reintroduce O-levels to schools, seemingly inspired by the success of an &quot;international&quot; version of the exam operated by one of England&apos;s big three exam boards and taken by teenagers in Singapore, rightly made headlines last month."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-09T18:45:01Z", "title": "Education in brief: are GCSEs the new O-levels?", "tags": ["O-levels", "GCSEs", "Exams", "Academies", "Schools", "Education"], "article": "GCSEs: the new O-levels? Michael Gove&apos;s leaked plans to reintroduce O-levels to schools, seemingly inspired by the success of an &quot;international&quot; version of the exam operated by one of England&apos;s big three exam boards and taken by teenagers in Singapore, rightly made headlines last month. But less noticed has been a move by another of the boards, Edexcel, quietly to scrap its own version of the exam three years ago. Edexcel, owned by Pearson, replaced its International O-levels with its existing International GCSE brand. Intriguingly, a 2009 document for teachers explaining the move described the IGCSE as &quot;the most up-to-date qualification from the UK&quot; and &quot;the same [as O-level] but with modern references&quot;. How very off-message. Speed Read wonders what Mr Gove thinks. A Pearson spokeswoman says: &quot;The demand internationally is for qualifications which reflect the UK curriculum. With the introduction of the GCSE, the demand shifted to IGCSE, rather than international versions of an old qualification.&quot; Cheats&apos; charter Confirmation came last week, in Peter Wilby&apos;s interview in these pages with Ofqual&apos;s chief executive, Glenys Stacey, that exam board seminars in which senior examiners give teachers advice on how to boost their pupils&apos; grades are being banned. These advice sessions were, of course, the backdrop to a series of undercover scoops in the Daily Telegraph last December. But is this the end of the matter? In 2009, BBC Radio Five Live reported on controversial advice being given to teachers at a seminar run not by a board, but privately, by a former languages examiner who guided his attendees on how to &quot;script&quot; pupils&apos; answers in the oral section of French GCSE. Would such seminars be banned? Ofqual&apos;s powers are limited, it seems; it says it only has powers to regulate the work of &quot;awarding organisations&quot;, or the boards themselves. So while &quot;face-to-face seminars that relate directly to specific, named qualifications&quot; and are run by the boards themselves will cease from next year, there is no such stipulation on those hosted by private organisations. A loophole, perhaps? A positive outlook A fascinating insight into the darker arts of education public relations is provided on the website of the firm Communitas. The company, based in Battersea, south London, sets out how it has secured positive news coverage for its clients, many of them academies. West London academy, which opened in 2003, had &quot;significant reputation and messaging challenges to overcome in the local community&quot;, Communitas tells readers, not least after Ofsted expressed serious concerns about management and pupil behaviour there two years later. The company therefore launched a strategy to &quot;limit the damage from the worst critical comments in the report&quot;, and proceeded to &quot;work the media&quot;. At Eastbourne academy in Darlington, where it created a new &quot;brand identity&quot; for the school, Communitas says &quot;early challenges were around staff management issues that needed delicate and skilled management to avoid unwelcome press coverage&quot;, while the section on Shirebrook academy in Derbyshire says Communitas&apos;s emphasis was to make the consultation process as &quot;easy as possible&quot;, as &quot;creating this ease is particularly vital for communications with any vocal minority who may be unsure about the \u2026 founding of an academy&quot;.

Traditional Chinese medicine, which has been tried and tested on its home turf over three millennia, is working hard to gain mainstream acceptance in the west, where there are stricter regulations and requirements for therapeutic trials. Based on a range of remedies inherited from Taoist scholars, and also on acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine is derived from Confucianism. But it would be a mistake to suppose that what is now officially known as TCM has traversed so many centuries unchanged. &quot;TCM is a political construct dating from the 1950s, following on from the 1949 revolution,&quot; says Professor Paul Unschuld of Berlin Medical University, who chairs the International Society for the History of East Asian Science, Technology and Medicine. &quot;It includes selected aspects of historical Chinese medicine, but it is also influenced by the rationale and concepts of modern science.&quot; Despite the slow acceptance, there have been advances. In Europe, where little was known about Chinese practices, TCM gained traction in the 1970s as part of the movement towards alternative therapies. A World Health Organisation congress emphasised the legacy of such medicine in a 2008 declaration, though stressed the need to hasten its modernisation and acceptance. China, too, has realised the need to integrate and advance, and has been working since 2007 to abandon some outdated methods. &quot;Many Chinese medicinal herbs are used in south-east Asia, in Singapore and Indonesia, but also Russia and Australia,&quot; says Professor Guo De-an, chief scientist at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. &quot;But Europe and the United States account for the major part of the global pharmaceutical market.&quot; To gain a foothold in the market for prescription drugs in the US and Europe, manufacturers must comply with the standards set by the agencies tasked with regulating healthcare products. They must satisfy requirements for both pharmacological effectiveness and overall quality. &quot;There is still no appropriate methodology for assessing the effects of TCM,&quot; says Guo. &quot;It is not sufficient to measure blood pressure \u2026 the question is how to carry out group studies of individualised treatment.&quot; Robert Verpoorte, the head of the Natural Products laboratory at Leiden University in the Netherlands, advocates a new approach to studying traditional Chinese medicine. &quot;We should base our approach on the effects produced by a medicinal plant on living organisms resulting from the activity of its many components,&quot; he says. &quot;This approach is used in systems biology and metabolomics, which studies all the metabolites present in a cell or organism.&quot; Guo sees two ways ahead for medicinal plants used in TCM: &quot;Either they can be authorised, through a simplified procedure, as traditional plant-based treatments; or they may obtain the status of herbal medicinal products for human use as defined by the European Medicines Agency,&quot; he says. The Chinese government has encouraged efforts to obtain US and EU authorisation of TCM-derived drugs for treating heart disease and menopause-related disorders. &quot;For the time being there is no alternative to western assessment criteria and we must work hard to provide the data required by the US and EU agencies,&quot; he says. As these therapies seek to gain greater recognition, the question of side effects also looms. Chinese advocates have tended to assert that TCM remedies are safe. But at a recent conference on such treatments in Bologna, one speaker diverged from this position. Defending an approach based on strict clinical trials, Bian Zhao-xiang, the head of the clinical division of the School of Chinese Medicine at Hong Kong Baptist University, said: &quot;We must improve reporting of side effects.&quot; Co-operation between China and the west is developing. &quot;Several major western drug firms have invested in industrial co-operation projects,&quot; says Guo.

Once considered his nation&apos;s political tour de force, Anwar Ibrahim has spent the greater part of the past two decades in jail, wrapped up in court proceedings and enduring what he calls a long-standing smear campaign \u2013 from being labelled a chauvinist and Zionist to facing accusations that he is homosexual, guilty of sodomy and anti-Muslim. Now Anwar is fighting his last fight: to be Malaysia&apos;s next prime minister, a battle for which he has been preparing for a very long time.\u00a0 At speeches and rallies Anwar is vibrant, compelling, persuasive. In person he is slight, ageing and soft-spoken, sipping black tea with honey as he outlines why his opposition alliance expects to usurp the prime minister, Najib Razak, and the incumbent Barisan Nasional (National Front), which has governed Malaysia for nearly 60 years. &quot;The mood is there, the mood for change,&quot; Anwar says from his office at the multi-storeyed headquarters of his People&apos;s Justice party in central Kuala Lumpur. &quot;I&apos;m very optimistic that we will wrest control and make major inroads.&quot; Anwar has long been a contender to rule Malaysia but his political career has suffered vertiginous highs and lows. The spectacular ascent that saw him grace the cover of Newsweek as Asian of the Year and become the heir apparent of then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad was met with an equally spectacular crash in 1998, when the two fell out and Anwar was imprisoned for six years on corruption and sodomy charges, claims he repeatedly dismissed as politically motivated. Times have not been easy since his release in 2004. Despite leading an opposition coalition to a famous result in the 2008 general election, when it stole one-third of the parliamentary seats and five states from the National Front, Anwar soon found himself facing new sodomy charges, accusations that were only dismissed this January due to lack of evidence.\u00a0 But his movement is full of hope. Elections are expected to be called any time in the next nine months, and even those who do not openly back Anwar often support what he stands for: relief from an autocratic and out-of-touch government they say has ruled Malaysia for too long. In April many tens of thousands of Malaysians took to the nation&apos;s streets to demand electoral reform at rallies organised by Bersih, an opposition-backed coalition of civil-society groups whose name means &quot;clean&quot; in Malay.\u00a0According to political columnist Art Harun, Bersih has thrown &quot;a massive spanner in the [government] works&quot; as increasingly informed activists point to numerous corruption scandals and police brutality as proof that government reform is necessary. But when it comes to voting they will have to contend with a determined ruling party that has been accused of playing dirty to win.\u00a0&quot;The electoral roll is our Achilles&apos; heel and their way of winning,&quot; sighs opposition MP and Anwar&apos;s 31-year-old daughter Nurul Izzah Anwar, herself a participant in April&apos;s rally. &quot;Before it was just small instances \u2026 Now we&apos;ve unearthed a whole pool of data.&quot; She claims that in her constituency alone she has 10,000 voters who suddenly &apos;appeared&apos; on electoral lists. Anwar&apos;s greatest task will be proving that he can actually instigate the change Malaysians have long been calling for, says Malaysia expert Bridget Welsh of Singapore Management University. &quot;Four months after Bersih there are two important issues: the management of the economy and who can manage the economy best, and who can offer more options in democratic governance,&quot; she says. &quot;The third aspect is whether this election will be free and fair ... so what we have is a situation where the integrity of the [electoral] process is as important as the process itself.&quot;\u00a0 Matters are complicated by new charges that Anwar faces of opposing a court order at the Bersih rally. If convicted he would not be able to stand for office in the next election. He denies the allegations. If elected Anwar knows that his will be a tricky balancing act in a nation that sells itself as &quot;Moderate Malaysia&quot;, where even his own opposition alliance spans his People&apos;s Justice party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic party and the ethnic Chinese Democratic Action party.\u00a0&quot;We have discussed economic policies, social policies and religious positions, and we have come to agreements,&quot; he says of his own alliance. &quot;But there&apos;s a big, huge internal battle&quot; \u2013 he strikes every word with his finger on his desk \u2013 &quot;among the [wider] Malaysian community between the fanatics and the extremists to petition broader, more liberal tolerance. We call ourselves liberals \u2026 [but] we must put in check, not through brute force, but through active and vibrant intellectual discourse, these [extremist] aberrations.&quot; Voters may be hoping for change at the next general election but they know they can&apos;t expect it. &quot;What we want to see is a multi-party democracy where, every two or three years, the [leading] party will change,&quot; explains Bersih leader Ambiga Sreenavasan. &quot;We&apos;re not averse to Barisan coming back but if parties think they&apos;re going to lose power, they behave a lot better. [This] is about power coming back to the people. It&apos;s about us being in charge.&quot; If Anwar is unsuccessful in what is very likely his last bid at the prime ministership, many of those on the ground expect his daughter to one day carry the torch. Young, articulate and popular, Nurul Izzah personifies all of her father&apos;s promise, without, perhaps, the residual baggage. &quot;I think she&apos;ll be the first woman prime minister of this country,&quot; says Ambiga. &quot;I&apos;ve said it so many times, I hope it comes true.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/jul/11/social-enterprise-network-daily", "sentences": ["SEED Conference 2012, &quot;A youth perspective - social entrepreneurship in Singapore&quot; SG Entrepreneurs: The Social Entrepreneurship Experience and Development Programme event, which will take place on 31 July in Singapore, will see 60 youths who have participated in the internships at social enterprises share their experiences."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-11T10:23:35Z", "title": "Social enterprise network daily: Wednesday 11 July", "tags": ["Social enterprises"], "article": "Nesta launches \u00a3200,000 Giving Challenge grants Third Sector: Nesta and the Cabinet Office are seeking ideas to tackle isolation in old age and reduce waste through volunteering and giving, with winning projects being awarded \u00a350,000.

Let me start with a look at the ComRes poll which provides the whole underpinning logic to Ed&apos;s article. It was conducted on 21 and 20 June, before the Torch Relay had completed its journey through the main centres of population of these regions when something like 20% of the population turned out and before it had reached Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. The survey was conducted online amongst adults only using a sample of 245 in the north west (pop 6.9 mil), 179 in Yorkshire and Humberside (pop 5.1 mil) and 100 in the north east (pop 2.5 mil). I leave it to readers to decide how statistically valid this is and how representative it may be, bearing in mind that no youngsters and children were involved (one of the main target audiences for all the work on 2012 legacy and participation). Ed&apos;s article focuses on four main outcomes from the poll and quotes Sam Tomlin, research officer at the Sports Think Tank, describing the north as &apos;detached from the economic, participatory and social legacies of the Games&apos; and adding that &apos;the further you get away from London the less excited you are about the Games&apos;. Having looked at the data, I don&apos;t know how Tomlin comes to these conclusions. However you look at it, I believe the only conclusion you can come to is that there is very little difference between us here and the rest of the country in the attitudes thrown up by the poll. You will find that on all the measures the north compares favourably with all the other regions including those closest to London.  One of the big problems we have faced in working to extend the reach of the Games in the regions and the home nations is the fact that few have ever taken the time to find out about the work of the Nations and Regions Group of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is chaired by Sir Charles Allen, who previously chaired the Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games organising committee. Established straight after the Singapore decision, its role has been to maximise benefits and engagement throughout the country. Each region and home nation has been working tremendously hard for close on seven years to bring that about. I can only speak in detail on behalf of the north west but the picture I paint here is repeated in more or less the same way everywhere else. Here is a quick synopsis of just a few of the achievements which rarely get reported. All these facts and figures are anecdotal but probably give a far more accurate indication than an opinion poll of how the Games are reaching all parts of the country.    - In education 85% of all schools and colleges in the North West are taking part in the London 2012 Get Set programme -- learning schemes built around the Olympic and Paralympic values. That represents over 3,000 schools and some 1.4 million children.  - The Inspire Mark programme recognises sporting, educational, social, arts and other community projects officially inspired by London 2012. We have 336 of these in the north west, the highest number outside London. Approximately 2 million people are involved in these with over 600,000 taking part specifically in sports projects.  - North West businesses have benefited hugely, with over 600 contracts worth over \u00a3211m that we are aware of. These range from a company in Penrith providing all the eggs for the McDonalds in the Olympic village to another from Bolton providing all the steelwork for the main stadium, velodrome and aquatic centre. The figures for economic benefits take no account either of the Olympic football competition (initial estimates \u00a330m) or from the enormously successful Torch Relay. Lloyds TSB have recently published their estimate of economic benefits from the Games and have suggested that the north west will be one of the main beneficiaries to the tune of some \u00a31.2billion.  - The north west is also host to some 22 countries with many hundreds of athletes based in the region preparing for their time at the Games as part of pre-Games training camps. They include the Australian swim squad, the US men&apos;s and women&apos;s basketball teams, the US boxing team, the entire Brazilian Paralympic squad, the Thailand Olympic team, 15 countries from the Oceania region in the Pacific and the Romanian and Namibian Paralympic teams. In addition to these, GB squads are based here including British cycling, taekwondo, water polo and Paralympic swimming. All these athletes are involved all manner of community engagement including running coaching sessions for local youngsters.  - 1.5 million plus people have attended events as part of the Cultural Olympiad in the north west in the first three years of the programme. Our main cultural legacy programmes include Lakes Alive, the street arts programme in Cumbria; Abandon Normal Devices, a digital media festival running in Manchester and Liverpool, and Blaze, a youth-led culture and sport project running across Lancashire. Each has delivered huge social and economic impacts to date and the 10,000 people who braved the rain in Bowness on 21 June saw an incredible performance by Los Commandos Percus as one of the launch events of the London 2012 Festival.  - Last but not least, Ed&apos;s article took no account of the fact that the north west and north east both have Olympic venues and will be hosts to the Olympic football competition. In the case of Old Trafford, there will be nine games over seven days including the first GB game against Senegal, matches involving Spain and Brazil, the US women&apos;s team and men&apos;s quarter finals and men&apos;s and women&apos;s semi finals. We are expecting hundreds of thousands to attend - the biggest sports event in the region since the Commonwealth Games. A total of 580 local Ambassadors are volunteering to support the event and welcome visitors. Let&apos;s do an opinion poll when that&apos;s all over!   There is honestly much, much more and if you want to find out what is going on, visit our website. There is more than enough evidence to show that engagement is already massive three weeks before the Games actually take place, and that Lord Coe&apos;s promise that he made in Singapore is well on the way to being fulfilled.

By supporting grassroots movements and mobilising other organisations, Google is using its global influence to create inclusive workplaces, and by extension societies, for LGBT people around the world. Awesome, yes? Not so awesome if you&apos;re a member of the American Families Association, however. Buster Wilson, the general manager of the AFA&apos;s radio network, has announced that the group may boycott Google products. A tricky task, he admits. Much trickier than the AFA&apos;s threatened boycott of Oreo for showing an image of rainbow-filled treats for Pride, of Ford for advertising in gay magazines, or of the musical We Will Rock You for being glam rock fabulous (OK, so I made the last one up). But actually this news is also awesome. Because the fewer intolerant rightwing zealots able to effectively utilise global communications the better, I say. Google here has scored a double whammy \u2013 promoting gay rights globally and freeing cyberspace from crazies who believe that gay people will be posthumously tortured by monsters with spiky tails. In fact, could someone please inform the AFA that Microsoft publicly supports gay marriage in America? Oooh, or that the chief executive of Apple is homosexual. No, wait \u2013 just tell them that Alan Turing, the father of modern computer science, was a gay man, and advise them that it&apos;s probably best for AFA members to avoid modern technology completely unless they want to catch gay cooties. But let&apos;s imagine that the AFA ignores the fact that boycotting Google without also boycotting Nike, Ernst &amp; Young, Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s, Microsoft and countless other companies that publicly support gay rights, is a bit pointless. Let&apos;s imagine that they continue in their witchhunt of Gayglers (Google&apos;s term for its gay employees and their supporters). How will the AFA continue to spread homophobia and intolerance on the web? What did we do before Google? Oh yes \u2013 I remember. We asked Jeeves. I have spent my morning experimenting with the antiquarian butler&apos;s effectiveness in the promulgation of anti-gay propaganda. The results are promising. I asked Jeeves &quot;How best to deny rights to gay people?&quot; In answer, the butler offered a link advising me on ways to deny a father&apos;s visitation rights. I asked Jeeves &quot;Gay Rights: What would Jesus do?&quot; In answer, I was given information about the time in Bal Gaye right now. Finally, I asked my butler pal another, slightly more leading question: &quot;Do gay parents mess up their kids?&quot; Jeeves, who had obviously been at Sir&apos;s brandy, sent a link informing me that a &quot;hodgepodge&quot; is not only a disorderly mass of things, but also a type of mutton soup. At this stage, your average AFA member might be tempted to return quietly to Google, tail between legs. This is a boycott that, as Wilson says, will test the meat of their convictions. But what kind of meaty substance is informing this protest? Google isn&apos;t lobbying for gay marriage in America. In fact, a spokesman at the first Legalise Love conference in London said: &quot;This really doesn&apos;t affect the US or most of the countries where we have offices.&quot; Can it be so important to the AFA that faraway gays in Singapore and Poland continue to be oppressed? Singapore isn&apos;t even a predominantly Christian country \u2013 they&apos;re all going to the fiery monster place when they die anyway. Or limbo. Or something. To afford the AFA credit which it probably doesn&apos;t deserve, we could perhaps root the boycott in discomfort with a global conglomerate, the representatives of which nobody has elected, openly pushing for legislative and social change. About this, I&apos;m conflicted. On the one hand, it&apos;s refreshing to see a major company distance itself from the profit motive and take a stand on ethical issues. This was certainly my feeling when Google pulled out of China in 2010 in response to the country&apos;s censorship practices and alleged hacking of email accounts of political dissidents. While some have tried to paint Legalise Love as an economically motivated move (insofar as the company wants to employ the best and brightest and some of these are, of course, LGBT), it&apos;s very hard to see Google&apos;s actions in China in a similar light. Taking the moves in tandem, it seems that Google is not just a financially motivated institution, but also a morally and politically motivated one. Here&apos;s the dilemma: I&apos;m shouting &quot;Google rocks!&quot; from the rooftops because the company is using its power to initiate change that I believe to be humanistic, tolerant and ethical. But what if it wasn&apos;t? What if an equally powerful company tried to lobby governments to curtail gay rights for the benefit of its anti-homosexual employees, or to limit maternity rights based on libertarian principles, or to suppress affirmative action programmes based on the totally excellent &quot;it&apos;s discrimination against rich whities&quot; argument? If this were the case, I&apos;d have to seriously consider ways in which to change my consumer behaviour.

Today we have discussions on the economics of resource scarcity, meeting future energy demands, disruptive innovations and how resource efficiency translates into shareholder value. Those speaking include Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestle, Jeremy Grantham, founder of GMO and Andy Wales, head of sustainable development at SAB Miller. Tomorrow will have a focus on the link between politics and economics and will include Bill Clinton, David Milliband and Tony Giddens from the London School of Economics. I hope you enjoy having a ring side seat at this invitation-only event and that by the end of it, we have all learnt something useful. Sir David King, former government chief scientist and director of the Smith School, wants this event to be about finding solutions rather than just another round of talking. Let&apos;s see if they succeed. Apologies in advance for any typos but I don&apos;t have a back-up in London for part of the day and my typing is not as good as I would like.  9.56am:  Coming up: Amartya Sen on resource scarcity Looking forward to the session coming soon with Jonathan Dimbleby interviewing Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen on the economics of resource scarcity. Key questions include the tools and mechanisms to redress market failures and how will increasing resource constraints affect pricing, distribution and volatility. he is speaking in the next few minutes.  10.09am:  Amartya Sen on resource scarcity What is necessary for us is to point out the causal connections for the problems we have, such as womens&apos; empowerment, which would help to reduce population growth and increase economic livelihoods. What is the role of the investors who tend to think short-term and what is his message to them: There have been terrible mistakes made but we need to look at changing the financial incentives. If you look at solar, it does not impact on global warming or suffer the catastrophic impacts of nuclear so we need more tax incentives for renewables and taking them away from the fossil-fuel industry. The whole idea of asking people to be responsible but not give incentives leads to schizophrenia. Technological reseearch will take place only when investors think there is money to be made and this is another reason for tax incentives.  10.13am:  Amartya Sen Sen says fracking has an enormous environmental impacts in the areas it takes place.  He says nuclear offers the chance of huge disaster from human error, natural disasters and the threat of terrorism, but this is not taken into account when looking at the benefits of solar. The world is dotted with nuclear power stations, so even small probabilities of risk add up to a very large risk.  10.20am:  Amartya Sen on food How are we going to feed a growing population and what is the role of the private sector? The economic reasoning is pretty clear which is the problem is that people are getting richer and this is driving much of the increase in demand for food, and this will increase. Sen says that governments need to intervene and regulate the markets and provide appropriate incentives. Sen says he sees the glass as both half empty and half full and we can make the glass much more full if we think intelligently.  11.00am:  David Nabarro, UN Secretary General&apos;s special representative on food security and nutrition Nabarro says Rio +20 showed that governments cannot find answers to the world&apos;s problems on their own and that civil society and business must become more involved. He warns there are increasing risks of wars from inequities and these must be dealt with, otherwise the future will be very difficult. We need to look at our institutions and political processes to amend them.  11.06am:  David Nabarro on food He says there are several areas of promising action. The coming together of business, financial institutions and governments to look at new ways of investing in agriculture. He says Grow Africa has created new multi-stakeholder working and has real potential for progress. There are 30-40 other multiple-stakeholder groups that are going to create new ways of development. Second area is there are major poltiical groups like the G8 and regional groups putting equity of access at the centre of the political discourse. There are also new governance structures being created for mutli-stakeholder dialogues. Is it enough? No it is not, but the future of the work on food and nutrition needs correct policies and social contracts for participation, combined with the application of science. The old-style idea that we can pull a group of political leaders together to solve problems is long gone.  11.10am:  Paul Conway, vice chairman of Cargill on food Conway says too many governments lack the air in their tyres to complete the Doha round of trade talks and only a few countries are showing leadership. He says there will need to be more trade to solve food problems as large populations are often not where food production is. He also says there needs to more productivity and governments must provide the right environment for this. But government cannot fix the problems, and must instead provide the ground on which business and NGOs can collaborate. There is also the risk of protectionism as witnessed recently by governments stopping exports of food as soon as problems arise.  11.16am:  President Paul Kagame of Rwanda Kagame says on the issue of food: &quot;We understand the problems and what needs to be done. There ae resources out there that can be brought to bear. &quot;The main problem lies in people working together and doing what needs to be done. When people know what needs to be done, they often don&apos;t do it. &quot;If we continue to collaborate, I don&apos;t see why we cannot make good progress.&quot;  11.43am:  The role of the meat industry  Professor Charles Godfray, director of the Oxford Marlin programme on the future of food at the University of Oxford, says the statistics on meat consumption are pretty frightening and there are no obvious answers. One route is education so that people know the health and environmental advantages, but this will never reduce demand as required. The other route is political but at the moment there is no possibility of politicians taking action as electorates willl not accept meat reduction. He therefore says we need to have a sophisticated debate to legitimise governments to take action. Godfray also warns that few people recognise the scale of political and social problems we face if nothing is done to produce more food and distribute it equitably. Not only will we will see a massive increase of demand but also many shocks to the supply. He says business has a vital role to play in helping create a food system that provides food security and unleashes the innovation of the proivate sector while similtaneously protecting the poortest. Not only is this the right thing to do and if we do not, it willl lead to enormous political and social dislocation at a scale that few can now envisage. Paul Conway, the vice chairman of Cargill, said that meat consumption in the western world is not growing but you cannot tell people in the developing world they cannot eat meat. He said methane was a serious problem and they are looking to formulate livestock food that creates a more efficient conversion, leading to lower emissions.  11.56am:  New collaboratons What&apos;s already coming out of the conference is the recognition that old-style multilateral negotiations are a thing of the past in terms of solving the world&apos;s sustainability challenges. This very much reflects the feelings at Rio+20 that the future lies in new forms of partnerships and collaborations between business, civil society and individual governments and regional alliances. But David Nabarro, the UN general secetary&apos;s special representative on food security and nutrition, warned that this patchwork of the coaltions of the willing can cause confusion if there is not a consensus on the direction of travel and the desired goals. On the issue of food, Nabarro does believe this happened in Rio, with five key objectives. The eliminatiion of hunger, the creation of sustainable agriculture, more produtive smalholder, big reductions in food waste and wasteful consumpiton, and also improvements in nutrition. He says: Ban Ki-moon&apos;s zero hunger challenge; that is the post Rio compass on all our work on food and there is a reasonable chance that if enough stakeholders align behind this, we can all move in the same direction.&quot;  12.20pm:  Meeting future energy demand Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, director of energy research, University of Oxford, paints a bleak picture on energy, which he says is absolutely key as without that we cannot tackle all the other problems in the world. He says governments do not follow up on pledges on energy reductions and meanwhile, demand is going to continue shooting up, particularly in the developing world. Changing human behaviour is difficult and if people save energy in one place, they think they can use more elsewhere. Smith also says you can redesign cities but this is very slow because much infrastructure is already in place. On top of this, the only serious renewable at the moment is hydro so there needs to be a vast increase in other renewables but these are expensive. What he shows is just how difficult it is to change.  12.38pm:  BG chairman attacks oil and gas indusry over fracking Andrew Gould, chairman of BG Group, has warned the oil and gas industry that they need to radically change the way they approach fracking if the industry to have any long-term future. He admitted that companies in the past have used a &quot;blitzed technique&quot; which is essentially that &quot;you frack as much as you can and hope you open up a route.&quot; He said the reason for this is that the oil and gas industry has been using classic petroleum measurements that do not apply to shale. He says the industry has to &quot;eventually identify the way that works so that the size and number of frackings will decrease and if it does not happen, the industry will never take off.&quot; Gould said that much more work also needs to be done to ensure that drilling fluids and oil and gas do not migrate and pollute natural water aquifers. On top of all this, Gould said much more must be done to ensure the systematic capture of methane and that companies need to engage with local communities. If all these changes were carried out, Gould said it would not do much to increase the cost of fracking. He said that if you look at satellite shots of the pockmarked landscape of previous fracking in the United States, it is &quot;horrifying.&quot; He said the industry tends to get in front of itself and now has to prove it can be environmentally conscious.  12.51pm: Carbon taxes Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, director of energy research, University of Oxford, says the absence of a carbon taxation should be seen as destroying the planet. He calls for subsidies for renewables and that subsidies for fossil fuels should be cut. However, he warns that vested interests always try to keep subsidies in place and that there should always be a route to phase them out. What investors need is certainty about how the future looks, so they can price this into their plans.  1.35pm:  Nestle chairman warns that water presents us with a global crisis  Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestle, says there is little recognition in society of just how important water is for our social and economic livelihood and how vulnerable we are from overuse. Interestingly he also pointed out that new technologies across sectors is leading to increasing water usage. Brabeck-Letmathe said that not only has water been primarily responsible for people living longer but also for extraordinary GDP growth. In the past, with a population of 2.5bn, we did not even have to think about water but now we are using it unsustainably. He says: &quot;In 2005 we were for the first time using water unsustainably and for the first time today we are using non sustainable water. We are now taking it away from the environment,&quot; which is leading to natural disasters. Brabeck-Letmathe said that in the future we will not have the water to produce the energy we need, nor to produce the food for an increasing population. He says research of 154 water basins does show there are solutions to balance sustainable water use with economic growth and 240 different levers of change have been identified. &quot;There are sufficient possibilities to bring water usage to balance,&quot; he says, &quot;but it needs political decisions and a better understanding of the water supply. &quot;It is clear that if we are not tackling this issue, which is not the next 100 years. This problem is of today. We are already using too much water.&quot;  2.16pm:  Nestle chairman in devastating critique of biofuels The chairman of Nestle has launched a devastating critique of biofuels and called for a ban on plantations that replace food production.  &quot;We are taking away water from where we need it most, to assure food supply,&quot; says Peter Brabeck-Letmathe &quot;I am not against biofuels but against replacing food for fuel, and if we came to this simple decision to stop doing this, we would be stabilising raw materials prices for food.&quot; Brabeck-Letmathe said the single most important political decision made in the last five years, was to go ahead with subsidising biofuels and this had come about because of a silo mentaility. He said the biofuels had been given a beautiful sounding name that gave it the aura of being &quot;about life&quot; but behind this facade was a direct attempt by politicians to pass on subsidies to farmers. He says: &quot;People did not understand and some still don&apos;t that the food market and the energy market is the same market.&quot; and that the result of replacing 20% of land used for food would lead to spiralling costs.  He also says that if water had been given a fair value, then a decision would never have been taken to go ahead with biofuels, as each litre needed 9100 litres of water. The Nestle chairman&apos;s criticism was echoed by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, minister of environment and water resources in Singapore, who said that biofuel production had been encouraged through &quot;stupid subsidies&quot; and he had witnessed peat lands and forests being destroyed to create biofuels, creating more carbon emissions then would have been saved through switching from fossil fuels.  3.27pm:  If you read Jeremy Grantham&apos;s predictions of the future, pour yourself a stiff drink first If you are depressed about the sustainability challenges of our age, you will be reaching for the bottle if you listen to Jeremy Grantham, the head of successful fund manager GMO. Although Grantham says he is a cheerful pessimist, seeing the glass as three-quarters empty, but there was precious little liquid to see after hearing his view of the world. He says that it is possible to adapt to our current circumstances, but the likelihood of that happening is limited due to a lack of courageous politicians, vested interests, inertia and dedication to short-termism. While it may be possible to stop the global population at 10 billion, the carrying capacity of the planet is likely to be less than five billion. Added to this is the extraordinary demands for raw materials from China, which now uses 59% of the world&apos;s cement, 48% of all coal, 45% of all steel and 47% of all pigs. Beyond that, even if we get far better at recycling, &quot;metal is slipping through our fingers,&quot; and water scarcity will lead to wars. Water problems are self-inflicted because the problem is caused by waste and a lack of valuing it in terms of pricing. Soil erosion is accelerating and we are at a peak of using fertilisers because prices have jumped five-fold and availability will be limited in the future. Beyond that, the increase in beef consumption is eating into the ability to produce crops such as rice and wheat. Grantham says that climate instability will lead to more unprecedented weather changes and this will cause a ruinous drop in food production. Beyond all this, scientists have been underestimating the threat from climate change and that the problem is far worse than most people so far recognise.&quot;Almost all climate scientists recognise the problem is worse that they are saying,&quot; he says. Beyond this, food currently accounts for at least 40% of poor household incomes and with food prices likely to double over the next 20 years, &quot;who will pay for this?&quot; Perhaps Grantham&apos;s greatest vitriol is aimed at incentives for the use of US maize for producing ethanol. As he points out, the maize needed to produce the fuel to fill one tank of one SUV, would feed an Indian person for a year. Grantham finishes up by quoting Churchill: &quot;The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.&quot;  How are you feeling now?  3.55pm: A little known fact: An aircraft carrier does an average of 12 inches per gallon of fuelIf you worry about the miles per gallon of your car, spare a thought for rear admiral Neil Morisetti, the climate and energy security envoy of the UK Ministry of Defence. When he was in charge of an aircraft carrier, he calculated that he used to get 12 inches for every gallon of fuel he used. Morisetti uses this example to point out that the Ministry of Defence is increasingly needing to think, like other businesses, how to reduce its reliance on fossil-fuels. Without fuel, the army cannot fight but securing supplies is increasingly difficult, and Morisetti gives the example of the problems with getting fuel to troops in Afghanistan. More than this, it has to be protected, it ties people down, and the cost of fuel in war zones is 10 times the normal price. &quot;We have to have an energy plan which recognises we need to reduce costs and risks by changing our behaviour,&quot; he says. &quot;For example big bits of kit needs generators while smaller bits of kids can use batteries.&quot;  4.32pm:  How even Unilever is struggling to get any investor interest in its sustainability performance If you are under any illusion that investors are interested in sustainability, then go and speak to Unilever&apos;s finance director, Jean-Marc Huet. Even though Unilever is a leader in building social, ethical and environmental measures into the heart of its business, investors couldn&apos;t be less interested. Huet says that when he goes around presenting the multinational&apos;s financial performance, &quot;next to no-one&quot; asks about sustainability in general and resource efficiency in particular. Huet has therefore gone in search of investors who are interested in discussing these aspects, albeit with little success, and has spoken with other companies who share the same experience. Given this depressing situation, Huet says it is likely that integrated reporting, which gives equal weight between financial and non-financial measures, is the best way forward. While Huet says &quot;this has to be the way to go,&quot; he warns that trying to tie down effective measures for non-financial areas is no easy task. &quot;A lot of people are talking about integrated reporting but I am still concentrating on demonstrating that our numbers are correct,&quot; he says. Huet says we need to get to a position where companies are not just giving profit warnings, but also resource efficiency warnings. When asked if Unilever&apos;s own pension fund is taking these issues seriously, Huet admits it could do more but adds that this issue is currently being discussed. The reason why Huet&apos;s comments are more than of just passing interest is that there are fears at senior levels of the sustainability movement, that Unilever could be at risk if it suffers from a dip in its financial performance. Peter Bakker, president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, told me in Rio the other week that if investors took the sustainability work of Unilever CEO Paul Polman seriously, then he would be considered a hero. As it is, if the company&apos;s profits take a hit, people will blame it on Polman&apos;s sustainable living plan and see its work in this field as a liability.  5.09pm:  Moving from vision to action I have been speaking to a few key delegates at the conference and the general impression is we need to move from high level visioning to practical action. I think there is a general feeling in the sustainability world that we need to take more time to show solutions working on the ground, and to learn best practice, so that we can take more experiments to scale. The key point is that words are not going to save humanity and stop the planet being degraded. The time for talking is over, the time for action is upon us.  5.11pm:  Today is over but tomorrow is another day..... My hands are starting to hurt so I am going to wrap up for the day. But please join us tomorow for the second day of the Resource conference at Oxford University&apos;s Smith School. Coming up tomorrow are Bill Clinton, Jochen Zeitz, Sir Terry Leahy, David Milliband, Will Hutton and Lord Mandelson. I hope that today has been useful and if nothing else, we have learnt that an aircraft carrier does 12 inches to a gallon of fuel :)"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/13/chinese-frigate-runs-aground-sea", "sentences": ["If this had been a near-run with a ship from another country, it could have ended badly, with political implications.&quot; Ian Storey of the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore said that while the grounding was in itself unlikely to escalate tensions, it indicated the growing militarisation of the waters."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-13T12:06:06Z", "title": "Chinese frigate runs aground in disputed part of South China Sea", "tags": ["China", "Philippines", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "South China Sea"], "article": "A Chinese naval frigate has run aground in a disputed area of the South China Sea in an embarrassing twist to the escalating territorial row in the area. News of the collision came shortly after a summit of south-east Asian foreign ministers broke up without a joint statement for the first time in the 45-year history of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) because of splits over the complex and increasingly heated maritime dispute. Huge amounts of cargo traffic pass through the sea, which also boasts rich fisheries and vast energy supplies. The gravest recent tensions have been between China, the Philippines and Vietnam, but Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan also claim parts of the sea. A statement on the Chinese ministry of defence&apos;s website said a navy frigate had been accidentally grounded near Half Moon Shoal in the South China Sea while carrying out routine patrols on Wednesday night. There were no casualties and the navy was organising its rescue, added the report, which appeared shortly after the Sydney Morning Herald broke news of the collision. It is unclear how badly the vessel was damaged. The area is about 60 nautical miles (111km) west of the Philippine province of Palawan in an area claimed by Manila. The Philippines military told Associated Press that the shoal was well within the country&apos;s territorial waters. &quot;We have to hear from them what happened. If it is in distress, we&apos;re always ready to provide any assistance,&quot; said Brigadier General Elmer Amon, the deputy regional commander. Rory Medcalf, director of the international security programme at the Lowy Institute, said it was surprising to see the Chinese using naval vessels to patrol the disputed area. &quot;This raises lots of questions \u2026 They have been relying primarily on civilian forces,&quot; he said. &quot;That does mean sooner or later we will see confrontational incidents involving naval vessels rather than civilian agencies. &quot;Secondly, it raises concerns about the quality of seamanship. If this had been a near-run with a ship from another country, it could have ended badly, with political implications.&quot; Ian Storey of the Institute of South-east Asian Studies in Singapore said that while the grounding was in itself unlikely to escalate tensions, it indicated the growing militarisation of the waters. &quot;Resolution of the dispute is even further out of reach,&quot; he added. &quot;No one seriously envisages a major conflict in the South China Sea because it&apos;s not in anyone&apos;s interests. They depend on those sea lanes for the continued functioning of their economies. &quot;The real risk is that an accidental clash occurs and escalates. In my mind, it is just a matter of time before one of these standoffs gets really ugly and people get killed.&quot; Tensions have been building in the area since 2007, with increasing keenness to claim the energy resources, and growing pressure from nationalists in several of the countries. Vietnam has seen unusual street protests over the dispute in the past few weeks. &quot;Add to all that the intensified US-China competition, with the Americans supposedly coming back to Asia, and you have all the ingredients for the muddle we have now,&quot; added Medcalf. Beijing and Manila have already engaged in a tense standoff at Scarborough Shoal, after the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of poaching in its exclusive economic zone. China says the area has belonged to it since ancient times. Both sides sent government vessels to the area, although the Philippines has now withdrawn its ships. Earlier this week, Asean members announced they had agreed a code of conduct governing maritime rights and navigation in the region and procedures for handling disputes. But further talks with China would be required to reach agreement on a legally binding set of rules. China argues that the territorial disputes should be tackled bilaterally, opposing attempts to handle them collectively. Hillary Clinton and China&apos;s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, sought to strike a more amiable note on the issue as they met in Cambodia on Thursday. But the US secretary of state urged China to open talks on the code, adding: &quot;No nation can fail to be concerned by the increase in tensions, the uptick in confrontational rhetoric, and disagreements over resource exploitation. &quot;We have seen worrisome instances of economic coercion and the problematic use of military and government vessels in connection with disputes among fishermen.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/13/tour-de-france-2012-stage-12-live", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;ve never been this interested in TDF but I&apos;m finding it very difficult to stop following the updates to the detriment of my sleep (I&apos;m in Singapore),&quot; reveals Aran Scutcher."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-13T15:15:44Z", "title": "Tour de France 2012: stage 12 \u2013 live! | Paul Doyle", "tags": ["Tour de France 2012", "Tour de France", "Cycling", "Sport"], "article": " Stage 12: St-Jeane-de-Maurienne \u2013 Annonay Dav\u00e9zieuxAfternoon all. This is a 226km stage in which the riders cross the Alps, though they&apos;ll generally take river valleys rather than mountain passes in order to avoid climbing as much as possible. We&apos;re 80km in already, which means the riders have already overcome the first first-category climbs (Col du Grand Cucheron, 1,188m) and are marking their way up the second (Col du Granier, 1,134m). That will be followed by a long, slightly downhill stretch on which they are liable to be gently buffeted by crosswinds. An uphill finish offers scope for a late twist.  About the destination: It&apos;s in picturesque Anonnay, which grew wealthy in the Middle Ages thanks in part to wine exportation and mule-trading. But its prosperity meant it also attracted swarms or brigands and mercenaries, meaning parts of it could have been twinned with Mos Eisley, the &quot;wretched hive of scum and villainy&quot; that Ben Kenobi warned Luke Skywalker about a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. In the plus column, Annonay is where the De Canson brothers invented tracing paper. And where would we be without tracing paper, eh?

Then, halfway through the final chapter, the words came to blazing life as the Tour de France once again rewarded the patience of its adherents old and new with an incident-packed finale in which Bradley Wiggins hung on to his yellow jersey, saw one of his principal rivals display an unexpected and possibly fatal weakness, crossed the line arm in arm with the other, and received a perhaps unwelcome reminder of the strength of his chief lieutenant.The day was all set up to be one in which the race leader would be subjected to constant danger. At the end, however, the man who appeared to be in the position to pose the greatest threat to Wiggins&apos;s chances of becoming the first British rider to win the Tour de France was not Cadel Evans or Vincenzo Nibali but Chris Froome, his own compatriot and team-mate.For most of the day it was like discovering that the best-selling detective novel you had been given to read consisted of blank pages.

Cadel Evans (Aus) BMC at 3min 19sec5. Jurgen van den Broeck (Bel) LTB 4min 48sec  12.04pm: A 12-man leading group is 5km from the summit, 1&apos;35&apos;&apos; ahead of a six-strong group of pursuers, who are 1&apos;37 ahead of the peloton, which features Wiggins. The 12 riders at the front are: Millar, Popovych, Gautier, Koren, Martinez, Peraud, Bouet, Edet, Gusev, Vorganov, Sorensen and Kiserlovski  12.12pm: It&apos;s a steep climb to the top at it&apos;s taking its toll, as two riders - Bouet and Gusev - drop out of the leading group.  12.16pm: Wiggins is ensconed in a group of about 25 riders, who are 1&apos;10&apos;&apos; behind the leaders. But the climb continues to do damage, as Nicolas Roche is among several riders struggling to stay in contact wit the peloton.  12.19pm: A five-strong group of leaders have reached the peak, Kiserlovski making it first. Meanwhile a little behind, Wiggins has decided to break from the peloton to join the seven-man chasing group just behind the leaders, who are 57&apos;&apos; ahead of the peloton as they begin their descent.  12.27pm: Wiggins has mostly been led out by his Sky team-mates so far in the Tour but he surged clear of them for a few minutes to distance himself from his rivals in the general classification. He has now tucked back in behind a couple of team-mates, 1&apos;09&quot;&quot; behind the fiver leaders and slightly less behind fiver chasers.  12.34pm: Sagan has led an attack on the descent and the pack is now quite scattered: we have five at the front, followed by five chasers and then, 1&apos;&apos;23&apos;&apos; from the leaders, a six-strong group featuring Sagan, followed by the peloton featuring Wiggins.  12.38pm: Sagan&apos;s group is now 1&apos;28&apos;&apos; behind the leaders (Millar, Martinez, Kiserlovski, Peraud and Gautier) but 1&apos;15&quot; ahead of the peloton. &quot;Before we get stuck into the daily debate about whether Sky are heroes or villains, can we spread some love for team Europcar please?&quot; pleads Robin Hazlehurst. &quot;In the break every day - Cyril Gautier today - and two consecutive stage victories with Rolland taking a second Queen Stage in as many years and French housewives&apos; and cycling fans&apos; favourite Tommy V taking the KOM. Christophe Kern is burying himself at the front again today and lots of real committed racing - and all this from a team based in the provincial sticks with no money. Sky are doing very well but doing it the Manchester City way, pots of money and lots of big stars, Europcar are more like Swansea. They aren&apos;t going to win the thing but they really entertain with relatively limited resources. Ok, love spread, back to the daily Sky arguments...&quot;  12.45pm: Sagan is working hard to catch the leaders. He is taking the intiatiave and cajoling a nine-strong chasing group to catch the five leaders, who are currently 1&apos;35&quot; ahead. We have 122km to go.  12.49pm: We&apos;ve just postewd Bradley Wiggins&apos; latest column. You&apos;ll want to read it. Below is the first paragraph. You can read the whole lot here:  There have been a couple of questions asked about doping this week and I don&apos;t feel I&apos;ve been able to give a full answer. I understand why I get asked those questions given the recent history of the sport but it still annoys me. It&apos;s hard to know what to say, half an hour after finishing one of the hardest races you&apos;ve ridden, when you&apos;re knackered. The insinuations make me angry, because I thought people would look back into my history, the things I&apos;ve said in the past, such as at the start of the 2006 Tour when I turned up for a first go at the race and Operaci\u00f3n Puerto kicked off, what I said when Floyd Landis went positive, and what I said when I was chucked out with Cofidis after Cristian Moreni tested positive in 2007.   12.53pm: The leaders are holding of the Sagan posse at the moment. And as they enter the snack zone, that&apos;s my cue to take a quick comfort break.  1.05pm: The peloton have caught Sagan&apos;s group, meaning there is now a single mass of riders chasing the five leaders, who are 3&apos;39&quot; in front. There&apos;s an intermediate sprint in about 35km. &quot;Interesting to see Bjarne Riis predicting Sky will change leaders mid-race&lt;&quot; warbles Paul Fulcher. &quot;And he should know as it happened to him in the 1997 Tour when Jan Ullrich took over. But Sky need to be careful - it went badly wrong in the 2011 Vuelta when Froome and Wiggins ended up finishing 2nd to 3rd.&quot;  1.09pm: The peloton have slowed right down, taking the opportunity for a break. The breakaway have stretched their lead to five minutes. Sean Kelly on Eurosport reckons they will be allowed to go a lot farther and thus, the stage winner will be one of Martinez, Millar, Kiserlovski, Peraud and Gautier. &quot;I don&apos;t understand this at all,&quot; Gareth Evans. &quot;Sure, Team Sky have invested and picked the better riders and support team but if that means that we get a British rider winning the thing and possibly a team mate finishing second overall, what&apos;s not to like? They would also not be the first cycling team to do that so it&apos;s not like they are setting a hideous, previously unheard of, precedent is it. There are many things to dislike about Sky - Stealing Alan Partridge and Veep and sticking them on a channel watched by 18 people, for example - but this isn&apos;t one of them. Wiggins deserves a proper crack at the Tour and as Team Sky have given him that then hats off to them.&quot;  1.20pm: True to Sean Kelly&apos;s prediction, the leaders have extended their advantage to 7&apos;43&quot;. Meanwhile, have a gander at these snaps.  1.31pm: &quot;I accidentally started watching the Tour de France yesterday,&quot; c onfesses Kat Petersen. &quot;After many patient answers and explanations from my cycling friend I even have a pretty good idea of what is going on. What I don&apos;t have, though, is a rider to support, which I&apos;m sure would make it even more interesting. I&apos;m open to suggestions! (I once named a lobster I knitted with the help of OBO readers, so I&apos;m evidently happy to let the Guardian help me lead my life).&quot; Well, if you&apos;re prepared to risk being called a gloryhunter, you could always root for the boy Wiggins, who seems to have gone even farther up in many people&apos;s esteem following his latest column.  1.40pm: Cavendish and Greipel, who got left behind earlier, have caught back up with the peloton, who are trundling along some 11&apos;37&quot; behind the five leaders.  1.45pm: Nibali has sidled up alongside his sporting director&apos;s car to change radios. In other news, Gary Naylor has some advice for new cycling enthusiast Kay Petersen. &quot;If you want to be a little different - and I know you do - Chris Froome is riding a sensational and noble race. He is a stone-cold certainty to win a grand tour in the future too, so a handy investment.&quot;  1.53pm: The peloton have no interest in catching up the leaders (11&apos;15&quot; ahead and counting) but Sky are making intermittent attempts to drop riders. With crosswinds sweeping the road, Eisel cranked up the pace a tad, but everyone kept up. So a mighty long serpent is maing its way over the road, 75km from the finish.  2.00pm: There are five Sky riderrs, including Wiggins, at the front of the peloton. They are in full control. &quot;Message for Kat Petersen: With cycling, the best option is to pick the rider with the best name,&quot; advises the not-so-badly monikered Michael Laycock. &quot;At the moment I particularly enjoy Johnny Hoogerland, it has a tremendous ring to it. Plus there was the whole being knocked into a barbwire fence by a car during last year&apos;s race.&quot;  2.03pm: Millar has won the intermiate sprint, taking a handy 20 points. He was followed by Gautier (17), Kiserlovski (15), Peraud (13) and Martinez (11).  2.09pm: Goss make a fine burst to finish ahead of Greipel, Van Hummel and Sagan in the intermediate sprint. So Goss takes 10 points, with Greipel getting nine and so on.  2.12pm: The five leaders will soon reach Lens-Lestang, where, according to L&apos;Equipe, there is an splendid bear and doll museum. At last you know where to find one! &quot;I&apos;ve never been this interested in TDF but I&apos;m finding it very difficult to stop following the updates to the detriment of my sleep (I&apos;m in Singapore),&quot; reveals Aran Scutcher. &quot;I heard that TDF competitors actually pedal in their sleep, apparently it&apos;s cycle-somatic.&quot;  2.18pm: &quot;When it comes to best cycling names, how can you go past Thor Hushovd?&quot; demands Tom Winders. &quot;I wish my name was Thor Hushovd. I reckon Andy Schleck wishes his name was Thor Hushovd.&quot;  2.24pm: The leaders keep going: there now 12 minutes ahead of the pack. In other news, in case you&apos;re interested, John Terry has been declared not guilty or racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. &quot;From Stateside, this Yank suggests another investment in the future, in TeeJay Vangarderen, current wearer of the best young rider&apos;s White Jersey,&quot; toots Ken Grabach. &quot;Or the telegenic and histrionic Peter Sagan, from Slovakia. There&apos;s a neutral suggestion that gives some cred for basing your enthusiasm on performance rather than national origins. Also an investment in the future as he&apos;s a first-time Tour rider, and is in the sprinter&apos;s green jersey.&quot;  2.28pm: Trundle, trundle. 52km to go. &quot;Dunno if he still does, but one of the guys who writes for Bicycling Magazine used to refer to Cadel Evans as &apos;Cuddles&apos;,&quot; chirps Sam Trzyzewski. &quot;If that&apos;s not enough incentive to pick a rider based on name, I don&apos;t know what is.&quot;  2.29pm: It&apos;s just a pleasant country ramble at the moment, with no one attacking or doing anything at all to disrupt the tranquility. &quot;Continuing the name riff, I get misty-eyed at the great names of the past,&quot; cooes Guy Hornsby. &quot;Guido Bontempi, Eros Poli, Armand De Las Cuevas and the Tashkent Terror, Djamolidine Abdoujaparov. Don&apos;t try saying that after a couple of Liver Compromisers.&quot;  2.37pm: A-trundlin&apos; they go. &quot;Without a doubt, the best name is Christian Knees, of Sky,&quot; interjects Andrew Brown.  2.55pm: What did we miss while I was stretching my legs? Nothing. The peloton continue to trundle, the five leaders have a 12&apos;04&quot; advantage as we approach the 30km to go point.  3.01pm: &quot;A couple of titbits from French TV,&quot; halloos Matt Cast. &quot;Firstly, David Moncouti\u00e9 is out of the race after a nasty crash on a downhill. Secondly, the elbow of the charming Mark Cavendish apparently caught a cameraman who dared to film him struggling up a mountain yesterday.&quot;  3.02pm: In just a couple of kilometers the stage will start to get interesting again as the leaders begin the final ascent to the finishing line. It&apos;s only a category-three climb but there&apos;s scope for manoeuvring nonetheless. &quot;Surely the greatest Nom du Tour was Bo Hamburger,&quot; toots Jack Windle. &apos;Gianni Bugno is also pretty good, and whatever you think of him, Lance Armstrong is a pretty belting name...&quot;  3.06pm: Sky continue to dominate the peleon, with Wiggins fifth from the front, four of his team-mates ahead of him. &quot;Not only is Cadel Evans known as &apos;Cuddles&apos; but Vincenzo Nibali rejoices under the appellation &apos;Nibbles&apos;,&quot; squawks Stephen Davenport. &quot;Of course. Add &apos;Wiggo&apos; and you&apos;re three quarters of the way to revisiting 1970 with an All-new Banana Splits.&quot;  3.11pm: The question now is who will win the stage: Kiserlovski would usually be favourite but may not quite have the juice following his exertsions yesterday. With 23km to go, no one has attacked yet, the gap to the peloton making such a break unnecessary yet. &quot;A discussion of the best names on the Tour, and no-one has mentioned Vladimir Karpets?&quot; gasps Jackie Woodworth.  3.18pm: Fans line the road on the way to the summit, and one bozo endears himself to the riders by waving a some kind of smoke bomb in their faces as they whizz past. Just what they&apos;ll have wanted 180km into the stage.  3.25pm: With 16km to go, everyone continues to bide their time. It looks like a burst for the stage victory is going to be left as late as possible, possibly until the little 4km uphill jaunt to the finish. &quot;I always thought that Miguel In-da-rain was a pretty good nom da pluie!&quot; chortles Simon Townend. &quot;Though I dont know if he could have performed on a wet Tuesday in Stoke.&quot;  3.31pm: Following the victories of Voeckler and Rolland in the last two stages, Gautier is well placed to give Europcar a third consecutive stage victory, each time by a different rider, a feat that has not been achieved in the Tour since 1991 apparently.  3.38pm: With 7km to go, the same fiver riders who&apos;ve been leading for nigh-on 100km are in contention for the same victory. To recap, they are: Millar, Gautier, Martinez, Kiserlovski and Peraud. They are 10&apos;20&quot; ahead of the peloton, which Sky continue to control.  3.43pm: Martinez spices things up at the front with 4km to go. The group don&apos;t let him get away and now the real cata-and-mouse stuff begins, Kiserlovski being the next to make a dash for it.  3.44pm: This is like the build-up to a track sprint now, with the five leaders slowing right down and sizing each other up. &quot;Many thanks for everyone&apos;s suggestions,&quot; announces Kat Petersen. &quot;I&apos;m definitely supporting Wiggins and Froome. Will leave a third spot open for anyone who catches my eye over the weekend.&quot;  3.46pm: Millar and Peraud seem to have found something extra and have jumped 50m ahead of other three. Gautier is trying to get back in touch with them. There are 2km left.  3.47pm: It looks like it&apos;s between Millar and Peraud, who seem unlikely to be caught with 1.5km to go. It&apos;s been a tremendous effort by both of them and it&apos;s going to be a real sickener for the man who finishes second.  3.49pm: Millar takes the stage in a flat-out sprint finish with Peraud, who comes in half a bike-length behind him. And after a celebratory punch of the air, the Scotsman jumps off his bike to prostrate himself on the ground. Totally knackered, I think they say in cycling jargon.  3.54pm: The peloton are approaching the finish, 1km left, with Sky still at the front.  3.58pm: Goss and Sagan are side by side at the head of the peloton going into the last 600m and there follows a frantic sprint finish in which Goss crosses first. But Sagan gestures furiously as he clearly believes the Australian blocked his line. It will be interesting to see what the race officials make of that.   4.02pm: &quot;Our Olympic team is basically made up of Tour de France stage winners, we&apos;re going to be a force to be reckoned with,&quot; says David Millar to Eurosport. Four of the five Team GB members have won a stage in this race.   Stage 12 Top 10: 1. D Millar2. J Peraud3. E Martinez4. C Gautier5. R Kiserlovski6. M Goss7. P Sagan8. S Hinault9. C Evans10.

They provide horse blood for the females to feed on, moist beds for them\u00a0to lay their eggs, and add genes that transform the mosquitoes into what could be the most decisive tool yet invented to combat mosquito-borne disease. The mosquitoes developed and raised here at the laboratories of Oxitec, a British biotech company based near Didcot, have already infiltrated wild populations in Brazil, Malaysia and the Cayman Islands, and will soon be unleashed in Panama and India. The company hopes that it will reduce populations of disease-carrying mosquitoes by 80% but public opposition to anything &quot;genetically modified&quot; remains a significant obstacle to the possibility of saving thousands of lives. Mosquito-borne diseases are one of the major barriers preventing economic progress in the developing world. According to the World Health Organisation, 200 million people were victims of malaria in 2010 and 655,000, mostly children, died from it. Dengue fever is believed to affect 50-100\u00a0million people per year and results in around 20,000 deaths. &quot;From a scientific point of view and an environmental sustainability point of view, we think we have a really good solution to the problem,&quot; says Hadyn Parry, the CEO of Oxitec. The company, which emerged from Oxford University in 2002, is primarily focused on dengue fever, which can cause excruciating pain and death, and the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries it. A\u00a0aegypti was mostly found in Africa until around the time of the second world war. After that, it was transported by ships all over the world. A\u00a0aegypti can now be found in 110 countries and the incidence of dengue fever has risen 30-fold in the past 50 years. The mosquitoes live near humans and lay eggs in any container holding water in and around homes \u2013 from as little as the residue left on a teaspoon to puddles in old tyres. Eggs can survive for months after the water evaporates. The mosquitoes prefer small pools of still water which contain rotting organic matter. In their 10-day lives they have little contact with species other than mammals and their eradication leaves the ecosystem much as it was before they arrived, Oxitec believes. The main weapons against A\u00a0aegypti, pesticides and education, have had little success in preventing its spread. Pesticides are only effective when the mosquitoes can be seen and touched with spray. Educating people to empty any vessel around the home that could\u00a0contain water is only as effective\u00a0as the diligence of the individuals involved. More sophisticated methods of control began after the second world war when scientists in the US began using radiation as a means of controlling insects. Sterilised male insects would then be introduced into the environment to mate with wild females. No offspring would be produced and the productive capacity of a female insect would be lost. The difficulty was in finding the right amount of radiation to sterilise the insect but not damage him so much that he would be unattractive to females. The scientists achieved this with fruit flies and other insects but did not succeed with mosquitoes, which were too feeble after sterilisation to compete in the wild. Oxitec&apos;s chief scientific officer, Luke Alphey, found this method inefficient and came up with an alternative using genetic modification which would allow the new mosquitoes to reproduce but only in a limited way. He produced mosquitoes that were engineered to need an antibiotic, tetracycline, to develop beyond larval stage. The altered males are fed tetracycline in the lab and then introduced into the wild where they mate with wild females. The offspring need tetracycline to develop but cannot find it and so die. Only males are introduced into the environment and in a few days both they and their offspring are dead. The company, Oxford Insect Technologies in its unabbreviated form, believes its technique is effective, cheap and far less damaging to the environment than the use of pesticides but its problem is the phrase &quot;genetically modified&quot; and the kneejerk fears it engenders. Critics see a ruthless corporate giant aiming to monopolise a market for commercial ends, which could have unknown effects on unknown things. For many critics, the mystery is often as potent as the evidence. Oxitec could not be more different from the multinationals. It employs 40 people,\u00a035 of whom are scientists. It doesn&apos;t have a public relations department, or even person, instead relying on Hadyn Parry and senior scientists to explain its work to the public. Parry says that the public perception of genetic modification is a barrier the company has to battle against. &quot;Genetic modification is an approach, a tool,&quot; he says. &quot;It is neither good nor bad. If you take a car and give it to a lunatic it is quite dangerous, but in the right hands it&apos;s very useful. You have to see what genetic modification produces and see if the risks and benefits are acceptable. But because there is a public perception issue around genetic modification then we have to overcome the negative perception and that is quite difficult.&quot; Unlike GM crops, Oxitec&apos;s mosquitoes are not designed to spread their genes down the line or to other species. &quot;We are not putting an advantage into these mosquitoes; we are putting in a disadvantage, sterility, which is the biggest disadvantage you can have,&quot; says Parry. &quot;You are not spreading your gene down generations because each one is sterile \u2013 it dies out. They do not out cross and mate with other species. So you are not spreading your gene laterally or downward.&quot; Critics of Oxitec say that the company is rushing to commercialise its products to provide a return on investment, massaging research while leaving key questions unanswered. Dr Helen Wallace, the director of GeneWatch, says she has several problems with Oxitec&apos;s findings from its trials. One major issue, she says, is the occurrence of the tetracycline \u2013 the antibiotic that the young mosquitoes need to survive \u2013 in livestock and meat. Theoretically, if a female mosquito, daughter to a modified one, bit meat or an animal that contained tetracycline, she could survive. Oxitec says that the chance of this happening is very slim and in its most recent trial in the Caymans, it did not find a single mosquito that had survived. Wallace says: &quot;It&apos;s a very experimental approach which has not yet been successful and may cause more harm than good. They are pushing ahead to commercialise their approach so they can start paying back their investors. &quot;I would be happier if there were more experiments in controlled areas, caged areas and labs, before general release in the populated areas. For example, in an area where dengue fever is endemic there&apos;s a possible danger to the public.&quot; Wallace believes that existing control methods could be just as effective as releasing genetically modified insects and points out there are other innovations on the horizon which could be even more successful. Other critics have accused Oxitec of a lack of transparency. Earlier this year, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Germany examined information regarding the release of modified insects into the environment in Malaysia and Grand Cayman, which were carried out by Oxitec. The scientists&apos; findings suggest that there are &quot;deficits in the scientific quality of regulatory documents and a general absence of accurate experimental descriptions available before releases start&quot;. Attempts to introduce mosquitoes in the US have also run into difficulties. In 2009, Key West, in Florida, was home to the region&apos;s first outbreak of dengue fever since 1934. Local authorities blanketed the area in pesticides but the outbreak lasted 15 months and 93 people were infected. Twelve months earlier, Oxitec had begun discussions with local authorities to carry out experiments on the islands but local activists soon voiced their opposition. &quot;If you enter the GM space, you get pressure groups and activists who are part of this reaction to the introduction of GM crops. They are very active and they are much bigger than us and they are much better communicators than we are. Some of them put out really outrageous lies and it is very difficult for us to counter that. Mud sticks to a certain extent,&quot; says Parry. The discussion continued and Oxitec was due to carry out an experiment with about 5,000-10,000 mosquitoes in January but the Florida Keys Mosquito Control\u00a0District postponed it. Oxitec isn&apos;t sure when the experiment will now take place. Friends of the Earth in the US disputes Oxitec&apos;s claim that mosquito numbers can be reduced by releasing more mosquitoes into the environment and says the planned release in Key West creates &quot;health, environmental and ethical challenges&quot; that should be carefully considered. &quot;Who will regulate their release and who will be legally and financially liable if something goes wrong?&quot; Friends of the Earth&apos;s Eric Hoffman asked in the local newspaper, the Keynoter. &quot;Will Oxitec be required to obtain the free and informed consent of Key West residents?&quot; On his Friends of the Earth blog, Hoffman also asked what happens when female mosquitoes are released along with the males and what happens when the young mosquitoes do not do what they were modified to do \u2013 die at an early stage. Parry explains that around one female is released per 3,000 males but it would have little effect. It would be able to bite like other mosquitoes but it would be dengue-free and likely to die before it could bite something with dengue and then infect a\u00a0human. On the question of the survival of mosquitoes, Parry says that in laboratory conditions 5% of the mosquitoes survived beyond the larval stage, but in the Cayman Islands tests they did not find a single surviving mosquito. If they did survive, says Parry, they would be shorter-lived than their wild\u00a0counterparts and more susceptible to pesticides. There were no cases of dengue fever in the Keys last year, changing the focus of the debate. The arguments of activists who question the technology have gained more weight because there is no immediate public health advantage to counteract. Parry welcomes questions about the value of the company&apos;s work but points out that anything it does must be sanctioned by each country&apos;s regulatory body. &quot;So whereas we compile the dossier and carry out tests to validate our arguments, the regulators form an independent and expert body that look at all safety and\u00a0environmental impact issues in great depth.&quot; Oxitec has had fewer problems with public opinion in countries where dengue fever is more common. Regulations in dengue-afflicted countries can be quite severe. In Singapore, a householder can be fined for leaving a glass of water in the garden, a potential breeding site for mosquitoes. In Malaysia, if someone contracts dengue, their home and every home within a 200-yard radius must be fogged with pesticide, inside and out. The more serious the problem, the keener are the authorities to try new approaches. &quot;So if you take Brazil in the 70s, they declared themselves free of A\u00a0aegypti and now they have millions of cases and spend a billion dollars a year trying to get rid of it,&quot; says Parry. Oxitec is now producing mosquitoes\u00a0in Brazil in conjunction with a local company following a successful initial trial. It recently reported that it reduced the number of Aedes mosquitoes by 85%, compared with an area where the company&apos;s mosquitoes weren&apos;t released. If a further trial goes well, Oxitec will apply for its first commercial licence which offers the prospect of earning\u00a0money for the first time in the company&apos;s history. Aside from startup costs, such as production facilities, training and equipment, Oxitec estimates that its technique would cost less than \u00a36 per person per year, and half that in India where labour costs are much lower. &quot;This is not a rich man&apos;s tool; there&apos;s no point in protecting a rich man&apos;s mansion,&quot; says Parry. &quot;You want to protect a community so it&apos;s got to be\u00a0cheap.&quot; Oxitec&apos;s technique has applications for agriculture as well as public health. One target is the tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta, a pest which arrived in Europe from Brazil in 2006. &quot;You get an insect coming in but without its natural predators it goes out of control, and then everyone sprays the hell out of it and then it gets resistant and you don&apos;t have enough types of chemical to manage the resistance. With our solution, you just take out the species itself, &quot;says Parry. Oxitec has already tested its method with Anopheles mosquitoes, which spread malaria. &quot;We could have outdoor trials in five years&apos; time,&quot; says Parry. &quot;We have transformed it, modified it. It can be done \u2013 it&apos;s only a question of time and money. Our plan is to prove it works in dengue and then people will be willing to invest the money for the next stages.&quot; It is unlikely that any single method could completely eradicate any species of mosquito but the introduction of Oxitec&apos;s modified mosquitoes could combine with existing techniques such\u00a0as bed nets and education to manage mosquito-borne diseases far\u00a0more effectively than is being done\u00a0presently. But just as the human response becomes more sophisticated so does the mosquito. Scientists are now reporting that mosquitoes have started feeding earlier in the day in response to\u00a0the widespread use of bed nets at night time. The scientists at Oxitec have tried to test every possible problem that could arise from the release of their mosquitoes. &quot;No innovation or adventure is risk-free but the trouble with unforeseen consequences is that they cannot be foreseen,&quot; says Parry. &quot;We go through a regulatory process, we ask what could possibly go wrong and we publish our findings for peer review. Our biggest challenge is communication \u2013 to get a responsible and sensible debate within a system where you get a small number of diehard activists who are dead against anything we do. We have a product that\u00a0works, that is safe and is cost-effective, and we need to get that message across.&quot; Other GM advances \u25a0 Triple-stack corn seeds resist the three biggest threats to the crop: corn borers (moth larvae), corn rootworms, and herbicides. The patent-protected technology was created in 2005 by the biotech company Monsanto, which aims to increase crop productivity and quality for farmers around the globe while conserving the planet&apos;s natural resources. About half of all US cornfields were grown from triple-stack corn seeds in 2010, and the number is expected to increase. Corn is one of the most important grains to humans worldwide: it is used to feed cattle and chickens, make fructose, biodegradable plastics, corn oil, corn meal, corn syrup, and even toothpaste. \u25a0 GloFish fluorescent fish are available as pets in the US, but were originally developed to detect pollutants: a non-fluorescing fish indicates safe water, a fluorescing one contamination. The first GloFish were bred by injecting a natural fluorescence gene into the fish eggs before they hatched, and the GloFish around today are their natural offspring, inheriting their colour from their parents. The fish have enabled scientists to gain a better understanding of gene therapy, cellular disease and molecular biology. \u25a0 The first Enviropig was created at the University of Guelph, Ontario, in 1999 as a more eco-efficient alternative to Yorkshire pigs. Enviropigs were genetically enhanced to digest the phosphorus that pigs create when they eat cereal grains, and excrete less of the environmentally damaging chemical than Yorkshire pigs \u2013 reducing the risk of water and soil pollution. However, as Health Canada was unable to assess the safety of the GM animals for human consumption, the unversity lost its funding for Enviropigs and the 10 remaining animals were euthanised earlier this year. \u25a0 AquAdvantage salmon grow into a full-sized salmon twice as fast as regular salmon, and were declared safe to eat in 2010 by the US\u00a0food and drug administration. The decision has been controversial, but Ron Stotish of AquaBounty (the US company behind GM salmon) claims that it will help to meet increasing demand for the fish &quot;by producing more fish in less time compared to current salmon farming techniques&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/editorial-olympics-good-for-britain", "sentences": ["In Singapore, in 2005, Team GB included 30 children from London&apos;s East End; David Beckham, Ken Livingstone, then mayor of London, and a typically crowd-pleasing performance from Tony Blair."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-14T23:08:48Z", "title": "London 2012: Despite our anxieties, the Olympics will be a force for good in Britain | Observer editorial", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Lord Coe", "Ken Livingstone", "Boris Johnson", "G4S", "International Olympic Committee", "Olympic Games"], "article": "In February this year, a team from the International Olympic Committee made their tenth and final visit to inspect and assess preparations for the 2012 &quot;Games of the XXX Olympiad&quot; due to begin in 12 days. The Games will embrace 26 sports in 34 venues across the country, involving more than 16,000 athletes watched by 11 million spectators and billions more around the globe. The cost to the public purse has risen over seven years from \u00a32.5bn to more than \u00a39bn. The IOC&apos;s verdict is that it is money well spent. &quot;London is ready to host the world,&quot; it declared boldly. Events over the past week or so have injected more than a modicum of doubt into that enthusiastic assertion \u2013 while raising questions about a lack of political leadership. A series of crises have occurred that appear all the more alarming both because of their proximity to the Games&apos; opening on 27 July and also, perversely, because the previous seven years of planning and delivery, under the stewardship of Lord Coe, have gone mostly smoothly. First, a crack in a flyover on the M4 risked putting London&apos;s most important Olympic route in jeopardy. Then, the ongoing issue of inadequate immigration staffing at Heathrow resulted in the public relations disaster of arrival lounges packed with visitors queueing for up to two hours and no staff in sight despite a ministerial promise that this would not happen. Most disturbingly, and still ongoing, is the security fiasco caused by the mismanagement of the international company G4S in failing to meet its target of providing up to 17,500 guards for the Olympic Park. As a result, 3,500 military personnel have had to be shipped in, many facing redundancy and forfeiting well-earned holidays, as well as extra police reinforcements. Ian Swales, of the House of Commons public accounts committee, has criticised G4S for charging &quot;colossal fees&quot; for &quot;very poor service&quot;. On Tuesday the G4S chief executive, Nick Buckles, explains the company&apos;s latest public sector calamity (it lost its contract to deport refused migrants last year after one death and 773 complaints of abuse) to the home affairs select committee. Boris Johnson, mayor of London, has told us glibly this is a case of &quot;pre-curtain jitters&quot; before the &quot;very safe, very secure&quot; Games begin. He is almost certainly correct, but what was needed was not flippant Boris-lite but a strong ministerial reminder of the uplifting mission and potential long-term rewards of London 2012. Jeremy Hunt, the Olympics minister, has been in purdah since his appearance at the Leveson inquiry and David Cameron, perhaps wishing to distance himself from yet another potential shambles, has conspicuously failed to fill the political void. Well, at a time when the eyes of the world are on London, someone needs to. The prime minister could still rise to the occasion and give a clear explanation for the &quot;jitters&quot; and, as importantly, provide a spirited narrative about the world-class athleticism and human endeavour to come. He could pause to praise the admirable response of more than 70,000 volunteers (&quot;big society&quot;, anyone?) and the fortitude of the local East End community, disrupted for the past seven years. He could remind us that Britain has faultlessly delivered world-class stadiums on what was a toxic industrial wasteland. He could talk of the hope we all have that this redevelopment will help regenerate one of the poorest parts of Britain. Instead, what we have this weekend are reminders to the public of the cost of the Games and the potential vulnerability of the host city. Critics remain convinced that the London Olympics is worth its weight in gold, but only if you count the bounty that will accrue to the corporate sponsors \u2013 among them McDonald&apos;s and Coca-Cola, whose brazen appearance in the Olympic Park seems, at best, incongruous. The commercialisation of the Games is not of London&apos;s making \u2013 it&apos;s a pact that any bidding city signs up for. The IOC insists that the candidate cities must sign a contract, described as an &quot;epic masterpiece in micro-management&quot;. It stipulates IOC transportation in exclusive &quot;Zil&quot; traffic lanes in 500 air-conditioned chauffeured limousines and accommodation in 1,800 four- and five-star hotel rooms. It also demands that the Olympics are a tax-free haven so the 18 Olympic partners won&apos;t have to pay \u00a3600m tax on the \u00a32.5bn they are expected to harvest. What the contract does not do is confront the IOC&apos;s continued association with corruption. Last month, for example, 27 Olympic officials and agents were caught selling tickets for London 2012 on the black market. Critics also voice concerns that the public money invested in the monumental regeneration of the East End (75p in every \u00a31 spent by the Olympic development authority) will benefit the already affluent, with jobs going to outsiders and housing beyond the price of locals. In addition, although the Games are sited across Britain, many non-Londoners view them as a purely capital city bonanza. In a BBC poll last week, 74% said the rest of the UK would not benefit and 59% thought the taxpayer had footed too large a bill. Add to that cavalcade of criticism the daily thrum of unrelenting rain and the appalling neglect of school sports (a squandered Olympic legacy) and it might appear that there are very few reasons to be cheerful about London 2012. The Observer disagrees. Of course there are caveats, including profound concerns about security; the IOC&apos;s &quot;vanity&quot; modus operandi; excessive commercialisation and inequities such as highly restricted ticketing that has locked out many ordinary people. But, uncharacteristically in Britain, let&apos;s look at the upsides. The planning and execution of the London Olympics, delivering impressive transport connections, including the high-speed rail from King&apos;s Cross to Stratford. Completing infrastructure on time and \u00a31bn under the adjusted budget. And, most importantly, the longer-term, meticulously planned legacy transforming an area that has suffered decades of shameful neglect. All these add up to an achievement of which Britain has a right to be proud. And that is even before the Games commence, bringing with them a potential tally of medals accrued by our many young athletes, among them 15-year-old Rebecca Tunney, Tom Daley and Jessica Ennis. Over the past several months they have done so much to rebalance the almost wholly negative media coverage of youth. So, hopefully, we are on the threshold of a much needed 17-day holiday in optimism for Britain, an historic event that has its roots seven years ago in the quality of Britain&apos;s original bid and a promise &quot;to inspire a generation&quot;. In Singapore, in 2005, Team GB included 30 children from London&apos;s East End; David Beckham, Ken Livingstone, then mayor of London, and a typically crowd-pleasing performance from Tony Blair. London stole victory from the favourite, Paris, by only four votes. Lord Coe, two times gold medal winner, said he had won &quot;the biggest prize in sport&quot;. Tessa Jowell, then minister for culture, media and sport, deserves credit as the godmother of London 2012. Against almost total cabinet opposition, and the professional judgment of economists she hired to conduct a feasibility study, Jowell persevered, allied with Ken Livingstone. Both believed that the Olympics could deliver to the highly deprived boroughs of Newham, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Hackney, Greenwich and Barking and Dagenham, &quot;60 years of regeneration in six&quot;. The 200-hectare site designated as the Olympic Park had the equivalent of 10 football pitches of Japanese knotweed; acres of fly-tipping; landfill and contaminated soil. The Queen visited in 2005 and viewed a mini-mountain of discarded fridges where the Velodrome is now sited. It is telling that while G4S has been handed bags full of public money without apparent scrutiny, targets or penalties, in contrast the Olympic development authority (ODA) has been transparent on goals, challenges and delivery. In the process it has created local jobs, training and apprenticeships. Contracts have also been spread across the UK. Every public pound has worked hard trying to retain a senior partnership with private investment. While new techniques have been pioneered, from burying pylons to washing 2m tons of toxic soil to recycling and design, this is a remarkable story that has yet to be fully told. At London 2012, for the first time in Olympic history, the legacy plans were initiated three years before the Games began. That is a powerful blueprint for future Games. Could more have been done for the East End community? Undoubtedly, but there are the next 30 years to make that good. The Observer would like to see an independent watchdog with clout established to ensure that this is the case. &quot;Convergence&quot; is a plan to improve a range of issues in the six boroughs \u2013 for instance, in education, employment, poverty and health \u2013 and bring standards up to the level of the rest of London. In July next year the Olympic site will reopen as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Six of the eight permanent venues are secure. The stadium goes out to tender again in the autumn; on Tuesday, it is likely that its agreed the press and broadcast centre will become home to iCity, a digital university, enterprise hub, broadcaster and provider of the first digital apprenticeship scheme. Effort has been made in regeneration to treasure the past, not ensure its obliteration. Over the next three decades, 11,000 new homes (35% &quot;affordable&quot; housing) will be built. Homes, not high-rise apartments. Homes with gardens built into a new living community in the Park. All of these are reasons to cheer. Twelve days hence we shall judge whether the imaginative appointments of Danny Boyle and Stephen Daldry will produce a multimillion pound opening ceremony that sets a benchmark for creativity. London 2012 has already proved that, for a tiny island with a population of 60 million or so, we are far from slow off the blocks. Last week the ODA published its final report. In The Finishing Straight, Sir John Armitt wrote: &quot;At every turn since 2005, the UK has proved that it can compete with the best, win, deliver and do what is promised.&quot; Let the Games begin."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/15/london-2012-lord-coe-david-beckham", "sentences": ["&quot;He was there with us in Singapore and he&apos;s devoted a lot of time to helping us, so he&apos;ll always be a part of the team."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-15T14:06:08Z", "title": "London 2012: Lord Coe disappointed by David Beckham's Team GB omission", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "David Beckham", "Lord Coe", "Olympics 2012: football", "Stuart Pearce", "Team GB", "Football", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe, has said he was disappointed by Stuart Pearce&apos;s decision not to include David Beckham in the Team GB men&apos;s Olympic football team. Beckham was widely expected to be picked for this summer&apos;s tournament, but Pearce dashed his hopes by selecting Craig Bellamy, Ryan Giggs and Micah Richards as his three over-23 players instead. Coe&apos;s comments hinted at Pearce going off-message by overlooking Beckham, although he said he respected the coach&apos;s right to make decisions without outside interference and also confirmed that the former England captain would still have a part to play at the Games. &quot;Personally I would have loved to have seen him in the football team, but I&apos;m not the coach and you always have to accept the decision that coaches and selectors make,&quot; Coe said on BBC&apos;s Sportsweek programme. &quot;They&apos;re horrible decisions to have to make. From a football fan, of course I&apos;d loved to have seen him there.&quot; When the squad announcement was made last month, Pearce defended omitting Beckham, insisting he picked his 18 man squad for &quot;football reasons&quot; and not based on sentimentality, personality or potential ticket sales, although Beckham demonstrated that he arguably still has something to offer with two classy goals in LA Galaxy&apos;s 5-3 win over Portland Timbers on Saturday night. Beckham&apos;s first goal was a fine curling effort from 35 yards out, before he added to that strike with a trademark free-kick. Coe remains keen to find Beckham a role at the Games, pointing out that he deserves recognition for helping to bring the Olympics to London. However Coe gave another indication that the 37-year-old&apos;s omission from the football squad had taken him and the British Olympic Association by surprise by admitting that with less than a fortnight left until the start of the Olympics, he remains unsure of how Beckham will be involved. &quot;He&apos;s always been a part of our team and he was with us when we poked our heads above the parapet and said this was a good idea, he was there when we handed the documentation over,&quot; said Coe. &quot;He was there with us in Singapore and he&apos;s devoted a lot of time to helping us, so he&apos;ll always be a part of the team. &quot;We&apos;re still looking at what he might be involved with and clearly a lot of David&apos;s plans changed anyway once he heard he wasn&apos;t in the final squad, so he will be with us at the Games and we&apos;re still working through that.

Can you identify this bird&apos;s taxonomic family and species?  Response: This is a stork-billed kingfisher, Pelargopsis capensis, one of three very large Asian tree kingfishers that were recently removed from the genus Halcyon into Pelargopsis (family: Halcyonidae). This is the largest kingfisher species in Singapore.  Although a kingfisher, this species is not a fish specialist. Instead, it primarily hunts small mammals (mostly rodents) and birds.  Like most other kingfishers, the stork-billed kingfisher is residential and territorial, lives near water, is a sit-and-wait predator and excavates its nest cavity in a river bank (although a rotting tree or termite mound may instead be used). These birds are easily overlooked.  Stork-billed kingfishers have green upperparts, blue wings and tail, and a brown head and nape. It has rufous underparts with small and distinctively bright red legs and feet, orangish-red irides and a large and distinctive coral-red bill with a black tip. Genders look alike, although the female&apos;s bill may be noticeably heavier than her mate&apos;s.  .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..

Like the competitors, their utterances are peppered with talk of dream results, golden opportunities, and a once-in-a-lifetime event. But unlike the athletes, they will not know just how well they fared at the London Olympics until long after the last races have been run. Dan Ritterband, director of marketing and 2012 communications for the London mayor, Boris Johnson, is blunt in his analysis of the opportunity the Games provides to showcase London to tourists, businesses, investors and students: &quot;It doesn&apos;t get bigger than this,&quot; he says. The only problem \u2013 or challenge, as PR people tend to prefer \u2013 is how to market a vast and rarely homogenous city to hundreds of different and demanding overseas clients. With Cool Britannia a distant memory and the financial sector struggling to shake off its ugly reputation, do you sell the capital on its traditional merits \u2013 a comforting convergence of Harrods, history, and fish and chips \u2013 or on its forward-looking credentials, as a city of tech entrepreneurship, cutting-edge fashion and sushi? &quot;I&apos;m an adman by training and so the London brand has always been a concern,&quot; says Ritterband. &quot;Within a couple of months of us winning the [mayoral] election in 2008, the whole market collapsed and in the research we did, the world blamed Wall Street and the City. Our reputation as the home of financial services was seriously tarnished.&quot; With the Games just four years off, Johnson convened a panel of 30 experts from different businesses to advise him on branding. As well as recommending that the capital&apos;s promotional bodies \u2013 Think London, Study London and Visit London \u2013 become a single entity, London and Partners, the panel stressed the importance of creating a brand for the city. The challenge, however, lay in defining and translating London&apos;s peculiar metropolitan DNA. &quot;London is about the juxtaposition; it&apos;s the old with the new; it&apos;s a conceit. The whole city is a city of contradictions,&quot; says Ritterband. &quot;London is all about its people and its businesses; it&apos;s not about the mayoralty or the states of public office. It&apos;s about the West End theatres along with the East End cool trendies. It is about the financial institutions as it is about the startup tech sectors in the east.&quot; Asked to sum up London in a single phrase, Ritterband opts for one of his boss&apos;s lines: &quot;A cacophony of noise.&quot; But\u00a0when it comes to the mayor&apos;s economic post-Olympic aspirations, Ritterband is more forthcoming. Although a Visa report has suggested the Games will see an incremental \u00a3750m spent in London during the competition \u2013 and Ritterband insists he can see the day when Parisians come to Stratford for shopping trips \u2013 much of the marketing focus is on bringing big business events such as congresses and conventions into London. &quot;Business travellers spend three times as much as leisure travellers,&quot; he says. &quot;We love our 55-year-old north Americans coming round and saying, &apos;Hey, honey, isn&apos;t this sweet?&apos;, [but] we&apos;d much rather the 55-year-old American gynaecologist coming with 10,000 colleagues, who spend considerably more and get around the city more.&quot; London and Partners has developed its own strategy for pushing the city. The 6,000 non-Olympic-accredited foreign journalists who will be based in the central London media centre will find themselves immersed in a seven-week bootcamp. &quot;It&apos;s a 50-day content programme, with over 500 events across a multiplicity of different categories from business to culture, education, fashion, through drink, film, history, heritage; you name it,&quot; says Martine Ainsworth-Wells, director of marketing and communications at London and Partners. &quot;It will expose media to a part of London or a sector of London that they&apos;re not familiar with, which is hopefully, exciting, insightful, interesting and engaging.&quot; If all goes according to plan, those journalists will file dispatches singing the praises of a multi-faceted capital, encouraging many who watched London 2012 to make the trip for themselves. London and Partners hopes its efforts will result in an extra 1.1 million visitors over the next five years, contributing around \u00a3650m to the capital. Despite the emphasis on Silicon Roundabout, avant garde fashion and the \u00a36bn spent regenerating east London, the government-funded tourism agency stresses that London&apos;s past still has a vital role to play in the city&apos;s future development. &quot;Let&apos;s remember that people do want to come here to see the heritage and the pageantry because that perhaps is something that they can&apos;t get anywhere else,&quot; says Sandie Dawe, chief executive of VisitBritain. &quot;You can shop in Dubai and you can shop in Singapore; you can shop anywhere. Yes, the shopping on offer in London is amazing but you can&apos;t see the changing of the guard anywhere else. We&apos;re not embarrassed about that.&quot; As far as Dawe is concerned, the perfect image of the city is one that unites London old and London new: the tower of Big Ben framed by the huge white circle of the London Eye. Such juxtapositions are the order of the day for the duration of the Games. Londoners and visitors can expect to see circuses appearing in unusual parts of town, along with ballet in lidos, poetry readings in gothic cemeteries and orchestras on the capital&apos;s waterways. These are the kind of events that Ritterband feels best sum up London. Trying to explain the capital&apos;s nature and appeal in a single image or slogan, he says, is difficult and, probably, wrong. He remembers some journalists describing the rebranding of London as an attempt to find London&apos;s Big Apple. &quot;That was never the intention,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s when people need to come up with a marque that represents everything about their city; ours is personality driven. It&apos;s the quirky bit at the heart of it. We are absolutely made up of our people: people go to New York to become a New Yorker; people come here to be themselves. Anything can blossom in London and everything is encouraged in London.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/17/london-2012-home-team-hua-jiang", "sentences": ["&quot;In fact I suppose I was becoming more and more interested the very moment that London won the 2012 bid in Singapore in 2005."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-17T09:47:37Z", "title": "Hua Jiang: If I get to see Michael Phelps I will be very happy", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "For Hua Jiang, being an Olympics volunteer at the Aquatic Centre will be in its own way a case of taking the plunge. Hua, who works in a central London travel agency, has never done anything like it before. Her annual holidays are usually a trip to Tianjin, a city 70 miles south-east of Beijing. This summer she has signed up for Stratford, London E15. Early starts \u2013 some duties begin at 6.15am \u2013 are not enticing, but everything else is. &quot;Everyone says the Aquatic Centre is the most beautiful venue at the London Games,&quot; says Hua. &quot;I think it will be second only to the Olympic Stadium in attracting the most attention. &quot;I&apos;m not a fan of celebrity culture but if I get to see Michael Phelps [winner of eight gold medals in Beijing] I will be very happy. Also, the diver Tom Daley.&quot; Hua adds with a grin: &quot;The Chinese have some very good divers too \u2013 they&apos;re known as the Dream Team. &quot;I was so pleased to be allocated to the Aquatic Centre. The wave-shaped roof is really beautiful. But people will be astonished by the inside, how big it is; the spectators have a brilliant view. It&apos;s a shame that I haven&apos;t had a chance to see the Water Cube which was the swimming venue in Beijing. I&apos;d like to compare them.&quot; Her fluency in Mandarin and English will be useful with China competitors and visitors \u2013 something the Olympic organisers are no doubt aware of. The Games will be hard work for all the volunteers. Some shifts will last six hours \u2013 others around 10 \u2013 and all unpaid, of course. Hua has attended three days&apos; of training on Saturdays. &quot;I&apos;ve been given my uniform, a T-shirt, jacket, trousers and trainers, plus a travel card for the Olympics, a watch, and an umbrella \u2013 a red umbrella,&quot; she says. &quot;Of course, I don&apos;t know exactly what to expect \u2013 except that it will be hard work \u2013 but I have no complaints and I&apos;ve spent the last six months looking forward to this.&quot; Hua has been encouraged along the way by her employers and staff at China Holidays Ltd. &quot;I&apos;m very grateful for that. Somehow, I feel there is this connection and that I&apos;m part of the Olympic family.&quot; What stirred her enthusiasm? She watches big football games, and rugby union internationals, but is not a sporty person. It was probably the opening ceremony at the 2008 Beijing Games. She bought a DVD of the ceremony and has watched in several times. &quot;It was so spectacular. On such a big scale. I was so impressed. &quot;In fact, I had considered volunteering for Beijing 2008, and going back there for my holidays, but there may have been accommodation problems for me in Beijing, so I dropped the idea. &quot;In fact I suppose I was becoming more and more interested the very moment that London won the 2012 bid in Singapore in 2005. I was cheering for London back then, but I would never imagined I would be in the Aquatic Centre as a volunteer. Working in a travel company, all I thought was that Britain has been handed a huge opportunity. &quot;When the volunteering chance came round for London I registered as soon as they started recruiting. I waited a long time to hear back. I knew someone else who got their invitation to an interview quite quickly but it was several months before I got mine. I had my interview in February and received the offer in early March. It was all starting up, I was pleased. &quot;Some people are saying it will be excellent experience for us volunteers, gaining experience of how big events are organised and run. That&apos;s true but my main thought is that it&apos;s great to know I&apos;ll be part of it all. And one thing I want to do after all this is to learn to swim. It&apos;s something I&apos;ve never really tried hard to do. If I don&apos;t after working at the Aquatic Centre, I never will. &quot;I attended venue training recently. Since then, I&apos;ve been to training at Hackney Community College, who taught us some of the skills and knowledge I will need to carry out my duties. There was also a workbook for us to get familiar with all aspects of the Games.

The research, compiled by Labour through Freedom of Information requests to 150 top tier local authorities, shows there are now 110 fewer School Sport Partnerships \u2013 local networks of organised school sport \u2013 than there were before the cuts in 2009/10, a decline of 37%. Almost half of local authorities (48%) recorded a decrease in the number of School Sport Partnerships, while 28% no longer have any. &quot;When we won the Games we made a promise to the people of this country and the international community to inspire a generation of young people through sport,&quot; said Tessa Jowell, the shadow minister for the Olympics who sits on the London 2012 board. &quot;It is important that schools are able to maintain this momentum and help young people develop sport and exercise as a habit that will keep them healthy and fit for the rest of their lives. It is not yet too late for the government to keep the promise that we made and make the most of this Olympic moment.&quot; In 2010 the education secretary, Michael Gove, threatened to axe \u00a3162m in ringfenced funding for a national network of School Sports Partnerships. In the wake of an outcry from athletes, pupils and opposition MPs, David Cameron ordered a partial U-turn, but the ringfenced funding was still cut by 69% and only guaranteed until 2013. It was redirected to a new scheme allowing PE teachers to be released for one day a week. Those working within the system fear that the funding will be withdrawn altogether next year. The culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has instead sought to focus attention on the School Games, a nationwide intra and inter school competition that proceeds through four levels to an annual final in the Olympic Park. So far, around half of all schools have signed up. His department has introduced a new policy to focus \u00a31bn invested over five years through grassroots funding body Sport England on 14- to 25-year-olds in a bid to address the precipitous drop off in sports participation when pupils leave school. But there are fears that the impact of the cuts on organised school sport, and on the provision of sport in primary schools, will impact on the amount of sport played by children even before they can benefit from the after-school clubs and better links between schools and clubs promised by the new strategy. Chris Dunne, the headmaster at Langdon School in east London, which provided some of the children who travelled to Singapore in 2005 when the bid was won, has been highly critical of the decision to slash funding for the school sport partnerships. &quot;The prime minister and his secretary of state for education, who both regularly lambast state schools for not doing as well as the independent sector in nurturing talent, when it is in fact they who have destroyed the work we were doing to promote a renaissance in sporting achievement, are in my opinion little better than privately-educated hypocrites,&quot; said Dunne, who said the network had helped increase the number of boys at the school playing first class critic from zero to 55 and nurtured the creation of four judo clubs. According to the FOI responses, in every region of England the number of days worked by PE teachers on release compared with the school sport co-ordinators employed under the old system has more than halved. The worst affected regions are the West Midlands, where there was a 74% decline, the north-east, which decreased by 72%, and Greater London, which declined by 67%. Clive Efford, the shadow sports minister, said Labour had succeeded in getting over 90% of children participating in two hours of school sport a week under the school sport partnerships network. &quot;They were the foundation for a national sports strategy that we should be building on,&quot; he said. &quot;It is incredible that David Cameron can complain that too many of our top sports people come from private schools when he is damaging the structure of sport in our state education system.&quot; The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, who on Tuesday said the budget for a grassroots sports initiative called Inspired Facilities had already distributed \u00a319.4m in lottery money to 377 community projects and revealed the overall budget available had doubled to \u00a330m, argues that it is only under the coalition government that PE had become a mandatory subject. &quot;You can&apos;t divorce this project from the fact we are trying to deliver it in the middle of a global recession, and that is what led to the issue with School Sport Partnerships. All we can do is play the best hand we&apos;ve got with the card that has been dealt to us,&quot; he said. &quot;I do think we get a lot of stick for cutting School Sport Partnerships and very little praise for increasing the amount sport gets through the lottery, which has safeguarded elite athlete investment, made this sort of thing possible and allowed us to continue with the Whole Sport Plan.&quot; The Lords science committee also warned in a report published on Wednesday that not enough was being done to improve the nation&apos;s health on the back of the Games. It expressed &quot;disappointment at the lack of joined-up thinking in government&quot; on the potential health legacy from the Games and found that a recent survey of 48 London GP practices showed none were aware of the chief medical officer&apos;s most recent physical activity guidelines. &quot;Government is failing to act in a consistent way to ensure that the Olympics help us tackle one of our greatest health threats, sedentary lifestyles,&quot; said Lord Krebs, chairman of the Lords Science and Technology Committee. &quot;The government must take a joined-up approach to sport, physical activity and health to ensure the Olympics deliver a lasting health legacy.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/jul/18/music-alliance-pact-july", "sentences": ["Klose)Exciting times are looming in the urban jungle of Singapore as audio-visual super-collective Syndicate turns up the heat, dropping influential honcho Kiat&apos;s new album like an A-bomb of intricate beats and samples that warp you into the inner workings of string theory.", "Featuring stellar collaborations with artists such as Vandetta, Klose, Digital and Isaac Aiesili, the album - titled The Inner Galaxy - decisively proclaims that electronic music from Singapore has come of age and is a force to be reckoned with."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-18T09:17:04Z", "title": "July's best music from across the MAP", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Culture"], "article": "Right-click on the song title to download an MP3, or grab a zip file of the whole 37-track compilation through Ge.tt here.  ARGENTINA: ZonaindieLos Coming Soon - No WayThis is one of our favorite releases from 2012. We Are Family is Los Coming Soon&apos;s first album, in which they deploy 10 great songs filled with electronic textures and a soft, minimalist funky-disco base, all played with real instruments (no programming whatsoever). It was hard to pick one song for MAP, but we think No Way is representative of the whole record (you can buy it here).  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Runner - FlawsFlaws is an understated instrumental track that drives the emotive dream-pop at the heart of Runner. These guys originate from the west coast of Australia but their sound would sit perfectly with any shoegaze stoner melody coming out of 90s Melbourne. Flaws builds beautifully to a crescendo layered with harmony and a wall of hazy guitars.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigOgris Debris - Sexy ChairThis electronic duo is best known for their onomatopoetic track Miezekatze, a club and radio hit in 2010. Mixing such diverse genres as house, funk and soul, the tongue-in-cheek track Sexy Chair is taken from the Affine Records compilation What A Fine Mess We Made. The most recent Ogris Debris release, The Way feat. Ken Hayakawa (listen on Soundcloud), has a more Arabesque vibe to it.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoBNeg\u00e3o &amp; Seletores de Frequ\u00eancia - Essa \u00e9 Pra Tocar No BaileIt took almost 10 years for BNeg\u00e3o &amp; Seletores de Frequ\u00eancia to release their second album, but now their music is even more influenced by black music and rhythms such as Afrobeat, soul and samba rock. Essa \u00e9 Pra Tocar No Baile is one of the breakthrough tracks of the record.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsDigits - Where Do You Belong?My heart melts every time I hear Alt Altman - the one-man techno R&amp;B band known as Digits - purr: &quot;It&apos;s just a broken heart/but you ain&apos;t had a broken heart/like this,&quot; on Where Do You Belong? A song this catchy and infectious should come with warning labels: &quot;May induce repeated listens and become lodged in your head for weeks at a time.&quot;  CHILE: Super 45La Big Rabia - Nos Gusta Que Sea As\u00edMusic abounds during times of crisis, and La Big Rabia is one of the symptoms of this social unrest we are living with in Chile. Their EP, La Bestia, and their shows begin with a disruptive speech made through a loudspeaker by singer Sebasti\u00e1n Orellana, a sort of tired and furious crooner. After this, a retro rock disposition is unleashed on songs like Para Todos Los Hijos De Puta, with its chorus: &quot;Todos contra los poderosos / Todos contra los que tengan sed de poder&quot; (&quot;Everybody against the powerful ones / Everybody against those thirsty for power&quot;). &lt;img src=&quot;http://i402.photobucket.com/albums/pp104/thepopcop/china.gif&quot; /&gt; CHINA: WooozyGlow Curve - Brain WasherGlow Curve formed in Beijing in 2011 and are influenced by post-rock and electronic music. The quartet absorb and explore new elements to blend complex instrumental sounds from contrasting emotions - manic or quiet, warm or cold.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloZalama Crew - No Hay Marcha Atr\u00e1sZalama Crew is a collective based in Cali, a city very close to the Colombian Pacific coast. An excellent example of what is happening in these lands, their project mixes hip-hop, urban and world music. No Hay Marcha Atr\u00e1s (&quot;There&apos;s No Turning Back&quot;) is taken from their first album Zalama Lekum, which fuses African rhythm with electronic sounds.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianK\u00fara - AnchorWith the amazing vocal of Fanney \u00d3sk \u00de\u00f3risd\u00f3ttir as a general highlight, Danish/Icelandic trio K\u00fara&apos;s debut Halfway To The Moon is a dark, melancholic and rather enticing affair mixing electronica, trip hop, dub and (indie) rock. Here&apos;s single Anchor, co-produced by acclaimed DJ and producer Buda (Lulu Rouge) and accompanied by this beautiful video by Kristian Touborg and Jesper Dalgaard.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogJosephine - Pray That I MoveManchester&apos;s Josephine Oniyama is not another soul girl, even though some early breathless accounts of her work and voice are of the &quot;you won&apos;t believe this isn&apos;t a classic lost R&amp;B or blues recording&quot; variety. Actually, as Pray That I Move shows, Josephine&apos;s vocal delivery and idiosyncratic lyrical vision have more in common with Morrissey than Mahalia Jackson. She&apos;s already made a big stir on the regional scene with Elbow&apos;s Guy Garvey and singer-songwriter Ed Harcourt among her champions. Her debut album, Portrait, is out on October 8.  FINLAND: GlueMinttu &amp; Olli - Corduroy BoyMinttu &amp; Olli are a graceful couple homebrewing sweet pop songs. With great vocal harmonies, a gentle folky spirit and smooth melodica sounds, the duo is a Nordic version of She &amp; Him that could have easily been featured in the soundtrack of (500) Days of Summer.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredThe Lemon Queen - Sailing In A Wild LoveThe Lemon Queen hails from Angers, east of France, where the music scene is flourishing at the moment, with everyone trying to play their cards right. The band makes a difference with their psychedelic pop-rock sound, reminiscent of Klaxons, a comparison particularly true on Sailing In A Wild Love. With catchy melodies and an undeniable energy, this quartet should be followed very closely.  GERMANY: BlogparteiSandy Bird - RevokeLittle is known about this band from Berlin which formed in 2008 and have already experienced some member changes. Revoke is taken from their Bambaloo EP. Expect to hear more of this promising post-rock act soon.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaElectric Litany - Sad PartBleak and broody music has never been quite so thrilling. Sad Part is an elaborately orchestrated, inherently dark, minimalist, piano dirge, like a sad dream scented with rain, with searingly compelling lyrical imagery, eerie vocals full of intuitive swells and fades, pauses that embrace some of the pious silence of a prayer and tremolo guitars that do an excellent job of creating a beguiling atmosphere. Electric Litany&apos;s highly anticipated sophomore album is set to be released later this year.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minn\u00datid\u00far - Grasping For AirThis latest track from the ambitious chamber-pop 10-piece sees them entering almost disco-like realms. A new album should see the light of day in the coming months but those who want to get to know this joyous collective better should check out the band&apos;s 2010 debut album This Mess We&apos;ve Made.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarMarcel Thee - Endless HeartAfter more than 10 years channeling his creativity with the indie-rock band Sajama Cut, Marcel Thee is now the only original member left. Here he pursues his passion for lo-fi, layered sounds, gospel music and poetry. If you love W.B. Yeats, the album is a tribute to him.  IRELAND: Nialler9No Spill Blood - Good CompanyFormed from members of Adebisi Shank, Elk, Magic Pockets and Hands Up Who Wants To Die, No Spill Blood&apos;s first EP is released this month on Sargent House, home to Fang Island, Omar Rodriguez Lopez and Les Butcherettes. If you&apos;re familiar with any of the bands mentioned then it won&apos;t surprise you to hear that No Spill Blood play it fast and furious, running on the noxious interplay between drums, effect-laden synth, low-end bass fuzz and bellowed vocals.  ITALY: PolaroidCosmetic - La Fine Del GiornoCosmetic may sing in Italian but I&apos;m sure their songs will speak to you anyway. Their rough and nervous shoegaze sound often drifts towards more muscular music as it makes way for an explosion of guitars. When I saw them live the first name that came to my mind was Dinosaur Jr. The motto on their Facebook page - &quot;Noise and melodies that fight to get the better of each other&quot; - pretty much sums up Cosmetic.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesCuushe - I Dreamt About SilenceTokyo artist Cuushe last brought out an album three years ago, and it turns out she spent the stretch of time after it was released building her own world. I Dreamt About Silence sees her stretched-out vocals covered in hazy synths, every sound wrapping around one another to create a glowing track you want to be enveloped by. Cuushe shows the best way to escape the rush of the modern world is to construct your own dreamy universe.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaBark Bark Disco - Let&apos;s Do ThisBark Bark Disco is a lo-fi pop band fronted by former inventor Morris Woodcock (great-grandson of Manfred von Richthofen aka The Red Baron). Their songs have a raw immediacy with catchiness befitting a Broadway musical. Let&apos;s Do This is from their latest EP of the same name.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaSonido Gallo Negro - LeticiaChicha is a psychedelic mixture of cumbia with rock &apos;n&apos; roll elements, originating in Peru during the 70s. Mexico City&apos;s Sonido Gallo Negro have unearthed the genre and hybridized it with local surf and rockabilly. Supplemented by the spooky visuals of design wizard Dr Alderete, their live shows are an intoxicating display of collective hypnosis. Throughout July 2012, this song and 13 more will be available for free download from Red Bull Panam\u00e9rika as part of our fourth birthday compilation.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!EARTH CONTROL - Mijn Nieuwe SteekkarArt-school punks Bert and Marcel met at Groningen&apos;s local venue Vera. Every week they formed a brand new band, recorded an album and played one show. But with EARTH CONTROL, things didn&apos;t go exactly as planned; the duo decided to continue under this capitalized moniker. Though barely audible due to their lo-fi production and sub-par electronic equipment, EARTH CONTROL sing in their native Dutch tongue. Their sardonic lyrics deal with everyday subjects such as cell phones, sweaters or, in this case, the online purchase of a new trolley.  PERU: SoTBGrita Lobos - Mr DangerGrita Lobos is a musician who hides behind an Ethiopian mask, his sound influenced by New Order and Depeche Mode in mesmerizing electronic songs that suggest dark stories. Mr Danger is taken from his debut self-titled album which features vocals from actress and singer Anah\u00ed de C\u00e1rdenas.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Micro Audio Waves - Cartoon RealMicro Audio Waves, who made history in 2004 by becoming the first Portuguese band to have a John Peel session, have released four albums and a fifth is due soon. Cartoon Real is a MAP exclusive free download, taken from their Zoetrope concept album, developed with choreographer Rui Horta and released with a DVD featuring one of their unique multimedia and performance live shows.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieEl Medio - Hasta CaerEl Medio is the solo project of Leonardo Balasques (Oscilador 4, Bal\u00fan). Since 2004, Balasques has used this outlet to release very personal songs about life, friendships and love. Using his bedroom (and subsequently his living room) as a recording studio, Leo has crafted an expansive discography that experiments with the confrontation of synths and traditional instruments to create a folk/pop hybrid that warms the heart and stimulates the brain. El Medio has just released the album No Le Tengas Miedo Al Amor, on which you&apos;ll find Hasta Caer, featuring strings by Bal\u00fan&apos;s Ang\u00e9lica Negr\u00f3n and an unexpected, yet much welcomed, dose of blistering guitar noise and distortion.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseSubcarpa\u021bi - Underground FolclorSubcarpa\u021bi is an explosive mixture of old and new. It&apos;s an eclectic combination that brings together melancholy Romanian folk songs, Romanian unity songs, traditional instruments and the rhythms of trip-hop, dubstep, hip-hop and dancehall.  RUSSIA: Big EchoLomovolokno - 22On this short preview from his upcoming album, beatmaker Lomovolokno moves to the next level of romantic harmonies, leaving us excited for a full-length release. He is one of those people who needs time and space to make music, so you need to wait patiently. But when the tracks are finally out, there is nothing as beautiful to compare.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopHoly Esque - RoseThere&apos;s a tangible buzz about the Glasgow music scene right now and part of that has to do with the emergence of Holy Esque. There&apos;s a dark magic about their sound. The rasping, quivering vocals of Pat Hynes calls to mind The Undertones or Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, while the squalls of guitar elicit comparisons with Joy Division or Glasvegas. The anthemic Rose, a MAP exclusive free download, is taken from their excellent debut EP.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...Kiat - Riding Past Draco (feat. Klose)Exciting times are looming in the urban jungle of Singapore as audio-visual super-collective Syndicate turns up the heat, dropping influential honcho Kiat&apos;s new album like an A-bomb of intricate beats and samples that warp you into the inner workings of string theory. Featuring stellar collaborations with artists such as Vandetta, Klose, Digital and Isaac Aiesili, the album - titled The Inner Galaxy - decisively proclaims that electronic music from Singapore has come of age and is a force to be reckoned with. Evolution never happened this fast.  SOUTH AFRICA: Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Fire Through The Window - Hey!Meet Fire Through The Window. They have the ability to take a simple melody, add their very own quirky styling and turn it into something truly infectious and endearing, all while maintaining a fun pop sensibility. That is wholly true with their song Hey! - it is fun, funky and best shows off the band.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieWagwak - Arabian NightLoud indie-folk duo Wagwak have been around for a few years and made themselves a name at home. They recently left Korea to travel through Europe, playing gigs where they can, and having sung in English all along they&apos;re well prepared to bring their sound to an international audience. Before moving from their native Seoul, Wagwak released EP The Way To Drive Into The Arabian Sunset, opening with the slightly psychedelic Arabian Night.  SPAIN: MusikornerStand Up Against Heart Crime - I Can&apos;t Stand Myself SoberStand Up Against Heart Crime are five desolate souls whose lives have been touched by unease and unhappiness, five romantics who create the soundtrack of a loser who has grown up through the years. They are from Barcelona, and they have played in one of the most important festivals in Spain, S\u00f3nar. I Can&apos;t Stand Myself Sober is a pitiful fable of lack of self-esteem.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaHanna - LionessHanna is Gothenburg-based Hanna G\u00f6ransson, formerly known as Hanna Lovisa and one half of Cat5. As Hanna, she has teamed up with acclaimed Swedish producer Dan Lissvik (of Studio) and Canada&apos;s Young Galaxy to record her new EP Lioness, where feisty pop \u00e1 la a certain Robyn meets Lissvik&apos;s characteristic grooves. The Lioness EP is out now via Sunshower Records and a first full-length is in the works.  SWITZERLAND: 78sMarochine - Braunvieh ExpressMarochine is an instrumental band from Lucerne which alternates its style skilfully between jazz and noise to create beautiful soundscapes. They have released a four-song EP that can be downloaded for free on Bandcamp.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATSoaked - Groove OnSoaked is a synth-pop band based in Istanbul. They formed in 2003 but their first EP only came out in 2010. With the success of it they recorded the Aftermath album at the end of 2011. In their own words, they describe themselves as &quot;not only a musical ensemble but also a creative artistic platform, determined to provide the quality performance and art that Turkish audiences crave&quot;. It might sound pretty pretentious but it sure is true.  UNITED STATES: I Guess I&apos;m FloatingPoolside - Slow DownNew-to-the-scene DJ duo Poolside, from Los Angeles, couldn&apos;t have found a better way to jump into the public consciousness than funky superjam Slow Down. Sounding like a sublime mix of Sebastien Tellier and LCD Soundsystem, the track glows and shimmers in every way - and now it&apos;s perfectly positioned to dominate summer mixtapes across the world.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sTomates Fritos - Eterna SoledadTomates Fritos returns to the Music Alliance Pact after first appearing in July 2010. This time they have released their fourth studio album, Hotel Miramar (free to download on Bandcamp), in which they dare to show a &quot;purest&quot; side to the band - a slight departure from the folk sound that featured in previous records."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-mormonism", "sentences": ["&quot;Post-Americans&quot;, meanwhile, include the ranks of urbane elites, jetting between New York and London and Singapore between Face the Nation and late-night bites of sashimi.", "Their political outlook, personal affinities, and cultural tastes are often no more aligned with an American&apos;s than, say, a German&apos;s or a Singaporean&apos;s.

In No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, Mitt Romney writes: &quot;I am one of those who believes America is destined to remain, as it has been since the birth of the republic, the brightest hope of the world.&quot; A mouthpiece for unbridled national cheerleading, Romney&apos;s two books, No Apology and Believe in America, tell us that only a strong America can make the world safer and more prosperous. Living temporarily in St George, Utah, a wealthy, predominately Mormon community, I got to absorb Mormon thinking firsthand like soaking in the southwest sun. According to Mormon holy writ, the US constitution is inspired by Christian divinity, and God chose the US to play an exceptional role in human events. Or, &quot;Mormons sort of have an extra chromosome,&quot; when it comes to American exceptionalism, as US senator Mike Lee, Republican from Utah and a Mormon, puts it. Why, then, does Romney squirrel so much unspecified money abroad?The outrage crescendoing over Romney&apos;s overseas holdings dangerously misses a salient point. In conspiratorial default mode, his critics slam him for avoiding US taxes. But that is only half the problem. The totality of the problem is that Mitt Romney&apos;s tax dodging presents a double-dealing, self-serving vision of globalization exploited by elites at the average American&apos;s expense. So the question arises to Romney: are you an American exceptionalist or a bona fide globalist? The tens of millions of dollars Romney shelters from US taxes, from Ireland to Switzerland to Bermuda, likewise disguises an underexposed tension, that between &quot;American exceptionalism&quot; and &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot;, between what I call &quot;patriot-Americans&quot; and &quot;post-Americans&quot;. According to political lore, patriot-Americans keep the country humming. They occupy &quot;these wonderful little pockets of what I call the real America&quot;, as Sarah Palin gushed in North Carolina on the 2008 campaign trail, thanking the &quot;hard-working, very patriotic, very pro-America areas of this great nation&quot;. &quot;Post-Americans&quot;, meanwhile, include the ranks of urbane elites, jetting between New York and London and Singapore between Face the Nation and late-night bites of sashimi. They&apos;re post-national. They&apos;re post-American. Their political outlook, personal affinities, and cultural tastes are often no more aligned with an American&apos;s than, say, a German&apos;s or a Singaporean&apos;s. This doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re anti-American. It just means that they&apos;ve become citizens of the world and don&apos;t view themselves as having a primary allegiance or a sense of patriotic solidarity with their own countrymen. For patriot-Americans, there is a special bond and duty to their nation and its citizens first, before anything or anyone else. And for post-Americans, it&apos;s the reverse: how post-Americans value humans takes precedence over the national origin of those humans. And so, &quot;patriot-Americans&quot; view geographic borders as tangible markers carrying intrinsic, unshakable national value. But &quot;post-Americans&quot; view borders as awkward anachronisms that interfere with the flow of human, intellectual, and financial capital. Most Americans do not think of themselves as &quot;global citizens&quot;. Only 30% of Americans consider themselves &quot;more of a global citizen than an American citizen&quot;, while 47% of Hispanic Americans consider themselves &quot;more of a global citizen&quot;. And only 24% of white Americans consider themselves &quot;more of a global citizen than an American citizen&quot;, in an unpublished study by the GfK Roper Group in 2007 The patriot- and post-American worldviews skirmish ever more fiercely, as America winnows down two global wars and recalibrates itself after a triumphant American century. The tenet of Romney&apos;s foreign policy? &quot;An American Century&quot;. And so, Romney&apos;s tax dodging gives us a toxic whiplash of cosmopolitan business calculation amidst his jingoist proselytizing. All the anti-global rhetoric \u2013 &quot;securing America&apos;s borders&quot;, bashing the IMF, demeaning the UN \u2013\u00a0espoused in much of Romney&apos;s foreign policy positions and campaign personnel dissipates in his personal gain. If Romney supports undocumented global tax shelters, could he be persuaded to support a path to citizenship for undocumented workers? If he supports flexible tax havens, does he support flexible, unfettered trade, an open highway from Mexico through the US and up to Canada, commonly espoused as the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP), purporting greater co-operation and information sharing? Romney&apos;s offshore accounts demand that any reasonable person wonder: what does the Republican nominee really thinks about globalized labor, immigration reform, the transparency of international law, co-operative global efforts to combat climate change, and the viability of international institutions. Romney is two-stepping his American Exceptionalism with his offshore tax dodging. He lavishes commonsense, cosmopolitan practicality to his own enrichment, while subjecting the rest of us to a punishingly rigid worldview. Where would this leave us under a Romney presidency? Would we benefit from the data-crunching, pragmatism of the France-loving, French-speaking, urbane, globe-trotting, one-time management consultant? Or would we be subject to an ideologically-driven, double-standard positioning of a conservative, America-first elite? Romney&apos;s offshore tax shelters recall the antics of Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, who renounced his US citizenship and bailed to tax-free Singapore, just in time to save tens of millions of dollars from tax responsibility during the Facebook IPO. Scheming already to keep his cake and eat it too, Saverin contends his rebuke of America had no financial motivation.  &quot;This had nothing to do with taxes,&quot; Saverin told the New York Times. &quot;I was born in Brazil, I was an American citizen for about 10 years. I thought of myself as a global citizen.&quot; Well, good riddance. For the better part of that decade, working-class kids were spit out into the Middle East as cannon fodder, while this global tax dodger nests overseas. Romney&apos;s hypocrisy furthers the divide between an elite cosmopolitan class \u2013privately invested abroad and ambivalent over this country&apos;s public resources\u00a0\u2013 versus great swaths of this country, worried about opportunity on our shores. A cosmopolitan elite is abandoning wholesale a collective ethic and commitment to this country, its rules, and its citizens. This cosmopolitan elite can pursue its private self-interest, all the while espousing patriot sing-song, shifting the money and plying the knowhow to abandon US military service, public classrooms, Social Security, national parks, and all that matter. The latent fury over Romney&apos;s tax shelters is that his brand of elites are leveraging and exploiting globalization in ways that leave the rest of us high and dry.

Brit Military Visit May Hasten GPS Signal Patent Dispute Resolution &gt;&gt; Inside GNSS  The US visit of a high-level official from the British Ministry of Defense (MoD) is spurring efforts to settle a dispute over a patent that could drive up prices on satellite navigation receivers for users around the world.  Inside GNSS has learned that Peter Luff, UK Minister for Defense Equipment, Support, and Technology, will meet with U.S. State Department officials on Thursday (July 19, 2012) to discuss the efforts of the MoD&apos;s commercial arm to patent and charge royalties for use of the new common civil GNSS signal agreed on by Europe and the United States.

Pretty hard to look at this chart and argue that the iPhone is doing second-best to Android in the USA...  iPhone market share heavily depends on carrier subsidies &gt;&gt; Betanews From June:   Based on the outputs of our regression analysis, we see that the iPhone&apos;s market share is heavily dependent on carrier subsidies but, interestingly, does not depend on purchasing power in a given country. More than 70% of the variation in the iPhone&apos;s market share can be explained exclusively by carrier subsidies. This figure improves to more than 80% if we consider NPD&apos;s US market share figures, which not only proves the dependence of the iPhone&apos;s market share on carrier subsidies, but also that our model is fairly accurate. We have also been able to prove that carrier subsidies have no impact on the market share of Android smartphones.   So carrier subsidies boost the iPhone share in the US?

The airline signed up for the entire Office 365 solution after six months of complex negotiations.  iTnews has learned that due diligence work on the contract included two key tests: the first, a &quot;bake-off&quot; comparing Microsoft&apos;s online office productivity options against competing products from Google and, second, a comparative analysis of whether to lease the Office 365 package directly from Microsoft in Singapore or from a local service provided by incumbent desktop supplier Fujitsu.  Both exercises were used to drive a better price from Redmond-based Microsoft.   First it dumps BlackBerry for iPhone, and now this.

Commentary: Is Nexus 7 launch a blessing or a curse for other Android tablet vendors? &gt;&gt; Digitimes  With the exception of the iPads, all of tablets currently available in the market are running on Android platforms, which means that price competition within the Android segment will continue to intensify and that it will be more difficult for hardware brands to generate profits out of the production of Android tablets.  Google&apos;s strategy of setting the pricing of the Nexus 7 to a level close to the BOM clearly indicates that Google doesn&apos;t want to make money from hardware sales. But such a practice actually enacts a barrier that is hard for other hardware vendors to pursue.  The new price competition triggered by the Nexus 7 may enable Google to cut a small piece of market share enjoyed by Apple, but to a great extent, Google eventually will eat up the share held by other members in the Android club.  Hardware brands which have climbed on to the Android bandwagon might come out empty-handed, while seeing Google continue to enjoy profit growth due to expanded advertisement income generated through the increasing popularity of the Nexus 7.   And if you were a hardware brand in that position, your next move would be...? (Note: Digitimes content goes behind a paywall after a few days.)

Its wet, winding journey through the British isles (with a detour to Dublin) is a neat metaphor for the Games themselves: a great deal of heavy-handed organisation, corralling of crowds and cranking up of national pride, followed by a large, loud appearance from the sponsors \u2013 Coca-Cola&apos;s scarlet pantechnicon of free drink and dancing girls \u2013 and finally the unexpectedly moving appearance of an ordinary person, often chosen by friends and neighbours for service to the community, bearing the torch itself. Next Friday, the athletes, the people who really matter, at last take over from the organisers and the arguments, the blunders and the oversights. As long as it goes more or less to the plans seven hard years in the making, then until the Paralympics&apos; closing ceremony on 9\u00a0September, it will at last be not about the business of sport but sport itself. Winning an Olympic bid is about as far from the Olympic ideal as the Games themselves can sometimes seem. There was scant evidence of global good humour when London ambushed the favourites Paris in Singapore in 2005. But some ideals survive even the most destructive of launches. Labour, helped by Seb Coe, the indomitable athlete turned Tory politician and now Olympics chief, won the Games for London with a message about legacy and participation. The Lea Valley \u2013 the Olympic zone that cuts across some of London&apos;s poorest boroughs \u2013 was finally to get a taste of boomtown Britain. First would come the Games, then housing, work and, of course, unrivalled facilities. The news this week that the Olympic Park&apos;s media centre now looks certain to be taken over by iCity as a technology hub, with the promise of up to 5,000 jobs, is welcome evidence of the determination to fulfil the original promise, after rumours that it was to add to the generous provision of private (and some affordable) housing in the Olympic Park. Civic organisations and the local boroughs have fought to set ambitious targets for convergence, raising opportunities for Lea Valley residents to the level of those enjoyed by the rest of London. The lessons of other Olympic cities were studied: think Atlanta where a grim Games marred by a bombing in which one person died has left an admired community legacy, and not Athens, where almost the only useful remnant is a stretch of motorway. But no one has yet pulled off regeneration on the scale being attempted here. It is not enough that the Games, as one assessment predicts, actually generate a return greater than the \u00a39bn they are costing. The London Docklands tower over the planners as a warning of how good intentions go awry: a new overspill city from where the prosperous middle classes can travel elsewhere to work is not what they are after. It is harder to work out what the benchmarks by which the Lea Valley can be judged should be, but they will include employment, rising school standards and good, affordable housing. It might take a generation to achieve. By then local people should feel compensated for the missile launchers on their roofs and the lack of jobs on the construction sites. Meanwhile, London&apos;s groaning transport system may not cope and, however much Lord Coe insists that the Zil lanes are there simply to allow athletes to plan their warm-up routine to the second, it seems more plausible that they are really about guaranteeing members of the International Olympic Committee a smooth commute from their central London hotels. There is much about hosting the Olympics that chafes, and big questions to ask about how the IOC works and whether an organisation invented by a 19th-century romantic can escape being traduced by the hard-faced businessmen of the 21st. But not right now. Now it is time to sit back and relish the heady, exhilarating, unforgettable mix of triumph and disaster that is the Olympic Games."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/20/big-picture-flying-sachigusa-yasuda", "sentences": ["In the name of art, she hung out of top-floor windows and climbed on to roofs in cities across the world, from Singapore and Seoul to Hamburg."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-20T21:59:01Z", "title": "Big picture: Flying, by Sachigusa Yasuda", "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "Afraid of heights?

Steve Ovett and the Princess Royal, the president of the BOA, are understood to have had an enjoyable blunt-speaking competition during their conversation. The former bad boy of British athletics and chairman of the bid is asked afterwards what they had spoken about but Ovett, with furrowed brow and brooding countenance, puts his finger to his lips, refuses to speak, drops his shoulder and hares off on foot up Whitehall. At his next press conference, Ovett is surprisingly garrulous, especially about the 1976 Notting Hill riots and its long-term influence on the lyrics of Joe Strummer. Concerns that London&apos;s Burning may not be the best theme for the tourism drive and reports that Ovett has sent along his doppelganger Mick Jones are quickly quashed by the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. London, July 2007 As work begins on clearing contaminated soil from the site where the Olympic Stadium is scheduled to be built in Stratford, east London, criticism about the spiralling 2012 budget is dogging Sir Steve Ovett, chairman of Locog. A note, purported to be in Ovett&apos;s handwriting, has emerged in which he seems to propose that if people want to be &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; about it, events could take place on Brighton seafront and the sand dunes of Merthyr Mawr with vast savings for the taxpayer. London, 19 May 2010 At a ceremony to mark the unveiling of the London 2012 mascots, rumours persist that the original designs have been hastily shelved under the strict instructions of Sir Steve Ovett. &quot;Is it true,&quot; he is asked, &quot;that you saw some prototypes of the figures, said they looked like a cross between aliens and Teletubbies, and took charge of the project?&quot; He insists, however, that the two human-like cuddly toys in GB vests, one with a shock of black hair, the other with golden curls, have been fashioned to project the principle that these Games are &quot;for all&quot; and is sure &quot;Coe&quot; and &quot;Cram&quot; will be a hit. London, 15 January 2011 Ovett announces that tickets for the London 2012 Olympics will become available in April and outlines the application process. &quot;It&apos;s simple,&quot; he says. &quot;Schmoozing will get you nowhere. Anyone, including the corporates, wanting tickets will line up 1,500m from the ticket booth. At the sound of the gun they will race towards it and may I suggest the best strategy is hanging on the frontrunners&apos; shoulders for the first 1,300m then kicking for home. It&apos;s an even contest. If you&apos;re a winner you will get what you want. If you are a quitter you won&apos;t. Simple.&quot; London, June 2012 Details of the opening ceremony are announced and are rumoured to be shaped around the desire of Sir Steve to reflect the austere spirit of the times. The main spectacle will involve displays of athletic endeavour, over various distances from 800m to 1,500m, to inspire the youth and provide a legacy for the Games. Features include a Georgian pavilion, a Victorian pier and a new Elizabethan, mock mods v rockers battle and is so under budget plans are afoot to equip each member of the audience with a stick of rock. Ovett and out: supremo brings down curtain The London 2012 Olympics drew to a close today with the extinguishing of the flame and the handover to Rio 2016. Lord Ovett, who was elevated to the peerage last night, spoke of his joy that the Games had been such a success while costing so little to stage, and flashed a thumbs-up sign &quot;for the British public&quot; and a V-sign &quot;for the British press&quot;. &quot;We chose for the theme of these Games the motto &apos;Good enough&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve been good enough on the day. That&apos;s all that really matters.&quot; Introducing two of the acts, he says in a nod to his critics that they summed up his views: &quot;Who are you?&quot; and &quot;Take That&quot;.

The success of the bid was previously put down to a number of prominent people, including Ken Livingstone, Sebastian Coe and David Beckham, and Cherie Blair&apos;s role may come as a surprise to many. Tony Blair told Murnaghan on Sky: &quot;It was the strangest electorate that I have ever had to deal with, because it is just about 120 people. &quot;Strangely, my wife played a very big part in this really because, of the 120, some were the great and the good and were very well known, and then you had the others who worked in sports administration and they were also on the committee,&quot; he said. Blair said that his wife, known professionally as Cherie Booth, had travelled abroad to speak to some of the less well-known delegates to help secure their votes. London was officially declared the 2012 Games host on 6 July 2005. &quot;People tended to make a big fuss of all of the big names but everyone had the same vote. My wife was very good at going to different countries and seeing people who were the less significant people. By the time we got to Singapore, we actually knew these people, I met them and was talking to them,&quot; he said. Blair&apos;s comments came as Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, toured television studios to insist that the city was as prepared as any previous hosts five days before the start of the Olympic Games. He put negative headlines about security and concerns about transport and congestion down to collective last-minute nerves. On BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr show, he said: &quot;There have been concerns and some at G4S have much to answer for. &quot;If you look at what [IOC president] Jacques Rogge said last night, he thinks our city is as prepared as any city in the history of the Olympic Games and I think that&apos;s a great tribute to all of the people from Locog, the ODA and all the people behind it. &quot;What we are going through as a nation and a city is that pre-curtain-up moment of psychological self-depression before the excitement begins on Friday when the curtain goes up. It is only natural that people should be tense and expectant and there are loads of things we need to get right. &quot;The G4S staff, who by the way I think we should distinguish from the \u00a3800,000-a-year G4S bosses, are doing a fantastic job, they are working very well with the military and it looks great. Johnson called on PCS union members who voted to strike on Thursday, the day before the Games begin, to return to work. &quot;I don&apos;t think whatever they do it will disrupt our ability to get people safely through to wherever they need to go. I think that if you look at the numbers who voted for a strike its a very poorly supported strike and that we have the contingencies in place to ensure that the Games carry on,&quot; he said. He also claimed that the Games would be very good for Britain&apos;s economy. &quot;This is a gigantic schmoozathon. I defy those who say that this will not be good for Britain&apos;s economy,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/22/sebastian-coe-olympics-2012", "sentences": ["&quot;Nobody in our organisation was sitting there thinking the final runup to the Games wouldn&apos;t be testing and that when planning collided with reality there wouldn&apos;t be fragilities.&quot; Which is just as well, because the seven-year project has been marked by soaring highs and crushing lows \u2013 a pattern set early when an inspiring bid victory in Singapore was followed a day later by the 7/7 bombings in London."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-22T13:44:57Z", "title": "London 2012: Coe eyes Olympics glory for Britain", "tags": ["Lord Coe", "Olympic Games 2012", "London", "Sport", "UK news", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Lord Coe, the man umbilically linked with a London Olympics that will begin in just five days&apos; time, insists he is not losing any sleep despite a string of last-minute problems. As the clock in Trafalgar Square ticking down to the opening ceremony inches towards zero, he says he lives by the maxim of a Tory prime minister from the early part of the last century. &quot;I do slightly take the Arthur Balfour view of the world that few things matter very much and most things don&apos;t actually matter at all. Somewhere in between you always find the right balance,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody in our organisation was sitting there thinking the final runup to the Games wouldn&apos;t be testing and that when planning collided with reality there wouldn&apos;t be fragilities.&quot; Which is just as well, because the seven-year project has been marked by soaring highs and crushing lows \u2013 a pattern set early when an inspiring bid victory in Singapore was followed a day later by the 7/7 bombings in London. The last week or so, with the Olympic Park finally open to the world&apos;s media, athletes and officials, who began streaming into soggy Heathrow, has represented one of the most testing periods of all. Questions were asked in the House of Commons and the troops called in following the admission by the security firm G4S that it could not provide its share of 23,700 guards within Olympic venues. Coe, a gold medallist in 1980 and 1984, is clear where culpability lies \u2013 and it&apos;s not with his organising committee. He insists there is no correlation between the decision to increase the number of guards within venues from 10,000 to 23,700 \u2013 necessitating a fivefold increase in G4S guards \u2013 last December and the recent scramble to fill security rosters. &quot;This company is four times bigger than any other security company in the world. We were assured they could do what they were being asked to do when we made the final assessment of security needs once we knew the sessions and the venues,&quot; he says. With all parties keen to draw a line and move on, Coe stresses that security has not been compromised by the saga. Asked whether he feels let down by G4S, Coe says: &quot;I&apos;m not remotely dodging the question, but I&apos;m not very good at letting anger, frustration, emotional response get in the way of this. We had a problem and we identified it at the beginning of July. We acted within hours of really understanding that this was a big issue. The point which has been slightly lost is that I know we have the numbers. We have the numbers because we have the military and eight police services here.&quot; As it is, the presence of those troops and police officers will probably end up having a positive impact on perceptions of the Games, he says. &quot;There is a big affection for their presence and they are really smart, engaging people. Their ability to deliver a safe and secure Games is not high on my list of concerns.&quot; On Friday, the curtain will come up on a 17-day sporting celebration that will host 8.8 million ticket-holders, 10,500 athletes and twice as many members of the world&apos;s media. The government is selling it as an investment in the future, promising a legacy for everything from tourism to inward investment. Others remain more sceptical, but most are looking forward to the sporting spectacle. Coe is hard to ruffle. But even he has appeared slightly unnerved in recent weeks. He had spoken recently to two contemporary athletes who had &quot;fallen at the final hurdle&quot; for selection and sympathised with their guilt at letting others down. &quot;There is a large chunk of me that says I don&apos;t \u2013 and we don&apos;t \u2013 want to let people in this country down. We&apos;re as excited about doing this. The 6,000 people in our organisation have lived and breathed and slept this. Of course, we feel a massive responsibility to get this right.&quot; It will be &quot;interesting&quot;, he says, to compare the feeling 40 minutes before Danny Boyle&apos;s \u00a327m opening ceremony \u2013 described as a creative &quot;high wire act&quot; by those who have seen it \u2013 and his pre-race thoughts as a competitor. &quot;You learn a lot about yourself in those 40 minutes,&quot; he says, munching on pasta from the media canteen. &quot;I do accept, though, that was very individual. It was about not letting your nearest and dearest down. It will be the same sort of feeling, just multiply that by a lot more people that you don&apos;t want to let down.&quot; The London 2012 organising committee, which is staging the Games using a privately raised \u00a32bn budget but also benefits from more than \u00a3800m from \u00a39.3bn in public funding, is a strange beast. It starts small and raises hundreds of millions in sponsorship, grows furiously in its final two years, then abruptly dismantles itself and flogs off its assets. Coe&apos;s organising committee has benefited from the work of the Olympic Delivery Authority in building the gleaming venues and transforming a toxic wasteland into an impressive new urban park ahead of time and under budget. That gave Locog some wriggle room, but it has since faced searching questions over the ticketing process, security and a perceived lack of transparency. In the plus column, the torch relay has been something of a triumph, more than 8m tickets have been sold, and the IOC and athletes are happy. Coe is proud, he says, to have put sport at the heart of the political agenda. &quot;My whole life, if there&apos;s been one continuum through pretty much everything I&apos;ve done, or said, or roles and responsibilities I&apos;ve had since the age of 18, it has been to secure a more robust and permanent place for sport in the political and social agenda.&quot; The 55-year-old says the legacy promises that secured the Games have provided a &quot;road map&quot; to hold others to as economic times have got tougher, but accepts that delivering on them after the Olympics will require real political will. Coe has permitted himself one or two moments of satisfaction, such as when he visited the Olympic Park with British IOC member Sir Craig Reedie so that they could share a Field of Dreams moment. &quot;We stopped the car and got out and had our little moment and then got back in and continued. But you don&apos;t dwell for very long as your mobile goes and there&apos;s another conversation to be had,&quot; he says. Yet he retains an unshakeable conviction that the Games will be a triumph. He says he is not surprised the torch relay that arrived in London this weekend has been such a hit around the country, reaching an estimated 10m people. Coe believes it will go &quot;up a notch&quot; again this week in the capital. For all the last-minute concerns, which have led to articles in the foreign press characterising us as a nation of whingers, Coe believes the Games will showcase the best of Britain \u2013 on the field of play and off. &quot;We were never going to win the bid, we were never going to be able to build it, then we weren&apos;t going to be able to raise enough money, then we weren&apos;t going to get any volunteers, then the torch wasn&apos;t going to ignite the excitement, then we didn&apos;t have any athletes \u2014 which we put behind us by Beijing. Then it was going to be chaos and it hasn&apos;t been,&quot; he says. &quot;We have a great, endearing ability in this country to question our ability. Often, it&apos;s quite counter-cultural. We have large parts of Britain in leading edge niche markets around the world, we have some of the most extraordinarily creative people ever put on this planet with a history and tradition that the rest of the world looks on enviously if a bit curiously. I like to think that with odd ups and downs we&apos;ve shown that when we do things properly and we do things collegiately, we do them as well as anyone in the world.&quot; As for London, he hopes that by the time the curtain comes down on the Paralympics in September it will be seen globally as &quot;a modern, confident \u2013 not brash \u2013 city at ease in its own skin&quot;. Coe has been selling these Games and their benefits since he became bid leader in 2004, but one telling aside when considering the range of perspectives from which he has seen the various Olympics since Moscow in 1980 reveals that even he recognises this is a leap into the unknown: &quot;It will be interesting. We haven&apos;t done this before.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/jul/24/social-enterprise-network-daily", "sentences": ["Social enterprise nominees slideshow Yahoo News Singapore: These nominees are shining examples that material wealth is not the only yardstick for success in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-24T10:00:18Z", "title": "Social enterprise network daily: Tuesday 24 July", "tags": ["Social enterprises"], "article": "Why you should start a social enterprise in college Huffington Post: It is difficult to believe that we started a company - let alone a social enterprise - as undergraduates.

With GDP data on Wednesday expected to show a third successive quarter of decline, the BCC&apos;s director general, John Longworth, said the political response to Britain&apos;s economic malaise had been lacklustre. &quot;What is lacking in politics at the moment is imagination, will and leadership,&quot; he said. Longworth said the call by William Hague, the foreign secretary, for businessmen to stop complaining and get &quot;on a plane, go sell things overseas&quot; had been rendered pointless by airport policy that had delayed a decision on new runways in the south-east. According to one BCC survey, the proportion of businesses exporting over the past year has risen from a fifth to third. &quot;They have [sold overseas], Mr Hague,&quot; Longworth said. &quot;So what are you doing, government, about providing the facilities that allow us to do it?&quot; Referring to other nations&apos; airport and infrastructure expansion plans, he said: &quot;Britain dithers while others do.&quot; Longworth said the government was not being big enough and bold enough over infrastructure, and pointed to the proposed \u00a332bn high-speed rail line that he said ticked the boxes for scale and ambition but on which building work had yet to commence. The Treasury&apos;s recent publication of a \u00a3200bn infrastructure wishlist included previously mothballed road projects, he said. &quot;We need something on a bigger scale, and new. We have infrastructure requests from chambers all over the country for road projects that are not even on the infrastructure plan.&quot; A detailed policy would set out investment plans for airports, ports, railways, roads, broadband networks, energy and skills, Longworth said. Along with the immediate boost of construction jobs and the long-term benefits for businesses, he said, an infrastructure boom would act as a buffer against the eurozone crisis. &quot;It is insulated from the eurozone crisis because it does not depend on trade.&quot; There is broad cross-party and business sector consensus that the UK needs infrastructure investment, but debate over how best to fund it. Longworth said a reverse sovereign wealth fund could be created that would draw in investment from pension funds and sovereign investors \u2013 such as Temasek in Singapore and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority \u2013 in exchange for a guaranteed return on the projects it created. &quot;We need some imagination on infrastructure financing,&quot; he said. The government could combine ambitions for the environment, infrastructure and small business banks into one entity: &quot;Why not wrap all these things up in one?&quot; He acknowledged that a long-term investment programme would take years to roll out, but said: &quot;If you commit to a medium- and long-term massive infrastructure investment, it will boost confidence to invest now. It will have a stimulating effect on the economy immediately.&quot; Longworth said a concerted infrastructure investment programme, backed by a national business bank or a Bank of England-supported bond scheme, would spur businesses to invest: &quot;Half the businesses in the UK are sitting on cash which they are not investing.&quot; Corporate Britain was sitting on an estimated cash pile worth \u00a3750bn, he said. &quot;These businesses have to recognise there is a new norm, there is less certainty and higher risk in the world and that will not change soon. We need to give them something that will give them the confidence to do that.&quot; Lack of credit and finance remained an impediment to growth, Longworth said. A BCC survey showed exporters in manufacturing and services were investing in growth by the end of last summer. By the end of the year, however, lack of access to capital had choked off their plans, he said. Another growth spurt emerged in the same sectors between April and June, Longworth said, but that faced the same constraints. &quot;We keep on getting growth and it just disperses.&quot; Longworth said political and media negativity was filtering through to businesses. &quot;It is not helpful that the government and commentators paint a picture of the economy that is relentlessly gloomy \u2026 The general disposition of UK business is that it is tough out there. They are doing okay, but the economic situation is poor and there is a lack of confidence in the future.&quot; A growth plan, backed by an infrastructure programme, would instil confidence, Longworth added."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/24/london-2012-team-gb-atlanta", "sentences": ["The next big step change came in Singapore in 2005, when Coe&apos;s inspirational speech helped London over the line and Sue Campbell, UK Sport chair, and Keen convinced Gordon Brown that it was worth investing unprecedented sums \u2013 \u00a3312m over four years \u2013 in securing gold at a home Games."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-24T18:29:53Z", "title": "London 2012: how Team GB's fortunes turned around after disaster in Atlanta", "tags": ["Team GB", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "UK news", "Olympic Games"], "article": "In the afterglow of Bradley Wiggins&apos;s triumph on the Champs Elys\u00e9es and on the day Team GB&apos;s athletes were officially welcomed to the Olympic Village in anticipation of their best performance in over a century, it seems barely credible. But speak to anyone involved in British sport who was around at the time, and mention of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta still provokes a involuntary shudder. Sixteen years on, as logistical concerns finally give way to sporting action as the Games begin with a football match in Cardiff, the fruits of a remarkable evolution are clear. From one gold to perhaps 27 (if the University of Loughborough&apos;s researchers are to be believed). From 15 medals overall to a target of at least 48 and most likely many more. And from just a handful of dedicated individuals who had beaten the system to a whole generation of athletes nurtured by it, from an ad-hoc collection of driven but disparate coaches to a &quot;Formula One&quot; style operation that hopes to underpin continued success. Great Britain came home from Atlanta with just one gold medal, of 15 in total. Seen by many as the nadir of recent Games with its transport, logistics, rampant commercialism and security issues, it also represented rock bottom for British sport. Finishing 36th in the medal table \u2013 below Belgium, Algeria and Kazakhstan \u2013 it prompted a period of furious self-flagellation in the media and serious soul searching among administrators. In Atlanta, the press leapt on the story of two British divers \u2013 Bob Morgan and Tony Ally \u2013 forced to sell their kit on the streets of the city. Ahead of London, Team GB&apos;s 542 athletes have come away from a no expense spared pre-Games training camp in Loughborough weighed down by more free kit than they can carry. More importantly, no stone has been left unturned in the drive to put those with the best medal chances on the podium. By the time Britain&apos;s athletes had enjoyed the benefit of a decade of lottery funding, and funding agency UK Sport&apos;s plan to integrate the best coaches in the world into a streamlined support system, 15 medals had become 47 in Beijing. The cycling team alone won 14 medals, eight of them gold. Lord Coe, the London 2012 chairman and double Olympic gold medallist, traces the transformation back to a single decision in the mid 1990s. &quot;I sat with John Major recently and I said he would quite properly claim all sorts of things from his premiership, but I look back and say that his greatest achievement was to change the face of sport in this country with the national lottery. The Atlanta to Sydney journey, from 1994 onwards, there is no question in my mind at all that what we started was down to him.&quot; Even taking into account the political allegiances of a former Tory MP, most agree that turning on the tap of lottery funding from the pockets of punters up and down the country was a seminal moment. Behind the scenes UK Sport honed a &quot;no compromise&quot; approach orchestrated by Peter Keen, the man who set in motion the revolution in British cycling from 1998 before trying to apply its &quot;aggregation of marginal gains&quot; philosophy to British Olympic sport as a whole from 2003. According to Keen, it transformed the British sporting landscape from one in which only the occasional &quot;Alpinist&quot; could succeed to one where there was an ongoing support structure. The lottery was introduced in 1994 but it wasn&apos;t until after the Atlanta humiliation that the World Class Performance Programme started diverting funds into elite sport. It allowed athletes to devote themselves entirely to their training, paying their living costs and delivering a range of support services, from physiotherapy to sports science and nutrition. &quot;We have now learned to look the monster in the eye and say: &apos;We could win, what does that take?&apos; If you go back to 1996, the vast majority of people who went to international competition were not really engaging with the idea of winning,&quot; says Keen, the unsung hero of the astonishing rise of Britain&apos;s Olympic aspirations, who recently stepped down to a part-time role. The next big step change came in Singapore in 2005, when Coe&apos;s inspirational speech helped London over the line and Sue Campbell, UK Sport chair, and Keen convinced Gordon Brown that it was worth investing unprecedented sums \u2013 \u00a3312m over four years \u2013 in securing gold at a home Games. &quot;Within a week, we mobilised to being in place where we could make the case on behalf of everyone in sport and ask for a significant uplift,&quot; says Keen. Campbell adds: &quot;From 1996 to 2000, the money had a huge impact. It got us to 10th. Then we were 10th again [in Athens]. That was good, but it wasn&apos;t great. Other than money and culture, the other big deciding factor was leadership. Someone had to articulate the mission and the vision.&quot; The people who provided that vision included the technocratic Keen at the centre, as well as a generation of inspiring performance directors in key sports. In the wake of the Beijing heroics and Wiggins&apos;s extraordinary achievement with Team Sky, British Cycling&apos;s Dave Brailsford is perhaps the best known. But the more understated David Tanner, GB Rowing performance director, and sailing&apos;s ebullient Stephen Park have been equally influential in their own sports. It has provoked a change in mindset as each has built on every new wave of success to bring through a new generation of talent. &quot;I remember my first Olympics in Seoul and the journey from taking a photograph at the opening ceremony to coming home three weeks later and realising that taking part is not fun. You&apos;re not climbing the mountain, you&apos;re just looking at it,&quot; says Keen. The money has also enabled Britain to go shopping for the best coaches in the world. From Shane Sutton in cycling to Jurgen Grobler in rowing and Michael Scott in swimming to Charles van Commenee in athletics, they have hauled up standards. &quot;There are four things you need. You need them all. Smart governing bodies, world class coaches, talented athletes with the good sense to pick their parents carefully, then you need predictable levels of funding. When you get that, you tend to get rowing and you tend to get cycling. That was the difference in Beijing,&quot; says Coe. &apos;Money talks&apos; Cash is remorselessly focused on those sports with the best chance of winning medals. Over four years, swimming gets \u00a325m, cycling \u00a326m and rowing \u00a327m. But that investment has also attracted additional commercial sponsorship. &quot;Let&apos;s be honest, money talks,&quot; says the former triple jumper Jonathan Edwards, who now sits on the London 2012 board. The money has gone into salaries for the best coaches and equipment, but also into a support network that is the envy of the world and is exemplified by the sports science services provided through the English Institute of Sport. For Keen, who coached Chris Boardman to gold in 1992, it has changed the nature of British sport: &quot;My career in sport, pre-lottery, was that of a classic Alpinist. We were trying to climb this thing but we weren&apos;t leaving any maps or ropes for anyone else. If anything, quite the reverse. That switch from one-off success to an approach that is a quite different set of values is probably the single biggest difference.&quot; Edwards, who won silver in Atlanta and gold in Sydney four years later, says that the public investment has had another effect in binding the team together. &quot;The biggest change overall, which I see in particular in the new generation that has come through, is that the lottery funding has given much more of a team feel. The fact that the athletes are funded by the general public brings them closer,&quot; he says. &quot;Track and field used to stand head and shoulders above anything else, but now everyone in the country gets as excited about cycling, rowing and sailing as they do about athletics.&quot; Sir Steve Redgrave, the five-time gold medallist who with Sir Matthew Pinsent contributed that single gold in Atlanta, says that one unexpected side effect of the lottery investment was the talent development programmes that made sure promising athletes were funnelled into their best sport at a younger age. &quot;At the time, I didn&apos;t think lottery funding would make a big difference. But I was wrong. Often we had the right athletes in the wrong sport. It made a huge difference to that,&quot; said Redgrave. &quot;We went from one gold medal, with five at the Olympics before that, to winning 11. That&apos;s where we should be, between 11 and 15. At a home Games, we should be up to 19 or 20. At the beginning of my career I&apos;d have said it&apos;s all about the athlete, that they&apos;ll make it there eventually. But the fact is that the infrastructure is important.&quot; The unprecedented investment came to fruition in Beijing, with a medal count that the sports minister Hugh Robertson says was the ultimate proof of concept. Cambell adds: &quot;In our wildest dreams we hadn&apos;t thought of fourth. But sport is all about momentum. You&apos;re suddenly winning and you&apos;re in a place you shouldn&apos;t be.&quot; Keen says that momentum has been maintained since Beijing and that while rule changes in cycling make a repeat performance impossible, other sports have stepped up to the plate. &quot;We&apos;re far further forward as a system. It&apos;s arithemtically impossible for cycling to do that again. But there&apos;s so much more strength in depth across the board,&quot; he says. Robertson admits that a looming home Games enabled him to make the case for continuing to invest in elite sport at a time when budgets for schools and hospitals were being cut as the coalition government came to power. Campbell says she does not detect any resentment from the British public at the money poured into elite sport in austere times. &quot;When the British team march out there \u2026 this country loves this stuff. It is a tough time and it is a lot of money. But if what it does is make us proud of who we are and proud as a nation and makes people realise you can have a dream and pursue it and make it come true.&quot; For those involved in Britain&apos;s extraordinary sporting revolution over the past 15 years, the challenge will be to maintain investment beyond the Games and avoid the post-Olympics slump that has bedevilled every host nation in history. Redgrave says that more emphasis should now be put on developing homegrown coaches, rather than buying in the best from abroad. Robertson, in the face of some considerable scepticism and the debilitating effect of school sport cuts, local authority cuts and societal factors, believes that the trick can be repeated in grassroots sport. &quot;I don&apos;t for a moment underestimate the challenge. But if anyone&apos;s going to succeed, we&apos;ll succeed with this plan. There is no alternative narrative out there.&quot; All such future concerns will be put to one side for the next three weeks, as the nation luxuriates in the vaulting achievements of Britain&apos;s athletes, rowers, cyclists, sailors and swimmers in the knowledge that their taxes and lottery tickets have played a key role in their success.

Coe was joined by the 20 schoolchildren who accompanied the party in Singapore and underlined the bid commitment to engage with the youth of the world. &quot;As you remember, we outlined a vision and the ambition was simple: to connect young people to sport and the Olympic values,&quot; said Coe. &quot;It has been an extraordinary journey over seven years since Singapore.&quot; The London 2012 chairman told the IOC session that young people selected from its programmes would play an important part in Friday&apos;s opening ceremony, such as in the guard of honour.

He worked for the National Basketball Association public relations department through the 2008 Olympics, and the experience stoked a passion for FIBA hoops. The passion for PR was quite abating, if it ever existed at all. So he quit his job, and devoted his full time to making a public spectacle of his basketball obsession. So far, the decision has paid off emotionally and monetarily, but mostly because his standards are so low for both thresholds. Strauss has written for ESPN.com, Salon.com, The Classical, Dime Magazine, Free Darko. He&apos;s quite thrilled at the prospect of speaking to a broader international audience, because &quot;&quot;basketball as a unifying force&quot;&quot; is the kind of touching trope that wrings water from his oft-rolled eyes. He&apos;s rooting for the United States in theory, but his intellectual vanity is hoping that Spain shows them up.

The UK accounts for about 85% of sales, and its fortunes depend on a vibrant housing and public-sector construction market. New homes, hospitals, schools and office complexes use the company&apos;s drainage pipes, including its clay sewer versions. With house-building projects having fallen sharply and PFI -backed projects drying up, Naylor says the 0.7% decline in GDP reflects the mood among customers. Recent employment and\u00a0GDP numbers were probably too optimistic, he believes. &quot;It confirms what we felt was happening on the ground. The recent economic news has felt too good to be true. If people are not feeling confident they don&apos;t buy houses and companies don&apos;t buy factory extensions,&quot; the 49-year-old said. Construction accounts for about 7% of GDP in the UK; it was hammered in the most recent quarter, slipping 5.2%. Naylor Industries employs 245 people and had a strong 2011, with turnover climbing 10% to \u00a3337m. This year will not be as good, Naylor says, with the government seemingly unable to kickstart the housing market and a pervasive lack of confidence influencing his own investment decisions. &quot;There is an issue around overall sentiment and that translates into me asking, do I want a shiny new piece of kit? And I am thinking, no, I am going to sit tight,&quot; Naylor said. He admits the business had a near-death experience in 2008 after a multi-million pound equipment investment coincided with the Lehman collapse. Naylor Industries has not tried to tap banks for loans recently, he adds, but his peers tell him that among banks there is &quot;no appetite to finance businesses&quot;. Outside, in neat piles, lies the great hope for Naylor Industries and the UK economy. Jacking pipes, a new drainage product that works well in cities and built-up areas, are stacked up and awaiting delivery to Singapore. Nearby, a consignment is being readied for Poland. Naylor has been working tirelessly to develop custom in Asia, where he sees a prolonged infrastructure boom as cities expand. &quot;There is more development and more potential for infrastructure installation.&quot; In the UK, he adds, it is the opposite. &quot;We are not seeing enough spades in the ground.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/25/tony-blair-london-2012-critics", "sentences": ["It&apos;s not just about picking some elite kids and making them champions; it&apos;s about permeating sport through the community.&quot; Blair, who with his wife, Cherie, is credited with playing a key role in schmoozing IOC members the night before the 2005 Singapore vote on the 2012 host city, said that the former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell and athletes persuaded him in 2002 to bid for the Games despite official advice that Paris would win."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-25T18:02:24Z", "title": "Tony Blair tells London 2012 critics to show 'a bit of pride'", "tags": ["Tony Blair", "Politics", "Labour", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Regeneration", "Communities", "Society", "UK news", "London"], "article": "Tony Blair has told those who criticise the investment of \u00a39bn of public money in staging the London 2012 Olympics they should have more pride in hosting &quot;the world&apos;s biggest sporting event&quot;. The former prime minister said it would be a decade before the success of the London Games could be judged and warned that political focus must be maintained afterwards. &quot;It&apos;s in 10 years time we&apos;ll know whether this has worked or not. What is important is after the Olympics to carry on encouraging the impact of it to keep generating local sport activity,&quot; he told the Guardian after appearing at the Beyond Sport conference in London on Wednesday. Blair, who has focused on his role as a Middle East envoy since leaving power, has taken on his first role with the Labour party since stepping down as prime minister, becoming an adviser on Olympic legacy. He said those who criticised the cost of the Games had not fully considered the benefits. &quot;It&apos;s really important on the money side to understand what you&apos;re getting in return. &quot;Of course, \u00a39bn is in one sense a lot of money but, in another sense, you&apos;re regenerating an entire part of the country, creating thousands of jobs and there&apos;s massive amounts of investment coming in,&quot; Blair said. When Blair originally gave the go-ahead to the Olympics bid, it was claimed that the Games could be delivered for \u00a32.4bn. After London was chosen, the budget more than tripled to \u00a39.3bn. Those involved say that the original budget was always an operational figure and did not include VAT, the cost of buying and remediating the land or the sizeable contingency fund required. Asked whether the same figure could simply have been spent on regeneration without the Games, Blair said: &quot;It&apos;s not quite the same. You&apos;ve got the Olympics! When people start making arguments like this I just have to say &apos;Come on guys, this is the biggest sporting event in the world and we&apos;re hosting it.&apos; A bit of pride there, I think.&quot; Blair admitted the competing figures cited in recent weeks on both sides of the debate made it difficult to calculate the benefits. &quot;There is no accurate assessment of the figures on this, but if you were to ask any of the cities who we beat if they wish the result had gone differently, if they were being honest they would say &apos;yes, of course&apos;.&quot; He said the last-minute list of concerns, from transport and security to the weather, were typically British but predicted that the country would revel in hosting the Games. &quot;We&apos;re just like this. But when it comes to the point, people will be delighted. It&apos;s an enormous opportunity for the country,&quot; he said. Blair, who said he still &quot;worked out four or five times a week&quot; at the age of 59, said he was convinced of the link between elite sporting success and grassroots participation \u2013 despite the fact that no previous Olympics have persuaded more people to play sport in the host country. &quot;I basically do buy it. If you look at cycling in the UK today, and I&apos;ve got no scientific evidence for this at all, but I think it really does make a difference. Andy Murray in tennis, these big sporting icons can draw people into sport.&quot; After leaving office, Blair set up a small-scale sports foundation in north-east England to train coaches and volunteers, which, he said, had reached tens of thousands of children. He said that it was vital to pour more money into coaching and urged sports bodies to invest more of their income in the grassroots. &quot;We need a greater linking up between government, sports organisations and the grassroots,&quot; he said. &quot;We sit in that gap but we sit pretty alone. It&apos;s important for the sports governing bodies, which have some pretty significant budgets, that they understand the importance of coaching and volunteers. It&apos;s not just about picking some elite kids and making them champions; it&apos;s about permeating sport through the community.&quot; Blair, who with his wife, Cherie, is credited with playing a key role in schmoozing IOC members the night before the 2005 Singapore vote on the 2012 host city, said that the former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell and athletes persuaded him in 2002 to bid for the Games despite official advice that Paris would win. &quot;We had a meeting in Downing Street with [the rower] Sir Steve Redgrave and all these people. Their enthusiasm was a big factor. It was difficult because we feared we weren&apos;t going to win. That&apos;s what people kept telling me,&quot; he said. &quot;The infrastructure is now the thing the Olympic committee more or less take for granted. What we added was a sense of London as a modern, multicultural, multi-faith city. &quot;I&apos;m not saying that was the determining element, but it was an important dimension,&quot; he said. Blair said he would take his seat at the opening ceremony on Friday feeling a &quot;mixture of nerves and pride&quot;, and hoped the Games would show London at its best. He said that he had waged an ongoing battle in government to &quot;fight the system&quot; and knit sport into the fabric of health, education and social affairs policy but admitted that he could have gone further. &quot;You can always do more. But I think we did a lot in terms of facilities, sports co-ordinators in schools and so on. But now I have a sports foundation, we find there is a big unmet need still there,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/25/manchester-united-new-york-flotation", "sentences": ["The move is the latest setback in a long-running attempt to list the company&apos;s shares, a move that had previously been earmarked for the exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore, and comes as the club had been looking to kick off their roadshow presentations to potential share buyers this week.", "Formula One shelved a $10bn flotation in Singapore after expressing concerns over the impact of the eurozone crisis on\u00a0markets."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-25T20:15:27Z", "title": "Manchester United 'temporarily postpone New York flotation plan'", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Business", "Football", "IPOs", "FTSE", "Stock markets", "Business", "Sport"], "article": "Manchester United are thought to have postponed temporarily plans to launch their $300m (\u00a3193m) flotation in New York, after volatile US markets spooked the Premier League club into a rethink. The move is the latest setback in a long-running attempt to list the company&apos;s shares, a move that had previously been earmarked for the exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore, and comes as the club had been looking to kick off their roadshow presentations to potential share buyers this week. However, United and their advisers are now believed to be reassessing that plan following another week of turmoil in the eurozone that has caused world stock markets to slide. Wall Street&apos;s S&amp;P 500 index is trading down 2% this week, while keenly watched statistics on the volatility of the market are thought to have made potential investors more circumspect. The plan had been for United&apos;s shares to begin trading in early August and it is not clear if United will still attempt to list their shares ahead of the traditionally quiet period up until after the US public holidays in early September, when Wall Street tends to return to work. Neither Jefferies, the investment bank that has been signed up to lead United&apos;s flotation, nor the club returned phone calls on the flotation delay, reported on Wednesday night in the Financial Times. Manchester United were acquired by the Glazer family for \u00a3790m in 2005, in a deal that was heavily criticised by the club&apos;s fans for its reliance on debt financing. That debt pile appeared to play a part in the Glazers&apos; consideration of a flotation, amid reports that part of the $1bn raised by the flotation would be used to pay down the club&apos;s \u00a3423.2m in gross debt. Despite the reported pause, the Glazers have laid the ground for a flotation across the Atlantic, filing their intention at the New York Stock Exchange to float a Manchester United company registered in the Cayman Islands. Manchester United fans, thousands of whom have campaigned against the Glazers&apos; ownership, have welcomed the prospect of a listing and not only because it would dilute the Glazers&apos; shareholding. The Manchester United Supporters&apos; Trust has said it would support the share sell-off if the proceeds were used to pay off debt. For some fans last season&apos;s performance, which saw the team slip up in the run-in and hand the title to their arch-rivals Manchester City, was seen as the tipping point when financial constraints finally began to impede the club&apos;s ability to compete for top players. Fans hope that\u00a0a less indebted club will be able to spend more on transfers, but Sir Alex Ferguson has never criticised the Glazers&apos; ownership publicly. Manchester United had eyed a listing in the far east, the fastest-growing region of the world economy, but that was pulled amid general concerns over market volatility. Other companies have suffered from the factors of eurozone turbulence and weak demand that have derailed their Asian listing plans.

With founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg criticised for taking a back seat during the company&apos;s disastrous Nasdaq listing, Wall Street will be hoping the founder steps forward with some reassuring remarks on Thursday evening&apos;s earnings call with analysts. After booking a $1.1bn (\u00a3710m) charge for share-based payouts to staff and early investors at the public offering, the social network is forecast by its lead bank Morgan Stanley to report a $673m loss before tax. Revenues are recovering from their shock first quarter plunge, but while the consensus among analysts is that they will be up 30% year on year, growth is likely to be the slowest yet disclosed at Facebook. Even without the cost of the float, underlying earnings are not thought to have returned to their Christmas high point of $725m, and may have in fact fallen slightly from the last quarter to $593m. Bad news on Wednesday from Zynga, whose income is heavily dependent on the Facebook platform, has not helped calm the markets.     Facebook share price Photograph: Graphic    Facebook&apos;s stock fell nearly 8% in after hours trading to $27.04 after Zynga reported results well below forecasts and slashed its outlook for the year. The company blamed the drop on Facebook, saying the social network made changes to its site that favoured new games, many from Zynga&apos;s competitors, over the company&apos;s existing games. Much of the social network&apos;s non-advertising income comes from Zynga, which shares profits for games played by Facebook users.

Analysts have been cutting their estimates in the past month, according to Bloomberg, with more than half rating the stock a hold, underperform or sell. Facebook has already warned that many of its users are now on mobile phones rather than desktop computers, and that advertising income on smartphone screens is harder to come by. Speaking at the annual Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley media conference earlier in July, Zuckerberg confirmed that his hardest job right now was figuring out how to adapt Facebook for mobile devices. And a recent study shows that the network&apos;s meteoric growth to 901 million users worldwide may be peaking. Over the past six months, Facebook&apos;s US user number is down 1.7%, and its popularity is declining in Hong Kong and Singapore, according to Capstone Investments, which used software to analyse activity on the site. But the company has at least one potentially magic revenue boosting bullet in its arsenal. &quot;Even one strategic change \u2013 charging for branded pages \u2013 would, in our view, nearly double Facebook&apos;s long-term revenue opportunity,&quot; according to Nomura bank analyst Brian Nowak. Brands are currently charged for advertising, but they can set up their own page for free. With many of the world&apos;s largest advertisers now using dedicated Facebook pages as one of their principal social media tools, many believe it is only a matter of time before the company begins charging them for the privilege, perhaps based on the level of usage and numbers of &quot;likes&quot;. Morgan Stanley says other new initiatives could include launching a mobile and desktop advertising network, using the firm&apos;s expertise in placing contextually relevant ads to sell space on websites owned by others. Facebook made $3bn from contextual ads in 2011 and could generate a further $2bn a year by 2015, according to its bank. The company could also dive into e-commerce, charging commission on merchandise sold via its pages, with digital entertainment, clothing and travel likely to be popular with social shoppers. Handled correctly, the catch up with investors could be an opportunity to rekindle some of the enthusiasm that was extinguished in May."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/26/olympics-2012-bollywood-amitabh-bachchan-torch-visitbritain-tourism", "sentences": ["Singapore Tourism Board launched a tour package to coincide with the 2006 release of Krrish which was shot there, thanks to a massive subsidy designed to attract international film productions."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-26T10:27:00Z", "title": "Bollywood's go with the Olympic torch could light up UK tourism", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Bollywood", "Film", "Olympic torch", "India", "ent and tourismHospitality, event managem", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "There were cheers as well as confusion when Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan announced to his three million Twitter followers yesterday that he&apos;d be carrying the Olympic Torch this morning, as the relay makes its way through the London Borough of Southwark. Some speculated that on the eve of the London 2012 opening ceremony, the Big B (as he&apos;s fondly known) might yet draw the biggest crowd of the torch relay, while others were left wondering why a Bollywood superstar was carrying the Olympic torch anyway. I suspect this is a calculated move which has less to do with sport and community, and more to do with economics. If the Olympics are good for tourism, then Britain has its sights on the fastest growing outbound tourist market in the world \u2013 India. Encouraged by visitor figures in recent years, VisitBritain, the national tourism agency for marketing Britain overseas, wants to entice a greater number of Indians to choose Britain for their next holiday. With this in mind, VisitBritain is currently rolling out a \u00a325 million marketing campaign, which involves saturating Mumbai and Delhi with huge billboard posters, 200 specially branded taxis, as well as a 60 second advert being played across 120 cinemas. So what&apos;s this got to do with Amitabh Bachchan? Well, as many countries will testify, Bollywood is now a major player in boosting tourist flow from India. Basically, getting your country featured in the latest Bollywood blockbuster is as good as it gets, when it comes to product placement. Little wonder then that tourism agencies from around the world are actively courting Bollywood directors and heavyweight stars with all manner of incentives.      Switzerland - named a lake after Yash Chopra. Photograph: Alessandro Della Bella/EPA    You see, filming in foreign locations is a long standing Bollywood tradition, and lends the film an air of excitement, escapism, adventure and aspiration. It was award winning director, Yash Chopra, who singlehandedly put Switzerland on the Indian map by regularly featuring the snowcapped mountains and crystal clear lakes as the backdrop for his romantic song and dance sequences. So grateful were the Swiss Tourism Authority for his contribution that they even named a lake after him.  More recently, New Zealand became a popular holiday destination for Indians after the 2000 blockbuster Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai was shot there. The film&apos;s director, Rakesh Roshan, was even honoured by the New Zealand Prime Minister for his contribution to tourism. Singapore Tourism Board launched a tour package to coincide with the 2006 release of Krrish which was shot there, thanks to a massive subsidy designed to attract international film productions. And the hugely popular actor Shahrukh Khan, who also runs an award winning production house, has signed up as the honorary cultural ambassador of the Korean Tourism Organisation, specifically to raise Korea&apos;s profile among Indians.  Britain too has become a very popular screen location in Bollywood films. So much so that VisitBritain produced a Bollywood Movie Map in 2007 to encourage Indian film fans to visit the British locations shown in their favourite films. The map highlighted old and recent Bollywood productions and included the 1998 film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, whose title track alone was filmed at Glencoe, Ross Priory and Loch Lomond in Scotland. So you see, getting Amitabh Bachchan to carry the Olympic torch through the streets of London is an almighty coup for tourism in Britain. With 180 films under his belt and a remarkable career spanning four decades, the 69 year old actor is one of the greatest and most influential figures in the history of Indian cinema. In fact, the Big B is bigger than Bollywood. So if Britain wants Indian&apos;s undivided attention and positive regard, then handing the Olympic torch to one of India&apos;s most esteemed statesmen is definitely a step in the right direction.

Manchester United, described as &quot;one of the world&apos;s leading brands&quot; in the 231-page registration document filed earlier this month in preparation for the club&apos;s flotation on the New York stock exchange, may not be quite as attractive as its owners like to believe. After a proposed float in Singapore was pulled last year, it has emerged that United&apos;s planned initial public offering (IPO) in New York has been temporarily postponed because of volatile US markets. While United and Jefferies, the investment bank signed up to lead the flotation, remain tight-lipped about the process, those that forensically examine the Premier League club&apos;s accounts are questioning whether the latest setback is about more than the fiscal shockwaves triggered by another turbulent week in the eurozone. &quot;Obviously it&apos;s a tough time economically but the US stock market has barely changed from where it was when they published the original prospectus,&quot; said Andy Green, a financial analyst who writes the &quot;andersred blog&quot; about football ownership and is an adviser to the Manchester United Supporters Trust (Must). &quot;Although it&apos;s hard to see inside a process like this, they&apos;re obviously having problems, and I get the impression from people that I&apos;m talking to in the market that it&apos;s at high risk of being cancelled.&quot; Should that happen, it will put paid to the Glazers&apos; hopes that fresh investment will cover a sizeable chunk of the \u00a3423m debt they loaded on to a club that have fallen well behind their Premier League rivals when it comes to competing in the transfer market. One of the primary reasons for that in the eyes of many United supporters is that the Glazers have taken \u00a3500m out of the club, in interest, bank charges and fees, to service the debt. &quot;The latest figures we&apos;ve got is that they&apos;ve spent \u00a371m on the debt in the first nine months of the financial year,&quot; Green said. &quot;And obviously supporters were hoping that the IPO would lead to an end to a lot of those costs and more money being available to the manager. &quot;But in the short term, the real question is: if they do have to pull this IPO, what does it say about investors&apos; perceptions of Manchester United? The Glazers have had talks with various parties in the past and never been able to agree on a price and this would be a real slap in the face for them if they take it to the biggest stock market in the world and they can&apos;t get it away.&quot; In truth, it would hardly come as a surprise if United&apos;s shares prove to be a hard sell. The shares will carry a tenth of the voting rights of the shares the Glazers will issue to themselves and there is no plan to pay dividends. The Glazers, in other words, will remain in complete control and are offering precious little in return. &quot;It&apos;s a tough sell to start with, with very little voting rights, no annual general meetings where you can quiz the management, no dividend. But on top of that obviously there is the question of what valuation they&apos;re putting on it, and if they&apos;re trying to put a very high price on the club and all those things I&apos;ve mentioned, then it becomes very, very difficult,&quot; Green said. Must have called on the Glazer family to launch a full flotation, which would no doubt prompt a very different response, in particular from United supporters. Duncan Drasdo, the Must chief executive, said: &quot;Should they choose to do this, with no strings attached, we would support such a flotation wholeheartedly and encourage the global fan base of Manchester United to seize such an historic opportunity to secure a meaningful fan ownership stake where the priorities of the club are the same as the fans \u2013 not absentee owners.&quot; Green, however, believes the prospects of that happening are slim. &quot;I don&apos;t see [any possibility of that happening in the short term] but I think the trust are right, the Glazers are making a big mistake. They&apos;re trying to do this at this huge price and with keeping total control. Actually, there is a natural buyer for these shares if they want to get more money into the club from the outside to get the debt down \u2014 the supporter base which they reckon is 600m around the world. &quot;I&apos;m sure there are at least a million football fans around the world who would like to own a stake in the club. The Glazers are far too short-sighted for that. They&apos;re too greedy and too controlling. I do think if this IPO falls apart, that it could be a real turning point because the Qataris, the Red Knights and now the world&apos;s institutional investors will all have said to the Glazers: &apos;No, the club is not worth as much as you think it is.&apos;&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/london-2012-time-to-find-out-who-we-are", "sentences": ["It&apos;s worth going back to the bid the capital made seven years ago, especially to the three-minute video which reportedly won over wavering IOC hearts in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-26T23:01:03Z", "title": "London 2012: time to find out who we are", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "UK news", "London", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The countdown clock that once measured in years is now down to hours, minutes and seconds.

Watching them will be hundreds of thousands, and hundreds of millions more via television, drawn by that perennial human compulsion to see what our species is capable of at its best: to see how strong, how fast, how beautiful we can be. But also at stake is a contest that involves the people of Britain especially. For these Olympic weeks will offer answers to a clutch of questions that have nagged at us since the last time London hosted the Games in 1948. What exactly is our place in the world? How do we compare to other countries and to the country we used to be? What kind of nation are we anyway? There&apos;s nothing unique in that. Major sporting events often present their hosts with an occasion to reassess themselves and be reassessed by others. In 2008 China confirmed its seat at the global top table with the Beijing Olympics. The success of Sydney in 2000 told Australians they were as capable as any other first world nation and it was time to banish the cultural cringe. The 1984 Los Angeles Games came to represent Ronald Reagan&apos;s &quot;Morning in America&quot;. It can work the other way too. In 2010, India&apos;s confidence took a blow when Delhi&apos;s hosting of the Commonwealth Games came in for widespread criticism. As Tony Travers, scholar of cities and especially the capital at the London School of Economics, puts it, &quot;They&apos;re like airlines used to be: a test of national pride and capacity to deliver.&quot; And the Olympics is the big one. &quot;It&apos;s the UN general assembly, Davos, the World Cup and the world&apos;s biggest convention of journalists all rolled into one.&quot; Even up to the last minute, in the final days of preparation, the question of whether Britain can actually pull this off has seemed in doubt. A wearily familiar narrative is already in place: the Britain of the Daily Mail and Crap Towns, the Britain where nothing works any more. If it wasn&apos;t the failure of G4S to provide security staff, it was the threat by the PCS to call border guards out on strike. One an incompetent company made rich by privatisation, the other a militant-led trade union, the two seemed to spell out twin aspects of our troubled political past: Thatcherism and the winter of discontent uniting to ruin the Olympics. Add in a ticketing system that left millions disappointed along with fears of a creaking transport network and a costly stadium that, so far, has no planned afterlife, and it seems that disaster looms. Commentators on the left and right have united in rage at the rocket launchers on residential roofs, the Zil lanes for IOC bigwigs, the gagging reflex of Olympic corporate sponsors, censoring anything they declare an infringement of their monopoly and, of course, the \u00a39bn budget at a time of austerity. Until a few days ago, when summer seemed to have passed this country by, the smart money said London 2012 would be a literal and metaphorical washout, rubbish or wasteful or both. The cynics&apos; eye view has been articulated perfectly by the BBC&apos;s brilliant Twenty Twelve series, from whose scripts Wednesday&apos;s confusion of South and North Korean flags at a women&apos;s football match in Glasgow could have been lifted directly. All of this angst has not gone unnoticed abroad. The New York Times opened a report from London thus: &quot;While the world&apos;s athletes limber up in the Olympic Park, Londoners are practising some of their own favourite sports: complaining, expecting the worst and cursing the authorities.&quot; In the words of Prof Stefan Szymanski, who specialises in sports management at the University of Michigan, &quot;Perhaps Britain doesn&apos;t believe it can do this.&quot; And yet, at the same time, a counter-narrative has been developing. Its most eloquent expression has been the 70-day torch relay, which has outrun all expectations. Drawing big, enthusiastic crowds across the entire country, it has all but erased what had been one of the chief concerns of 2012: that it would be seen as a London-only event, of interest only to the capital. Instead, the sight of a simple flame passing hand to hand, from jogging young mother to local youth worker to elderly civic volunteer, seems to have touched Britons quite deeply. In Hackney last weekend, a borough which a year ago was on the brink of vicious riots, people filled the streets not to stone policemen but to high-five them. The sense of expectation is building, too. A staple of London smalltalk has become, &quot;Have you got any tickets?&quot; And the response to the appeal for volunteers has been remarkable. Their training manual forbids them from talking to the press, but I learned this week of the 72-year-old man now staying with his daughter in London so that he can work at the volleyball venue, doing 11 10-hour days in the coming two weeks, starting work each morning at six. He plans to get up at 4.30am every working day and last Friday woke at 4am in order to do a test run by Tube to the venue \u2013 promptly walking back again to calculate how long it would take if he had to travel on foot. A much younger fellow volunteer has taken a holiday from her job in Scotland and hired a caravan for two weeks, pitching it on the outskirts of London, so that she can do her bit. They&apos;re not complaining. On the contrary, they say they&apos;re excited to be part of a once in a lifetime event. There are, then, two conflicting impulses alive in the British breast. Perhaps we are always like this when faced with such a collective experience. Britons certainly divided over that strange, heady Diana week in 1997 and again over how to mark the millennium. In the case of the 2012 Olympics, ambivalence was encoded into its DNA from the very start. For many Londoners the memory of that day of celebration, the cheering and whooping of 6 July 2005 when the capital&apos;s victory over Paris, Madrid, New York and Moscow was announced, is inseparable from what immediately followed: the bombings of 7 July. The timing was especially cruel, suggesting that London was both blessed and cursed, that it might win but that it would not be allowed to savour its triumph for long. Perhaps some of that mixed sentiment lingers even now. Indeed, the combined memories will be present in human form, in the person of Martine Wright, who lost both her legs on the Circle Line train bombed outside Aldgate station on 7/7. She later took up sitting volleyball, in which sport she will compete in the Paralympic Games as a member of Team GB. So there is nothing uncomplicated about the event . Even now, there is a sense that it could go either way, that we might pass this mammoth test or flunk it. US presidential candidate Mitt Romney, in London this week to raise funds and not, he insisted, to see the horse he owns compete in the dressage event \u2013 what his opponents gleefully call the &quot;dancing horse contest&quot; \u2013 said as much when he admitted he had found the G4S and PCS stories &quot;disconcerting.&quot; And he may have been right when he wondered aloud about Britons&apos; enthusiasm: &quot;Do they come together and celebrate the Olympic moment? That&apos;s something which we only find out once the Games actually begin.&quot; In this, Friday night&apos;s opening ceremony will be crucial. The choice of Danny Boyle as ringmaster suggests a possible resolution of the great British dilemma. For the show Boyle is likely to produce will surely understand something important about this nation: that the whingeing and complaining are not a repudiation of national identity, but a part of it. Sunder Katwala, founder of the thinktank British Future and a cheerful enthusiast for the Games, is not worried by the naysayers&apos; grumbling: &quot;Their cynicism is a performative act of Britishness,&quot; he says. &quot;They&apos;re part of the chorus.&quot; Boyle, he reckons, will get that. There will be no Beijing-style massed, precision choreography: &quot;Opening ceremonies organised by the politburo deserve a raspberry,&quot; Katwala says. We remain the people George Orwell described in the essay Your England. &quot;Why is the goose-step not used in England?&quot; Orwell asked. &quot;It is not used because the people in the street would laugh.&quot; Boyle knows that there can be no North Korean pageantry, nor any of the unironic, chest-puffing patriotism of LA 1984. No one in Britain says what Americans say regularly \u2013 &quot;Is this a great country or what?&quot; \u2013 not without an arched eyebrow anyway. So Boyle&apos;s ceremony will surely incorporate humour, self-deprecation and some of that nonconformist spirit that is continuously British. It is a big task for one evening, even one that cost \u00a327m, but it will be part of a process under way since the end of the second world war, as we look for our place in the world. When London first hosted the Games in 1908, it was clear: Britain was a mighty empire that saw its natural place as bestriding the global stage, setting the sporting rules the rest of the world would follow for nearly a century and topping the medals table while we were at it. In 1948 it was a battered and exhausted London that played host, knowing that the days of imperial glory were gone for ever. What followed were decades of uncertainty over where the country was meant to go next. The result, says Szymanski, is that &quot;we can be a bit like a manic depressive, with mood swings. Sometimes we think we&apos;re the best in the world, sometimes the worst. But we need to be realistic: we&apos;re neither.&quot; London 2012 is predicated on an answer to that stubborn question about where we belong. It&apos;s worth going back to the bid the capital made seven years ago, especially to the three-minute video which reportedly won over wavering IOC hearts in Singapore. It hardly featured London at all. Instead it showed children in a South African township and a Latin American street market, in China and Russia, dreaming of heading to London to win Olympic gold. This, says sportswriter Mihir Bose, who was there that day, was a radical departure from the &quot;arrogance&quot; not only of the French bid \u2013 whose video was full of images of the magnificence of Paris \u2013 but of past British approaches. No longer was Britain casting itself as the imperial power, which once came to the countries of others, determined to shape their futures. Instead it was inviting the people of the world to come to Britain, where they might shape their own destiny. &quot;It worked because it&apos;s true,&quot; says Tony Travers. &quot;People do want to come to dear old London because they see it as Dick Whittington saw it, as a place of opportunity, a place to make their fortune. That&apos;s true for all the Africans and Poles and Americans, to name but three, who are already here. It&apos;s true of the Games because it&apos;s true of the underlying reality.&quot; You won&apos;t hear Sebastian Coe say this, for fear of annoying the rest of the country, but, in this regard at least, this was about London, not Britain. For years, the IOC had told Britain that if it were serious about winning the games, Manchester or Birmingham would not cut it: it had to be London. (That fits with a general Olympic shift, away from the likes of Montreal, Barcelona and Atlanta, and towards capitals and mega-cities.) And, if ethnic diversity was the pitch \u2013 the notion of London as a kind of world colony, settled by the peoples of the globe \u2013 then only the capital could make it. It is London, not Britain, that can boast of being the most plural and various spot on the planet (indeed, narrowing it down, Travers says that honour may well belong to the N15 postcode). London is less segregated than even that other great world city, New York, where communities tend to live in more tightly defined enclaves. But London is also different in kind, not just degree, from the rest of Britain. Between 35% and 40% of Londoners were born outside the UK, while in parts of the capital the number of babies born to mothers born outside the UK tops 50%. The offer of what Travers calls a &quot;neutral homeland&quot; for the 2012 Games is one only London, not Britain, could make. There was a time when such talk would have spelled deep alienation between the capital and the rest of the country as well as arousing the ire of British traditionalists. Some people still speak of Planet London, as if the city were utterly separate from the rest of Britain. But it&apos;s not just the success of the torch relay that suggests such thinking is becoming out of date. Katwala reckons that diversity is no longer always understood as a break or rejection of Britain&apos;s past, as it once was, but rather as continuous with it. &quot;It&apos;s a very British globalism, it says this is where our story has got us.&quot; It&apos;s about a river Thames that opens out on to the seas or about Shakespeare, celebrated in a festival this year as a global writer whose eyes were never just on Britain but on Rome, Athens, Venice and the great stories of the world. Much of this shift has happened within the last decade. Traditionalists in the Thatcher period clung to the old verities of national identity while struggling with the new, varied face of modern Britain. Modernisers in the Blair period were comfortable with diversity but didn&apos;t know how to talk about the past. Part of the failure of the Millennium Dome was its aversion to history, its fondness for the novel, adhering to Blair&apos;s ruling that Britain was &quot;a young country&quot;. What 2012 suggests, with its combination of the Queen&apos;s diamond jubilee and the Games, memorably condensed by Twenty Twelve as the Jubilympics, is a synthesis: a more comfortable affirmation of both our past and our present. Katwala says the old choice was between national pride on the one hand and acceptance that Britain had changed on the other: &quot;Now we can be proud of the nation that has changed.&quot; It helps that the Conservative party is headed by a man who won the leadership in that Olympic bid year of 2005 by declaring he loved Britain as it is, not how it used to be. It&apos;s a good bet that plenty of these messages will be conveyed in the opening ceremony on Friday night, depicting a nation that is both ancient and postmodern, that cherishes its green pastures as well as the grit and grime of its cities. It may be that none of that gets through to the outside world. Szymanski, British-born but now based in the US, says the American coverage has shown only snapshot glimpses of Britain by way of background \u2013 and it is still the cliches of old: &quot;Big Ben. Tower Bridge. What will Kate be wearing? The royal family. Tea. Eccentrics. Bad weather. Dodgy infrastructure.&quot; Maybe we should not let that worry us. Maybe, like some of the most successful host nations, we should just relax and invite the world to have a fortnight of fun, rather than fretting about legacy and meaning. But it&apos;s hard to relax when so much is at stake. Seven years ago we told the world that we could come together to stage a spectacular Olympic Games and that we were a kinder, gentler, more inclusive country, open to the rest of humanity. The world believed it. The question is, can we believe it too?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/27/world-hepatitis-day-silent-disease-response", "sentences": ["There are systemic barriers to testing in many countries in the region such as Vietnam, Singapore, Philippines, or Thailand where people are required to pay for testing."], "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T09:39:43Z", "title": "World Hepatitis Day: the silent disease needs a global response | Ding-Shinn Chen and Jack Wallace", "tags": ["Global development", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis C", "Health", "Society", "Infectious diseases", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "The silent nature of viral hepatitis infection has an enormous impact on the capacity and willingness of governments across the world to develop and implement effective policy and health responses to these diseases. The burden of viral hepatitis is stark, particularly in Asia Pacific where the prevalence is greatest, with approximately 340 million people living with chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C. This is almost eight times the number of people in the region infected with HIV, tuberculosis (TB) or malaria (42 million). In 2011, the World Health Organisation&apos;s (WHO) south-east Asia office reported there are 120,000 deaths annually related to hepatitis C and 300,000 related to hepatitis B. Viral hepatitis is a significant health problem, but its silent nature \u2013 there are no symptoms in the early phases, so people are often unaware that they are infected with hepatitis B and C until it is too late \u2013 has meant that the diseases have not had the same global and regional response as HIV, TB and malaria, and this lack of co-ordination continues to undermine global health efforts. In 2010, there were signs that things were changing, with the agreement of a resolution on viral hepatitis by the World Health Assembly, but its implementation to date has been slow and unco-ordinated. Ahead of World Hepatitis Day on Saturday, this week&apos;s publication of a global framework by WHO is another important milestone, but it runs the risk of failing to deliver if the denial that exists around chronic hepatitis, among individuals and in health systems, is not addressed. Hepatitis B, which is transmitted from mother to child or through bodily fluids, is prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. There has been some recent good news from China, which successfully reduced the number of children under five with hepatitis B from 5.5% in 1992 to less than 1% in 2005, according to WHO. But there remain huge barriers for implementing vaccination programmes among babies and young people in the region. Although there is access to vaccines, the implementation can be problematic where there are fundamental weaknesses in health systems. In countries such as Papua New Guinea or Laos there are simply not the health services nor workers available to carry out vaccinations. For most people with viral hepatitis, the infection has no obvious symptoms, meaning that their disease is likely to progress to a point where treatment has limited impact. Most people with viral hepatitis do not know they are infected. Even in countries such as Taiwan and Australia where hepatitis is recognised as a priority health issue, a sizeable proportion of people are yet to be diagnosed. There are systemic barriers to testing in many countries in the region such as Vietnam, Singapore, Philippines, or Thailand where people are required to pay for testing. This essentially limits the number of people who know they are infected and the ability to reduce the impact of infection. Hepatitis B infection is complex, and liver damage as a result of the infection occurs over many years. Most people with chronic hepatitis B will not require treatment, but will need to be monitored to identify when liver damage is taking place. Only about 15-25% of people need to receive treatment for the infection. However, for people who do know that they have the infection, access to health services can be an issue. Of the 300,000 to 400,000 people living with chronic hepatitis B in Hong Kong, 80,000-90,000 people (25%) need treatment, and only half are being treated Like many 21st-century health issues, viral hepatitis knows no borders. Migration and other movements of people mean that comprehensive and co-ordinated responses to the infection within and across countries are imperative if the burden of infection is to be reduced or eliminated. In collaboration with the Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University, the Coalition for the Eradication of Viral Hepatitis in Asia Pacific (Cevhap) has developed a research plan to assist countries and the World Health Assembly to identify the essential elements of a strategic response to chronic viral hepatitis. This work is under way, with assessment of the policy in Taiwan, a needs assessment of people with chronic viral hepatitis across five locations in China, and support for the facilitation of partnership development initiatives in Malaysia and India. Lessons from other international health issues such as HIV can support the development of effective policy and health responses to viral hepatitis. One lesson is the importance of broad-based partnerships in policymaking, something that has been woefully lacking in Asia. More important, however, is the need for WHO to establish a sustainable mechanism for international funding and implementation of the new global framework and the newly formed Global Hepatitis Programme, similar to those that exist for HIV, TB and malaria. An effective policy framework can prevent new infections, ensure people can access clinical care, and reduce the burden of infection at an individual, country and regional level. That will only be possible if funding is increased considerably. The global response provided by UNAids, the Stop TB Partnership and the Rollback Malaria Partnership show what can be achieved if governments, the medical community, donor organisations and civil society work together. Viral hepatitis can be eliminated with resources, co-ordination and willingness, but, as the world recognises the second WHO-endorsed World Hepatitis Day, a lack of funding remains the single greatest barrier to tackling these diseases. \u2022 Professor Ding-Shinn Chen is a distinguished chair professor at the department of internal medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University and is chair of Cevhap.

NBC&apos;s broadcast, which began as the live ceremony was finishing in London, left out sections including the reflective moment when the Scottish singer Emeli Sand\u00e9 sang Abide with Me.

Were I daft enough once again to find myself as a &quot;working producer&quot;, I&apos;d be dealing with the impact of every kind of digital technology, from looking at potential cast on YouTube and available locations on Google Street View to screening the completed movie on a 3D digital projector. The skills required to excel, for example, in the field of digital effects are a mixture of creative and technical competences that have traditionally been found in very few individuals. This has to change. Had we focused on those skills and entrepreneurship two decades ago, we might now be in a position to generate the type of jobs and growth we so desperately need, by accessing the massive uptake in tablets and smart phones, and taking the lead in markets that weren&apos;t even on the map in the early 1990s. Looking at the broadband speeds available in some of the more affluent areas of Asia such as Singapore or South Korea, you get a sense of the direction in which things are going and the nature of the opportunity that&apos;s beginning to open up. Unfortunately we have created an imbalance between support and protection for the supply-side of production, with nothing like enough attention being paid to the growth of the demand-side. We&apos;ve reached what I&apos;ll call a Radio Caroline moment, the type of political and societal shift in which mainstream attitudes find themselves slipping out-of-sync with &quot;the cultural zeitgeist&quot;.\u00a0 I&apos;m old enough to have lived through at least two of these &quot;revolutions&quot;.\u00a0The first occurred in advertising between 1962 and 1964. In early 1962, most account executives still came to work in pinstripe suits and carrying furled umbrellas, looking like investment bankers, and their clients liked it that way.\u00a0By the end of 1964, such sartorial splendour would probably have lost them both their clients and their job. Similarly, when I first went to Hollywood in 1969, it was run by half-a-dozen men, all in their 70s and called Sol, who were married to each other&apos;s sister, chewed large cigars and played poker together at the weekend. By 1972, the Easy Riders had driven the last of the Sols out of town and Messrs Scorsese, Coppola and Lucas ruled the roost.\u00a0 Both those early 60s Ad (or Mad) Men and their Movie Mogul counterparts had been caught asleep at the wheel. I sincerely believe the same is true right now.\u00a0My favourite newspaper columnist, Tom Friedman of the New York Times, wrote this recently: &quot;Obama should aspire to make America\u00a0the\u00a0launching pad where everyone everywhere should want to come to launch their own moon shot, their own start-up, their own social movement.&quot; We can&apos;t stimulate or tax-cut our way to growth. We have to invent our way there. The majority of new jobs now are created by start-ups. The days when Ford came to town with 10,000 jobs are over. Instead, we need 2,000 people in every town, each starting something that employs maybe five people. Therefore, we should aspire to be the world&apos;s best launch pad because our workforce is so productive, our markets the freest and most trusted, our infrastructure and internet band width the most advanced. Also, our openness to foreign talent should be second to none, our funding for basic research the most generous and our education system unrivalled What Tom Friedman is describing is precisely what the UK should be doing and arguably could be doing rather more easily than the US, given the wealth of creativity we have at our disposal. All that is lacking is the leadership, the commitment and the political imagination needed for success.

It was very, very well done. This was about Great Britain; it didn&apos;t pretend it was trying to have global appeal. Because Great Britain has self-confidence, it doesn&apos;t need a monumental Olympics. But for China that was the only imaginable kind of international event. Beijing&apos;s Olympics were very grand \u2013 they were trying to throw a party for the world, but the hosts didn&apos;t enjoy it. The government didn&apos;t care about people&apos;s feelings because it was trying to create an image. In London, they really turned the ceremony into a party \u2013 they are proud of themselves and respect where they come from, from the industrial revolution to now. I never saw an event before that had such a density of information about events and stories and literature and music; about folktales and movies. At the beginning it dealt with historical events \u2013 about the land and machinery and women&apos;s rights \u2013 epically and poetically. The director really did a superb job in moving between those periods of history and today, and between reality and the movies. The section on the welfare state showed an achievement to be truly proud of. It clearly told you what the nation is about: children, nurses and a dream. A nation that has no music and no fairytales is a tragedy. There were historical elements in the Beijing opening ceremony, but the difference is that this was about individuals and humanity and true feelings; their passion, their hope, their struggle. That came through in their confidence and joy. It&apos;s really about a civil society. Ours only reflected the party&apos;s nationalism. It wasn&apos;t a natural reflection of China. Few of the people were performers. They were ordinary people who contribute to society \u2013 and if there is a celebration, then it should be for everyone from the Queen to a nurse. I feel happy that they can all have their moment to tell their story. It was about real people and real events and showed the independent mind of the director, but at the same time it had so much humour. There was a strong sense of the British character. The Chinese ceremony had so much less information and it wasn&apos;t even real. It wasn&apos;t only about the little girl who was miming \u2013 which was an injury to her and the girl whose voice was used \u2013 but that symbolically showed the nation&apos;s future. You can&apos;t trust or rely on individuals or the state&apos;s efforts. In London there were more close-ups \u2013 it didn&apos;t show the big formations. It had the human touch. In Zhang Yimou&apos;s opening ceremony there was almost none of that. You could not push into a person&apos;s face and see the human experience. What I liked most with this was that it always came back to very personal details. And that&apos;s what makes it a nation you can trust; you see the values there. Anyone who watched it would have a clear understanding of what Britain is. Miranda Sawyer: A collective vision Horny-handed men of toil doing a Stand and Deliver formation dance. Hundreds of NHS nurses combining to assist the birth of a giant glowing baby (pictured). Those amazing butterfly bicycles. It seems daft to pick out individual elements of this great and glorious pageant \u2013 though James Bond&apos;s helicopter ride with the Queen was a proper &quot;whoop whoop&quot; moment \u2013 as Danny Boyle&apos;s vision was a deliberately collective one. He chose to celebrate what we can achieve together. When he picked out single people \u2013 Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Tim Berners-Lee, Mr Bean \u2013 it was to highlight what they gave to us all. Berners-Lee&apos;s words on the openness of the web, flashed around the stadium in letters the size of skyscrapers, was what this event was about. This Is For Everyone. At times I was reminded of the Green Fields at Glastonbury at 5am \u2013 the drums, the people, the benevolent united madness \u2013 and Danny Boyle&apos;s come-one-come-all attitude is very post-rave. It extended right through to the lighting of the flame by seven young athletes and the petals of that flame, one for each competing country, coming together to form one enormous torch. A proper goosebumps moment, but just one among many. The music section, though it sounded great, was the least successful visually, as a house flashing with images of Hugh Grant bibbling, of Renton running, just didn&apos;t seem all that thrilling after we&apos;d had an enormous Voldemort growing before our very eyes. And there were a few weird omissions \u2013 no Oasis? Stone Roses? Primal Scream? Adele? \u2013 though, to be honest, they might have been in there but just whizzed past. To see Dizzee Rascal belt out Bonkers really did make me proud. That wouldn&apos;t have happened anywhere else. The United States has the musical chops, but would have drowned us with gloop and sentiment. The only bit that failed was good old Sir Paul McCartney: not because he&apos;s bad, but because he seems to have been singing Hey Jude in a stadium for the past five years. It felt slightly hackneyed, something we&apos;ve seen before, and nothing else \u2013 absolutely nothing else \u2013 about this ceremony was anything other than original. It was terrific, spectacular, moving, wonderful. Oh, the joy of people! It made me cry. Nicholas Kenyon: Music from the iPod shuffle generation So this is what it means to be British today. Danny Boyle&apos;s delirious dreamscape wove together pageantry, pastoral, pain and pride to create a new vision of nationhood \u2013 a supremely fresh portrait of that special mixture of enduring tolerance and suppressed passion that has always underlined our national identity. A powerful sense of community drove every moment of the swirling, surreal sequence, from the gentle, idealised, pastoral idyll that began it, though the iron-forging impact of the industrial revolution, to the healing hospital sequences and the diversity created by immigration \u2013 all involving hundreds of volunteers demonstrating superhuman commitment in the vast Olympic arena. Voices united the nations of the kingdom, but singing their hymns and songs unaccompanied, without any bombast: Jerusalem an unearthly single line, Abide With Me a personal lament stripped to the bone. Elgar mingled with David Bowie, Handel with Dizzee Rascal: it was (at least until the final predictable McCartney singalong) the music of the iPod shuffle age. What has created our imagined memory of Britishness now? Boyle&apos;s answer was phantasmagorically all-inclusive: EastEnders, the Archers, Monty Python, CND, the Jarrow crusade, Kes, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Full Monty \u2013 endlessly varied allusions, barely linked, a multimedia collage of images stocked somewhere at the back of our minds. We have an enduring problem in a culturally diverse era, because those who value our tradition and love our history too often cling to it as a reassurance to imagine the past has not changed. And those whose motto used to be Cool Britannia reject the past as a useless burden and abandon all sense of heritage (remember the Dome?) Boyle pointed beyond that to an attempt at reintegration: there was no Rule Britannia here, no mindless waving of union flags. At every point, heritage was valued, but gently undermined by humour: the corgis left on the steps of Buckingham Palace by the Queen&apos;s departing helicopter, Rowan Atkinson wittily sending up Chariots of Fire, a royal kiss matched by a same-sex kiss. It wasn&apos;t Land of Hope and Glory that we were all invited to come together and sing, it was I&apos;m Forever Blowing Bubbles: a postmodern picture of a world in search of its future. It wasn&apos;t quite a new Jerusalem, yet. To create a newly reconciled Britain of old and new, tradition and innovation \u2013 that is surely a task beyond any single event, even the most watched TV spectacular in the world. But what Danny Boyle and his committed crowds reflected with honesty, vividness and piercing imagination was a supremely humane vision of where we are now, and how we have become what we are. It will stay in the mind a long time after the Games. The world could not ask for more. Nicholas Kenyon is an Observer critic and managing director of the Barbican Centre  Emmy the Great: It made me addicted to patriotism Like many Londoners, I&apos;ve spent the last six months making an Olympic sport of complaining about the Olympics. Complaining, I felt, is what we do best, along with being cynical, unwelcoming to visitors, and a bit moany about traffic. All the bloody adverts! Giving directions to tourists! Those awful mascots. Danny Boyle was going to have to come at me with a wrecking ball to break down the barriers of uninterest that I had erected. And in a way he did. In fact, it&apos;s really hard writing this without the excessive use of capitals. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever felt quite such a bewildering mixture of true excitement and national pride over things I never really had an opinion on before, like Harry Potter, or Mr Bean, who had me weeping with laughter. During the runup I was aware that there are things about England that I am proud of. Not sport, really, but culture, and the NHS. To see this reflected on the screen during the opening ceremony actually blew my mind. I thought the NHS scene was incredibly brave, and I loved how much pop music featured. Whenever I travel, I am always aware of how our rich culture of great rock&apos;n&apos;roll affects people&apos;s opinion of us abroad. I feel like Boyle got the tone right every step of the way. It was knowing, but sincere, dark and hilarious, like we are. And it was everything I needed to get excited about the next few weeks. By the end of the night, I was so addicted to patriotism I started cheering for countries that I&apos;d visited, or that I&apos;d once met someone from. It felt amazing. I think all the medals should be melted down and made into one giant medal for Danny Boyle. They should just make him king of something. He should get to marry the Queen. Neither the royal wedding or jubilee gave me warm feelings towards the monarchy, but the sight of the Queen jumping out of a helicopter with James Bond has just made me her biggest fan. I love how deadpan she was. It&apos;s like she&apos;s spent the last 60 years gearing up towards this moment, so we could see that her no-smile policy is a humour device. I feel like Kenneth Branagh in the industrial revolution scene right now, looking upon Britain with satisfaction and pride. Go team! Jackie Kay: Bonkers, but brilliant bonkers Within seconds I&apos;m hooked: Brunel, Branagh, Bond, Bean \u2026 breathtaking, bold, brazen. Boyle might well have sat with his dictionary open at the letter B, but I&apos;m giving him an A gold star. Boyle&apos;s bonanza even included Oh Danny Boy at the beginning, which is what I find myself saying at the end: oh Danny boy. It is bonkers. But brilliant bonkers! It effortlessly mixed the past with the present, the working class with the Queen, fact with fiction, and told the complex dual narratives of these islands, sometimes tongue in cheek: even the Queen got a doppelg\u00e4nger. It seemed that Boyle had invented a new kind of opening ceremony, a concept ceremony, one that embraces big ideas as passionately as it does technical flamboyancy. The singing flaming copper kettles was a wow moment. Another favourite was the cycling doves of peace (or were they angels?), one of them rising like ET. It was moving, the countries parading in their snazzy outfits (my favourite was Cameroon). It made you think, if all these nations can come together for sport, then please. It made you long for peace. Nice touch, the dancers forming into the CND sign, the arrival of the Windrush, the stadium builders there for the arrival of the flame, the flag carried by, among others, Doreen Lawrence. The inspiring use of volunteers.The laid-back way that Boyle showed us all in all our colours; the inclusiveness did not feel forced. It moved from the pastoral to the industrial to the digital with athletic alacrity, using film and theatre and symbols along the way. It was bitty, it was dotty, but the bits made a whole, and we joined the dots. It will keep us thinking. In the future, people will study this ceremony and find other hidden clues. A fantastic neverland of them. It will be replayed. It might be the only gold we get. Jackie Kay is a Scottish poet and novelist Trevor Phillips: A dazzling, inventive tapestry This was not the Britain that the world knows. But Britishness isn&apos;t about pedestrian reality; it&apos;s about myth \u2013 what we tell ourselves we have been, and what we hope to be. Danny Boyle&apos;s pageant took shards of our folk memory, and threads of our everyday experience and conjured a beguiling vision of the Britain that we could be \u2013 energetic, inventive, witty, profound, and delightful. Every part of our inherited culture was woven into a dazzling tapestry. Who will ever forget the forging of the rings; the wicked Mr Bean send-up; or Her Majesty&apos;s impeccable comic timing? Anyone who thinks that this was just a sparkling mash-up of British history has missed the point entirely. From the opening anthems to the blistering party night Boyle asserted our tolerance and diversity as the quintessential British quality. I was moved by the appearance of the Windrush story \u2013 a recent piece of myth-making in which my own family played an important part. And the most striking thing about the Saturday-night-in scene was that in 21st-century Britain, its multiracial family no longer seemed striking at all. Boyle&apos;s genius has created a new myth about a Britain made rich and vibrant by its diversity, for others to see and to admire. To people in countries impoverished and racked by ethnic bias and religious conflict, this will look like the true wonder of these isles. Trevor Phillips is chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission Martin Durkin: Dim-brained leftwing history When it comes to blowing vast quantities of other people&apos;s money, no one can beat the Statist left. So it was entirely appropriate to entrust the Olympic opening jamboree to the miserable northern socialist Danny Boyle. He kicked off with apple-cheeked villagers prancing round the maypole and frolicking in their feudal rural idyll, but then came the sound of ominous drums. To everyone&apos;s horror, giant menacing, smoking factory chimneys started to rise up from the land. In the background, the moaning Romantic Blake was doing his dark satanic stuff, while the BBC commentator laid it on thick about wicked industry disfiguring the landscape and cruelly uprooting everyone. I was still reeling from this extravagant display of dim-brained leftwing history, and looking in vain for any mention of Newton, global trade and so on, when suddenly whole wards of hospital beds were wheeled on. My daughter asked me what the glowing duvets were meant to represent. John Lewis? But then the stadium was flooded with light, and three giant flaming letters shouted out the answer \u2026 NHS. It was at this point that I choked on my gin and tonic. What really sets Britain apart (besides our shocking nationalised health system) is the brilliant achievement of being the first proper capitalist nation, and everything that went with it: far greater prosperity for ordinary people, parliamentary democracy, toleration, a sense of fair play and decency and humour (which Rowan Atkinson represented very nicely). But in the topsy-turvy world of Danny Boyle, industrial capitalism is what&apos;s wicked and shameful about Britain. What&apos;s good is the NHS \u2013 not because of the quality of health provided (how could it be?!), but because it is state-owned. Polly Stenham: The BBC commentary was hilarious I didn&apos;t know this was a directing gig you could have \u2013 it&apos;s the best directing job on the planet, 2 billion people watching your nutcase ideas. It was a massive school play! You had the best boys in the band, and the headmistress the Queen, then all the audience participating. You had the bits that weren&apos;t so good, that kind of fucked up, but it kept in the spirit of England&apos;s school play. I felt very uplifted by it. The use of the Tempest was brilliant. It was fabulous, and it was right that it all unravelled from a bit of Shakespeare. The BBC commentary was absolutely hilarious, they had no idea what was going on. I thought the best bit, the sexiest bit, was the Arctic Monkeys doing Come Together. Unlike Beijing, it had a sense of humour. The Queen in the helicopter was brilliant \u2013 the moment with Bond and the helicopter was the moment we beat Beijing! Ending with McCartney was smart and predictable and it felt right. I felt very proud, it was raggle-taggle and messy and had so many volunteers \u2013 it had a really nice spirit to it. My only criticism is that it lost its mind for about 10mins, but I think that was because something had to be cut. There was some business with a boy and a girl and some mobile phones, but I didn&apos;t understand that at all. Aside from that it was fabulous and I liked the way some of it wasn&apos;t right. Something slick and military-esque would have left me a bit cold. Harvey Goldsmith: It really was sensational I was lucky: I went to the final dress rehearsal and I watched it on TV on the night, so I&apos;ve seen both sides of it. Coming out of the dress rehearsal I thought it was extraordinary. The difficulty is how you capture that on TV. They did a pretty good job, but it really was sensational live. Most people loved the Bond bit, but I wasn&apos;t so overjoyed because it didn&apos;t seem to finish off properly. You saw them jump out of the helicopter and then it didn&apos;t end. If Craig had arrived in the stadium that would&apos;ve made it all work. The Queen bit was funny and clever, but it was a bit disjointed. I was wondering what people abroad would think with all of the quirkiness, and some of the things like the Archers must have been a bit strange! The Rowan Atkinson part was a stroke of genius. The balance between dealing with the scale of it in a stadium and capturing it on TV is always difficult. He made it as if it was a movie, the way it morphed from the first scene with the cows and the cricket and so on, and it traversed the history really nicely. The other thing I was impressed with is the sound in the stadium \u2013 it was amazing, I didn&apos;t expect that at all. It&apos;s not easy in a place that size. You can always pick holes in something of this size and scale but overall it was pretty fantastic. Amber Charles: An interactive show It really was incredible. It wasn&apos;t a tense atmosphere in the stadium \u2013 it was like when you go to a really big festival or concert and everyone&apos;s happy to be there. The lights on the chairs were amazing and people could pick them up and move them. It was a really interactive show. We were right in the moshpit, so we could see everything \u2013 you weren&apos;t just sitting there watching, you felt like you were involved in it. Everything was a surprise on the night. My mum was involved in the dancing, so had seen the rehearsals, but she didn&apos;t tell me. I met the guy who designed the cauldron and he wouldn&apos;t tell us anything about it. When we saw the kids holding the little metal things we had no idea what they were doing \u2013 I thought it might be a seashell or something. When we realised what it actually was, it was amazing. Before it started I called my friends and asked them to videotape it for me. Watching it in person is amazing but we didn&apos;t get to see some of the stuff that happened on the other side of the stadium. I wanted to see all of it. I was really proud. Everyone knows London walks to the beat of our own drum, we have our own swagger. It was nothing like any opening ceremony I&apos;ve ever seen. It epitomised the nation. This is our country, our history, this is what you&apos;re going to get. It shows the International Olympic Committee that we&apos;ve taken this seriously and that this is going to be the greatest. Amber Charles was one of 34 other teenagers who were flown to Singapore in 2005 to help persuade the International Olympic Committee that her generation needed the Games to bring hope and opportunity to their neighbourhoods. PY Gerbeau: Typical British humour It was extremely British, extremely eccentric, and an incredible challenge to take on. People say maybe not everyone understood it \u2013 I tell you, everybody understood it. The only thing that didn&apos;t compute with me was the NHS bit. But I&apos;m being detailed here because it was breathtaking, phenomenal, every single adjective. It was full of nice touches with David Beckham, Muhammad Ali, and I had my money forever on Steve Redgrave to light it. He&apos;s the best British Olympic athlete ever, and he personalises every value of the Olympic movement. Forget British at its best, it was entertainment at its best. From all the cock-ups at previous events, Britain has shown its best face to the world and it was so important to do it. The Bond bit with her majesty showed the world the typical British sense of humour. It&apos;s so important to start on a good note. It&apos;s all about the intangibles \u2013 you can argue about the budget for it, but it will affect lots of things, and the least important is the economy. The logistics of the operation was massive, but we need to hold our breath and hope for success of the whole Olympics, not just the ceremony. You&apos;ll always get the stories about the bus driver getting lost, or the wrong flag. Hopefully after last night these stories will be a bit of fun, not a drama.

The changes \u2013 almost certainly designed to protect the Glazers&apos; control of the club if the family cashes in further shares \u2013 is revealed in regulatory documents published as part of the club&apos;s planned flotation in New York. The float stands to net the Glazers around $150m (\u00a396m), despite previous assurances that proceeds would go towards paying down the club&apos;s debt. The US filing warns potential investors: &quot;Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Cayman Islands law [where Manchester United are incorporated] may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders, which could depress the price of our shares and prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.&quot; The filing goes on to say that the club&apos;s &quot;amended and restated memorandum and articles of association&quot; now permit the Glazers to issue new shares &quot;from time to time, with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate. Our board of directors could also authorize the issuance of preference shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction&quot;. The Glazers are only selling around 10% of the club through the stock market listing, so they would be able to block any takeover bid launched immediately after the float. However, financial experts said that the new anti-takeover clauses would protect their position if they needed to raise cash in the future by selling down their holding. The flotation documents also show that the Glazers have retained the option to sell an additional 2.5m of their shares, which would bolster their proceeds from the offering by $45m. Michael Moritz, a Cardiff-born Silicon Valley investor who is also a Manchester United fan and critic of the Glazers, said: &quot;The anti-takeover provisions further protect the Glazers. It is the financial equivalent of armed robbers leaving the scene of a crime and throwing nails on the road to stop pursuers.A pound of potatoes will be a better investment than the purchase of shares in Manchester United&apos;s stock offering. The only people who will be better off with this offering are the Glazers&quot;. Neither Manchester United nor Jefferies, the club&apos;s main adviser on the listing, returned phone calls or emails. Monday evening&apos;s statement \u2013 which described United as an &quot;emerging growth company&quot; despite revenues slumping by up to 5% in the last financial year \u2013 shows that the club will be valued at around $3bn if the listing goes off successfully. Assuming United can find enough buyers, the shares will begin trading next month. However, it is still far from clear that the club will be able to sell enough shares at what the Glazers consider an acceptable price, and concerns over the valuation have previously forced the club to abandon plans to list its shares in Hong Kong and then in Singapore. The investment bank Morgan Stanley is also believed to have stepped away from the flotation because of fears that the Glazer family had pinned too high a valuation on the club. Much of the investor concern comes down to the club&apos;s massive debt, which stood at \u00a3437m at the end of June, and how the balance sheet is potentially weighing the club down. Andy Green, a football finance writer behind the andersred blog, calculates that \u00a3520m has been taken out of United since the Glazers took the club over in 2005, with most of that figure being accounted for via interest and fees related to the club&apos;s borrowings. Meanwhile, of the \u00a3520m, \u00a338m has been paid directly to the Glazers via \u00a328m in consultancy fees to their companies and a \u00a310m dividend. Apart from raising money for the Glazers, a successful float of Manchester United will achieve two further aims. Firstly, it will raise around $150m to pay down debts. Second it will give the club a financial valuation, which the Glazers will eventually need if they are to cash in their investment by selling the club at some future point. How much United are worth is crucial to the balance of the family&apos;s finances. Wealth-X, a consultancy that specialises in high net worth individuals, estimates Malcolm Glazer&apos;s fortune at $2.7bn, $1.3bn of which is tied to United. His stake in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is worth another $980m and First Allied, his ailing shopping malls business, another $8.5m. The rest is cash shares and property."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/01/taiwan-facebook-photographs-leeds-london-shang-ting-peng", "sentences": ["Due to demand the book has now also been released into more of the Far East including Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-01T06:00:00Z", "title": "Taiwanese lass hunts cool in Leeds and exports it all over the world", "tags": ["Taiwan", "Leeds", "London", "Books", "Life and style", "Culture"], "article": "   The Observing Diary duo get Taiwan's TV chat show treatment    I love the quirky, the fresh and the unexpected - things I see, don&apos;t quite understand but know have some weird significance. I love this one, it&apos;s so left-field and thoroughly modern, full of those things I don&apos;t quite understand, which is to say: the young, funky and trend setting.  A Facebook page set up three years ago by a couple of Taiwanese lasses to share their UK experiences and fascinations with friends and family has become an internet (and now publishing) phenomenon. Shang Ting Peng and Chia-Wen Liu now have over 117,000 followers on The UK Observing Diary Facebook page, over 10 million hits a month and when I checked out the page a single photo had over 19,000 likes.  Yes, I know some people tweet to millions but this isn&apos;t Justin Bieber; this hasn&apos;t got the mundane, cynical clout of the big business, manipulative, multi-media industry machine behind Lady Gaga. This is a couple of ordinary people from Taiwan.  This is cyber street, one of those organic things set up by smart individuals that hit on something and just kept growing. Hundreds of likes turned into thousands and when the page hit around 6,000 the Guardian Northerner&apos;s John Baron wrote a short article about it on Guardian Leeds This got picked up in Taiwan feeding into an internet frenzy and national TV and press coverage. The page is based around Leeds (Shang Ting Peng) and London (Chia-Wen Liu), photo-centric with brief comments in &apos;traditional Chinese&apos;, Mandarin. A guide to all things lifestyle in the two cities; fashion, food, restaurants, cool people, cool brands, bands, events, tourism, interesting buildings, etc; things that are different in the UK to the Far East but also anything that catches their eye, so a brief post about Louis Le Prince making the world&apos;s first film in Leeds went down a storm.            As the story spread and the number of likes hit the tens of thousands Taiwanese publishers came calling about a book and a deal was signed for the first ever UK Observing Diary book. That&apos;s where the women are now, back in Taiwan promoting the book but before they even got there, or the book was released, it entered the Taiwan equivalent of the Amazon chart at number three, number one in the popular travel category, and a second print run was rushed through. Their book tour included interviews with Taiwan&apos;s trendiest magazine for young women (Brand Magazine) and multiple national newspaper, radio and TV seshes. They are big news. To top it all off, from a fashion point of view, there was an interview and photo shoot with Vogue. Due to demand the book has now also been released into more of the Far East including Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. The book launch, a collaboration between their publisher (Suncolour), the British Council and fashion designer/retailer Cath Kidston, was Taipei&apos;s trendy Eslite Books. The store was full, with people queuing outside to filter through and gets books signed after the presentation which - wait for it - included the Victoria Quarter, Back to Basics, Roundhay Park, the Thackray Medical Museum, the Owl Trail, places to study in Leeds and the cities development and future.     Shang Ting Peng and Chia-Wen Liu signing their book in Taipei. Well done John Baron and Guardian Leeds    The book, written in &apos;traditional Chinese&apos; and so only available online in the UK, reflects the women&apos;s fashion background, picture heavy and with the layout of a cool magazine. Shang Ting studied Fashion Communication at the European Institute of Design in Barcelona. Here she had the good fortune to meet an attractive Leeds lad and now works as Hebe Media&apos;s Head of Fashion and for the last year on the print version of the UK Observing Diary. She blogs about the Observing Diary experience at Leeds Online. The extent of my contemporary fashion knowledge ends at the inside leg measurement of my M&amp;S jogging bottoms - ooh, that and washing kids clothes \u2013sommat about R&apos;n&apos;B and almost Emo rockish music \u2013 but the large fashion element is of the streets, pictures of cool looking individuals snapped in the streets and Indi fashion designers/retailers.  The thing I like about newcomers to Leeds, be they from Runcorn or Peru, they look at our city with new eyes and perhaps the further they have travelled, culturally, the fresher the perspective. Because we walk past things every day, we miss the magic, the beauty submerges into a blur of bricks, the clutter of the familiar. To us fish&apos;n&apos;chips are just fish&apos;n&apos;chips but if you stumbled across them for the first time, at the other side of the world, they&apos;d contain magic.  The everyday is obviously cultural, contains a story. As a result of the Catholics&apos; tradition of eating fish rather than meat on a Friday, one in every five meals bought outside the home on a Friday is from a fish&apos;n&apos;chips shop. The ordinary can also tell us who we are; our traditional northern dish contains fish &apos;cooked the Jewish way&apos;. Leeds is a city built and shaped by incomers and Shang Ting is having a C21st impact. Having a mild Leeds obsession I absolutely love the idea of an adopted Leeds lass from Taiwan flogging the Leeds word all over the Far East. Although this was not her intention, she&apos;s a one woman Leeds marketing machine. It&apos;s also exciting that young people with an eye, a phone, an idea and an internet connection can make such a big splash and, it being what seems to be the only &apos;observing diary&apos; in the world, create a new publishing genre and experience.  What&apos;s next for Shang Ting Peng? Well obviously, she wants to work on her Leeds accent.

The figures emerge from the World Cities Culture Report 2012 published on Wednesday - an international survey which is the biggest of its kind examining in number crunching detail the cultural offerings of 12 cities, although the authors stress that it is not an attempt to rank them. One of the report&apos;s central points is that world cities are as important in terms of culture as they are in finance or trade. The report says: &quot;Culture in all its diverse forms is central to what makes a city appealing to educated people and hence to the businesses which seek to employ them.&quot; It was commissioned by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and is being published to coincide with a cultural summit in London in which representatives of the 12 cities - London, Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Mumbai, New York, Paris, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo - will gather to discuss common aims. Johnson said: &quot;World cities are international hubs for commerce and trade, but as this groundbreaking report makes clear, they are powerhouses for culture too \u2013 in London the creative industries alone contribute \u00a319bn to our economy and employ 386,000 people. In coming together as city leaders and policymakers we want to harness the full potential of culture, which makes our cities exciting and desirable places to live in and visit, but also makes a massive contribution to wider social and economic goals.&quot; The report says the contribution of the arts and creative industries is fundamental to a city&apos;s health. It uses 60 different indicators and reveals that London has the most museums at 173 which includes 11 national museums; while Berlin has 158 combined; Paris has 137; and New York has 131. Paris has the most art galleries (1,046) followed by London (857), New York (721) and Tokyo (688). The importance of public libraries is explored with Paris coming way out top in numerical terms. It has 830 public libraries compared to Shanghai&apos;s 477, London&apos;s 383, Tokyo&apos;s 377, Johannesburg&apos;s 234, New York&apos;s 220, Sydney&apos;s 154 and Berlin&apos;s 88. Paris also has more bookshops \u2013 1,025 to London&apos;s 802, although Tokyo has the most (1,675); Shanghai has 1,322 and Johannesburg has 1,020. Paris has the most cinemas (302) and cinema screens (1,003) in the world, while London has 108 cinemas and 566 screens. New York comes out top in terms of number of theatres. It has 420, compared to 353 in Paris, 230 in Tokyo, 214 in London and 184 in Istanbul. London&apos;s theatre admissions total is the second highest at 14.2m \u2013 but it is dwarfed by New York which has twice that number at 28.1m. Paris is top in terms of live music venues: a figure of 423 compared to 385 in Tokyo; 349 in London; 294 in Sao Paulo and 277 in New York. London does come top for comedy performances: 11,388 compared to 11,076 in New York and 10,348 in Paris. And the city also has a strikingly high number of restaurants with 37,450, or 478 for each 100,000 of population. The report addresses the assumption by some that the world is &apos;flattening&apos; or becoming more homogenous; that cities are becoming more similar places. &quot;What links world cities to one another is trade, commerce and finance. What makes them different from one another is culture.&quot; The report says many cultural elements shape a city whether &quot;its record shops, its large and small music venues, its libraries and book shops, its museums and galleries, its parks and open spaces, football clubs and cricket grounds, students and cafes.&quot; Paul Owens, of BOP Consulting, who led the research team said: &quot;Culture is an under-researched and poorly understood factor in the social and economic success of world cities.

The announcement on 1 August of the first tranche of government policymaking to be outsourced with the commissioning of a review looking at the working of the civil service in other countries, is not, in itself, a specific threat to the integrity or impartiality of the civil service, although it will look at more political systems for administration, such as that in the US, where incoming governments bring in their own administration. But it would be hard to tell that from the reports that accompanied the announcement, with headlines about civil service impartiality being put at risk and failing permanent secretaries facing the sack. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, said &quot;change that would damage the ability of civil servants to give impartial advice and would help ministers play to the party political gallery is to be firmly resisted&quot;. Kerslake was prompt to refute the speculation that the review involved politicisation of the civil service. &quot;Not true,&quot; he said, on his Twitter account, describing the coverage as another round of &quot;inaccurate stories&quot; and adding: &quot;We simply want to see what [we] can learn from others.&quot; But the coverage highlights the difficulties inherent in the civil service reform programme.

The review itself will analyse the structure and operation of governments in other countries, including Australia, Singapore, the US, France and Sweden and will &quot;specifically consider&quot; the New Zealand model, where there is a contractual relationship between ministers and the chief executives of government departments. Guy Lodge, associate director at thinktank IPPR, said initial attempts in New Zealand to reconfigure relationships between ministers and senior civil servants, based on very detailed contracts, were not successful. &quot;They didn&apos;t work from the ministers&apos; view, because they stipulated the nitty gritty detail,&quot; he commented. Instead, the approach has been changed to set out broad outcomes, overseen by the country&apos;s state service commissioner, the chief executive of the civil service, who oversees the appointment of senior civil servants and holds them to account. &quot;New Zealand is not the model for those interested in giving ministers more power over hiring and firing,&quot; said Lodge. &quot;That was rejected in favour of holding chief executives much more accountable over the things for which they are responsible, including whether their departments are fit for purpose, and that model could apply more to Whitehall.&quot; Thinktanks or academic institutions wanting to carry out this review, which is the first contestable piece of policy-making since it was announced as part of the civil service reform plan in June, have until the end of August to submit their bids for the \u00a350,000 contract. Announcing the review, Maude said that while the government is &quot;rightly proud&quot; of the civil service, it would be hubristic to assume there was nothing the UK could learn from other successful governments. &quot;For the first time ever, ministers are directly commissioning policy advice from outside Whitehall, moving towards our goal of opening up policymaking,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/02/francis-maude-thinktank-civil-service", "sentences": ["Maude said: &quot;While we are rightly proud of our civil service, we shouldn&apos;t hubristically assume that there&apos;s nothing we can learn from other successful governments, whether like Australia and New Zealand where they have political arrangements which are broadly similar to ours, or like Singapore or the United States where they are more distinct."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-01T23:01:01Z", "title": "Civil service shakeup: Francis Maude looks abroad for inspiration", "tags": ["Civil service", "Politics", "Francis Maude", "Thinktanks", "Public sector careers", "Society", "UK news"], "article": "In a fresh sign of the coalition&apos;s frustration at the civil service, the Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude will announce today that he is commissioning research into how foreign governments make civil servants personally contractually accountable to deliver ministerial objectives.

The thinktank Reform, one of the most influential critics of traditional civil service neutrality, argued before the election: &quot;The doctrine of ministerial responsibility should be abolished. It not only shields officials from taking personal responsibility for their actions but also draws ministers into the process of delivery. &quot;Instead, ministers should be responsible for the strategic direction of policy and its communication. Officials should be personally responsible for the construction of policy and the use of resources.&quot; Ironically the Conservatives were very critical of Labour&apos;s politicisation of the civil service, and the large number of special advisers, promising to cut them back as part of the a cost-cutting exercise.

The facilities at Stratford are as good as ever. The park, the flowers, the &quot;Henman hill&quot; are a delight. The opening was appropriately zany. Above all, television&apos;s celebration of youthful energy \u2013 when spared the endless BBC chat \u2013 is a diversion from the woes of the world. Nor is it fair to chide the athletes for Locog&apos;s incompetence, soldiers packing empty seats, public school bias or the weird plutocrats of the &quot;Olympic family&quot;, whom I saw yesterday tumbling out of our limousines into Harrods. So is it worth \u00a39bn? No, of course not. The Games was never worth that. But those who doubted that a passably competent nation with unlimited cash could deliver two weeks of sport were wrong. The Games seems enjoyable and remarkably scandal-free. More worrying is the impact on political discourse. Apparently any gesture of national prestige, glory and self-congratulation, once declared by government to be &quot;worth every penny&quot;, is beyond rational debate. To quarrel with any feature of the games is to be a whingeing, unpatriotic naysayer. Normally hard-headed politicians (and journalists) have gone soft in the head \u2013 flat-earthers, creationists, climate-change deniers. In 2005 Tessa Jowell was gushing that Athens had been rendered &quot;a changed place: cleaner, brighter \u2026 vibrant and modern&quot;, when it was already plunging off the cliff. In his final bid for London 2012 in Singapore, Ken Livingstone dubbed it the &quot;regeneration games&quot;. Locog&apos;s Lord Coe talked of the &quot;Olympics profit&quot;. David Cameron burbles on about &quot;making \u00a313bn&quot;. This is nothing to do with sport, nor with hosting the Games. It has to do with the manner of the hosting. There is a copious literature on the impact of big-budget sports events on host cities and how to avoid pitfalls. Studies from the International Association of Sports Economists (IASE) are relentlessly cautionary. Postmortems on Atlanta, Barcelona, Sydney, Athens and Beijing all tell of hotel slumps, unpaid debts, empty parks and subsequent disillusion. A study of Sydney by Australia&apos;s Monash University found there was no tangible benefit &quot;or economic boost&quot; from the Games. An IASE report on Atlanta called Bidding for the Games: Fool&apos;s Gold? found that &quot;diverting scarce resources from more productive uses translates into slower rates of economic growth&quot;. Civic leaders talk desperately of &quot;legacy&quot; but no survey can find any. Barcelona saw hotel occupancy fall from 80% to 50% in the year after the Games. The city&apos;s subsequent prosperity is now attributed to cheap flights and the Spanish boom. Beijing has seen no games-related uplift. On London, an exhaustive 2006 report for the European Tour Operators Association pointed out that sport is a &quot;notoriously narrowly focused&quot; form of travel, with no spillover into wider tourism. &quot;During the Olympics, a destination effectively closes for normal business,&quot; it warned. Mark Perryman&apos;s spirited survey, Why the Olympics Aren&apos;t Good for Us and How They Can Be, charts the same tale. More ironic is Mitchell Moss&apos;s How New York City Won the Olympics. It points to how, by losing the 2012 bid, resources allocated to the Games were diverted to the Lower West Side and other, now booming, locations. There is no shred of evidence for claims still being made by the government and others of an Olympics profit, fast weakening to a &quot;promotional legacy&quot;. Nor is there evidence of ministers recovering their brains. Today the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, described talk of ghost London as &quot;absolute nonsense&quot;. The city was booming, he said, and &quot;quids in&quot;. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, attacked ailing businesses, saying: &quot;This is hardly a surprise \u2026 there has been ample time to plan for [the Olympics].&quot; Their problem is they did. For years Robertson&apos;s department told everyone to prepare for a boom. Hotels raised prices and took on extra staff. Bus and tube drivers were paid bonuses to cope with the crush. Central London was told to expect an invasion and that residents should stay at home. This was the tone of every statement from the mayor, Boris Johnson, and his transport boss, Peter Hendy. Either these men were lying or their apparatchiks dared not tell them the truth. I can find no warning in recent years from any official body that August 2012 would be anything but a cash-rich bonanza. Last week Johnson was still hyperventilating like Big Brother over tube loudspeakers that passengers should expect &quot;a million extra visitors a day&quot;. He must have known this was rubbish. Reports were pouring in from London business associations of trade at hotel, restaurant, theatre and other tourist venues plummeting by an average of 30%. With August always down, they had been told to greet a &quot;games uplift&quot;. They must have a strong case for a class action against the mayor, who has been milking the games for all the politics he can. Clearly the authorities massively misjudged, but it was entirely because they refused to believe the evidence of past games. They were glory-blinded. Had the government said from the start that London was a rich city staging the Olympics as a costly but generous gesture to the world, there could be no further argument. Ministers said no such thing. From Cameron down, they claimed the games would make money, now and, if not now, then some time in the future. This was plain dishonest. Everyone knows there is no Olympic legacy, but, as with Santa Claus, we dare not tell the children. London will not recover the cost of the Olympics and may as well forget it. Having spent the money we should at least lie back and enjoy it. But we should stop pretending. The real victims of London&apos;s mind-numbing mendacity will be the poor and hapless citizens of Rio in 2016. They really cannot afford it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/03/twitter-guy-adams-online-censorship", "sentences": ["Last month the Twitter account of a promotion for Singapore was taken down without explanation."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-03T15:09:00Z", "title": "Twitter confronts ethics of commercial pressures in wake of Guy Adams 'mess'", "tags": ["Twitter", "Facebook", "US news", "World news", "Technology"], "article": "In January 2011 Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter, together with the site&apos;s &quot;trust and safety&quot; arbiter Alex Macgillivray, posted a paean to freedom of expression under the portentous title: The Tweets Must Flow. They promised they would respect everyone&apos;s human right to unimpeded speech, vowing only to remove tweets that were illegal, spam or in breach of privacy. Fine words. But this week the tweets stopped flowing for one of Twitter&apos;s users. When Guy Adams, the Independent&apos;s Los Angeles correspondent, went to issue his latest gobbet of wisdom in 140 characters on Monday he found his Twitter stream well and truly dammed. The suspension of Adams&apos; account, and its reinstatement on Tuesday, led to a storm of indignation culminating with an apology from Twitter. &quot;We did mess up,&quot; admitted Macgillivray \u2013\u00a0now Twitter&apos;s general counsel \u2013 &quot;and we will actively work to ensure this does not happen again&quot;. The most toxic aspect of the affair was the whiff of a commercial incentive. Adams was blocked after he posted a succession of tweets heavily critical of NBC for its tape-delayed broadcasts of the Olympics. When it was revealed that Twitter and NBC had entered into a business partnership for the Games, and that Twitter had tipped off the TV network to Adams&apos;s tweets, prompting the complaint that would lead to his suspension, the Twittersphere turned blue with rage. Twitter&apos;s quick and abject apology may have nipped in the bud the suspicion that it censored Adams for commercial gain, but doubts will remain. &quot;The whole incident reveals how easily people can be silenced in social media for commercial reasons if we are not vigilant in preventing it,&quot; says Rebecca MacKinnon, author of Consent of the Networked who sits on the board of Global Network Initiative, a body that fights internet censorship. This week&apos;s fiasco has also underlined the bewildering speed of Twitter&apos;s rise. Since Jack Dorsey (@jack) sent the very first tweet on 21 March 2006 (he wrote: &quot;inviting coworkers&quot;) the site has taken off at a rate that would make a Nasa rocket look sluggish. It now has more than 140 million active users, supports 30 different languages and has at its peak recorded 15,358 tweets per second (during Euro 2012). As a result of such exponential growth, the site is having to develop ethical systems in the blink of an eye that established media organisations refined over decades. Jonathan Zittrain, a specialist in internet law at Harvard, thinks the commercial pressures Twitter is now coming under are not dissimilar from the incentive a magazine might feel to pull articles that could upset a major advertiser. &quot;It sounds like Twitter is trying to articulate, and enforce, the kinds of editorial separation that reputable magazines have long embraced.&quot; Jillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation thinks the Adams saga has revealed a lack of clarity in Twitter&apos;s privacy policy. Adams was ostensibly suspended because he published the email address of an NBC executive, yet as he pointed out it was a public NBC address easily accessible on Google. York also calls for a more robust system allowing challenges to Twitter&apos;s actions. &quot;If Twitter decides that content should be taken down, there should be an appeals process allowing users to push back.&quot; For every Guy Adams able to generate a Twitter storm in the event of their accounts being suspended, there are countless other people around the world who are vulnerable because they lack the profile or the contacts to fight back. Last month the Twitter account of a promotion for Singapore was taken down without explanation. The organisers of the initiative presume it was blocked because the Twitter algorithm assumed the account was spam, which it wasn&apos;t. Yet in the absence of press publicity or protests, it took several days to get the account reinstated. &quot;There are many other cases of social media platforms kicking people off their sites that go quietly in the night, which nobody hears of,&quot; says MacKinnon. Despite the Adams furore, Twitter is still relatively highly considered by internet freedom campaigners. The Electronic Frontier Association gives Twitter 3.5 stars out of 4 for protecting users&apos; interests against government encroachments, compared with a miserable 1.5 for Facebook. Most open web advocates see Facebook as a far worse offender. Cases of heavy-handed suspensions by Facebook are legion, such as that of the certified breastfeeding adviser Anne Smith. Time and time again she has had her account disabled or deleted altogether for the sin of having posted photographs of breastfeeding women. &quot;I&apos;m extremely careful not to post pictures of nipples, not even a snippet of areola,&quot; she says. And yet still she is suspended, for 30 days at a time. She appeals, using a process recently implemented by Facebook, frequently with no response. &quot;I&apos;m furious. They shouldn&apos;t be censoring breastfeeding pictures, and they shouldn&apos;t be stopping me giving advice to women who need it.&quot; Behind these individual cases lies a bigger problem of consumer powerlessness in the social media firmament. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and the rest have become the modern equivalent of the public square. People get used to the idea that this space is their space; this Twitter account is their Twitter account. Yet it&apos;s not. It&apos;s Twitter&apos;s. &quot;Our daily lives are influenced by sites that we think are in the public sphere but are in fact private companies,&quot; says York. &quot;It&apos;s a huge concern that users don&apos;t have a say in the governance of these sites, because if they have their accounts discontinued they are in essence being excluded from the public sphere.&quot; Zittrain points out that the original building blocks of the internet \u2013 email, the web, newsgroups, relay chat \u2013 were all uncontrolled and &quot;unowned&quot;, with no global administrator. Now they are being supplanted by controlled counterparts like Facebook messaging available only to Facebook subscribers, or Apps instead of websites. &quot;There&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with that, but it does give rise to risks of compromise and control,&quot; he says. Or as Jeff Chester, a campaigner on internet privacy, puts it: &quot;Companies like Facebook and Twitter present themselves as engines of democracy and are hailed by the state department as engines of digital diplomacy, but their main purpose is to serve the biggest advertisers in the world. They sell themselves as empowering users, but in reality they are all about enhancing the dreams of Madison Avenue.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/aug/03/world-cities-culture-summit-report", "sentences": ["His comments came in the keynote address of the World Cities Culture Summit on 1 August at London&apos;s City Hall, which saw the launch of the World Cities Culture Report 2012, an international survey analysing the range of cultural assets and activities that are produced and consumed in 12 major cities: Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, London, Mumbai, New York, Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-03T16:38:00Z", "title": "World Cities Culture: a tale of 12 cities", "tags": ["Culture professionals network", "Policy", "Finance", "Leadership"], "article": "What makes a world city? According to British Museum director Neil MacGregor, it&apos;s not cultural integration in London&apos;s case, but a determined fostering of diversity. His comments came in the keynote address of the World Cities Culture Summit on 1 August at London&apos;s City Hall, which saw the launch of the World Cities Culture Report 2012, an international survey analysing the range of cultural assets and activities that are produced and consumed in 12 major cities: Berlin, Istanbul, Johannesburg, London, Mumbai, New York, Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. The report, produced by BOP consulting, is a substantial body of knowledge, packed full of revealing statistics and newly gathered data as well as pen portraits of each city alongside commentary to contextualise the findings. Its conclusion: that alongside finance and commerce, culture is the defining cornerstone that establishes a city as a powerhouse within the global economic system. The crux of the summit was MacGregor&apos;s compelling keynote. The British Museum is currently the most visited museum in the UK, attracting more than 5.8 million visitors in the past year. While some might say the British Museum was born out of empire, we were reminded how the museum was established as a consequence of the first global economy in the mid-18th century as a place where any global citizen can visit to gain insight on the interconnected network of human cultures throughout history. World cities are able to support the widest range of cultural activity because of their scale and diversity of people. Instead of forcing cultural integration, suggested MacGregor, London fosters diversity, enabling multiple cultural heritage identities to co-exist, producing art that is unique yet none-the-less inherently British. Hybridised art forms then emerge when ideas are blended together fuelled by their constantly changing populations and international connections \u2013 this forward-thinking approach is not a new argument but one that is more likely to succeed if universally embraced. MacGregor&apos;s words resonate in the context of London 2012. The opening ceremony of the Olympics was a celebration of the rich and continuously evolving nature of our cultural landscape. London is proudly portraying itself as a dynamic and heterogeneous environment where innovation thrives. MacGregor also emphasised that having a strong leader who enables a city to be cosmopolitan is crucial \u2013 commercial exchange and cultural exchange go hand in hand and it is the leader of a world city who lies at the helm of these transactions. Even if he gets stuck on a zip-wire from time to time. Boris Johnson wasn&apos;t there to personally enjoy the summit but MacGregor did show us a colourful PowerPoint slide show that included the Tower of Babel, ancient Vienna and images of the London mayor juxtaposed with other historical leader figures. It went down a treat with delegates and removed the impression that this event was simply a cheer-leading exercise. The ensuring plenary sessions reflected the nuances of different national cultural policies. Dr Bilgili, director of Istanbul&apos;s provincial directorate of culture and tourism acknowledged the challenge of balancing tradition with modernity and ensuring that both are valued in the context of Istanbul&apos;s young dynamic population and its rich history and architecture. Kate Levin, commissioner from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs explained the heavy investment in the arts and culture is most likely to be sustained through continued public-private investment and endowments from wealthy philanthropists. Professor Huang, vice-president of Shanghai Theatre Academy touched on how the city embeds culture in public policy via a five-year development plan that aims to use culture as a way of positioning the city as a global metropolis by 2020. Culture is viewed as a source of cohesion in China&apos;s rapidly changing environment. Rachel Healy, head of culture for the city of Sydney, highlighted they have more festivals and events than any other &apos;World City&apos; and this boosts other economic areas, for instance outdoor dining, in Australia&apos;s rich informal culture. And Yusaku Imamura from Tokyo Metropolitan Government explained how the 2011 Japanese earthquake prompted a reappraisal of values and culture to be put at the heart of its future revival as reflected in its cultural infrastructure and participation. Delegates to the summit arrived a day earlier to sample the treasures of London&apos;s cultural sector. Their itinerary included tours of the Royal Opera House and the fantastic Thomas Heatherwick exhibition at the V&amp;A. Invited guests on the day included the great and good of London&apos;s flagship art institutions, including the Royal Opera House, National Portrait Gallery, National Theatre and the London 2012 Festival. London based arts organisations will be able to see where they feature in the World Cities report and which matrices they contribute to. For instance London has over 1,000 museums and art galleries \u2013 more than the other world cities surveyed \u2013 and the highest level of attendance. Public participation in the arts is a key strength of the capital reflected across engagement with libraries, film and performance. Arts organisations now need to come together to absorb and reflect upon the findings and perhaps use as a goal post for future activities. The summit signalled a desire to cement closer co-operation between the partner cities and there was also talk of expanding the membership of the forum to other world cities wishing to join. The intention is to update the data every three years and rotate future summits between forum members. In the meantime global culture will continue to be shaped by world cities, each with their own individual strengths and each serving as inspiration to the others.

The Austrian army officer launched 200 &quot;balloon bombs&quot; controlled by lengths of copper wire and timed fuses, over the city in an attempt to get the Venetians to surrender. He Uchtaius may might not have been the mother of invention but he may well have been the father of a new weapon: the military drone. More than 160 years later, technology is driving military and civilian uses of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into remarkable areas. On the smallest scale, moths living moths have had been implanted with electrodes in their nervous systems to control their movements. On the grandest, UAVs could be flying in civilian airspace by the end of this decade, some aviation experts believe. This potential is one of the reasons why the UAV sector is the most dynamic of the aviation industry. It is worth an estimated $6bn (\u00a34bn) a year, according to US market analyst, the Teal Group. And that figure is expected to double within 10 years. This potential has been accompanied by fears among scientific critics and human rights groups that downgrading the &quot;man in the loop&quot; means devolving life and death decisions to airborne robots. Those anxieties are unlikely to be allayed as established arms manufacturers and various start-up firms jostle for position in the competitive field. A crucial piece of technology is needed to take UAVs to the next level is a robust &quot;sense and avoid&quot; system allowing unmanned planes to fly safely in busy airspace. Arms maker BAE Systems is confident this development is within reach and that UAVs will be able to manoeuvre safely in civilian airspace by 2020. Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal, BAE&apos;s engineering director (systems and strategy), said: &quot;We need to design products that fit in everywhere. We want to open up [civilian] airspace. At the moment you can&apos;t fly UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] in unsegregated airspace and you can&apos;t exploit the commercial market. You have to replace the responsibilities of the pilot.&quot; Dopping-Hepenstal said Astrea, a collaboration between aerospace firms and the UK government, was looking at all the issues needed to persuade air traffic regulators that civilian drones were safe. &quot;They have to behave correctly even if they lose communications links to the ground. They must be able to behave as safely as a human pilot.&quot; Even then, he added, there would be little point deploying them on holiday charter flights. &quot;It&apos;s about long endurance activities like search and rescue. You can put them into places where you couldn&apos;t put a human \u2013 for example, an ash cloud. &quot;In Fukushima, after the Japanese earthquakes, they used a small UAV to assess damage and radiation. There&apos;s no night flying in fighting forest fires: they let them burn during the hours of darkness.&quot; A drone could carry on dousing flames overnight. The CAA says 120 companies and other organisations have been given approval to fly UAVs in Britain. Five police forces are said to be among them. At present the UAVs can only be flown within &quot;the line of sight&quot; of the operator, though even with these restrictions companies can see great potential. Andre Clot, from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Association (UAVSA), said: &quot;This is not an aerospace market any more. It is an information and technology market. We are seeing lots of small, nifty, flexible companies coming up with solutions, and they offer much lower prices than the bigger manufacturers. Eighty-per cent of the UAV market is made up of small companies.&quot; Drone technology is rapidly spreading around the globe and for the moment the military is still driving innovation. Since losing aircraft to Syrian missile batteries in the 1973 Yom Kippur war, Israel has been a leading developer of UAVs. It sells the vehicles to US and European armies. Working with the US manufacturer Northrop Grumman, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) had a contract to fly them over Iraq. The UK&apos;s Watchkeeper UAV, a military &quot;target acquisition&quot; spotter is based on an Israeli prototype. A spokesman for IAI said the firm had sold $1bn worth of drones &quot;over the last few years&quot;. More than 50 countries now manufacture or use drones. China, for example, makes the Yilong drone (which translates as &quot;pterodactyl&quot;). Beijing has said it will sell the armed surveillance UAV, equivalent to the US Predator, to Pakistan and other countries. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Iran, Latvia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates all have active UAV research or manufacturing programmes. According to UK strategic export controls, in the last three months of 2011 alone, British firms exported UAVs or components for drones to at least 18 countries. As well as Nato allies, the equipment went to destinations including Brazil, Croatia, India, Israel, South Korea, Nigeria, Serbia and Singapore. Sustaining long-endurance flights for persistent surveillance or loitering above targets is a recurrent problem for designers. In the US, Sandia National Laboratories explored the possibility of nuclear-powered drones but suspended work because of public antipathy towards what would amount to a dirty bomb if the device crashed. One US air force strategist, Adam Lowther, suggested the USAF replace its strategic bombers with drones capable of carrying a nuclear payload. The White House has shown no enthusiasm for adopting the idea. Some drones are so small they are intended to resemble insects, to avoid detection. The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has commissioned a drone the size of a humming bird, equipped with a camera, from the firm AerEnvironment. A Dutch firm, Green X, builds drones that fly by flapping wings and are disguised as falcons or hawks. They have been flown low around Schiphol airport to scare away geese so the birds do not get sucked into plane engines at take-off or landing. The robot&apos;s radar profile makes it indistinguishable from a real bird of prey. Green X is working on multiple drones to simulate and redirect bird flocks. Bio-inspired technology has been a source for one of the more improbable strands of drone research. DARPA has implanted gold-plated electrodes into the pupae of tobacco hawkmoths to learn how to control animals remotely, exploiting their flights. There is also interest in such work in Britain. The MoD&apos;s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which works from Porton Down, Wiltshire, and other locations, this summer produced a HoriZone briefing on current research &quot;to stimulate new lines of thought&quot;. The review, which notes that &quot;inclusion of any information does not constitute an endorsement by DSTL or the MOD&quot;, carries reference to a US patent on an &quot;animal sensor network&quot;. The US study, it said, aimed to develop a &quot;method for the remote guidance and training of free-roaming animal sensor networks&quot;. It noted: &quot;Electrodes implanted into the nervous systems of animals are used to provide clues and rewards by stimulating specific regions of the brain to induce desired behaviours such as the direction and speed of movement. &quot;Each animal carries a backpack containing wireless networking equipment, sensors, and data storage and processing equipment.&quot; Animals, it suggests, could be trained in odour detection. A call by the MoD agency for research proposals sent out by DSTL last September, asked for projects involving micro UAS (weighting less than 2kg) and nano UAS (60g or less), which would &quot;operate inside buildings and within deep urban canyons&quot; and explore in &quot;confined spaces&quot;. DSTL said it was also interested in &quot;bio-inspired technology&quot; for small UAS systems, aircraft that could detect chemical, biological and radiation hazards, and be used in &quot;crowd monitoring&quot;. Another use envisaged is for miniature drones that could land and &quot;perch-and-stare on the edge of buildings, on window ledges, [or] on telegraph wires&quot;. One big weakness of UAVs is their reliance on radio signals. DSTL is eager to improve anti-jamming technology to prevent unmanned aircraft being disabled mid-flight or even hijacked. Critics of drones, such as the International Committee for Robot Arms Control (ICRAC), warn that as communications can easily be disrupted there will be a drive towards greater automation of the technology, including selection of targets. Drone makers and developers often focus on civilian uses of the technology to try to stop it being demonised in the media. The US-based Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, issued a code of conduct, noting that: &quot;Whether it is aiding search and rescue efforts, navigating through airspace too hazardous for manned vehicles, or furthering scientific research, UAS are capable of saving time, saving money and most importantly, saving lives.&quot; While drones are best known for attacks on al-Qaida supporters \u2013 and bystanders \u2013 in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen, they are already being used for police surveillance, monitoring fires and inspecting wind turbines, crops, high buildings and power lines. Once they can fly in mixed airspace, their roles will proliferate. The possibilities are seemingly endless. At Farnborough airshow in July, Craig Lippett, of the UAS training programme, said he had been approached by the Welsh Development Agency, which said it was interested in &quot;using drones to count sheep&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/05/digital-only-financial-times-difficult-trick", "sentences": ["And FT editions on newsprint or online are complementary, one defined by familiarity with the other so that, as you sit at your screen in Singapore or Tokyo, the FT you scan there is given a special value by the personality and record of the paper version you can also buy."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-04T23:05:55Z", "title": "Digital-only Financial Times would still be a difficult trick to perform", "tags": ["Financial Times", "Newspapers", "Wall Street Journal", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "Digital media"], "article": "There&apos;s a predictable buzz of futurology as the FT announces that its digital subscription circulation (301,471 and rising) has passed its print sales (297,227 and falling). How long will it be before pink paper and pounding presses are mere memories? Now, with subscriptions swelling, the FT looks far better placed for such online transition, a digital trailblazer by choice rather than force of circumstance. Yet hang around for a few more earthbound moments. Nobody, to be honest, can be quite sure yet what such progress means in hard cash terms: the Columbia Journalism Review punches whatever numbers it can find and pronounces FT accounting somewhat &quot;opaque&quot;. It&apos;s fashionable enough for struggling publications to talk of going online-only. Newsweek hinted at just that transition the other day. But digital existence can also be low profile, going on totally obscure. As predicted, Rupert Murdoch&apos;s tablet newspaper The Daily is finding cyberspace a cruel pool for making a splash: no news-stand visibility, no TV or radio summaries, no copies passed from hand to hand. A third of The Daily&apos;s staff were laid off last week. It&apos;s no accident that big digital advertising launches still happen on posters, TV or via print. And FT editions on newsprint or online are complementary, one defined by familiarity with the other so that, as you sit at your screen in Singapore or Tokyo, the FT you scan there is given a special value by the personality and record of the paper version you can also buy. John Ridding, the FT&apos;s buoyant chief executive, may see a long-term strategy working, but he bridles at the thought of the paper being put to death. On the contrary, digital success had given it &quot;a new lease of life&quot; he told the Guardian last week. Remember, too, that the FT&apos;s closest competitor, the Wall Street Journal \u2013 is big in print and big behind a paywall: 2.1m copies purchased, one way or another, every weekday. Of course the Journal is benefiting from rolling its print and digital reach together, claiming convincingly that it is America&apos;s top-selling newspaper: but there&apos;s no sign of Mr M falling out of love with presses or satellite printing there. Would a digital-only FT be able to compete with an all-singing, all-dancing Journal? Could it keep a separate identity in a new world where Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters are the biggest beasts? And how will it cope with a declining but still crucial print sale as real transition starts to bite? It&apos;s easy to talk about moving from one world to another.

The most valuable club in sport \u2013 according to Forbes magazine, which estimated the Old Trafford side is worth $2.2bn \u2013 has found it harder than you would expect to find the back of the net with the US listing, the third float attempt by its owners, the American Glazer family. It has already pulled planned initial public offerings in Hong Kong and Singapore because of lack of demand. The club is trying to sell 16.7m shares, at between $16 and $20 each, a 10% stake that at the top end of the range would raise up to $333m. The Glazers, who bought the club for \u00a3790m in 2005, had originally looked to raise as much as $1bn in Singapore. The club&apos;s share will be used to reduce its \u00a3423m debt burden to \u00a3345.4m, a decision that has disappointed fans, who had hoped to see it come down further. The club failed to win a trophy last season and supporters argue that it is being held back by its finances. Analysts say the price tag attached to the club, which would still be controlled by the Glazers post-listing, is too high. The lack of listed sports teams makes it is difficult for investors to crunch the numbers and historic examples, such as The Boston Celtics and Cleveland Indians, did not fare well and have since been taken private. There are also bigger worries such as falling revenues and the absence of a dividend.

Furious commentaries ordered Washington to &quot;shut up&quot; and accused it of &quot;fanning the flames and provoking division&quot; in the region. The foreign ministry in Beijing called in a senior US diplomat at the weekend over the State Department comments. Analysts fear the South China Sea has become a major potential flashpoint, as tensions have risen sharply between China \u2013 which claims almost all the sea \u2013 and Vietnam and the Philippines. Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts of the sea, which contains valuable energy reserves and fisheries and sees an estimated $5 trillion of cargo \u2013 half the world&apos;s shipping tonnage \u2013 pass through its sea lanes annually. &quot;While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing,&quot; the International Crisis Group warned in a recent report on the six-party dispute. Beijing&apos;s most recent moves include offering oil and gas exploration blocks for bidding and establishing a new city, Sansha, which boasts at most a few thousand residents and 5 square miles (13 square kilometres) of land spread over several tiny islands \u2013 yet lays claim to 772,000 square miles (2 million square kilometres) of sea and its own military garrison. It prompted the US to publicly reenter the row, with a statement expressing concern at the growing tensions and singling out Beijing&apos;s role. The city and garrison &quot;run counter to collaborative diplomatic efforts to resolve differences and risk further escalating tensions in the region,&quot; said Patrick Ventrell, acting deputy spokesperson at the State Department. Beijing responded by calling in the US deputy chief of mission and state media ran a spate of hostile pieces. &quot;We are entirely entitled to shout at the United States, &apos;Shut up&apos;. How can meddling by other countries be tolerated in matters that are within the scope of Chinese sovereignty?&quot; asked a commentary in the overseas edition of the People&apos;s Daily, the official Communist party newspaper. The domestic version accused Washington of &quot;fanning the flames and provoking division&quot; in the region. State media say Beijing&apos;s moves are a response to the actions of Manila and Hanoi, such as a new law requiring all foreign ships passing through the disputed waters to notify Vietnamese authorities. In Chinese eyes, it is \u2013 as deputy foreign minister Cui Tiankai recently described it \u2013 a &quot;victim&quot;, not the instigator. Though its far smaller neighbours bristle at such a description, the new ICG report notes: &quot;China is not stoking tensions on its own. South East Asian claimants ... are now more forcefully defending their claims \u2013 and enlisting outside allies \u2013 with considerable energy.&quot; Shading the row is concern about the Obama administration&apos;s refocusing of foreign policy in a &quot;pivot to Asia&quot;. The US says it has no territorial ambitions in the Sea and no position on the competing claims to land features, but has a national interest in freedom of navigation and maintaining peace and stability. But Chinese hawks warn of an attempt to encircle and contain China while others argue that, at a minimum, its rivals are exploiting the US shift. A Xinhua commentary this weekend accused the US of double-dealing and urged Washington to show it was not seeking &quot;to clip China&apos;s wings and shore up the United States&apos; cracking pedestal in the Asia-Pacific&quot;. In a speech quoted by the Global Times, Zhou Fangyin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences noted: &quot;Countries with territorial disputes with China believe that the costs and risks of provoking China have largely dropped ... China&apos;s rapid rise may also make [them] realize that their chances of reaping and consolidating benefits by encroaching upon Chinese territories would be smaller in the future.&quot; In any case, argues Rory Medcalf of Australia&apos;s Lowy Institute, &quot;It has become academic to ask who started it ... What we see now is an action-reaction cycle.&quot; The multitude of Chinese agencies involved has stoked tensions, the ICG has argued, with poor coordination and some actors seeing it as a way to increase their power and budget. Increasing militarisation of the dispute makes it harder to resolve skirmishes, but could also raise the threshold for armed conflict, it noted. &quot;More immediate conflict risks lie in the growing number of law enforcement and paramilitary vessels playing an increasing role in disputed territories without a clear legal framework&quot;, it added. Domestic nationalism in other claimant countries adds to the difficulties. No one wants military conflict, not only because of the inevitable disruption of trade. The smaller countries would have to take on mighty China, while such a conflict &quot;would undermine [Beijing&apos;s] peaceful rise thesis, cause irreparable damage to its image and foreign policy in Asia and push other countries far closer to the US. Clearly none of that is in China&apos;s interests,&quot; said Ian Storey, of the Institute of South East Asian Studies in Singapore. Yet should it come to an exchange of fire, even the US could feel compelled to become involved \u2013 with great reluctance \u2013 to defend its credibility as an ally not only to the Philippines but countries across Asia, argued Medcalf. Analysts see little hope of resolving the dispute and say the best-case scenario is now the agreement of measures to handle clashes. &quot;I don&apos;t think any of the claimants have any good options. They have all painted themselves into a corner,&quot; said Storey."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/06/uk-higher-education-overseas-markets", "sentences": ["In 2007, Australia&apos;s University of New South Wales opened a Singapore campus."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-06T18:29:00Z", "title": "Britain, where you can get a flat-pack campus", "tags": ["University funding", "University administration", "Higher education", "Education", "David Willetts", "Politics"], "article": "Studying for a degree from one country while living in another is nothing new: Nelson Mandela famously took his University of London degree while imprisoned on Robben Island. But 2009-10 marked the first year in which more overseas students were studying for British degrees beyond these shores than within them. In January, a report from the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education revealed that there were now more than 200 overseas campuses dotted around the world. Of these, 25 are British: a figure that has doubled in just two years. It&apos;s a trend the universities minister, David Willetts, is keen to encourage. In a speech last June at Stanford University in the US he pointed to the surging demand for higher education in nations such as Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil, adding: &quot;I want to see investors from Britain and abroad helping our universities access these big overseas markets.&quot; But questions remain about whether financiers and universities are ready to work together \u2013 and about what form such ventures could take. By the time Willetts gave his speech, in fact, the wheels were already turning. In May, he convened a meeting with private firms, financial investors and vice-chancellors to discuss how to boost universities&apos; overseas presence. And he launched UK Education Services (UKES), a new unit of the business department, with the intention of helping to sell British education suppliers to foreign governments. UKES won&apos;t just push overseas campuses: everything from technology to accreditation is also in its sights. But it could also market a sort of flat-pack higher education system, with campus construction, academic expertise and the finance to pay for it all in a single package. Governments in a hurry to create a new university could use Britain as a one-stop shop. Willetts&apos;s interest in all this is as much economic as educational. He sees higher education as &quot;one of our great export industries&quot;, and wants to use its global reputation to boost the national coffers. Meanwhile, emerging economies increasingly want to educate their students at home, to reduce the risk of a brain drain. Overseas ventures will allow British universities to hang on to lucrative foreign income in the face of changing migration patterns \u2013 and unfriendly student visa policies in the UK. Some universities are already moving in this direction. This October, the University of Central Lancashire is launching UCLan Cyprus, the first UK university to set up shop on the island. It is planning UCLan Thailand and UCLan Sri Lanka, too. &quot;Within the next 10 years the face of education will change very significantly,&quot; says Professor Dave Phoenix, the pro-vice chancellor who has led the Cyprus project. &quot;There&apos;s a real opportunity for institutions that want to create a global brand.&quot; However, as big as the opportunity is, universities tend not to think in terms of business transactions. Consultant John Fielden has researched transnational education for organisations including Universities UK and the thinktank Million+. &quot;Most people assume universities [establish branch campuses] for money, but that&apos;s usually the wrong assumption,&quot; he says. In the case of newer universities, it&apos;s often a matter of &quot;securing a supply chain, getting students back to the UK in their third year and hoping they stay on&quot;. For those higher up the league tables, it&apos;s about making a statement about their international reputation. As Professor Drummond Bone, the former Universities UK president who as Liverpool&apos;s vice-chancellor established its Chinese subsidiary, says: &quot;I think if you&apos;re looking at it in terms of short-term profitability, you&apos;re crazy, frankly.&quot; University bosses say the biggest barrier to getting international ventures off the ground is the lack of capital. Two investors \u2013 the Ontario Teachers&apos; Pension Fund and investment bank Goldman Sachs \u2013 are keen, but so far neither has put its hand in its pocket, perhaps because of a lack of commercial expertise perceived in university management. And some universities aren&apos;t comfortable with the idea of teaming up with investment banks. Until that changes, foreign ventures are likely to remain relatively small, ad hoc affairs, funded largely through local investment. There is a third pitfall: governing bodies are a risk-averse lot, and an overseas venture that offered sub-par teaching could do a university&apos;s reputation more harm than good. And other risks are more tangible. In 2007, Australia&apos;s University of New South Wales opened a Singapore campus. It was meant to serve 15,000 students; actually, it attracted fewer than 150. It closed in a matter of weeks, leaving the university with a bill of over S$22m (\u00a311m). The result of all this is that full-blown campuses overseas are likely to remain a relative rarity. Fielden has just completed a report on transnational education for the UK Higher Education International Unit (IU). &quot;Nearly everyone is cooking up something,&quot; he says; but only a minority of institutions are planning branch campuses. The rest are looking instead to research partnerships or franchising arrangements: smaller, less risky ventures that require less money and management time. Others think the most likely outcome of the UKES will be &quot;education city&quot; projects of the sort seen in Malaysia&apos;s Educity Iskandar: campuses established by investors or overseas governments, into which British institutions can just slot a faculty or two. The IU&apos;s director, Joanna Newman, argues that success depends on working closely with existing local institutions: &quot;The old model of us supplying and them taking isn&apos;t going to work.&quot; If the government is serious about boosting higher education exports, there are other things it could do. One is to provide &quot;pump priming&quot; funding to get projects to the stage where investors might take an interest. It could also take on an active matchmaking role, Newman argues, citing a recent IU &quot;speed-dating&quot; event at which British and Brazilian universities could meet each other with a view to finding research partners. Even if the government does all this, though, not everyone in higher education will be jumping for joy. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the university thinktank Million+, argues that the entire debate is a distraction. &quot;This government&apos;s approach contrasts poorly against the previous one, which actually provided funding to boost higher education exports,&quot; she says. &quot;The Home Office visa restrictions are damaging one of the most successful UK export industries. No amount of private capital can compensate for that.&quot; If British universities don&apos;t fill the gap, though, those of other nations will. And the window of opportunity won&apos;t last for ever. Bone says that one of the reasons Liverpool went into China was to hang on to a group of students it otherwise expected to dwindle away. &quot;Ten, 15 years down the line, the attractions for developing countries of sending their young people to high-cost UK education is going to be a lot less, because of the development of their own systems,&quot; he says. By then, those countries will have built their own universities \u2013 and won&apos;t need to borrow ours."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/07/britain-nation-problem-gamblers", "sentences": ["Britain is also some way behind Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-07T11:56:18Z", "title": "Why politicians hedge their bets when it comes to gambling in Britain | Daniel Macadam", "tags": ["UK news", "Harriet Harman", "Politics", "Labour", "Gambling"], "article": "So we are now living in &quot;betting shop Britain&quot;. Last night&apos;s Dispatches documentary on Channel 4 has focused minds on the sight of more bookmakers on the high street, and the seeming explosion of quick-play, high-stake slot machines known as fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). Confronted with stories of people losing everything on FOBTs, Harriet Harman, the former Labour minister who led the liberalisation, said she had made a &quot;mistake&quot;. So why did MPs from all three parties suggest last month that betting shops should be allowed even more FOBTs? As bizarre as it may sound, some MPs feel they missed a golden opportunity to recognise gambling as legitimate entertainment back in 2005. The select committee report last month was an attempt to fix some of the perceived mistakes of the 2005 Gambling Act. Dropping the arbitrary cap of four FOBTs per betting shop will stop bookmakers from opening up more stores, and prevent so-called &quot;clustering&quot; on Britain&apos;s high streets, the MPs&apos; report argued. There is also a lack of hard evidence on how dangerous these machines are. A report by NatCen and Geofutures, produced last year before the Dispatches documentary, showed that seaside areas and satellite towns around major cities with higher deprivation tended to have more betting shops and gambling machines. However, it did not set out to answer whether this has created more gambling addicts. Nor have many tried to answer the wider question of why it is wrong for the poor to gamble and not the rich. Some betting advocates have said the clustering of betting shops is a simple case of supply and demand. They point out, slightly tongue-in-cheek, that the high street in Barnes, west London is full of estate agents. &quot;Not everyone wants them but the demand is clearly there,&quot; they say. Some of the more colourful suggestions by select committee MPs last month, including more slot machines in betting shops, are unlikely to ever be picked up by ministers. The government already has enough rebellions on its hands over Europe and House of Lords reform without stepping into the explosive area of gambling. Another reason for the government&apos;s reluctance is what gambling companies ruefully call the &quot;Daily Mail effect&quot;. Coalition ministers are too frightened to iron out glaring kinks in the 2005 act, the industry argues, in case they are on the receiving end of a bruising crusade by the newspaper. Harman admitted that Labour was influenced by the Daily Mail over gambling policy, and wrongly limited the number of slot machines in casinos, when she appeared before the select committee earlier this year. To complicate matters, even the definition of problem gambling is disputed. Should we be talking about &quot;gambling addicts&quot;, &quot;gambling obsessives&quot;, or, a wider catch-all, &quot;problem gamblers&quot;? That is without looking at the thousands of under-18s spending hours on social poker and casino games on their mobiles and Facebook. Last year&apos;s British gambling prevalence survey found a small but measurable rise in problem gambling to 0.9% of the population, or 451,000 adults, since the liberalisation introduced by New Labour. Putting aside differences in methodology, Britain has the same rate of problem gamblers as Germany and Norway, where much of the gambling is under government control. Britain is also some way behind Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States. And it is not just British politicians who are grappling with the problem. Across Europe governments are being asked to look at the spread of high-stake slot machines. In Sweden, the state-run gambling monopoly Svenska Spel \u2013 supposedly free of the hunger for profits that drives publicly listed bookmakers \u2013 is also under pressure for installing addictive slot machines in poorer areas. Likewise, in Italy local councils are trying to stop the relentless expansion of slot gambling. Italians have already spent \u20ac44bn on gambling this year, more than half of that on slots, and are well on course to outspend the \u20ac80bn they gambled in 2011. More than \u20ac8bn of that went to the Italian government in gambling taxes. The question is whether here in the UK the economic benefits of FOBTs outweigh the drain on people&apos;s incomes? Perhaps betting operators will also ask themselves whether extra FOBTs in each of their shops are worth a sustained bout of negative headlines."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/standard-chartered-iran-justice-department", "sentences": ["The director for the US at the time was Ray Ferguson, currently running the Singapore business."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-08T06:45:00Z", "title": "Standard Chartered: US justice department investigates Iran allegations", "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Business", "Banking", "US news"], "article": "The US justice department is looking into allegations that Standard Chartered illegally moved $250bn of Iranian money around the global financial system, according to a source close to the investigation. More than \u00a38bn ($12.5bn) has wiped off the stock market value of the banking group since Monday, when a New York regulator issued a damning report alleging the bank had flouted US laws in its dealings with Iran. The bank&apos;s shares lost another 16% of their value Tuesday. A source with direct knowledge of the investigation said the report was now being considered by the justice department, which could pursue a criminal case against the bank and its executives. The justice department works in conjunction with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which monitors and enforces US trade sanctions against countries including Iran. In its report the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) said it had evidence of similar breaches by the bank in Libya, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and Sudan, all countries under US sanctions. Both the justice department and NYSDFS declined to comment on the next stage of the investigation. The bank has denied wrongdoing and said the regulator had not provided &quot;a full and accurate picture of the facts&quot;. The bank said &quot;99.9%&quot; of the disputed Iranian transactions had complied with US law. In May Standard Chartered announced it was ending its business in Iran after decades of international pressure.  John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University in New York, said even a single illegal transaction would be enough to spark a justice department investigation. &quot;There are 20-year sentences for money laundering in the US,&quot; he said. The move is another blow for the UK&apos;s financial services industry, which has been rounded on in Washington following Barclays&apos; alleged fixing of Libor interest rates, JP Morgan&apos;s huge London losses and a devastating US government report that concluded HSBC had acted as banker to criminals and terrorists around the world. The report is also damaging to the bank&apos;s top management, who only last week boasted the bank was too &quot;boring&quot; to be afflicted by the scandals sweeping the UK financial services industry. Peter Sands, Standard Chartered&apos;s chief executive, was recently tipped as a potential governor of the Bank of England and finance chief Richard Meddings had been linked to the top job at Barclays vacated by Bob Diamond, forced out following the Libor scandal. Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said: &quot;Standard Chartered&apos;s head is on the chopping block.&quot; He said Iran was an oil-rich country that no international bank would chose to ignore. &quot;But the US and Iran have been at each others throats for 40 years. You have to make a choice,&quot; he said. Henning said the dramatic share sell-off may yet prove overblown. &quot;In the end this may not be HSBC but the question remains about how many heads will roll and how high up. Diamond has set the benchmark pretty high,&quot; he said. James Cox, law professor at Duke University, said: &quot;Frankly it looks like the bank turned more than a blind eye in its quest for profits. Once again we see a bank putting personal gain ahead of public interest.&quot; In the UK the Financial Services Authority is keeping a close watch on the situation, as it always does when share prices move so violently. Sands and Meddings have been forced to cut short their holidays and return to London to deal with the crisis. Meddings and Sands both joined Standard Chartered in 2002 \u2013 the alleged violations ran between 2001 and 2007. An emergency board meeting is expected to be called shortly. Only a week ago the bank reported its 10th successive year of record profits.While it is not a household name in the UK, its blue and green logo is familiar site on high streets across Asia and Africa and the bank sponsors Liverpool football club. It employs 90,000 people, some 2,700 of whom are in the UK head office. The timing of the allegations by NYSDFS \u2013 which claimed that the bank&apos;s actions had left the US &quot;vulnerable to terrorists, weapon dealers, drug kings and corrupt regimes&quot; \u2013 has stunned the bank, which insists it is going to defend itself against the claims. Even as it admitted that it had moved &quot;under $14m&quot; for Iranian clients \u2013 albeit considerably less than the $250bn outlined in the regulatory order \u2013 the bank was unrepentant as it made it clear it would refute the allegations at an appearance before the regulator on 15 August. While it had breached so-called U-turns, which were transactions that US authorities allowed to take place as long as the money did not end up in Iranian banks, it said &quot;well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied with the U-turn regulations&quot;. The US regulator&apos;s 30-page report reproduces emails and conversations between Standard Chartered staff, including a remark from a London-based director when warned by a US colleague of potential problems in dealing with Iran. &quot;You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we&apos;re not going to deal with Iranians,&quot; the director said. The director is not named but the exchange is said to have taken place when the bank&apos;s chief executive for America warned, among others, the head group executive director for risk. At the time, October 2006, this title was held by Meddings, who was promoted to finance director the following month. The director for the US at the time was Ray Ferguson, currently running the Singapore business. The bank would not comment on individuals."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/financial-crisis-five-years-on-readers", "sentences": ["I was then offered a job in Singapore in 2008 and eventually in Brazil where I am now."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-08T11:36:32Z", "title": "Financial crisis, five years on: readers' stories", "tags": ["Financial crisis", "Credit crunch", "Recession", "Economics", "Banking", "Financial sector", "Business", "World news", "Family finances", "Money"], "article": "The fifth anniversary of the start of the financial crisis is marked on 9 August \u2013 &quot;the day the world changed&quot; in the words of former Northern Rock boss Adam Applegarth. With little sign of the crisis abating, readers tell how it has affected their lives. Liz Arundell, 63, retired teacher, West Sussex My husband inherited some money, so we bought a second home in Wales in 2004 with a view to moving there in retirement. But he was made redundant, so we had to sell the house in 2007. We couldn&apos;t sell it until 2010 because despite having a lot of interest each offer fell through. One man had his survey done, only for his business to fold a day later. Others who offered were made redundant and people&apos;s confidence was shattered. I had a good two years or more of very troubled sleep and my mental health certainly suffered from the worry of it all. My husband is still working until at least next April when he will be 67, having planned to retire sooner. Tim Robson, 49, unemployed senior civil servant, south Wales My wife was made redundant from her job at RBS and was given 1,000 shares as part of her redundancy package, which at the time were worth around \u00a320 a share. They&apos;re now worthless and wiped out any safety net. I was a senior manager at a local council when I was made redundant in 2010 earning more than \u00a370,000 a year. Now I&apos;m being offered jobs at the bottom being paid \u00a316,000 and my jobseekers allowance is about to run out. If things don&apos;t improve, this year I will have to sell the house, but the market is so depressed it&apos;ll be a struggle to sell it. If we get beyond this Christmas in the same situation I&apos;ll probably be back living with my mum. I&apos;ve managed to keep myself busy but some days you wonder &apos;what if&apos;? I won&apos;t be beaten. I&apos;ve still got a lot to offer. Robert, 59, south Wales I worked for a major IT firm for 22 years and in 2007, as I was coming up to 55, they were asking us to take early retirement. There was no serious pressure, but then I was suddenly told I had three weeks to decide and was told there was a penalty if I didn&apos;t take early retirement, so I did. I took financial advice and invested the cash into stocks, shares and bonds and have made next to nothing back. One bond with Aviva has even left me out of pocket. I don&apos;t want to upset myself by looking at how much I paid these advisers. I wanted to spend my retirement working in politics or the arts and I would have loved it, but to earn nothing was not an option. I&apos;ve made up for the shortfall the credit crunch has caused, but I&apos;ve given up three-and-a-half years of my life to make sure I achieve that. Alex Rudd, 39, technology manager, Sao Paulo, Brazil I was living in London and tried to sell my house at the peak of the market after probably trying to emulate the numerous property shows on TV, but didn&apos;t manage it. I was then offered a job in Singapore in 2008 and eventually in Brazil where I am now. If I had stayed in the UK I wouldn&apos;t have a job, because the company shut its European operations. The salary I earn in Brazil I wouldn&apos;t be able to get in the UK, and I live within walking distance of my office. Even if I lose my job tomorrow, there&apos;s no chance I would leave Brazil because my quality of life is so much better here. David, 56, and Ruth Willis, 55, Cumbria Ruth, former senior civil servant: I was the corporate director of a local authority until 2004, when I was made redundant. It was very well paid but I still managed to work as a consultant. But by 2007 work dried up and we were struggling to pay the mortgage, leading to our home being repossessed. I was offered a job in Cumbria, so after 33 years in London we moved north, which was a wrench for us both because we didn&apos;t know anybody at all. After two years I was made redundant again, a month before I was due any redundancy payment in March 2010. I&apos;ve now been offered a job in Lancashire and will live away from home during the week with my brother. I&apos;m starting at the bottom again and it will be quite hard. Both of us live on benefits, which is unbelievably strange having worked my whole life. At times I&apos;ve been at rock bottom and find it difficult mentally. You feel like an outcast. When you&apos;re not working you don&apos;t feel part of society and you have no value to give. David, former librarian: My mental health has not been too good. I&apos;ve been hospitalised and waited four years to see a psychiatrist. It&apos;s only recently that things have started to move on, just as we&apos;re considering moving to Bolton. I was receiving good treatment in London but couldn&apos;t continue because we had to move. Things got so bad I tried to commit suicide, and I think it was entirely down to the economic downturn and not receiving the proper treatment I needed, and everything that has happened in our lives, which made everything unbearable. Moumita Paul, 32, IT worker, Kolkata, India I was working for Hewlett Packard when the financial crisis struck and was expecting a promotion which I had been promised, but my manager was under a lot of pressure and couldn&apos;t give us those rewards. The expectation in India was a good employee would get a 30% pay rise each year before 2007. We were still in the delusional world that nothing would happen to us and managers were encouraged to keep staff by throwing money at them. I got a raise of 8% in 2007, but had been used to raises of 30%. An American vice-president came over to visit one time and created a lot of fear that people would lose their jobs. Lots of us worked harder because it was a wake-up call and it separated the wheat from the chaff. I did get a promotion and a raise, but only through making sacrifices. Ben Edwards, 27, software developer, London I graduated in 2008 and managed to find myself a job for a small NGO, which I kept going for a couple of years. It was losing money, which meant I had to supplement my work elsewhere before I was eventually made redundant. However, I put my CV out and within three hours I had three agents call me and I could name my salary. I now work for a multinational e-commerce company and there has been a huge increase for our work as a direct result of the economic downturn as retailers look to us for automation to reduce labour costs. My own outlook is positive because I don&apos;t see any change in the economic situation, which means I will still be in demand. My job is very specialised and friends who have similarly specialised jobs such as marine, mechanical and civil engineers can still find work. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2012"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/09/brian-crozier", "sentences": ["He subsequently rejoined Reuters through its Australian counterpart, Australian Associated Press, which sent him to Indonesia, Singapore and Saigon, where he covered the war leading to the defeat of the colonial power, France, in Indochina."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-09T11:52:21Z", "title": "Brian Crozier obituary", "tags": ["Politics", "Politics past", "MI5", "MI6", "CIA", "Communism", "Politics", "Books"], "article": "The intelligence expert Brian Crozier, who has died aged 94 after a long illness, was the ultimate cold-war warrior: a political vigilante who unashamedly cultivated a close, mutually beneficial, relationship with MI6, MI5 and the CIA, successfully courted Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and praised the dictators Pinochet and Franco. He lectured army officers about the risks of a Marxist-Leninist takeover of the ruling Labour party in the 1970s. On one occasion, after telling a group of officers about the potential need for a military coup, the audience, in his words, &quot;rose as one man, cheering and clapping for fully five minutes&quot;. In the 1960s, at MI6&apos;s suggestion, Crozier was approached by the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a CIA-funded agency that financed publications around the world, including Encounter magazine in Britain. In 1966, with the help of CIA funds, he set up a British-based agency, Forum World Features, and later founded the Institute for the Study of Conflict. He also contributed to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&apos;s Information Research Department (IRD), a shady organisation whose unattributable reports distributed to susceptible journalists and MPs were designed to highlight the dangers of communist subversion. The IRD was disbanded by David Owen soon after he was appointed foreign secretary in 1977. That year, continuing in his role of what British intelligence agencies call &quot;an alongsider&quot;, Crozier set up a new group, &quot;The 61&quot;. Its aim was to make up for what he perceived as the failure of western governments to counter communist Soviet propaganda effectively. A former senior MI6 officer, Nicholas Elliott, was one of its fundraisers. Among Crozier&apos;s friends was Charles Elwell, MI5&apos;s head of counter-subversion until 1981, who instructed his officers to monitor the activities of trade union leaders, as well as the National Council for Civil Liberties and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. So, too, was Stephen Hastings, a Tory MP with whose help he set up the Shield Committee, designed to combat subversion, a phenomenon Crozier described as the &quot;political equivalent of Aids&quot;. He presented a further proposal for a &quot;Counter-Subversion Agency&quot; at a meeting in the City in the summer of 1978, chaired by Thatcher and attended by Sir Keith Joseph, Willie Whitelaw, Lord Carrington and Harry Sporborg of Hambros bank (who had been deputy head of the wartime Special Operations Executive). Thatcher suggested the new agency should be attached to No 10, but Carrington vetoed the plan. Crozier was born in the small mining village of Kuridala, Queensland, Australia, where his father was a mining engineer. He came to Britain at the age of five, but the family moved to France in 1923. They returned to Britain in 1930 and he studied at Trinity College of Music in London. He was a talented young composer and pianist, and music engaged him throughout his life. He was still playing his own compositions and those of Scriabin, Chopin, Faur\u00e9 and Schumann on his Bechstein grand piano a week before he died. It was while at Trinity College that he started his career as a journalist and author. He worked for the Stoke-on-Trent Evening Sentinel and the Stockport Express before joining Reuters news agency in 1943. A year later, he joined the News Chronicle as a subeditor. In 1948, he was offered a three-year contract on the Sydney Morning Herald. He subsequently rejoined Reuters through its Australian counterpart, Australian Associated Press, which sent him to Indonesia, Singapore and Saigon, where he covered the war leading to the defeat of the colonial power, France, in Indochina. Crozier returned to Britain in 1953, to run Foreign Report, a confidential bulletin of The Economist magazine, and broadcast general commentaries twice a week on the BBC overseas service in French and Spanish, before extending his intelligence sources and branching out on his own. His books include Neo-colonialism (1964), South East Asia in Turmoil (1965), A Theory of Conflict (1974), The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire (1999) and biographies of Franco (1967), De Gaulle (1973) and Chiang Kai-Shek (1976). In 1993, he wrote Free Agent: The Unseen War 1941-1991, in which, much to the chagrin of MI5 and MI6, he described in detail his links with western intelligence agencies. He is survived by his second wife, Jacqueline, his daughters, Kathryn-Anne, Isobel and Caroline, and son, Michael. \u2022 Brian Rossiter Crozier, journalist and intelligence expert, born 4 August 1918; died 4 August 2012"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/10/manchester-united-ipo-share-prices", "sentences": ["This is the Glazer family&apos;s third attempt at a share sale, having previously scrapped efforts to sell shares on exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-10T00:05:04Z", "title": "Manchester United IPO: share prices cut before US stock market flotation", "tags": ["Manchester United", "IPOs", "Stock markets", "The Glazer family", "Football", "Business", "Sport", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Manchester United has slashed the price of its shares in advance of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

It was not because I have an informed view on whether or not Standard Chartered has been acting in such a grossly negligent fashion, but due to the fact that New York politicians have a long history of building their political careers off the backs of prosecuting the banking industry for misdeeds. The risk departments of all banks operating in the US zone are well aware of this fact and routinely report that such prosecutions could take place.So I guess Labour MP John Mann&apos;s suggestion that US regulators are out to get London as the world financial capital, in order to build up New York&apos;s reputation, has to be viewed with an equal measure of scepticism. Probably the better question for everyone is to ask: is it possible for cultures of big global banking groups to operate to a singular good business agenda? If not, is the enormous size of the banks that have caused so much havoc another reason to consider breaking up the large banks so that they can concentrate on performing certain financial services functions to the highest standards possible? What the various US regulators&apos; investigations into Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered have in common is that they involve numerous businesses operating all over the world. HSBC and Standard Chartered have found themselves in trouble through some of their subsidiary companies that have transacted business through the US. It is one thing to operate a bank in a single jurisdiction and comply with that country&apos;s regulations and law, but global businesses operating in a multitude of jurisdictions have an extraordinary web of requirements and legal codes to acknowledge in their decision-making. In my own career, the senior and mid-level management debates about how to comply with certain regulatory and standards began more than 20 years ago as many OECD-member nations and others began the first stages of a crackdown on banks used to launder drug money and proceeds of other crimes. More than 10 years ago sanctions against helping certain countries such as Iran carry out day-to-day business in the global financial markets became part of our working lives too, as did watch lists of politically exposed individuals. When these actions began in the 1990s, bankers would complain that it was insulting to ask a client for identification. They would say it was impossible to verify the address of residents of the Middle East because they only had post office boxes. Knowing the source of a client&apos;s funds became a huge issue and still is because money launderers are sophisticated and know the loopholes, and impatient bankers just want the accounts open so that business can be conducted and they can, in turn, earn bonus revenue. But still, any banking leader working in this industry for more than 20 years should be able to see that they can only earn revenue from good business and should have been actively working to shed themselves of any dodgy money associated with corruption, crime and terrorism. While not all the jurisdictions have exactly the same regulations and laws, regulators and lawmakers in financial centres from New York to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Sydney, Johannesburg, as well as a number of smaller jurisdictions have all been saying: &quot;Banks, you are not above the law, you must make your businesses comply with our requirements \u2013 there is no debate \u2013 otherwise there will be consequences.&quot; I am certain that regulators are now looking at the global operations of big banks to make certain they have everyone operating to the highest standard. This is all the more reason why such large businesses might consider selling off or closing down the business lines that are too difficult to make compliant, no matter the consequence to a bank&apos;s income.

It moved on to Europe. Now the fear is that the big economies of the emerging world are about to join the west in a blanket slowdown. This would be a new and worrying development. While the United States, Britain and Europe were having it worse than at any time since the 1930s, Brazil, Russia, India and China grew by 25% between 2008 and 2010. There was talk of a changing of the guard, of a shift in economic power from west to east and from north to south. It was certainly the case that without the strong growth in the big emerging markets, the downturn that followed the financial crisis of 2008 would have been significantly worse. The so-called Bric countries are growing, but since the start of 2012 there have been unmistakable signs that economic problems are not confined to Europe, North America and Japan. India has slowing growth and high inflation; Russia&apos;s industrial weakness has been masked by a high oil price; Brazil has felt the backwash from weak growth in the US; and China&apos;s export-led model has started to falter. The only real surprise is why anybody should be surprised by these developments. Globalisation of production over the past quarter of a century has meant not just interconnectedness but interdependency. China&apos;s big export markets are Europe, which has been in the throes of a sovereign debt crisis for the past two and a half years, and the US, experiencing a sub-par recovery by historic standards. Figures out last week showed that Chinese exports in July were just 1% up on a year earlier, with shipments to the EU and the US down by 8% between June and July. Import growth was also weak, suggesting that the domestic economy has also softened since the turn of the year. Electricity production, which economists use as a proxy for growth, has been flat during 2012. Nor is China the only Asian exporter seeing reduced demand for its products. Singapore joined Hong Kong in registering falling growth rates in the second quarter of 2012, and Monday&apos;s Japanese GDP figures are likely to show a marked deceleration in activity between the first and second quarters of the year. Beijing has started to respond to the slowdown in China. Official interest rates have been cut and the authorities are starting to make credit available for investment projects, albeit with a bit more caution than they showed during late 2008-09, when emergency action was taken to prevent the economy grinding to a halt. China has oodles of capacity. Investment accounted for almost half of gross domestic product in 2011 (compared with less than 20% in the UK and the US), and much of the spending in recent years has been wasteful. In a more open economy, a combination of high domestic inflation and falling overseas demand would be leading to capital scrapping rather than investment in new plant and machinery. But just as Europe has been kicking its sovereign debt can down the road, and the US has been delaying the moment when the budget deficit has to be tackled, so China is looking for a short-term fix in the hope that something will turn up. That &quot;something&quot; is the pick-up in the global economy that will occur when the European Central Bank delivers on its promise to do whatever it takes to hold the single currency together, thereby providing the boost to confidence that will allow America finally to recover strongly and the Chinese to again become the workshop of the world. From this perspective, the ECB&apos;s pledge to take on the bond markets was a game-changing moment. The next couple of months will see Greece put back on track with its austerity programme, falling bond yields in Spain and Italy, and evidence that the double-dip recession of 2012 was shallow and temporary. A resolution to Europe&apos;s problems will enable Barack Obama to win a second term, allowing the US to shuffle away from the edge of the fiscal cliff, the big package of tax increases and spending cuts planned for 2013. Once the west is fully recovered, the good times will return to China and the other big Asian exporters. This may be indeed what happens over the next six months. Equally, it could be the case that the ECB has merely bought Europe&apos;s policymakers a quiet August and that when they get back from the beach in September the old worries will resurface. Greece will go bust when the Troika (the ECB, the EU and the International Monetary Fund) refuses to give it another bailout, the Germans will refuse to allow Mario Draghi at the ECB to fire his &quot;big bazooka&quot;, and the economic news will get worse and worse. America&apos;s recovery will stall, leading to a victory for Mitt Romney in November. The new president will take early action to slash the deficit, pushing not just the US but also the global economy deep into recession. A third scenario \u2013 and perhaps the most likely one \u2013 is that things remain messy. Policymakers find it impossible to repair the damage caused by the events of the past five years but instead try to adjust to the &quot;new normal&quot;. Mark Cliffe, the chief economist at ING, says &quot;massive and unprecedented action&quot; by governments has manipulated asset prices in an attempt to cushion the blow from the painful de-leveraging that would have otherwise taken place in the financial and public sectors. Zombie banks, real-estate bubbles in China, rising commodity bubbles, and rocketing budget deficits are the price that has been paid for avoiding a slump as severe as that of the 1930s. The risk is that this is simply delaying the inevitable, which is what, from their different perspective, the Marxist and Austrian schools believe. The Marxists say this is the world of overproduction, suppressed wages and falling profit shares described in Das Capital; the Austrians say capitalism can be revived only if the rottenness is purged from the system. Draghi, Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve, and Sir Mervyn King at the Bank of England, say the exceptional measures they are taking are justified because, given time, they will work. So, this is a world in which the Bank of England has bought a third of UK gilts, a world in which the Federal Reserve has pumped trillions of dollars into the US economy for fear the money supply will collapse, a world in which the ECB props up European banks so they can buy government bonds nobody else will touch, and a world in which China can keep its growth model functioning only through manipulation of the exchange rate and unproductive investment. Apparently, this is the &quot;new normal&quot;. There doesn&apos;t, to be frank, seem much normal about it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/aug/13/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["Bitcoinica was launched by Zhou Tong, who claimed to be a 17-year-old based in Singapore and communicated primarily through blog and forum posts."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-13T05:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Dell's fate, Bitcoin lawsuit, analysing Samsung and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrencies"], "article": "A quick burst of 7 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Stick a fork in it: Dell is done. &gt;&gt; PandoDaily Farhad Manjoo:   In a week and a half, Dell will announce its second-quarter earnings results.

Bitcoinica was launched by Zhou Tong, who claimed to be a 17-year-old based in Singapore and communicated primarily through blog and forum posts.

Instead, after ensuring that his team &quot;runs through the line&quot; to deliver the Paralympic Games with the same precision and passion as they oversaw the Olympics, Coe would be forgiven for taking some time out to spend with his family (he recently remarried), write a book, indulge his love of Chelsea Football Club and review his options. But with the same rigour that he brought to his athletic career and the Locog role, he is likely to have already planned his next move with precision. He will do so from a position of strength, surfing a level of public approval he has not known since his track days. It has been a long journey, from being crashed onto the judo mat by the now foreign secretary when he was William Hague&apos;s chief of staff to receiving the heartfelt cheers of 80,000 people in recognition of a Games that had been delivered to his own design but succeeded beyond even his expectations. No other Olympic Games has been so umbilically linked with one man. For nine years, since he took over as leader of the bid from Barbara Cassani until Sunday&apos;s closing ceremony, he has steadfastly refused to engage in any debate about what he might do afterwards. But as the opening ceremony loomed, he confirmed in public what has been an open secret in the sports administration world for some time and said he would like to become the next president of the International Association of Athletics Federations. With the automatic International Olympic Committee membership that would confer, he would have a path to getting on to the executive board of the most powerful body in world sport and, perhaps, a tilt at becoming president. Although the incumbent, Lamine Diack, is unlikely to step down until his term ends in 2015, and the Ukrainian former pole vaulter Sergey Bubka would be an obstacle in his path, Coe would be the favourite to succeed the Senegalese at the IAAF. The 55-year-old remains passionate about his sport and amid the punishing schedule of the Games seemed to only really come alive in discussing the athletic achievements of Mo Farah, Usain Bolt or David Rudisha. As he sat alongside Diack at a press conference on Saturday night, shortly before Farah stormed to gold, he wore the air of a man who had delivered for his sport. He sees in London an opportunity now to reconnect the British public with track and field and restore the sport to its 1980s heyday when he, Steve Cram, Steve Ovett and Peter Elliott had the country rapt and it was considered on a par with football, rugby and cricket in terms of popularity. Since his time as a double Olympic hero, the intervening years had not necessarily been kind to perceptions of Coe among the public at large. A successful businessman then a Tory MP, there was a prevailing impression that he was a bit too clever for his own good. Even up until the eve of the Games, his achievements as Locog chair seemed to inspire grudging respect rather than warm appreciation. The successful delivery of a feelgood Games to a giddy nation has changed all that. Where he sometimes seemed a fish out of water in Westminster, he has proved himself a hugely effective operator in the sometimes arcane world of international sports politics. In league with an effective team including chief executive Sir Keith Mills, and Sir Craig Reedie, then BOA chairman and now IOC executive board member, he did what many others had failed to do before him and got London&apos;s bid over the winning line in Singapore. Those networking skills were also in evidence last year as London beat Doha to the 2017 world athletics championships. Sealing that deal was crucial for Coe if he was to secure an athletics legacy for the \u00a3428m Olympic Stadium that had become a political hot potato amid a botched process to find a football club to move in. Given Coe&apos;s instinctive recoil from going back into party politics, accepting David Cameron&apos;s offer to take up an as yet ill-defined role as a &quot;legacy ambassador&quot; could yet come back to bite him. He had previously endlessly spoken of &quot;passing the baton&quot; when he faced searching questions on delivering the legacy promises he made in Singapore that helped secure the Games, intimating that he preferred to keep up the pressure on politicians from outside the tent. Coe may think that the part time, unpaid role will mean lending his name to drives for overseas investment, but there is a danger he will now be made answerable for the government&apos;s increasingly confused sports policy. Rather than being able to put pressure on politicians from above the fray, he may find himself dragged down into squabbles over school sport and grassroots investment. On the other hand, he may feel that he can help draw together the sort of cross-party consensus that pretty much held for the duration of the London 2012 project. Given the potential jeopardy of getting it wrong, and the potential upside of getting it right, mortal political enemies such as Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, or Tessa Jowell and Jeremy Hunt, stood side by side. &quot;I don&apos;t see this as being inside the tent or outside the tent. I was asked by the prime minister if I would play my part alongside others about how we can maximally leverage every ounce of legacy. I&apos;m very happy to play my part. The basis of what we said in Singapore was not simply the successful delivery of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, but there had to be a follow up story to that,&quot; he said on Monday. But without the glue of a huge single project with \u00a39.3bn and Britain&apos;s international reputation at stake, it will be hard. Longer term, his eyes are on the IAAF and the IOC. Reedie and Coe in harness have never lost an election, and are confident he can land the IAAF presidency in time to be in post for the 2017 world athletics championships in London. By then, there will be a new IOC president: Tthe incumbent, Jacques Rogge, will step down next year at the end of a 12 year term. The favourite to replace him, the German Thomas Bach, would be likely to serve for a further eight or 12 years. There is a chance that Coe, who will be 68 by then, could look to challenge for presidency then. Bach is considered a clear favourite but other names in the frame include Puerto Rican Richard Carrion, the Swiss Denis Oswald and the Moroccan former 400m gold medallist Nawal El Moutawakel, who would be the first female IOC president. Coe knows the IOC corridors of power well, having chaired its first ever athletes&apos; commission, but succession to the top table requires years if not decades of networking and power-broking. It is a slow-moving but cut-throat world and the desire to have a non-European president may count against him. IOC insiders think it more likely he will have to ultimately settle for an influential place on the executive board, combined with the role of overseeing international track and field. With his own legacy assured after delivering a Games that will live long in the memory, Rogge said that having delivered London&apos;s &quot;happy and glorious&quot; Games Coe could effectively do whatever he wanted to at their joint closing press conference. &quot;He is a man with his heart in the right place, he thinks about the athletes first. He has a lot of skills. He should have a great future not only in sport but in society. I have a high esteem for Sebastian,&quot; said Rogge in the manner of a kindly elder brother. Rogge also paid tribute to Coe&apos;s ability to build a team and much of his success can be attributed to his luck and judgment in hiring well. That can be seen most clearly in his choice of former banker Paul Deighton as chief executive, but also in Jean Tomlin, the HR director who oversaw volunteer recruitment, and Debbie Jevans, his director of sport, who delivered innovative and engaging stages for the athletes to perform on. The most telling example, though, was the warmth and mutual respect between Coe and Danny Boyle, the left-leaning film director who delivered London&apos;s spectacular opening ceremony and set the tone for what was to come. It was Coe who protected Boyle from political interference and allowed him to pursue his vision. Cameron, who has clearly enjoyed basking in the success of Team GB&apos;s athletes but has seemed less sure footed on capitalising on the sporting legacy, might do well to listen to his new &quot;legacy ambassador&quot; on the need to approach a complex topic with sensitivity and care. &quot;That cross-party debate I hope is a grown-up debate. The one thing that politicians of any hue now recognise is there is an appetite for that,&quot; said Coe."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/aug/14/paul-ryan-conservative-saviour-republican-albatross", "sentences": ["And on the same page Kishmore Mahbubani, an academic policy analyst in Singapore, patiently explained why the New York state regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, was wrong to beat up on Standard Chartered Bank the way he did."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-14T12:33:25Z", "title": "Paul Ryan: conservative saviour or Republican albatross? | Michael White", "tags": ["Paul Ryan", "Politics", "Mitt Romney", "UK news", "World news", "Republicans", "US news", "US politics", "US elections 2012"], "article": "It didn&apos;t take long for Mitt Romney&apos;s Republican running-mate, Paul Ryan, to make the kind of impact on us foreigners which will delight his admirers and confirm the bookies&apos; hunch that Barack Obama may well win his second term in November despite an ailing US economy. Just two days on the job and some bright spark has just unearthed Ryan&apos;s attack on the NHS. It confirms the impression I got from reading the Fleet St Tory press on Sunday after Romney&apos;s introduction of him as &quot;the next president of the United States&quot; (whoops). &quot;Who says Romney is always risk-averse, eh?&quot; and, &quot;this will set the contest alight&quot;. It sounded like whistling in the dark to keep conservative spirits up, knowing that the choice may well prove a Palin-esque mistake. We can shrug and say that Congressman Ryan doesn&apos;t know much about the NHS, either its strengths or weaknesses, so we needn&apos;t waste much time on his views. That&apos;s true as far as it goes. Very bright (so we keep being told) and charismatic (Mitt needs help in that department), Ryan is an ideologue who would look at a taxpayer-funded healthcare system and condemn it out of hand. That&apos;s what he did in the Wall St Journal (proprietor: R Murdoch) in 2009 when he warned that the Obama health plan would put the US on &quot;a glide path towards European-style socialism&quot; in which voters would become dependent on government, reluctant to embrace spending cuts which might hit their healthcare. &quot;We need only look to Great Britain and elsewhere to see the effects of socialised healthcare on the broader economy. Once a large number of citizens get their heathcare from the State (it&apos;s always with a capital &apos;S&apos; among the Ryan crowd), it dramatically alters their attachment to government,&quot; he wrote. OK, we can follow that and agree with it \u2013 or not. What we do know is that the UK still spends less than 10% of its GDP on healthcare, as do most advanced EU healthcare systems, more or less, while the US spends at least 15%, and probably nearer 17%, a US health executive (private sector) told me recently. Which system its both fairer and more efficient in terms of health outcomes? We all know the answer. Despite the brilliance of its hi-tech medicine and its restless quest for innovation, it&apos;s not the US. That&apos;s what the great battle over Obama healthcare was all about: to create a system underpinned by compulsory insurance \u2013 nearly 50 million Americans, one in six, are uninsured \u2013 greater efficiency as well as fairness and bear down on costs which benefit doctors, insurance firms and pharmaceuticals, but not US business overall. Health costs are a weighty burden on both employers and staff, the largest single cause of personal bankruptcy. We know all this, don&apos;t we? That&apos;s where critics of Andrew Lansley&apos;s marketisation plan for the NHS \u2013 a bit more competition between the NHS, private and voluntary providers - often get it wrong. Lansley knows what a mess the US system is and doesn&apos;t want to copy it. No one does and even pro-market campaigners like Reform now cite the low-cost health care innovations being pioneered in places like Mexico and Brazil as examples we might usefully explore. For all his vaunted cleverness I doubt if Paul Ryan knows much about this. Americans are surprisingly insular in many ways, that&apos;s why they call their local baseball competition the World Series (although the Toronto Blue Jays are allowed to play). Example? Two from yesterday&apos;s FT will do. Columnist Gillian Tett explained that many major American corporations earn most revenue abroad now - 90% of sales are overseas even for Tupperware now \u2013 which helps in a recession, but is bad for US politics. Most CEOs can no longer be bothered with it. And on the same page Kishmore Mahbubani, an academic policy analyst in Singapore, patiently explained why the New York state regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, was wrong to beat up on Standard Chartered Bank the way he did. Right or wrong (probably wrong?) he acted unilaterally (probably for local political reasons) in a world where co-ordinated action between global bank regulators is more vital than ever. It wouldn&apos;t occur to Benny that Asian regulators might be unimpressed \u2013 and that their views now count for a lot, his for less. But Paul Ryan is a familiar type in so many ways. Check out his CV here. Being born in heartland Wisconsin doesn&apos;t automatically make him insular. The region&apos;s industries have bled badly during globalisation. But he&apos;s also a professional politician of the kind conservatives usually like to deplore \u2013 Barack Obama didn&apos;t have much of a CV before politics either. Ryan&apos;s father died young of heart trouble (there&apos;s a family history) which has made him a fitness fanatic, something American health policymakers need to take more seriously than most. He worked his way through college, but also used his late father&apos;s state benefits to help out. There ought to be an irony check here, but \u2013 as Obama is already pointing out - Ryan advocates a small state solution while still voting for expensive government programmes. We know the type. Professional politician? Yes, After college in Ohio, where he first encountered Hayek, Friedman, Von Mises and the intoxicating works of Ayn Rand (Alan Greenspan, who presided over the great boom and bust at the Federal Reserve was also a Rand fan), Ryan went straight to work for Wisconsin senator Bob Kasten at just 22. When Kasten lost his seat the same year (1992) Ryan stayed on in Washington \u2013 the wicked capital to Tea Party types \u2013 so he&apos;s not the &quot;Washington outsider&quot; they claim he is. Within six years \u2013 at 28 \u2013 he was back home (1997) and elected to Congress. He will face his eighth re-election (the law allows it) while running for Veep this autumn. Though he always did part-time jobs, there&apos;s a sniff of privilege in that CV, the long-established Ryan family construction business and some political jobs which may have helped him up the ladder. Meritocracy and nepotism are close cousins, as we know. As you&apos;ve probably read in the past two days Ryan is now chairman of the House of Representatives budget committee, author of the Ryan Plan to shrink the federal government by such devices as a cap on healthcare spending (ironically Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, are government programmes that outspend the NHS), a 10% cut in government jobs and a simplified income tax system, 10% and 25% bands to replace the current six. That&apos;s a $6tn cut in federal spending over 10 years and would trim everything from roads and airports to student loans, environmental protection and food stamps for the poor \u2013 everything except social security (which is basically benefits and pensions) and defence. Ryan&apos;s proposed &quot;block grant&quot; system of payment to states running Medicaid would on some estimates cut the numbers entitled to it from 41 million to 27 million. It has prompted the wits to say that Romney, who has flip-flopped on so many issues in his quest for the presidency, has now outsourced his brain. Whatever the candidate says to reassure Middle America that he&apos;s not as radical as Ryan, the running mate is the more dynamic figure, the man who brought vast cheering crowds of loyalists out to cheer an astonished Romney in Waukesha, Wisconsin, yesterday. Plenty of Americans see government as the enemy \u2013 and only this year big money funded a successful referendum result in Wisconsin to endorse the governor&apos;s plans to curb trade union rights, this in a state once famous for progressive welfare reform. There was a mass shooting at a Sikh temple there only last week. Many people are under pressure and come up with some crazy solutions. One of the more interesting articles on Ryan that I have read claims that he is more of a principled conviction politician than many critics \u2013 or this article \u2013 might suggest. Jacob Weisberg, chairman of the Slate website, has been telling his readers that Ryan&apos;s arrival on the ticket will force Americans to consider basic issues they might otherwise be tempted to duck. Thus he would pay for some of his promised tax cuts \u2013 Americans love tax cuts, even when it leads straight to added debts for their children - by eliminating tax deductions. He doesn&apos;t say which ones, but that is a recipe for getting more taxes from the rich. Other commentators say that Ryan&apos;s arrival allows Obama to switch the election&apos;s spotlight from his record, patchy in hard Bush-created times, to what a Romney-Ryan administration might do. Scary stuff. Weisberg&apos;s sombre conclusion is that Ryan knows about the hard choices ahead for the US as it seeks to improve its performance in the face of the Chinese ascendancy, that he has a coherent policy which finally starts to make have-it-both-ways conservatives honest as the Democrats are not yet in the quest to make government more affordably efficient. Brutal honesty in election year is a bold option. For that reason Ryan on the ticket probably means a Republican defeat in November. Rupert Murdoch, who likes winners, is backing him. But, as we know, Rupe is fast losing his grip. David Cameron should watch from a safe distance and learn from the Romney-Ryan train crash."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/14/olympic-legacy-london-2012-school-sport", "sentences": ["When London won the right to host the Games in 2005 in Singapore, under the Labour government, those at the heart of the project proclaimed it was a once-in-a-generation corrective: an opportunity to place sport at the heart of health, education and social policy; to knit together a coherent plan so the \u00a39.3bn cost of the Games would catalyse the estimated \u00a31bn investment in sport, across elite funding, schools, the grassroots and local authorities; to cut down on duplication and bureaucracy; and to give sport a role at the heart of government rather than considering it a sideshow."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-14T18:02:12Z", "title": "London 2012's school sport legacy?

That didn&apos;t happen for the rest of Labour&apos;s tenure, although huge investment in school sport began to pay dividends and there was some (but not enough) progress in directing a proportion of the health budget to prevention rather than cure. And it certainly hasn&apos;t happened under the coalition, largely because the education secretary, Michael Gove, saw fit to dismantle a hugely effective school sports network on ideological grounds. The School Sports Partnerships hobble on in reduced form, having had their funding slashed from \u00a3162m to \u00a365m, but even that reduced funding runs out next year. Just as worryingly, the money to release specialist PE teachers to work in primary schools is also due to run out in the next academic year. While the government has promised to continue funding the elite performance system that led to an avalanche of medals \u2013 not a difficult call in the wake of a record medal haul in return for \u00a380m extra over two years \u2013 and there is at least a vaguely coherent plan in place for the grassroots (albeit with no increase in funding or guarantee it will work), the incoherence of the government&apos;s policy on school sport undermines that progress. Sir Keith Mills, who played an instrumental role in winning the Games for London and delivered the successful International Inspiration overseas legacy programme, has called for a wholesale rethink of sports administration and a new national plan that is backed at the highest levels of government \u2013 one that can&apos;t be unpicked by future ministers. And Lord Coe, the hero of the hour after helming a hugely successful Games, has called for a wide-ranging debate that recognises the need for a cross-party, cross-departmental long-term plan. The government would do well to listen to them. Instead, we have had Cameron&apos;s ill-advised broadside against &quot;Indian dancing&quot;, and a return to the tired debate of competitive sport versus exercise. It is a red herring because both have their place; instilling in children a love of exercise for its own sake and allowing them to get the most out of organised sport are entirely compatible. But both need time, money and expertise at both primary and secondary level. While the Department of Culture, Media and Sport is busy investing in a new strategy to stop 14 to 25 year olds dropping out of sport, the Department for Education is undermining the chances of them getting into it in the first place. Sports minister Hugh Robertson, who has spent eight years either in the role or its shadow, warned of the complexity of the debate and said it was no time for kneejerk reactions or policy on the hoof. &quot;It is deeply unhelpful. To see the school sport debate simply as a question of competitive sport versus participation is an over-simplification. There are a number of ingredients in this pile: the number of PE teachers and what they do, the role of after school clubs, the role of school club links, primary provision and all the rest of it. It&apos;s a complicated, bigger picture,&quot; he said on Tuesday. &quot;I have been tearing my hair out for the last three or four days because the terms in which this debate has been conducted have not been helpful to finding a solution. The last thing we want is a school sport initiative. We want to have a structured think about how to move forward.&quot; Before the Games, culture secretary Jeremy Hunt seemed more concerned with whether there would be enough ponchos to go around if it rained or how to control the crowds expected to pour into central London. After it, he railed against a reporter who asked whether enough was being done to develop a cross-departmental strategy to maximise the Olympic legacy. &quot;I am absolutely astonished that you even dare to ask that question after the most stunningly successful example of joined-up government that any of us have ever seen, with 19 government departments working incredibly well to put on a wonderful Games,&quot; he said. He would do well to instead listen to Coe \u2013 who has taken on the unpaid role of &quot;legacy ambassador&quot; \u2013 and his own sports minister."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/14/london-2012-olympic-legacy", "sentences": ["It advised that hosting events such as the Olympics would produce surging national pride, but for a huge cost: &quot;It would seem that hosting events is not an effective, value for money method of achieving a sustained increase in mass participation.&quot; Nevertheless, three years later, Blair pledged to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore that a London Games would do exactly that."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-14T18:30:54Z", "title": "London 2012 euphoria has died, but will the Olympic legacy live on?", "tags": ["Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games 2012", "UK news", "Sport", "Fitness", "Life and style", "Schools", "Education", "Jessica Ennis-Hill", "Local government", "Lord Coe", "Olympic Games"], "article": "It was the key pledge supporting London&apos;s bid to host the Olympics, made winningly by Lord Coe and the then-prime minister Tony Blair: that a British Games would &quot;inspire a generation&quot; to become more involved in sport. A nation still heady with the glories it has witnessed now expects greater sporting opportunities as a legacy of the Games and their \u00a39.3bn cost, but the Olympic torch has not burned away the stubborn realities dragging people the other way. Modern life for most besides those few full-time athletes is increasingly sedentary; Britain&apos;s sports facilities are old, tired and seriously underfunded, and being further depleted by swingeing government cuts to local authority budgets. The slashing of the \u00a3162m funding of school sport partnerships imposed by the education secretary, Michael Gove, in 2010, has received most criticism in the context of developing a genuine sporting legacy, but encouraging adults to be more active is a greater challenge. Critics say in the seven years since the Games were awarded to London, no sufficiently coherent plan, backed by will and resources, has been developed by the government to capitalise on the post-Olympic rush of enthusiasm. Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, while pointing to the \u00a31bn which Sport England, the grant-giving agency, has to invest over four years from 2013-17, acknowledges that driving up participation is &quot;very difficult,&quot; and a major advance is unlikely to come quickly. &quot;I think we will see an improvement,&quot; he said. &quot;The Olympics have been marvellous, and generated huge interest. But none of the things that made this difficult have been lessened. We are talking about societal change. If participation increases, it is likely to be on a long-term, incremental basis.&quot; Some say the prospect of even gradual improvement is being damaged by the government&apos;s cuts to local authorities, which own and run public sports facilities, but have no statutory duty to do so. In Sheffield, home of gold medal-winning heptathlete and &quot;face of the Olympics&quot; Jessica Ennis, the council is seeking a 20% reduction in its swimming pool, leisure centre and facilities budget, including that of the Don Valley Stadium, where Ennis trains, as it wrestles with a reduction to its government grant of at least \u00a3170m over three years. The council has already &quot;drastically reduced&quot; its maintenance of parks, including playing fields, according to its leader, Julie Dore. &quot;The chance of an Olympic legacy is being undermined,&quot; she said, &quot;and the situation is only going to get worse. We believe in all the benefits of sport, and do not want to close any facilities, but when we are forced to cut on this scale, our statutory responsibilities mean that sport, leisure and parks become an easy target.&quot; Councils are being forced to implement cuts of \u00a36.25bn, 28% of their grants from the government, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, according to the Local Government Association. Playing fields, sports centres and swimming pools, and the staff to run them, are under threat and many budgets are being cut. The LGA warned earlier this year that by 2020 funding of discretionary services, including sport, faces a 66% reduction, and could disappear, due to the mounting cost of adult social care, which councils must provide. A survey of councils by the Chief Cultural and Leisure Officers Association (CLOA) earlier this year found that services, including arts and culture as well as sport, are suffering reductions of around 10% on average, with further cuts to come. So far, the CLOA estimated, 2,800 jobs have been lost in the sector. &quot;The sheer scale of ongoing cuts to local government funding represents the biggest single threat to a participation legacy for London 2012,&quot; said Andy Burnham, the shadow health minister. The \u00a31bn government and lottery funding of Sport England is the prime national vehicle now for encouraging participation, distributed to the governing sports bodies, which have targets to meet. A central aspect of the strategy is to link local sports clubs with schools, which often have an area&apos;s best facilities, and to staunch the huge drop in people taking part in sport after they leave education. Jennie Price, Sport England&apos;s chief executive, is optimistic for a post-Olympics increase in participation, but acknowledged many governing bodies, whose role has traditionally been focused on running clubs and competitions, were not equipped for the new development drive. She cited hockey, netball and cycling as examples. &quot;We have a reasonable chance,&quot; Price said. &quot;Around half the governing bodies have a good understanding of what motivates participation and are evolving different models of their sports to make them attractive.&quot; The challenge of helping people to be more active has grown into a major public health issue, although there remains limited co-operation across government departments responsible for different aspects of the problem. Sport England&apos;s survey in April 2012 found 15.3m people, 35.7% of the population, participated in at least 30 minutes of moderately intensive sport once a week, the recommended minimum. Department of Health guidelines for people to be active, which include brisk walking for at least half an hour five times a week, is met by only 37% of British adults, according to research published last month in the medical journal, the Lancet. So, the nation still hugging itself with pride at the prowess of Team GB athletes has 64% of its adults not playing sport once a week, and 63% not even walking often enough to be physically healthy. The mental and physical health consequences of inactivity are the subject of persistent official warnings; the latest NHS health survey for England found that in 2010 68% of adults were obese or overweight, a growing tendency in recent times, and 16% of children were obese. The economic cost of obesity is estimated at \u00a350bn a year by 2050, \u00a39.7bn to the NHS. Yet despite the warnings, progress towards increasing participation has been slow, and several ambitious targets have been abandoned. Sport England&apos;s figures show there was a jump of almost 1m in 2007-08, but since then, only around 400,000 more people have been drawn into playing sport. Given the stubborn factors pulling people to inactivity, it was always controversial for Coe and Blair to claim that hosting the Olympics would inspire a generation to do more. Surprising as it sounds, while inspirational feats still feature vividly in the national mind, no previous Games has led to a general increase. Blair made the claim even though his Downing St strategy unit had stated in a 2002 report, Game Plan, that the links are tenuous between watching top athletes perform and being motivated to do sport. &quot;There is little evidence that hosting events has a significant influence on participation,&quot; Game Plan concluded. It advised that hosting events such as the Olympics would produce surging national pride, but for a huge cost: &quot;It would seem that hosting events is not an effective, value for money method of achieving a sustained increase in mass participation.&quot; Nevertheless, three years later, Blair pledged to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore that a London Games would do exactly that. Coe later admitted the claim was not supported by research or a strategy for how participation would be increased. Then the \u00a32.4bn budget presented by Coe&apos;s bid team, supported by the government, rocketed to \u00a39.3bn, a golden pot of public money which was protected even as government funding was slashed around it. That huge expense, vindicated by the sparkling and brilliantly-organised success of the Games, dwarfs the money available to build and maintain sports facilities, and run sport development programmes, across the country. Chris Gratton, professor of sport economics at Sheffield Hallam University, explains that Britain&apos;s limited public sporting stock dates from two phases: late Victorian and early 20th century philanthropy when swimming pools were built, then leisure centres, the fruits of sudden local authority financial surpluses, in the 1970s. &quot;Our commercial facilities, such as private gyms, are relatively good,&quot; Gratton said, &quot;but since the 1970s, comparatively few public facilities have been built.&quot; Under the previous Conservative government, cuts to local authority budgets saw many facilities decline, and thousands of playing fields sold off. A review for Blair&apos;s government by Baron Carter of Coles in March 2005 found that rebuilding sports facilities to modern standards would cost around \u00a34.5bn. Yet no major rebuilding programme has taken place, and just over twice that figure was spent building the Olympic facilities. Gratton said all research into sports participation shows poverty and inequality lead to people being less active. Finland, which has Europe&apos;s highest rates of sports participation, thanks to a strong public health message and making facilities available locally, is a more equal society than Britain. &quot;Poorer people suffer social exclusion,&quot; Gratton said, &quot;which, by definition, applies to exclusion from sport, too.&quot; Robertson agrees, and accepts the cuts to councils will not help. &quot;I do recognise that poverty and inequality affect participation,&quot; he said. &quot;And it would be dishonest not to recognise that local authorities cutting budgets will have an impact.&quot; He pointed in compensation to changes in lottery distributions which he championed, increasing the proportion of the lottery total going to sport from 13.7%, to 20%, enabling Sport England&apos;s \u00a31bn four-year funding. He identified too a specific Olympic legacy programme, Places People Play, targeted at making small grants to facilities in poorer areas \u2013 the initiative&apos;s budget is \u00a3135m over three years. Robertson said that while the Games were a huge success, and had given sport &quot;a tremendous boost,&quot; the afterglow is unlikely to translate into a great upsurge in participation. &quot;We have held an Olympics which surpassed expectations; it has produced an amazing stimulus, and a new generation of sporting heroes. However anybody who remotely pretends it will be easy to increase general participation in sport is kidding themselves.&quot; So, the claim that a London Games would inspire a generation to do more sport, is in danger of being an over-promise. After the euphoria, the battle is against sedentary culture, junk food, haggard sports facilities, too few opportunities, local authority cuts, and, for young people, inequality between private and state schools. If this landscape undergoes no post-Olympic transformation, Britons who supported the Games so wholeheartedly may come to feel short-changed by its legacy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/aug/15/music-alliance-pact-august", "sentences": ["MUON is also a musical entity that exists in Singapore, whether as one person (Nick Chan) or more (currently, Jordan, Ren and Adam)."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-15T08:00:00Z", "title": "August's best music from across the MAP", "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "article": "Right-click on the song title to download an MP3, or grab a zip file of the 34-track compilation through Ge.tt here.

Those violins and cascading treble guitars which duck and weave out of the chorus provide a nice backdrop to the band&apos;s quieter moments and slight Arcade Fire stylings that mesh together so well. If Felusine is a pitch into the musical void, someone needs to sign these guys real soon.

The duo will go on a US tour with Grass Widow in September and also record a 7&quot; record there. Freaks And Geeks is taken from their debut album Playdate, recorded by Wolfgang M\u00f6stl (of previous MAP act Mile Me Deaf).  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoIconili \u2013 O Rei De TupangaThe fusion of jazz, experimentalism and African beats is the guideline for Iconili, formed by eight young musicians from Minas Gerais.

Begin here with the excellent Running With Insanity.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogStealing Sheep \u2013 Shut EyeThis all-girl Liverpool trio&apos;s debut album Into The Diamond Sun is more Staves/Warpaint than Atomic Kitten. The fact that one of the members hails from an area with a rich folk tradition seems to have seeped into their music, which has a pagan-ish, medieval quality to it. Elsewhere it is possible to detect influences as varied as The Go-Go&apos;s and The Monkees, The Doors and Talking Heads, and there is a blend of good old-fashioned &quot;played&quot; instruments and electronic drones and effects, but always the folk elements shine through.  FINLAND: GlueSatellite Stories \u2013 Anti-LoverIndie quartet Satellite Stories have delivered several party songs over the last couple of years to become one of Finland&apos;s most promising acts. Anti-Lover is the first single from their debut album Phrases To Break The Ice which will be released this autumn. It is three minutes of energetic guitar-based, dance-oriented indie-pop.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredThe Aerial \u2013 ClarityThe Aerial are one of France&apos;s top up-and-coming bands. Hailing from Nancy, they released their first EP in April, in which each of their songs show a different influence, all while staying very danceable. In just four songs, they manage to sound like The Rapture, Foals and Foster The People. Clarity is their most electro-pop oriented song and is supported by a killer beat and an impeccable production. Don&apos;t miss unreleased single Running on YouTube.  GERMANY: BlogparteiCamera \u2013 AuslandLet&apos;s continue our little series of new Kraut with Berlin trio Camera. Although they connect to the old Kraut by playing with Michael Rother and Dieter Moebius, their music sounds refreshing. First single Ausland keeps the typical meandering melodies and synths but brings back rock to Krautrock. Their debut album, due out this month, incorporates many more influences and will, of course, be released on Bureau B.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaThe Last Drive \u2013 Child Of The SkyThe Last Drive are regarded as one of the most important and influential bands of the Greek underground music scene. They were formed 30 years ago and, through their explosive live performances and unique sound, became rapidly popular. After their dynamic comeback in 2007 (they split up in 1995), they released Heavy Liquid, a crafted mix of intense, raw rock &apos;n&apos; roll songs, blurred melodies, addictive fuzz guitar riffs and almost primitive drums that unites disparate musical elements into blasts of noisy cohesion and howling passion. Right before the recording of their new LP, they have just unleashed News From Nowhere, an imprint of the difficult times we&apos;re living.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnJ\u00f3nas Sigur\u00f0sson \u2013 \u00deyrniger\u00f0i\u00f0This is the first single from J\u00f3nas Sigur\u00f0sson&apos;s upcoming third album, \u00dear Sem Himinn Ber Vi\u00f0 Haf (&quot;Where The Sky Touches The Sea&quot;). J\u00f3nas, who is widely considered one of the most inventive musicians in Iceland, reinvents himself yet again by introducing electronic influences to his otherwise soulful, folksy and rhythmic sound. If you like what you hear you should really check out his first two albums.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarAwl \u2013 AlbertineAwl is Joan Lumanauw (The Wispy Hummers) and Mickey (Tenderpaw) creating noises and melodies for the world to dance to. You might think of The Raveonettes or Best Coast but if you listen carefully you&apos;ll find something of their own.  IRELAND: Nialler9Orquesta \u2013 Kokomo (feat. Jape, Kathi Burke &amp; Katie Kim)His recent acceptance into the prestigious Red Bull Music Academy is yet another reason to pay attention to Dublin producer Orquesta. Previously, he shot to attention with this gorgeous cover of The Beach Boys holiday anthem Kokomo. Featuring the vocal talents of Irish stalwarts Jape and Katie Kim, the song is a modern tropical uplift.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesGreeen Linez \u2013 Palm Coast FreewayGreeen Linez take a lot of inspiration from City Pop, a style of music that was popular in Japan during the late 80s and early 90s. Palm Coast Freeway captures this luxurious sound quite well, the elegant synths and bass suitable for both a dance club and a bank lobby. Palm Coast Freeway is on the album Things That Fade, which features even more modern takes on the City Pop sound.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaHey Sus! \u2013 The PressMike and Andrew write tunes under the name Hey Sus! They try to create surfy indie-pop-folk with hip hop beats, provided by Thom. They recently released a split EP on cassette with Clandestines, titled Summer Camp For Pale Young Boys, from which The Press is taken.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaSoul Compas \u2013 Por InsurgentesSoul Compas is a rap group formed by Eric El Ni\u00f1o, Konceptos and Milio Boogie, three well-known MCs from the Mexican rap scene. With the influence of Native Tongues, G-funk and post-Dilla movements, they have created Al Comp\u00e1s Del Soul, a humorous and fresh album that can be downloaded for free on their website. Por Insurgentes is one of their most interesting tracks. Aside from those swell samples, they&apos;ve pictured an imaginary trip on one of the most important avenues of Mexico City, Insurgentes, which happens to be the longest road that crosses the city north to south, and shows most of its contradictions and emblematic places.  PERU: SoTBHerzchenschmerzchen \u2013 Tic TacHerzchenschmerzchen, a word written in German and difficult to pronounce, is the name of Maria Jose Jordan&apos;s solo project. This young woman reveals her indie-folk interests in her self-titled debut EP. Get ready to open a Pandora&apos;s Box of musical gems such as the sweet Tic Tac.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogFair Weather Friends \u2013 Fortune PlayerAs MAP&apos;s first ambassador for Poland, I bring you some catchy electro-pop from Fair Weather Friends. Fortune Player was used in an official commercial for this summer&apos;s Heineken Open&apos;er Festival (and Coke Live Festival) and caused some internet buzz thanks to its goofy video. You may have heard dozens of pop songs based on synth hooks on MAP but what you might not realise is that this singer is white, with Micha\u0142 Ma\u015blak originally from guitar band Searching For Calm.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?PAPERCUTZ \u2013 Where Beasts DiePAPERCUTZ returns to MAP with an exclusive track. Where Beasts Die is from their new album, The Blur Between Us. Bruno Miguel&apos;s impressive project has paved its way with hard work, gathering a considerable fanbase outside Portugal. They were recently selected for the Red Bull Music Academy, which will take place in New York next year.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndiePasajero \u2013 En La PlayaDaniel Vicente brings a delicate blend of pop, rock and electronic flourishes to his art and music project, Pasajero. His most recent EP boasts three layered tracks that highlight this idiosyncratic mix of influences, ranging from local acts like Superaquello to international names such as The Postal Service. En La Playa is a powerful tune featuring guest vocals by Carolina Martinez. With a dreamy pop quality that reminds us of waves slowly crashing at the beach at dusk, the song also addresses Puerto Rico&apos;s current state of affairs and the alarming apathy that seems to have taken over its inhabitants. A great lead-off track for a &quot;political dream-pop&quot; playlist.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseChanging Skins \u2013 Perfect FoesChanging Skins is an eclectic Bucharest-based band who rock the thin line between alternative and electronic music. They plan to release their debut album in October. NME recently posted a live video of their song Baby on their website.  RUSSIA: Big EchoCream Child \u2013 With The WindSchool Skulls is not just another sweet summer record with soft beats - it&apos;s a great balance of good and evil, happy and melancholy, that results in tunes inspired by Russian folklore, candy, death and marvelous melodies like With The Wind.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopQuickbeam \u2013 Seven Hundred BirdsQuickbeam play at a volume that requires pin-drop silence from the audience and they&apos;ve got the talent to write songs that demand such reverential obedience. Harmonium and strings shepherd Seven Hundred Birds into beautifully fragile and exquisitely precise spaces, marrying the raw intensity of Low with the melodic emotiveness of Sigur R\u00f3s. Cinematic stimulation is provided by the song&apos;s staggeringly ethereal promo video.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...MUON \u2013 Aqua AssaultThe muon is an elementary particle similar to an electron. MUON is also a musical entity that exists in Singapore, whether as one person (Nick Chan) or more (currently, Jordan, Ren and Adam). Despite its varying states of existence, MUON&apos;s music is rather akin to its sub-atomic namesake with its deconstruction of pedantic structures, but also as intelligent, intense and cryptic aural and visual forms. Always exciting and always new, MUON has been forged in its singularity, and their craft emerges through parallel universes.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieLang Lee \u2013 HahahaLang Lee could be likened to a Korean Daniel Johnston, but with her own crazy and quirky, sometimes delightfully whimsical, storytelling ranging from teaching Yoda enough Japanese to be able to order green tea to love stories inspired by Kurt Vonnegut. Hahaha is an example of the latter and comes fresh off her just-released first album Yon Yonson.  SPAIN: MusikornerPajarita \u2013 Animals (ASIMO Remix)Pajarita began in March 2012 as the musical project of Norah Alexandra Vega and her ukelele and, a few months on, she&apos;s already about to release her first album via Discosdelrollo. Pajarita&apos;s style can be described as lo-fi pop, dreamy and awesomely catchy for its simpleness and discretion. Animals (ASIMO Remix), though, might be the exception that confirms the rule about her music.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaPicture \u2013 TruePicture, aka David Kyhlberg from the enigmatic duo Sail A Whale, makes elusive, trance-inducing electronic pop that&apos;s nothing short of amazing. True, the title track and first single from his debut EP, is no exception. This is probably as close to The Tough Alliance as you can get in 2012. The EP is out now on one of our favourite labels, Cascine.  SWITZERLAND: 78sBiggles \u2013 Let A New World BeginSven R\u00fcf aka Biggles from Zurich is a singer-songwriter with a special talent for making music that sounds simultaneously humorous and fragile. His songs always come with a decent dose of mischief, which is why we love him so much. His fifth long-player Cloudspeaker is released this month, guaranteeing pop music without boundaries.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATAdult Monkey \u2013 SupermarketAdult Monkey is one of the cutest groups in Istanbul. They nestle all kinds of genres, especially chillwave, ambient lo-fi stuff. Besides being a band, Adult Monkey also contains illustrations and animations. In fact, Adult Monkey is a whole life portfolio for the two cartoonists who put together the band. Supermarket, their newest release, is a knockout track for the hot hot HOT summer.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouHoundmouth \u2013 PenitentiaryLouisville, Kentucky&apos;s Houndmouth writes music that I like to call &quot;recession rock&quot;. Their music echoes the dirt roads of back-country counties during the night, the discarded bar stools in the back lot of an abandoned whisky joint, or the overall beauty that can sometimes be found in despair. Houndmouth, while young, bring the similar sounds of The Band back into contemporary rotation.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sLos Polaroid \u2013 El Blues De Sus Piernas (Chicago Blues)Los Polaroid formed in Maracaibo in 2010 with the idea of creating a musical proposal inspired by genres like jazz and blues.

It will be the first time ever any host country has issued Gold Medal stamps for their Paralympic winners since the movement was founded in 1948 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital by Dr Ludwig Guttmann. Andrew Hammond, Managing Director, Royal Mail Stamps, said it was the &quot;right thing&quot; to do. Previously Royal Mail had statement the greater number of Paralympic gold medals expected made it too difficult to produce a stamp for every winner and Hammond said it would be the &quot;greatest logistical challenge in stamps production ever undertaken&quot; by any postal administration. &quot;Just as our Olympians outperformed expectations, we are confident that our Paralympians will also outperform. That would see us issuing many more individual stamps than the 29 printed over the London 2012 Olympics fortnight,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a huge logistical challenge and we will get the Gold Medal stamps for sale as quickly as possible to a network of Post Office branches around the country.&quot; The decision comes after The shadow Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, waded into the row, urging Royal Mail to reconsider its decision. In a letter to the chief executive of Royal Mail, Jowell accused the postal administrators of veering away from the spirit of integration of the Olympics and Paralympics in London 2012, a key feature in its organisation. &quot;From the moment that London won the right to host the Olympics and Paralympics in Singapore, we were always determined to ensure that they would be one vision and one Games,&quot; wrote Jowell. &quot;The people of this country have demonstrated their enthusiasm for the Paralympics through record ticket sales and the prospect of the first ever sell-out Games. The stamps for Team GB&apos;s gold medallists have been such an emblematic part of this nation&apos;s celebrations during the Olympic Games. It would be a shame if this important symbol was not offered to our Paralympian heroes as well.&quot; Other critics also questioned the decision. &quot;How are we going to inspire this generation and the future children of this generation if you exclude our Paralympians from the full celebration of the UK&apos;s sporting achievements?&quot; said one person commenting on the British Paralympic Association website. &quot;Are they somehow not good enough or perhaps not worthy enough to have their individual achievements recognised?&quot; Following Royal Mail&apos;s decision Tim Hollingsworth, Chief Executive Officer, British Paralympic Association, said: &quot;We are delighted that the offer has been increased to enable individual stamps to celebrate our athletes&apos; achievements and thank Royal Mail for reconsidering this proposal. We hope that the whole nation will continue their support of British athletes and cheer us on to many gold medals.&quot; Jowell said after the change of heart: &quot;Royal Mail should be congratulated for making the right decision on this. The stamps for Team GB&apos;s gold medallists have been such an emblematic part of our celebrations during the Games. I am delighted that our Paralympic heroes will be given the same honour.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/aug/16/manchester-united-van-persie-glazers", "sentences": ["Following the worldwide attention focused on the financial manoeuvrings, which came after an abandoned plan last year to float in Singapore, the Glazers ultimately only floated 10% of Manchester United in New York.", "As the investment analyst and critic of the Glazer leveraged buyout Andy Green has pointed out, the saving in interest is exceeded by the $12m (\u00a37.7m) it has cost United in lawyers and other fees to float, following the \u00a37m costs incurred for the aborted flotation in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-16T17:03:30Z", "title": "Manchester United deal for Robin van Persie can't mask Glazers' intentions | David Conn", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Robin van Persie", "The Glazer family", "Football", "Sport", "Business"], "article": "Manchester United&apos;s signing of Robin van Persie has delivered a blast of the ambition which the glory, glory football club is supposed to stand for, after a summer dominated by the shabby details of its owners&apos; float on the New York Stock Exchange. To make sense of United since the US-based Glazer family bought the club and loaded it with \u00a3525m borrowings in 2005, it has always been instructive to wonder where the Reds would be had the US corporate raid never happened. The signing of Van Persie is the boldest of statements for the forthcoming Premier League season, and a reminder of what might have been, if the Glazers had not inflicted their leveraged takeover on United, which has since cost the club over \u00a3550m in interest, fees and charges. Van Persie is United&apos;s first truly major signing of an outfield player \u2013 with due respect to Ashley Young and Phil Jones \u2013 since the club paid \u00a330.75m for Dimitar Berbatov on 31 August 2008. That was the day Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan bought Manchester City, and from then, with Mansour intent on pouring almost \u00a31bn in, the opposite of the Glazers&apos; financial drain, United&apos;s signings have been eclipsed by City&apos;s. Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s justifications have never quite convinced; his assertion that the owners, whom he pronounced &quot;great&quot; this summer, have made enough money available to him but he declined to spend it because there was &quot;no value in the market.&quot; The transfer market can be considered obscenely inflated, but it works both ways and United never spent the \u00a380m received from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo on replacement players of similar class. Instead, the enduring Portuguese puzzle of B\u00e9b\u00e9 aside, Ferguson signed good players of promise including Jones, Young, Chris Smalling and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. The manager repeatedly insisted he was not inhibited by the Glazers&apos; draining the finances, but asserted he was only interested in footballers of youth, who would develop. The hauling of the 37-year-old Paul Scholes out of retirement last season, while City were powered to the title by his world class opponent in midfield, Yaya Tour\u00e9, 28, bought for \u00a324m, exposed United&apos;s vulnerability from successive seasons of declining to land established stars. The Van Persie signing, bitter for Arsenal, swipes that away; he is 29, and is being bought for what he can do now. So this is a taste of the buying power and the A grade ambition United could be expected to have wielded had the Glazers not swooped in 2005 to buy what they describe, in their heart-sinking flotation prospectus, as &quot;one of the world&apos;s most recognisable brands.&quot; The acquisition of Van Persie came a week after the flotation was finally achieved, at a reduced price of $14 per share, the jarring re-registering of the famous Manchester United in the Cayman Islands tax haven, and the choice of New York to trade its shares. United&apos;s Old Trafford-based chief executive, David Gill, and London-office sited vice-chairman Edward Woodward, have pointed in support of the Glazer ownership to United&apos;s much-envied sponsorship deals and doubling of income, from \u00a3159m in the eleven months to 30 June 2005, to \u00a3331m for the year to 30 June 2011. However critics, most prominently the Manchester United Supporters Trust, who campaign for a genuine fans&apos; stake in the club, have always argued bitterly that the Glazers&apos; running of United is designed to serve the family itself. Malcolm Glazer and his six children, &quot;lineal descendants&quot; as the flotation document bloodlessly described them, have conducted a text-book example of a leveraged buyout, loading the money they borrowed to buy the club on to United itself to repay. Amid all the detail, and widespread criticism, of the New York float, for offering to traders a club still \u00a3423m in debt despite the \u00a3550m drained out since 2005, two points are most central to understanding it. Following the worldwide attention focused on the financial manoeuvrings, which came after an abandoned plan last year to float in Singapore, the Glazers ultimately only floated 10% of Manchester United in New York. When they announced on 3 July their plan to float, the Glazers stated that all the money raised would be from selling new shares, and would be used to pay down the debts they loaded on the club. &quot;We intend to use all of our net proceeds from this offering to reduce our indebtedness,&quot; the original prospectus, said. When the flotation actually happened last week, it turned out that the Glazers had changed their intention, and in fact were helping themselves to half the proceeds. They sold some of their shares, and only issued five per cent new shares. Of the $220m (\u00a3140m) earned from selling the Manchester United (Cayman Islands) shares to investors, only $110m (\u00a370m) has ultimately been banked by United. The Glazer family themselves have been paid the other \u00a370m. Reducing the debt by only \u00a370m after all this fuss and effort, at 8.75% annual interest, will save United \u00a36m in interest a year. As the investment analyst and critic of the Glazer leveraged buyout Andy Green has pointed out, the saving in interest is exceeded by the $12m (\u00a37.7m) it has cost United in lawyers and other fees to float, following the \u00a37m costs incurred for the aborted flotation in Singapore. The costs of hocking United around the world are coming out of the club&apos;s share of the proceeds, not the Glazer family&apos;s. The US-based venture capitalist Michael Moritz, who has financially backed companies with huge growth prospects including Google, has repeatedly been scathing about United&apos;s float. He has insisted that the Glazers&apos; financial draining of United for their own interests should be considered by the old-fashioned description: asset-stripping. Although the Glazers never explain themselves publicly, Ferguson, Gill and Woodward have always defended their running of United. Now, with Van Persie, United have found the money to sign a genuinely top class, fully-formed footballing asset, for the first time in years."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/info/2012/aug/17/long-reads-of-the-week", "sentences": ["Photograph: Reuters    The man who opened fire in a Sikh temple in Wisconsin was not just a crazed loner, but a vocal neo-Nazi \u2013 in fact, his white supremacist ideology reflected a growing form of extremism that expresses its strength through violence rather than at the ballot box The ruins of empire: Asia&apos;s emergence from western imperialism     Raffles Place, Singapore \u2026 'European withdrawal after the second world war was never in doubt.'"], "publicationDate": "2012-08-17T12:32:56Z", "title": "In case you missed it ...

According to leaked extracts from the book, Britannia Unchained \u2013 Global Growth and Prosperity, five Tory MPs from the &quot;class of 2010&quot; call for a culture of &quot;graft, risk and effort&quot; to propel Britain into the &quot;superleague&quot; of nations. The book contains a blueprint of radical reforms. The MPs \u2013 Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss \u2013 say: &quot;Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor.&quot; The MPs claim the UK workforce should model itself on the workers of South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, rather those in European nations \u2013 or watch living standards fall away. The Evening Standard reports the authors as saying: &quot;Britain will never be as big as China or Brazil, but we can look forward to a new generation, ready to get to work. If we are to take advantage of these opportunities, we must get on the side of the responsible, the hard working and the brave. We must stop bailing out the reckless, avoiding all risk, and rewarding laziness.&quot; The 184-page book will be published shortly before the Conservatives&apos; autumn conference. In it, the five rehearse well-worn Tory themes about how the welfare state has sapped the strength and vigour of the British economy. &quot;We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor,&quot; they say in the book. Kwarteng told the Standard: &quot;We need to look beyond Europe for economic success. We should be starting now. There is no reason why we can&apos;t be pushing ahead with a lot of this. [London mayor] Boris [Johnson] when he talks about big infrastructure projects, deregulation and cutting taxes, is absolutely on the money.&quot; He added: &quot;There is definitely a new right, which is much more international in its focus.

Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said: &quot;First they blame British businesses for their economic failures and now they blame the people who work within them, showing how out of touch the Tory party has become. &quot;Arguing that working Britons are &apos;the worst idlers in the world&apos; is deeply insulting. People who work hard, play by the rules and pay their taxes shouldn&apos;t have to put up with Tory MPs calling them lazy \u2013 especially when prices are rising faster than their wages, their tax credits are being cut and Britain is in a double-dip recession made in Downing Street.&quot; The controversial comments come days after Johnson urged the prime minister to stop &quot;pussyfooting around&quot; over plans to build another London airport and reduce the strain on Heathrow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/17/save-25000-university-tuition-fee-refugees", "sentences": ["Ben Poulter, 18, from Brentwood County High, a state school in Essex, will be packing his bags in a few weeks&apos; time to head to Singapore, where he will begin a four-year course in business at SP Jain Global School of Management."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-17T22:01:00Z", "title": "Save \u00a325,000 at university and join the 'tuition fee refugees'", "tags": ["Student finance", "Family finances", "Money", "Tuition fees", "Students", "A-levels", "Sixth form", "Higher education", "Education"], "article": "Welcome to the \u00a39,000 tuition fee refugees. The number of British students applying to Dublin&apos;s Trinity College has jumped by 20% to nearly 2,000 this year. At University College Dublin (UCD), applications from students with British A-levels have surged 37% from 800 to around 1,100. The University of Groningen in the Netherlands, where many courses are taught entirely in English, has seen the number of applicants from Britain quadruple in the last two years alone. British 18-year-olds are fleeing the prospect of a \u00a350,000 bill for studying at home \u2013 and finding they can save as much as \u00a325,000 over three years by studying abroad as well as enjoying a life-changing experience. In Denmark, tuition fees for students from within the EU are zero. In the Netherlands, they are around \u20ac1,700 a year (\u00a31,330), and it&apos;s even possible to access Dutch state grants worth around \u20ac500 (\u00a3390) a month (see page 5). Irish institutions such as Trinity and UCD, ranked among the top universities in Europe, charge just \u20ac2,250 a year (\u00a31,760) to EU citizens. It has also emerged that a significant number of UK students have applied to universities in the EU as an &quot;insurance&quot; against failing to achieve the grades they want and having to go through clearing. Many British &quot;Russell group&quot; universities now demand A-level scores of AAB and above, while similarly-ranked Dutch universities accept lower grades \u2013 though they are much tougher (almost brutal, say some) about weeding out underperforming students in their first term. &quot;It&apos;s not exactly a flood of students fleeing the new tuition fees in Britain, but we are seeing much more interest,&quot; says Mark Huntington, who runs astarfuture.co.uk, which has since 2006 offered a free advisory service to British students and parents considering higher education opportunities abroad. There are now more than 1,200 degree courses in Europe (not including Ireland) taught entirely in English, while in the Netherlands alone 20 universities are teaching in English. &quot;The overall cost of a three-year course in Holland, taking in tuition fees, accommodation and living costs, will be around \u00a324,000 compared with the \u00a350,000 or so it now costs in the UK,&quot; says Huntington. But, as he warns on his website, &quot;we don&apos;t believe you should go abroad just to save money and there are lots of other reasons why studying abroad is a good idea. &quot;It is also worth bearing in mind that even though a degree abroad may be significantly cheaper than an equivalent qualification in the UK, you will possibly have to pay out more up front than if you were to study at home.&quot; Not being able to speak a word of Dutch, Danish or Flemish does not seem to be a problem. &quot;You could survive the whole way through a course in Holland without learning a word of Dutch,&quot; says Huntington. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t recommend it, but it is possible.&quot; Hania Thurlow, 18, from Norwich, left for Maastricht University yesterday a day after learning she had got A*AB in her A-levels. She initially planned to go to the University of Exeter, anticipating three A grades, but was deterred by the costs. &quot;The fees really put me off,&quot; she said. &quot;I know you can take out loans and don&apos;t have to repay them straight away, but it&apos;s still a huge debt. Accommodation costs are lower too. In Maastricht I will pay \u20ac375 (\u00a3293) rent a month for a room, but Exeter wanted \u00a3125 a week (\u00a3540/month). Even travel is cheaper \u2013 I can fly home from Eindhoven for around \u00a330 on Ryanair, less than the cost of going to Manchester.&quot; She is aware of the tougher first year students face in the Netherlands compared to Britain, but is unfazed: &quot;The first year is supposed to be quite difficult. But I&apos;m going to university to study hard anyway.&quot; She has also already lined up part-time employment (arranged through the university) as a babysitter for Dutch families, and will be starting lessons in Dutch when she arrives. She says one other student from her school in Norwich is already at Maastricht, and another has applied. Christian Garrard from Canterbury, who is about to start his fourth year studying law at the University of Groningen says: &quot;It&apos;s the best decision I have ever made. I had a Dutch girlfriend and if it wasn&apos;t for her I would probably have thought, no way. It was only really daunting until I got here. As an international student you live in an international house, mostly with other foreign students who all speak English, while Groningen is almost becoming a bilingual university. I&apos;ve thrived on it, though maybe if you&apos;re more of a home-bird it&apos;s not for you.&quot; Garrard worked part-time, which also enabled him to access Dutch grants, meaning that after two years he had no debts at all: &quot;I was even saving money at one point.&quot; But it is the Republic of Ireland which is seeing the biggest surge in British students beating the tuition fee hikes. For many 18-year-olds it is far less daunting than going to a non-English speaking country and many arrive with family connections in the country. The major barrier is academic entry requirements. &quot;The grade requirements can be almost ridiculously high,&quot; warns Huntington. The Irish equivalent of A-levels is the Leaving Cert, which covers six subjects. Unless a British student has studied four A-levels and gained good grades, they may find it difficult to obtain enough points to qualify for an Irish university. Prices in Dublin, once one of Europe&apos;s most expensive cities, is another issue, though the cost of living has fallen in recent years. UCD says rent for on-campus rooms are \u20ac486 a month (\u00a3380), while living off campus nearby in Rathmines would be about \u20ac450 (\u00a3352). The universities of Cork, Limerick and Galway all charge similar tuition fees but with lower living costs. Most of the &quot;bargain&quot; tuition fees are in EU countries, but some students are heading further afield. The University of Nottingham has set up campuses in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Ningbo, China (south of Shanghai), where students graduate with a UK degree. At \u00a37,100, fees at the Kuala Lumpur campus are not far short of the cost of studying at Nottingham, and most students are from Malaysia, but a number are now coming from Britain, many having gained scholarships. Without scholarships (and no access to student grants) the financial equation is much less attractive, though living costs are a fraction of the UK. In Ningbo, student accommodation is \u00a3100 a year. Nottingham was first to pioneer campuses abroad, and others are following: Reading University is opening a Malaysian campus in 2015 while Liverpool is partnering with a university in Shanghai. Emerging universities in Asia, keen to recruit European students, are also offering highly attractive scholarship programmes to students with decent A-level grades. Ben Poulter, 18, from Brentwood County High, a state school in Essex, will be packing his bags in a few weeks&apos; time to head to Singapore, where he will begin a four-year course in business at SP Jain Global School of Management. His second year will be in Dubai, followed by two years in Sydney, Australia. And the $18,000 annual tuition fees will be sliced to zero as it&apos;s entirely paid for by the scholarship. &quot;SP Jain came to our school and gave a presentation to year 12 and year 13 [lower and upper sixth],&quot; he says. &quot;I applied and they offered me a scholarship almost immediately after the interview so long as I got AAB at A-level. I&apos;m really excited. It&apos;s a little bit daunting, but an incredible opportunity.&quot; Poulter was lucky; his school encouraged students to consider opportunities abroad. But Gerard Spencer, founder of europeducation.org.uk, which provides information on studying in Europe for students and parents, says: &quot;Unfortunately, most British schools don&apos;t talk about options outside the UK for higher education. Admissions to European universities for September 2012 are now closed. But postponing the decision for a year and starting in a European university in 2013 would be a unique and life-changing decision.&quot; Reality restricts the overseas options British students have a huge range of options for studying abroad, but the reality \u2013 if you want to keep costs low and can only speak English \u2013 is that Ireland and the Netherlands are head and shoulders above the rest. We&apos;ve highlighted a few other choices \u2013 Denmark and Norway in particular, as they do not charge tuition fees. We excluded France and Germany because they have few courses taught in English (apart from a few specialist private universities). The US and Australia, with pricey tuition fees, only come into the picture because they offer numerous scholarships. Republic of Ireland     Republic of Ireland flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee \u20ac2,250 (\u00a31,760) student contribution for 2012/2013, expected to rise to \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,955) next year. Students also pay &quot;capitation&quot; fees at institutions such as University College Dublin (\u20ac183/\u00a3143) to cover facilities such as its 50m pool. Private universities charge around \u20ac5,000 (\u00a33,900) a year. What&apos;s available Seven universities, 14 institutes of technology and a number of private universities. Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin are ranked in the world&apos;s top 200 universities. Entry requirements Tough. Based on points score in the Irish Leaving Certificate (six subjects, maximum 600 points for six As). A British A grade is worth 135 points, so students will need four good A-levels to obtain a place a leading university. Irish universities do not make conditional offers. No one receives an offer from an Irish university until they have received their grades. Grants/Scholarships No Irish state grants for UK students. Individual universities have limited scholarships/exhibitions for top students. Accommodation Not cheap. As an example, University College Dublin this year charges \u20ac486 (\u00a3380) per month. Living costs High, especially in Dublin, where the price level is similar to London or higher. Part-time earning opportunities more limited than in the past; the Irish unemployment rate is 14.8% compared with 8.1% in the UK. Netherlands     Netherlands flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee \u20ac1,771 (\u00a31,385) for most courses. Expected to rise in line with inflation. What&apos;s available Twenty universities offer degrees taught entirely in English, although at some (such as Amsterdam) there may be just one or two courses in English. Groningen and Maastricht are the most popular among British applicants. Groningen, founded in 1614 and one of the Netherlands&apos; oldest universities, currently offers nine undergraduate programmes in English but will raise that to 19 in 2013. Entry requirements A general rule is that a GCSE in three subjects with marks ranging from A*-C, plus a GCE (A-level) with three subjects at advanced level (six different subjects in total) is comparable to a Dutch VWO diploma and thus admissible for a programme in a Dutch university. Grants/Scholarships British students can access Dutch student finance on exactly the same basis as local students. So long as you find part-time work of at least 32 hours a month and pay Dutch national insurance, you qualify for a grant of \u20ac266 (\u00a3208) a month, plus you can apply for a means-tested additional grant of up to \u20ac242 (\u00a3189) a month. Students can also borrow up to \u20ac285 (\u00a3223) a month if they have been awarded the full means-tested grant. Accommodation Expensive in Amsterdam. Don&apos;t expect en-suite bathrooms. Rents outside the capital are typically \u20ac200-\u20ac400 (\u00a3150-\u00a3300) a month. Living costs Approximately the same as London and the south-east of England, but higher than the north of England. Expect to pay around \u00a33.70 for a pint in city centre Dutch bars. Denmark     Denmark flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Denmark does not charge tuition fees to anyone with an EU passport. So nothing to pay over three years. What&apos;s available There are 27 universities and higher education colleges in Denmark, but only a few offer courses taught in English. About the best option is the University of Southern Denmark, based in Odense, about an hour-and-a-half south of Copenhagen. Entry requirements If you have A-levels you should be eligible for entry to a Danish university. Details at StudyinDenmark.dk Grants/Scholarships Limited. No state grants or loans for UK students. Accommodation USD says expect to pay around \u00a3235 a month for rent, but much more in Copenhagen. Living costs Very high. Denmark is not in the euro and its krone has risen in value in recent years. But students with EU nationality are able to work, and pay rates are relatively high. Norway     Norway flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Norway&apos;s state universities do not charge students from any country. What&apos;s available There are seven universities and eight specialist universities, but few offer courses taught in English. But the University of Nordland, inside the Arctic Circle, welcomed 200 international students last year and has courses taught in English in subjects such as marine ecology. Entry requirements The minimum requirement is five GCE passes, of which two must be A-levels. Grants/Scholarships Limited. Accommodation Student rent at the University of Nordland is \u00a3375 a month Living costs Some of the highest in the world, with the Norwegian krone one of the world&apos;s strongest currencies. A bottle of beer in a pub can cost anything up to \u00a37, while a loaf of bread is around \u00a32.70. United States     US flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Vary enormously. Most universities quote all-in tuition, lodging and food prices at around $20,000 - $45,000 a year (\u00a312,700-\u00a328,600), so they&apos;re not cheap. What&apos;s available Immense. There are around 4,000 universities in the US. Entry requirements Visas are required, and you must depart after completing the course. International students must have a certificate of completion which allows admission to a university in their home country. Grants/Scholarships Extensive scholarship programmes in academic subjects and sports. The scholarship will typically be worth around 50% of the cost of studying in the US. InTuitionScholarships (student-scholarships.com) says it helps around 50-60 Brits a year obtain academic scholarships to the US. Accommodation With a scholarship, you should be paying around \u00a36,500-\u00a39,000 a year for the total package of accommodation, tuition and food. Living costs Vary enormously. Accommodation outside the centre of major cities is cheap, but food is about the same price as the UK. Australia      Australia flag Photograph: Graphic    Tuition fee Fees are usually in the range of AU$15,000-20,000 (\u00a310,000 - \u00a313,000) for undergraduate degrees, so higher than the UK.

Yeah, I think we&apos;re pretty close to it. We&apos;d got demand beforehand, but what has actually really helped is that people have seen the Olympics, the atmosphere in the stadium, and everyone has suddenly caught the bug. How excited are you on a scale of 1 to 10? Easily over 10 because, for the past seven years, I&apos;ve been involved in the whole build-up\u2026 I went to Singapore for the bid in 2005. It&apos;s constantly on my mind because I&apos;m working on the coverage, so I go to bed quoting different classifications for different athletes. The amount of information I know about them, they&apos;ll probably think I&apos;m stalking them. Apparently you were a mattress-tester for the beds in the athletes&apos; village\u2026 I was part of an athletes&apos; advisory group that Locog set up and for some reason I was allocated the bed testing. It&apos;s important because you&apos;ve got to cater for all sizes \u2013 from a 5ft gymnast to a 7ft 7in basketball player. And, for some paralympians, it&apos;s got to be at the right height to get in and out of your wheelchair. Do you tend to favour a hard or soft mattress? Normally, you&apos;d think soft, but I think a hard mattress is more suitable for your back. The beds will see a lot of action, in lots of ways [laughs]. You retired from international-level wheelchair basketball in 2005 after winning a Paralympics bronze medal and taking gold at the Paralympic World Cup. Do you miss competing? When I&apos;m commentating, I don&apos;t miss it, but I would have loved to compete at the London Paralympic Games \u2013 those big events are what you live for. You miss the atmosphere, yeah. I was at the opening ceremony of the Olympics and, when Team GB came out, that was just tremendous. It would be great to be out in that \u2013 as an athlete, it&apos;s the greatest moment of your life. How did you get into basketball? By sheer luck, when I was about 13, 14. I used to walk on callipers. I was at a mainstream school and I didn&apos;t have any knowledge of disabled sports, but I was into sports: I played goal in football at school, and I had great hand-eye co-ordination. I was spotted by two physios from a disabled school nearby that was affiliated to a sports centre. They spotted me as I was racing through the streets, being pushed by my mates in a Tesco shopping trolley because, back in those days, I couldn&apos;t keep up with my mates and it was quite territorial in east London, so if we were in trouble, we&apos;d just be able to leg it. Do you think disabled people should be educated in mainstream rather than specialist schools? My experience of a mainstream school had positives and negatives. It was mainly positive, but I think everybody&apos;s different. I was very lucky because my mobility needs were quite minimal. I could get about at school. But it was tough. I had a one-mile walk to my secondary school and there were loads and loads of stairs \u2013 that was difficult. For me, it worked, but I wouldn&apos;t say it would work for every child. You were selected for the Great British wheelchair basketball team at the age of 18. You&apos;re now 35. Have our perceptions of disability changed in that time? It&apos;s a difficult question. For me, yes, we have changed, but I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve changed enough. I also think there are a lot of unanswered questions. People might see someone with a disability, and they will have things in their mind, and they won&apos;t ask them out of politeness. Because I&apos;m in the public eye, I think I get treated differently. Are people more aware of paralympic sports? Yes. In the 80s, I had a disability and I didn&apos;t know you could compete with other disabled people. For most people in the UK, the word &quot;paralympic&quot; wasn&apos;t even in their lexicon 15, 20 years ago. How has wheelchair technology for athletes changed over that time? The first chair I was given was a folding wheelchair, and basketball is a full contact sport. I got hit on the side, and my chair folded in half in the middle of the court, and everyone was cracking up laughing. I think people realised in the 80s that folding chairs weren&apos;t going to work. It went to fixed frame, then to aluminium and steel and now they&apos;re titanium. They share a lot of the technology with bike technology, so it&apos;s similar to the guys you see in the velodrome You contracted polio as a baby in Lagos, Nigeria, and lost the use of much of your legs. Did you ever go through a phase of being angry about that? Not so much angry about the polio but more about other people&apos;s perceptions of me. In my younger, teenage years, I was very body-conscious. I was a little bit ashamed and upset that I didn&apos;t walk the way that other friends did. It was only when I saw myself in the mirror that it was obvious; I used to avoid walking past any windows or anything reflective as I was going through puberty. But I grew out of that, especially because of sport. As soon as I started hanging out with other disabled people, I suddenly thought able-bodied kids were boring. Being disabled seemed a lot cooler because every weekend, I&apos;d be playing in basketball tournaments, travelling all around the country. I think I&apos;ve done more things with my disability than most able-bodied people would dream of doing. I remember one time being stopped by some people who said: &quot;Have you ever thought of prayer? The power of prayer will mean you&apos;ll be healed.&quot; And I remember saying: &quot;That would assume walking is all it&apos;s cracked up to be.&quot; I think they were shocked. Who are the Paralympic medal hopes from Team GB? So many! In athletics, Jonnie Peacock. He&apos;s a single-leg amputee who broke Oscar Pistorius&apos;s world record for the 100m this year. He&apos;s 19 years old, from Cambridgeshire, and he only took up the sport in 2009. Within three years, he&apos;s one of the fastest sprinters in the world. What do you think about the government cuts to the disability living allowance? It&apos;s a difficult situation with the deficit, deciding what to spend money on. I think you&apos;ve got to look at things from a human perspective. I think the Olympic and Paralympic Games will do exactly what we, as athletes, want them to do because they&apos;ll bring sport back into the consciousness of the British public. Sport had really lost its status, especially school sport, and the government didn&apos;t want to spend a great deal of money on it. I think, with grassroots sports, it&apos;s a win-win situation. Sport&apos;s given me goals, it&apos;s given me discipline, and it&apos;s meant I&apos;ve managed to achieve stuff outside sport because of the life-skills I&apos;ve learnt through sport. That&apos;s what the government has got to realise. Sport helps you to become more confident about who you are, and it teaches you to surprise yourself. I read somewhere that you want to ban the YMCA dance? It just doesn&apos;t look cool, people. But Mo Farah got his signature Mobot move from it\u2026 Yeah, but he&apos;s being specific. He&apos;s not doing the whole dance. If he&apos;d suddenly broken out into the YMCA dance then, as cool as Mo Farah is, it would have changed the way we thought about him.

We Are Social is a conversation agency \u2013 we help brands to listen, understand and engage in conversations in social media. We created We Are Social in response to the impact of social media on the media consumption landscape, and the need for a new kind of agency to help brands succeed in this environment. We moved from the &apos;big idea&apos; to the &apos;social idea&apos;. In four years, the company has grown from myself and my co-founder Nathan McDonald and a single launch client to a multinational business with eight offices worldwide and 220 staff. We&apos;ve achieved this growth purely though client revenues and without external funding. I run the company as global MD in partnership with Nathan. We split things fairly equally between us, with both of us spending time on different clients and management issues, although Nathan is more focussed on the financial side while I&apos;m driving more of our marketing and PR efforts. Our roles have evolved hugely since starting the business \u2013 after all, when you go from two employees to 220, the challenges we deal with now are hugely different to those when we started out. What did you do before We Are Social? I&apos;ve been lucky enough to have been in &apos;digital&apos; ever since I graduated from the University of Bristol in 1996, and it has been quite a rollercoaster ride, to say the least. I started with building websites for the likes of Microsoft and the Royal Mail in a shed in Cirencester, and that was followed by a stint in New York trying to rescue the ailing boo.com \u2013 I then landed a job as &apos;entrepreneur in residence&apos; at an &apos;incubator&apos; that provided funding, office space and consultancy to internet start-ups just before the dot.com crash. After that was the downhill ride of two redundancies and around a year of not being able to find a job before going back into the digital agency world. I then rebuilt my career over six years in progressively more senior agency roles before taking the leap to launch We Are Social with Nathan in 2008. Looking back over the last four years, yes, we had big plans and we worked extremely hard to achieve them, but things have gone better than we could have ever reasonably hoped for. To some extent, we have been very lucky, but they&apos;re right when they say you make your own luck. What does an average day look like for you?  There&apos;s no such thing! I could be flying out to Singapore to help with recruitment or over to New York for a pitch. Often I&apos;ll be working with senior management in London on growth and key hires. Today I happen to be in Munich to help the team here celebrate their new office space. Every day is different. What are the biggest challenges to your job and how do you overcome them? For me personally, the biggest issue is managing my own time \u2013 there&apos;s never enough of it, and it&apos;s impossible to fit everything in. When it comes to the business, which has grown rapidly in four years, the challenge is finding and hiring the best people at all levels. We&apos;ve also tried really hard to build and maintain the right company culture while growing quickly. When we started We Are Social, we wanted to make it the kind of place we would have wanted to work when we were younger, and I think our extremely high staff retention rate is an indicator that we&apos;ve succeeded in this. Of course, part of our culture is to always strive for excellence in our client work and because of this we&apos;ve managed to pick up and retain some of the world&apos;s biggest brands as clients on our four year journey. What first made you want to work in social media and digital marketing? Digital and social media was a new frontier \u2013 it wasn&apos;t an established playing field and held unlimited possibilities. For the past 16 years of my career, every day has been different; we&apos;re constantly learning and trying new things, and making a genuine difference to society and commerce. What&apos;s do you think is the key to being a good managing director, especially on a global scale? Probably learning when to let go and trust others, and hiring good people you can trust. Also the team need to feel as though the agency has leadership and vision, instead of feeling like they&apos;re just being managed. They also need to feel confident that we&apos;ll achieve that vision \u2013 both things I believe to be really important differentiators. What would you say your management style is? I&apos;m not sure I have a style \u2013 I&apos;ve been learning as I go along! I think my main priorities are making sure that everyone has respect and trust in their colleagues and that we build the right kind of company culture. However, making sure people take responsibility for their own actions (or lack of them) is also very important. What online resource can you not do your job without? Google Reader \u2013 I need to keep a close eye on industry news and trends, and I subscribe to a lot of blogs. What in social media is exciting you the most at the moment? The change in attitude from the media towards Facebook since its IPO is certainly making things &apos;interesting&apos;. But it&apos;s the rise of new platforms, such as Pinterest and Tumblr, that&apos;s really changing the landscape. They&apos;ll never replace Facebook but they are gathering large and very engaged audiences and this has real implications for our clients and the work we do for them. Where do you see social media and digital marketing in the next 5 years? I don&apos;t think things will have changed as much as people might expect. Budgets will certainly be much bigger, but brands will still be grappling with the same problems and will still need agencies like us to help solve them. What top tips would you give to a social media / digital marketing professional looking to get to where you are? Being in the right place at the right time really helps. Spend a lot of time thinking about when and where this place and time are, and make sure you&apos;re there at the time. But even when you are, you still need a bold plan for success, to believe in yourself and to be prepared to work your arse off \u2013 and to project this onto others. Any last words? Bring people solutions, not problems, and if you stop learning, move on.

Yet, like the famous and infamous women to whom she has been compared \u2013 from Jackie Kennedy to Lady Macbeth \u2013 her life has been shaped as much by her husband and high politics as by her will and talent. Bo Xilai, the ousted Chongqing party secretary, was a charismatic but divisive leader who shared her ambition and taste for publicity and her revolutionary heritage. Gu&apos;s mother, Fan Chengxiu, is descended from a famous Song dynasty minister, but joined the party at 14 and later led a band of Communist guerrillas. Gu&apos;s father, Gu Jingsheng, was a general who took charge of missile research but was ousted in the 1950s anti-rightist movement because Fan was judged politically unreliable. Though urged to divorce by comrades, he stood by her. &quot;It affected his political career for several decades. He never regretted it or complained,&quot; Fan later wrote. &quot;He was a man out of the ordinary.&quot; In 1966, when Gu was just seven, the lives of the five daughters took another turn for the worse as the Cultural Revolution broke out. Their father was jailed for 12 years; not long afterwards their mother, too, was detained. Gu Jingsheng had already foreseen what was likely to happen, warning his children that their parents might have to go away. &quot;Don&apos;t think too much just because I and your mother suffer criticism every day and they come to home to search frequently,&quot; he urged them in a letter. &quot;Don&apos;t be threatened by the door-knocking and confiscations during the night, and don&apos;t be misled by the neighbourhood children [if they accuse us].&quot; While her elder sisters did their best to protect Gu, the family struggled to survive. She worked as a labourer, in a textile factory and as a butcher&apos;s assistant. Even then, she did everything well, it seemed; years later, she could still cut meat cleanly with a single cleaver stroke. The end of the turmoil and her parents&apos; rehabilitation cleared the way for Gu to go to the prestigious Peking University, where she studied law and international relations. She met Bo on a university research trip, she told a magazine. He was party secretary of the area she visited and &quot;very much like my father, that sort of extremely idealistic person&quot;. The background to their meeting was more complicated than that wide-eyed account suggested. Their fathers had long known each other, first meeting in the 1930s; her sister&apos;s husband was the brother of Bo&apos;s first wife. That marriage ended acrimoniously in the early 80s and Gu married Bo in 1986. He treated his young bride &quot;like a queen&quot;, said a friend, and their son Guagua was born the following year. Soon after, Gu set up her own law firm, Kailai, and took the professional name Horus L Kai. Though it evoked the falcon deity, it was taken, more prosaically, from the title of Egyptair&apos;s inflight magazine, glimpsed on a business trip. For a while, the couple&apos;s careers appeared to be on the fast track. Bo became mayor of the north-eastern city of Dalian, and earned a reputation as a popular leader with an eye for attention-grabbing initiatives. Gu proved equally canny, writing a book about her battle to overturn a US court judgment against Dalian-based firms. It lauded the support she had received from &quot;the big man in the family&quot;. She said she took on the case at the request of Dalian officials and there were other signs of crossover with her husband&apos;s work. In 1996, she represented the Port of Singapore in a $1.5bn joint venture deal with the Port of Dalian. Her family was prospering too, with her elder sisters establishing a web of businesses that Bloomberg reported this year was worth $126m (\u00a380m). As Bo climbed the political ladder, friends wondered if his wife&apos;s business activities could become a hindrance. Her law firm, now based in Beijing, changed its name to Angdao. Even so, Gu remained registered with the firm and acquaintances believe her involvement continued for some time. Angdao has refused to comment. In his final public appearance this year, Bo said he was &quot;touched&quot; by his wife&apos;s sacrifice in becoming a housewife for his sake. Others thought Gu learned to revel in her status as Bo&apos;s wife. &quot;She enjoyed people asking for favours and being treated like a star,&quot; says one of those who knew her. But the couple were leading increasingly separate lives. One friend said Gu was distraught when Bo became conspicuously enchanted by another woman in the early 1990s, confiding that she had contemplated divorce and suicide. As time went on, she spent increasingly lengthy periods with her parents in Beijing or overseas. Ever since the announcement of her detention on suspicion of murdering Neil Heywood, officials have referred to her as &quot;Bogu Kailai&quot;, in what some have seen as a hint she had obtained foreign residency or even a foreign passport. While mainland women rarely combine their names with their husbands, it is common in Singapore. An official said Gu had obtained Singaporean nationality or residency. Chinese law does not allow dual nationality. For much of the time she appears to have been in the UK, where Guagua was studying. At one stage she lived in Bournemouth, where she and Patrick Devillers, a French architect who was also part of her inner circle, gave the same address when they registered as directors of a company. Many of the people who encountered her there recall her as kind, polite and friendly. Giles Hall, a businessman who dealt with her, was struck by her charm when she approached him with an unusual request to export a hot air balloon to Dalian. But Hall saw another side to her when he angered her by refusing to bulk up the invoice so she could bring another \u00a3200,000 into the country to pay her son&apos;s school fees. When the firm did not meet what he called an overly ambitious deadline for delivery, she warned him that if he came to China &quot;we can get you thrown in jail. You&apos;ll never see the light of day,&quot; he told Associated Press. Heywood told friends Gu worried about betrayal, believed people were out to get her and was &quot;mentally unstable&quot;. One account of her trial said the court heard she had bipolar disorder and moderate schizophrenia, while Xinhua said she had been treated for &quot;insomnia, anxiety and depression, and paranoia&quot; in the past. Certainly, she told friends she was considering treatment for depression. She seems to have led an increasingly solitary life and Bo Guagua described her as living &quot;like a hermit&quot; in an interview in 2009. He suggested she turned down social invitations because she did not want to be in his father&apos;s shadow. Three years on, Gu has overshadowed Bo and determined his political fate; not through her achievements, but her crime."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/aug/20/curo-group", "sentences": ["Executive Director Finance and StrategySimon Gibbs     Dominic Lynch    Simon began his career as a Chartered Accountant with Deloitte, before moving into banking at Rothschild where he spent five years dealing with acquisitions, flotations and rights issues both in the UK and in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-20T15:41:00Z", "title": "Curo Group", "tags": [], "article": "Established2001 RegionsSouth-west England Stock12,500 Turnover\u00a363m Number of staff450 Key areas of workSocial and market-rent/sale housing; support services and supported housing for young, vulnerable and older people Chief executiveVictor da Cunha     Victor da Cunha    Victor da Cunha joined Curo as chief executive in April 2011.

The victory parades have barely begun, and already the midsummer dream is rudely shattered. No more talk of herculean efforts to win gold, no more hammering of iron rings of fire, no more warm fuzzy feelings towards our national broadcaster. No, it&apos;s back to being depicted as a nation of slack-jawed lummoxes incapable of a decent day&apos;s work, and to Iain Duncan Smith accusing the BBC&apos;s economics editor Stephanie Flanders of\u00a0&quot;peeing all over British industry&quot;, after she failed to greet falling unemployment figures with unquestioning wonderment. So much for the legacy. In fairness to the five Tory MPs who first pricked the bubble, via leaked excerpts from their forthcoming book arguing that we&apos;re not the nation of champions we had giddily begun imagining but &quot;among the worst idlers of the world&quot;, this wasn&apos;t quite the plan. Perhaps provocative references in Britannia Unchained to people preferring &quot;a lie in to hard work&quot; will look less inflammatory in context, or at least in season (the book&apos;s due out in September, traditional month of noses back to grindstones and party conference tub-thumping). But still, the politics of idleness deserves unpicking. Here&apos;s a test: does the word &quot;idle&quot;, when used by politicians, instinctively set alarm bells ringing? If so, you&apos;re probably left of centre, because it&apos;s an indisputably Tory buzzword \u2013 reeking of Norman Tebbit&apos;s father getting on his bike and rightwing tabloids haranguing welfare &quot;scroungers&quot;, stirring in leftwing breasts the old fear of attack on the vulnerable. But if it&apos;s that word &quot;vulnerable&quot; which gets your hackles up then you&apos;re probably right of centre, because vulnerability is a Labour buzzword \u2013 reeking for you of excuses to do nothing, of lily-livered bleating about why the welfare state couldn&apos;t possibly be reformed which ultimately traps those it purports to protect. You probably cheered when Eric Pickles ditched the term &quot;vulnerable families&quot; (Whitehall speak for impoverished families with multiple social problems) for &quot;problem families&quot;, saying it was time to stop making excuses. For the right, the word &quot;vulnerable&quot; smacks of victimhood, of ducking blame and not holding individuals accountable for their actions. Because that&apos;s really the difference between &quot;vulnerable&quot; and &quot;idle&quot;. The first suggests that being broke or desperate is at least partly to do with external circumstances, which may need help to overcome; the second suggests it&apos;s your own dumb fault. &quot;Vulnerable&quot; resonates for those who believe in the transformative power of the state; &quot;idle&quot; for those who believe in the power of individuals. And what&apos;s giving the politics of idleness a new lease of life is the marriage of an ancient Tory belief \u2013 that anyone can haul themselves up by their bootstraps, that failure means you&apos;re not trying hard enough \u2013 with a newly fashionable argument about the decline of the decadent west and rise of the industrious east. The young Tory turks are busy weaving a narrative not just of individual moral failing (too many workshy scroungers) but of national degeneration: a sense that we&apos;ve been spoiled by\u00a0years of easy money and need a collective kick up the backside. It&apos;s intimately connected to austerity politics, with its inference that only rich countries can afford to go this soft. The idea that developed nations have grown fat and lazy with prosperity, and that only the children of hungry tiger economies still understand the value of hard graft, is quietly embedding itself in political culture. Think Michael Gove raiding Singapore&apos;s education system for ideas on toughening up exams; or even the Indian steel magnate Ratan Tata, complaining last year that his company&apos;s western workers were overfond of their leisure and blaming &quot;a certain comfort level that comes from a country that has had good times&quot;. (Tata is shortly to retire but says at 75 his life&apos;s work won&apos;t be done, a sentiment of which the Britannia Unchained quintet would doubtless approve.) It&apos;s not clear yet exactly who these pampered slackers supposedly dragging Britain down are, beyond familiar vague complaints of a bloated public sector and kids &quot;more interested in pop music and football&quot; than in becoming lawyers. Perhaps inevitably, they exist now more in the realm of anecdote \u2013 the intern who thinks she&apos;s above making the coffee, young men scorning the menial jobs subsequently snapped up by immigrants \u2013 than hard fact. And while Britain does, as the book&apos;s authors say, have unusually short average working hours, that&apos;s mainly because we have an unusually high percentage of part-timers, many of whom want fulltime work but can&apos;t find it. (Those working fulltime still do some of the longest hours in Europe.) Perhaps all those frantically juggling part-time mothers of small children \u2013 the ones who a generation ago wouldn&apos;t have worked at all \u2013 are to be deemed lazy? But there&apos;s a bigger problem with the politics of idleness than quibbling over definitions. Hauling ourselves out of recession might indeed be as easy as demanding everyone pull their socks up, if declining GDP really was just a fancy name for indolence. But the many dull technical reasons why value of output per worker might fall \u2013 from the shrinking of highly productive sectors like the City to the rise of self-employed freelances commanding a lower hourly rate than they did as staffers \u2013 aren&apos;t solved by simply clocking up more hours. Our challenges are not those of tiger economies, suggesting their recipe of working harder for longer for less won&apos;t necessarily work miracles here. Yet for exploring this complicated new reality in her Newsnight report, Flanders was accused by the work and pensions secretary of &quot;carping and moaning&quot;, running down an &quot;incredibly robust&quot; private sector. It&apos;s apparently fine to call individuals lazy, but not to suggest any flaw in modern labour markets. And perhaps that&apos;s partly because doing the latter suggests we may be vulnerable (that word again) to global economic trends beyond our immediate control \u2013 trends not so easily reversed by the classic Tory formula now being touted for unleashing our inner tiger, namely slashing employment regulations and cutting benefits. Idle, or vulnerable? The story we believe\u00a0about\u00a0ourselves has wider implications than we think."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/20/mayfair-art-galleries-under-threat", "sentences": ["The 7,700 sq metre (83,000 sq ft) site at 29-30 Burlington Street, which includes a stretch of Cork Street, will be bought by an international partnership made up of developer Native Land \u2013 45% owned by a Gulf investment firm \u2013 Singapore company Hotel Properties Limited (HPL) and Malaysian investment firm Amcorp."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-20T17:21:04Z", "title": "Mayfair's art galleries under threat from developers", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "London", "UK news", "Real estate", "Business"], "article": "As one of the country&apos;s most important art hubs for nearly 90 years, the exhibition spaces of Cork Street have launched the British careers of many major modern artists \u2013 with the Mayor Gallery alone giving Paul Klee, Francis Bacon, Max Ernst and Joan Mir\u00f3 their first London shows. But now seven of the 22 galleries, including the Mayor, will have to leave the Mayfair location as early as next year in what owners fear could be &quot;the death of the whole street&quot;. Their landlord, the British insurance firm Standard Life Investments, has agreed to a \u00a390m deal to redevelop their building as a luxury apartment block. The 7,700 sq metre (83,000 sq ft) site at 29-30 Burlington Street, which includes a stretch of Cork Street, will be bought by an international partnership made up of developer Native Land \u2013 45% owned by a Gulf investment firm \u2013 Singapore company Hotel Properties Limited (HPL) and Malaysian investment firm Amcorp. The deal, which is expected to be completed on 30 November, will mean that the Mayor, Alpha Gallery, Adam Gallery, Stoppenbach &amp; Delestre, Waterhouse &amp; Dodd, Beaux Arts and Gallery 27 will lose their leases and must move out. Several of the galleries said they understood the existing building will then be demolished. James Mayor, whose father opened the street&apos;s oldest gallery in 1925 that bears his name, said: &quot;It will be hell. It could be the death of the whole street. It&apos;s very sad.&quot; He fears he will be unable to find another space in the area. &quot;It&apos;s a nightmare trying to find suitable premises in Mayfair, the fashion trade has taken over everything,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s all about short-term gain. Who will these flats be for? They won&apos;t be for residents or nationals. Haven&apos;t we got enough hideous apartment buildings being built? We&apos;re losing all individuality as a city.&quot; The redevelopment plans include a restaurant and an unspecified number of new galleries, but they will not open until the project is completed in 2016. Jamie Anderson, manager of Waterhouse &amp; Dodd gallery, said Cork Street would lose some of the most &quot;significant players in the British art gallery world&quot;. He said: &quot;Losing a gallery of the stature of the Mayor Gallery will be a major loss to Cork Street. If they leave Mayfair, it will be a major loss to the area.&quot; Announcing the deal earlier this month, Alasdair Nicholls, chief executive of Native Land, noted Mayfair&apos;s reputation as &quot;the cultural and lifestyle epicentre of London&quot; and the site&apos;s proximity to the &quot;fine art galleries of Cork Street and bespoke tailoring of Savile Row&quot;. A spokesman added: &quot;We recognise and respect the significance of the Old Burlington Street and Cork Street neighbourhood to the international art marketplace. We have no intention of undermining it. We envisage gallery space being provided in any new redevelopment proposals.&quot; But with Malaysian billionaire Ong Beng Seng \u2013 the managing director of HPL and a major shareholder of luxury handbag maker Mulberry \u2013 involved in the deal, gallerists fear an incursion of upmarket retailers will price them out of the street. Louis Singh, director of the Beaux Arts gallery, said: &quot;They&apos;ve had to put in a provision of galleries but I understand that encompasses boutiques, jewellers, etc. There&apos;s no doubt they can get a lot more money if they let in fashion. But we can&apos;t afford to compete with Prada. &quot;It does my head in that money is the only consideration. The street is known all over the world. Related businesses, like framers, are also going to suffer. It&apos;s the only place you can see a variety of art in such a short distance. It seems madness to me. It&apos;s one of the attractions of London.&quot; Singh predicted that the building work would also disrupt the business of galleries not in the affected building. &quot;They&apos;re going to pull it down completely. Imagine the dust, the scaffolding, the noise. I&apos;d be livid if I was a gallery across the street.&quot; Christopher Battiscombe, director general of the Society of London Art Dealers, said: &quot;It would be disastrous if galleries were forced to leave. &quot;Cork Street has been a headquarters for the art trade. Some of the galleries have been there many, many years. It&apos;s a very sad day to see this coming to an end.&quot; The society has contacted Westminster council to propose the creation of a protected area for art galleries in Mayfair, although as such a scheme would require up to two years of public consultation it seems unlikely to prevent the Cork Street redevelopment. A council spokesman said it had not received any planning application with regard to Cork Street, adding: &quot;As a general principle, we can protect the fact that retail units exist in buildings but not dictate the occupier or type of retailer.&quot; Some galleries remain hopeful that recent moves by the nearby Royal Academy will make the developers think twice about threatening the street&apos;s art heritage. In June, the Royal Academy unveiled plans for a major renovation of Keeper&apos;s House, part of the eastern wing of its historic Burlington House building. It is also leasing out an 835 sq metre (9,000 sq ft) gallery in the west wing of 6 Burlington Gardens, which will open just before the Frieze art fair in October. Johnny Messum, director of Messum&apos;s gallery, opposite the affected building on Cork St, said: &quot;With all the effort going on in the street you&apos;d be crazy not to put in spaces for new galleries. A landlord who wasn&apos;t engaged with the art world would be crazy.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/21/hank-williams-jr-obama", "sentences": ["&quot;My president is trying to pass a gun ban, so he&apos;s staging all of these murders,&quot; Mustaine said at a concert in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-21T10:51:11Z", "title": "Hank Williams Jr: Obama is a 'Muslim president who hates the US'", "tags": ["Music", "Country", "Megadeth", "Metal", "Pop and rock", "Culture", "Barack Obama", "US gun control", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Hank Williams Jr has become the second musician in as many weeks to accuse Barack Obama of plotting to destroy the United States.

If\u00a0the dog causes injury, the maximum term is to be two years. I have no sympathy for such people. Keeping these beasts is weird, and those who do it probably need treatment. But the Defra minister, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, complained in May that fewer than 20 people were in jail for dangerous dog offences. The sentencing council has duly told courts to raise the threshold to two years, &quot;to send a message&quot;. The same sentiment a year ago motivated magistrates to play to the gallery by jailing 1,292 people for stealing bottles of water or trainers or sending idiot incitements during the dispersed rampage dubbed &quot;urban riots&quot;. Hysterical ministers raced home from holiday to tell judges to send messages. Judges duly ruined the lives of hundreds of young people, at great public expense and to no advantage to their victims. I have no sympathy for these people either, but again the politicised response to crime was disproportionate. A month before, a London court jailed a stoned Charlie Gilmour after he swung on a union flag from the Cenotaph and tossed a bin at a police car, thus causing widespread outrage in the offices of the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail. The judge sent him down for 18 months to send a message carefully designed to wreck his university career. Yet again we need have no sympathy for Gilmour. But there is no such thing as a rap over the knuckles in jail. Judges know that any term in prison is a sentence for life. How can British politicians, whose statements clearly seek to influence pliable judges, criticise other sovereign states for doing likewise? Last week the Foreign Office professed itself &quot;deeply concerned&quot; at the fate of Russia&apos;s Pussy Riot three, jailed for two years for &quot;hooliganism&quot; in Moscow&apos;s Christ the Saviour Cathedral. They had staged what, by all accounts, was an obscene publicity stunt, videoing an anti-Putin song defamatory of the Virgin Mary in front of pious worshippers. Good for free speech, we might all say. That the act outraged public decency is an understatement. In a Levada poll of Russian public opinion, just 5% thought the girls should go unpunished and 65% wanted them in prison, 29% with hard labour. Artists round the globe may plead free speech, but to treat the Pussy Riot gesture as a glorious stand for artistic liberty is like praising Johnny Rotten, who did similar things, as the Voltaire of our day. There can be disproportionate apologias as well as disproportionate sentences. Artists can look after their own. For the British and US governments to get on high horses about Russian sentencing is hypocrisy. America and Britain damned the &quot;disproportionate&quot; Pussy Riot terms. In America&apos;s case this was from a nation that jails drug offenders for 20, 30 or 40 years, holds terrorism &quot;suspects&quot; incommunicado indefinitely and imprisons for life even trivial &quot;three strikes&quot; offenders. Last week alone a US military court declared that reporting the Guant\u00e1namo Bay trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would be censored. Any mention of his torture in prison was banned as &quot;reasonably expected to damage national security&quot;. This has no apparent connection to proportionate punishment or freedom of speech. The British security establishment during the Tony Blair-Gordon Brown regime tried to censor history books for possible &quot;terrorist&quot; incitement. It introduced control orders, restricted courts and long-period detention without trial. It made unlicensed demonstrating an offence and has since sought prosecution of Twitter and Facebook abuse. British ministers and courts are craven to what passes for public opinion. The idea that, whenever a crime or antisocial action hits the headlines, &quot;the courts must send a message&quot; is politicised justice. At times, especially in tragic cases involving children, it gets near to a lynch mob. Again the only message sent is to the media. If Britain&apos;s draconian sentencing were effective, British jails would not be bursting at the seams. There is of course a difference between the liberties enjoyed in most western democracies and the cruder jurisprudence of modern Russia, China and much of the Muslim world. It would be silly to pretend otherwise. But the difference is not so great as to merit the barrage of megaphone comment from west to east. Pussy Riot may have attacked no one physically, but no society, certainly not Britain, legislates on the basis that &quot;words can never hurt&quot;. If a rock group invaded Westminster Abbey and gravely insulted a religious or ethnic minority before the high altar, we all know that ministers would howl for &quot;exemplary punishment&quot; and judges would oblige. Commenting on the social mores of other countries may offer an offshore outlet for the righteous indignation of politicians and editorialists. It has no noticeable effect. Western comments on the treatment of women in Muslim states, dissidents in China or drug offenders in south-east Asia are dismissed as imperial interference. But then how would we feel if Moscow or Singapore or Tehran condemned the treatment of Cenotaph protesters? British courts jail at the drop of a headline. One of the few cabinet ministers in recent years to show a sincere desire to relate punishment to crime and imprisonment to consequence is the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke. He is now being bad-mouthed out of his job by Downing Street&apos;s dark arts, frightened not of Clarke but of the rightwing press. Clarke is, with Iain Duncan Smith, a rare minister intellectually engaged with his job and eager courageously to see it through. Why are the Lib Dems not defending him? For David Cameron to sack Clarke would indeed send a message.

The future of GCSEs is in doubt, as we wait to see how the government moves forward with exam reform and who prevails in the coalition struggle over education policy. We know that the education secretary, Michael Gove, is impressed by Singapore&apos;s education system, and there is indeed much to admire. In Singapore, 15-year-olds are 10 months ahead of those in the UK in English. They are 20 months ahead in maths. South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Shanghai match Singapore&apos;s performance. So we most definitely have something to learn from Pacific Asia. The question is what? Eastern cultures have valued education for centuries: the belief is that\u00a0diligence will be rewarded. The &quot;talent myth&quot; that is ubiquitous in Atlantic societies \u2013 that either you&apos;re smart or you&apos;re not \u2013 is roundly rejected. Parents \u2013 such as &quot;tiger mothers&quot; \u2013 prize and prioritise education. Eastern governments do likewise. South Korea pays teachers well, and recruits the best graduates into teaching. It pays for that by having much larger classes; whereas across the Pacific California chose a class size cap, which in effect limited teachers&apos; pay. The former strategy worked; the latter didn&apos;t. When President Obama asked South Korea&apos;s President Lee about his biggest problem in education, he was told it was parental expectation. Nice problem to have. But at the very moment when Gove is looking east, the east is looking west. Leaders in Pacific Asia are realising that what worked in the last 50 years is not what will be required in the next 50. They have come to the conclusion that their economies need to become more innovative and their schools more creative. It is one thing for an education system to produce well-educated deferential citizens; another to produce a generation of innovators. They see that mastery of the basics, while essential, is not enough. When I talk about the future of the curriculum, including not just knowledge but also ability to lead by influencing those around you, I find a ready audience among leaders of Pacific Asian systems. People understand too that while exams are important, the obsession with them among parents can be dangerous. As the Chinese say, public exams are the batons that conduct the entire orchestra. If students are to develop well across the full range of this emerging curriculum, innovation in tests and exams will be essential. Hong Kong&apos;s new exam system began this year, after a decade of careful consultation with parents. The National Institute of Education in Singapore is a hub of innovation in assessment, while the OECD as a whole is looking to assess collaborative problem-solving from 2015 onwards. The best computer games may be a good pointer to the assessment revolution ahead. The educational challenge for Pacific Asia is to encourage greater diversity and individuality by building on its undoubted high standards in the basics. For Gove it is to match Pacific Asia&apos;s standards in the basics \u2013 which really are basic \u2013 while also developing the capacity to innovate that is evident in the US. As Arne Duncan, the US education secretary, told me: &quot;The US is still ahead in experimentation \u2026 we have many islands of excellence.&quot; However, the US struggles to apply to the system the lessons from those islands. In future, education systems will need to combine a high-quality, reliable system with the capacity to innovate at scale. Pacific Asian countries know this only too well and are beginning to move in the right direction. We don&apos;t yet know what Gove plans for the exam system. As he makes up his mind, it will be important for him to learn not just from where Singapore is, but also where it is heading."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/michael-gove-skills-exam-blair", "sentences": ["Gove has spoken of his admiration for Singapore, where children are streamed into separate bands based on ability."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-22T20:20:10Z", "title": "Michael Gove must pay notice to skills, says former Blair education adviser", "tags": ["Michael Gove", "Education policy", "Exams", "Education", "Politics", "Conservatives", "Liberal Democrats", "Labour", "Schools", "Vocational education", "Further education", "UK news"], "article": "A guiding figure behind Tony Blair&apos;s education reforms has warned Michael Gove against becoming too obsessed with exams and ignoring skills in favour of teaching children facts.

For Michael Gove, it is to match Pacific Asia&apos;s standards in the basics \u2013 which really are basic \u2013 while also developing the capacity to innovate evident in the US.&quot; There is increasing concern that the system now is inadequate as it allows children to drop English and maths after 16. Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg has called for students to continue studying these core subjects after GCSE. He said: &quot;We need to go further on English and maths. We are examining this as part of the policy review, requiring some English and maths learning between the ages of 16 and 18.&quot; Labour has suggested creating a new post-16 qualification in maths that is short of a full A-level, in an attempt to encourage more students to study the subject. Twigg called for a strengthening of vocational education, saying Britain needed to learn from countries like Germany that &quot;have succeeded in giving practical subjects the kind of status they haven&apos;t had in this country&quot;. A Department for Education spokesman said the government was transforming vocational education, citing the expansion of University Technical Colleges, the creation of studio schools and the funding of what he described as &quot;the biggest apprenticeships programme our country has ever seen&quot;. The Institute for Fiscal Studies called for a &quot;radical rethink&quot; of GCSEs on Wednesday, saying that England is unusual in having a school leaving exam at age 16. &quot;Now that the vast majority stay on past 16 to do further qualifications, there must be some question over the role of a set of exams which may signal to some that leaving at 16 is expected, particularly in the context of government policy to raise the &apos;education participation age&apos; to 18.&quot; GCSEs are also used to hold schools to account for their performance, the paper says, and is one of the measures used by universities when making offers to students. But it adds that other accountability measures could be used in league tables. &quot;It would also be odd to justify retaining GCSEs on the basis they are used for university admissions,&quot; the paper argues. &quot;Currently, the majority of children don&apos;t go to university and other reforms could improve the flow of information to admissions tutors, such as entrance exams or running the application process after A-level results have been published.&quot; It concludes: &quot;Perhaps an even more radical rethink of the role of GCSEs and the structure of the public examination system is called for if we are to ensure that these exams serve a valid purpose and young people are best served for the future.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/23/un-green-climate-fund-climate-change", "sentences": ["This is an important distinction, as it would mean that China, the world&apos;s second biggest economy, and other rapidly growing countries such as South Korea, Singapore and many Middle Eastern nations, despite their high incomes per capita, would be excluded from contributing."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-23T12:36:00Z", "title": "Green Climate Fund to discuss $100bn pledged by rich countries", "tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "United Nations", "World news", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Ban Ki-moon", "Canc\u00fan climate change conference 2010 | COP16", "Durban climate change conference 2011", "Global climate talks", "Global development", "Environmental sustainability"], "article": "The fate of billions of dollars of promised funding from rich countries to help the developing world adapt to climate change will be discussed on Thursday in Geneva, at the first meeting of the UN&apos;s Green Climate Fund.

The fund is unlikely to have much sway over the initial round of &quot;fast-start&quot; financing from rich to poor countries that was agreed at the Copenhagen summit in 2009. Most of the $30bn (\u00a319bn) pledged at Copenhagen has now been committed, and most of it is already earmarked for various projects. For instance, the UK is on track to provide \u00a31.5bn between 2010-13 and about \u00a31bn of this has already been committed to bilateral and multilateral projects developed with poor countries, or is being channelled through existing funding routes. Given this, it is unclear whether the GCF will have access to much financing in the next few years, even though it is envisaged to be the world&apos;s single biggest source of financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2020. In the longer term, the prospects for substantial funding are even less clear: it will have to raise money from both governments and the private sector but at present there is no agreement on how it might do so. Although the $100bn a year was agreed at Copenhagen, and confirmed at Cancun in 2010, the GCF will be only one source among many for those funds. Private sector and government cash flowing through other routes will also count towards the $100bn goal. One major source of contention in the discussions is that some developing country governments want to limit the fund, so that contributions from the public sector come only from &quot;traditional donors&quot;. That is, the countries labelled as developed in the original UN climate treaties of 1992 and the Kyoto protocol of 1997. This is an important distinction, as it would mean that China, the world&apos;s second biggest economy, and other rapidly growing countries such as South Korea, Singapore and many Middle Eastern nations, despite their high incomes per capita, would be excluded from contributing. Developed nations including the US and the UK insist that this distinction should not apply to the fund. Although the GCF has been under discussion for years, with governments agreeing in principle at Copenhagen to set it up, the complexities of the climate negotiations have stalled its development. However, the delays increase the political risk around the project: for instance, the US under a Republican president or Congress is unlikely to be willing to commit substantial sums to the fund. As the US presidential campaign has progressed, the White House has not made climate change negotiations a major issue. The administration&apos;s special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, caused consternation several weeks ago when he appeared to suggest, in a speech at Dartmouth College in the US, that the long term goal of holding global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 the underpinning principle of the Copenhagen accord, Cancun agreement, and last year&apos;s agreement at Durban - could be abandoned."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/aug/23/rbs-libor-scandal-barclays", "sentences": ["As the Royal Bank of Scotland gets dragged into the Libor scandal thanks to court documents in Singapore, shares have dropped 3%, making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-23T15:15:43Z", "title": "RBS shares down on Libor manipulation claims but Barclays shares back at pre-scandal levels", "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Barclays", "Libor", "FTSE"], "article": "As the Royal Bank of Scotland gets dragged into the Libor scandal thanks to court documents in Singapore, shares have dropped 3%, making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100.

It has already announced that it has sacked several employees for misconduct as a result of its investigations.

RBS&apos; chief executive, Stephen Hester, has warned that the bank is likely to face fines, like Barclays. RBS is 82% owned by the British taxpayer. The Libor scandal, which has engulfed the banking industry, led to the resignation of three senior Barclays executives \u2013 chief executive Bob Diamond, his former right-hand man Jerry del Missier and chairman Marcus Agius, who was subsequently reinstated to search for a new chief executive. Barclays has appointed Sir David Walker as chairman from 1 November, when Agius will step down, but is still looking for a replacement for Diamond. Last week MPs accused Diamond of being &quot;highly selective&quot; in the evidence he gave to their emergency hearings on rigging Libor interest rates. The Treasury select committee also criticised the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, the chief City regulator, for not acting sooner: the FSA&apos;s investigation of Libor was two years behind the US. The Bank of England will take over the lead role in banking regulation next year when the FSA is disbanded.

But the coalition, through its free schools and academies programme, has drained so much funding away from councils that local education departments are now being squeezed out of existence. Solihull LEA, for example, shed a further 25 advisory teachers at the end of the summer term, leaving a tiny core \u2013 a shadow of a once proud and effective team. Teachers will now be working without the dispassionate and continuous support of experienced experts whose role was to make trustworthy and productive professional relationships with teachers and managers; to organise subject and management conferences; to lead regular subject, heads of department and management meetings; to identify and disseminate best teaching practice; to identify and work to remedy problem areas of education, such as links between junior and secondary schools; to build national networks with other schools, LEAs and researchers; to provide training in curriculum initiatives; to help develop teaching skills alongside teachers in the classroom; and to offer support in times of school or personal crisis. Michael Gove is already making the argument that if standards fall, it is because of a more challenging examination regime. In reality it will be because Gove is dismantling schools&apos; traditional means of advice and support. David CurtisSolihull, West Midlands \u2022 Michael Barber reflects our view that the way schools are measured needs rethinking. Many young people will have done well in their GCSEs. This is fantastic \u2013 they and their teachers have worked really hard for their results. But what do these grades actually mean? What do they stand for? To quote one of our children, who got her results yesterday: &quot;You&apos;re given the syllabus and that&apos;s what you learn.&quot; Is this really an education? This hoop-jumping culture is all down to that freedom-crushing behemoth, the league table. Academic league tables push for all young people to learn and perform in a certain way to meet a certain model of success. Young people find little opportunity to grow their own skills and interests, to find their own strengths and values. Thinking for yourself and knowing what you believe and what you&apos;re good at is just as important as passing exams. This knowledge brings confidence, clarity and motivation, which in turn helps young people flourish at work when they leave school or university. So instead of ranking our schools by the number of A grades they churn out, we think it is time to measure them by their ability to produce self-aware, well-rounded young people capable of independent thought and able to make a positive contribution to society and the world of work, no matter what letters are printed on that results slip. Richard Addis Founder, The Day, Tom Hickman Founder, The Bridge, Sarah Wrixon Founder, uni&apos;s not for me  \u2022 It&apos;s time to treat teachers as professionals, and not anti-progress apparatchiks. Teachers will not be\u00a0motivated by performance pay (Report, 22 August). Their reward is in students achieving as best as they can. Mr Gove appears not to understand his brief.

John Mann, a Labour MP on the Treasury select committee, said &quot;City insiders&quot; had suggested RBS&apos;s involvement may be &quot;noticeably worse&quot; than Barclays&apos;. Barclays was forced to pay \u00a3290m in June by US and British authorities for its role in trying to manipulate Libor, which affect the cost of borrowing for millions of customers around the world.

RBS chief executive Stephen Hester has already warned that the bank is likely to face fines. It is thought that Barclays received a reduced fine for settling early. Mann is asking George Osborne whether he or Treasury officials have been briefed on the issue, and when the FSA inquiry into Libor fixing at RBS began. He said: &quot;It&apos;s not credible that UKFI, who represents the main shareholder ie, the taxpayer, was not kept informed of the investigation and it&apos;s seriousness. Either George Osborne is failing to run the Treasury properly or he is failing to tell parliament what he knows.&quot; UK Financial Investments (UKFI) controls the taxpayer&apos;s 82% stake in RBS. Mann&apos;s concerns have been heightened by City minister Mark Hoban&apos;s claim that he only learned of the scandal in recent times. Mann asked: &quot;Why was the City Minister kept in the dark and who else has been kept in the dark? &quot;If Osborne denies receiving any information there needs to be a full Cabinet Secretary investigation into the running of the UK taxpayers investment in RBS; the failure to protect future share values and the liability of both Osborne and UKFI if losses accrue to the taxpayer due to a lack of due diligence.&quot; Mann suggested that Osborne&apos;s position is compromised because he has based his fiscal projections on an anticipated windfall from the reprivatisation of RBS.

Hello. Only 38 more weeks to go. Or if you prefer, it&apos;s the second week of the new season. All eyes today will be on Old Trafford where Robin van Persie is expected to start against Fulham. The west London club have a horrible record at Man Utd. They have avoided defeat once in the last 49 years. They haven&apos;t scored in their last five trips up the M6. They&apos;ve conceded sixteen in their last six visits. Anything other than a Man Utd victory will be a surprise. A thrashing looks a distinct possibility. For what it&apos;s worth, the Cottagers look a decent outside bet to go down. You can&apos;t not warm to Martin Jol, though. In the early kick-off Swansea are leading West Ham 2-0. The Swans new Spanish midfielder Miguel Michu is again among the goals.

See also Sunderland.&quot;  I&apos;m sympathetic if you&apos;re talking Steven Fletcher, but Adam Johnson is a great signing.

GOAL! ASTON VILLA 1-3 EVERTON Karim El Ahmadi scores his first goal in English football. A consolation, though, surely. &quot;El Ahmadi appears to have looked up that phrase involving silver linings and thought, &apos;Oh right, I&apos;ll do that then.&apos;&quot; says Anthony Hull.

He&apos;s a highlights player, flatters to deceive. His work rate is less than poor, he can&apos;t tackle so he never even tries and his tracking back is non-existent. He can dribble (sometimes) and his technique is wonderful, sure, but the occasional long-range howitzer or even six of them like last season, does not a good player make.&quot; I disagree, it probably does a good player make.

Great Ormond Street hospital, GOSH to its friends, is a global brand \u2013 without doubt one of the most famous children&apos;s hospitals in the world, and one with a reputation for quality and innovation, delivering services that are unique in the UK. We have other similar brands - the Royal Marsden, Moorfields and other specialist hospitals \u2013 as well as academic health science centres (AHSCs), such as Imperial, Cambridge and UCL Partners. These are centred on teaching hospitals, which are at the top of global academic league tables. Collectively and individually, they all punch well above their weight scientifically and enable our patients to access world-class treatments and technologies. Encouraging the NHS to export this expertise has raised a few eyebrows. It has been suggested the move could harm the NHS. Yet building the reputation of the NHS beyond these shores could build capacity and capability. The idea is not new \u2013 AHSCs in the US have been supporting services overseas for many years. Johns Hopkins University pioneered medical and nursing training at Peking Union Medical College in the 1910s. Duke University runs a graduate medical school in Singapore and many American academic institutions deliver services across the globe. It is hard to imagine Americans would see the brands of their great hospitals being undermined by global activities and reputations. Likewise in the UK, many of our hospitals provide private medical care to overseas patients, which generates funds to deliver NHS services. And they do it without damaging the brand in the process. There are also chains of private hospitals delivering high-quality care across continents \u2013 so why shouldn&apos;t one of the best healthcare systems in the world? Indeed raising the private patient cap and enabling NHS foundation trusts to increase their income from this activity is an important aspect of delivering financial sustainability to a number of organisations. A move of this nature would, in turn, also deliver better services for patients within the UK. We have hidden the NHS light under a bushel for too long. For many years Commonwealth Fund reports have put the NHS at or near the top of a league of health services of industrialised countries. For chronic and serious illness it performs consistently highly \u2013 for co-ordination of care, patient safety and the way patients are engaged in their care. Building the NHS brand, and singing about a service that should be the envy of the world, as Danny Boyle did, can only be positive. Not only will this initiative take the capability overseas \u2013 for the benefit of other patients and healthcare systems \u2013 but it could help recruit high-calibre clinical and scientific talent, making these organisations more exciting places to work. Perhaps, however, &apos;export&apos; is the wrong term? It suggests goods being made in the UK and shipped overseas. This idea is about much more. It is about leveraging the NHS as a brand, building capability and capacity as well as enhancing our understanding and our global contribution in such an important area. Healthcare is a global issue \u2013 and taking a parochial view from within these shores is neither helpful, nor appropriate.

Alas, it would have been more instructive to walk around the wealthiest districts of London at night. I&apos;ll come back to that. Online, most early posts got no further than those along the lines of &quot;dead man walking&quot;, &quot;too late&quot; and &quot;you&apos;re toast, mate&quot;. It may all be true about Clegg&apos;s prospects, though it&apos;s still too soon to be sure. But it&apos;s not very illuminating, is it? We can see the merit of what Clegg is trying to say, that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the biggest tax burden and plenty of countries have wealth taxes. It might help prevent further cuts in the welfare state, which damage the social fabric as well as individual and family lives \u2013 what George Osborne has in store for us as the recovery falters, though I have always doubted he&apos;ll be able to do it. Will Clegg be able to do it? Politics is about practicality, about actually doing things and making them stick, not about high-blown rhetoric or posturing of which we get far too much \u2013 and always have. And he&apos;s not alone in looking at taxation of wealth. Tim Montgomerie, the mastermind behind the Lord Ashcroft-owned ConservativeHome website, has made himself plenty of Tory enemies (not just Ashcroft?) by backing a shift from taxes on income and wealth creation to wealth itself, notably property. Check out his constructive response to Clegg. It&apos;s an interesting read. Tricky stuff, eh? Montgomerie&apos;s ideas for increasing the too-flat council tax band scale and hitting property sales harder would also help the north-south unfairness divide, he adds. The Tories need to do better in the north, but it&apos;s not easy to see the coalition doing it. Montgomerie can be naive in a wholesome way. But practicality goes for the chancellor as much as it does for blogger Tim or the DPM. Osborne may see himself as the hard-nosed realist, despising Clegg as a hand-wringing wet. He may be right about the personal judgment, but he&apos;s been wrong from day one to assume that the UK economy will grow again with his austerity medicine. Not much realism about that. And without growth the medicine won&apos;t work. Those who say &quot;ah, we must administer even more medicine&quot; are engaged in bogus machismo, as dumb in their own way as panacea-merchants who say &quot;nationalise everything&quot; or &quot;leave the EU and all will be well again&quot;. Clegg and Vince Cable are right about that too. There&apos;s plenty that the coalition can do to rearrange public spending, making it work better for all without further depressing demand in the economy. Building infrastructure projects, houses, power stations and third runways, instead of spending the same money on unemployment benefit is only part of it. Public spending is needed to stimulate the private kind. Everyone knows that except those Tory &quot;realists&quot;. In their attack on Clegg today the TaxPayers&apos; Alliance shows how not to do it. But how to lift flagging tax revenues and reinforce a greater &quot;we&apos;re all in this together&quot; sense of fairness, which is so important to social cohesion? That&apos;s much harder and Clegg was conspicuously vague about his proposed wealth tax in his interview, in which our Nick detected a new sense of self-confidence in the other Nick after his long coalition battering. David Cameron&apos;s rebuff on Lords reform (with Ed Miliband&apos;s collusion, he feels) may have put iron into Clegg&apos;s soul. He promises details at his party conference. Don&apos;t hold too much breath. Those respectable UK-domiciled wealthy earners and taxpayers already pay most of the income tax collected in this country, though tax avoiders (legal) and evaders (illegal), non-domiciles and other shifty types who use our roads and are protected by our laws do not. The top tax rate has been raised (and lowered) to 45% and assorted allowances \u2013 pensions for instance \u2013 curbed. Bonus culture is under pressure. Deutsche Bank ended it only last week. Bob Diamond has gone home to New York. So there has been progress. Amid a hail of weary abuse about &quot;the politics of envy&quot; (as tired slogans go &quot;the culture of greed&quot; still works better in 2012, I feel) and &quot;killing of enterprise&quot;, Clegg wants to levy a tax on wealth, not income. That&apos;s fair enough in theory, but harder in practice. As the BBC&apos;s Nick Robinson was quick to point out, an elderly widow living in the family home may have wealth locked up in the property, but no spare income to pay an annual wealth tax. Such people tend to be Tory voters. Some are even Lib Dems (Labour, SNP etc too) as Cable discovered when he launched his unilateral &quot;mansion tax&quot; plan at the party&apos;s conference in Bournemouth, barely a cab ride from Sandbanks, the Poole suburb with (it is claimed) the richest postcode in Britain. Cable&apos;s target of a levy on \u00a31m homes captured too many middling earners and rapidly became \u00a32m before the Tories blocked it - Nick Robinson confirms the point. Uphill work Property is always said to be easier to tax because you can&apos;t hide it in Jersey or Zurich. Alas, Osborne is only the latest chancellor to find that isn&apos;t quite true any more. A Russian oligarch who puts his Mayfair house into the ownership of an offshore company and then sells the company to another company avoids stamp duty as the house itself has not been sold. The Treasury is trying to close such loopholes, but it&apos;s always uphill work. As Wikipedia&apos;s modest summary points out, a wealth tax is levied on net assets in several countries \u2013 including Norway and, exclusively in the EU, France. Germany is among those to have recently abolished an annual levy on net worth, property as well as more liquid assets. I&apos;m not sure that US state and federal property taxes or UK council tax (which replaced the rates) are really wealth taxes. They are tied to property values though, albeit values which are usually well out of date, and they do deliver some of the same rough justice, taxing people who are cash-poor such as widows in the family house or flat. As our near and comparable neighbour, France and its &quot;solidarity tax&quot; is the interesting case, as is Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s stance on tightening of the screw. It&apos;s complicated, it always is, but uncomplicated is the French republican loathing of great wealth. It&apos;s what turned voters off Nicolas Sarkozy, champion of bling and the bling crowd. The solidarity tax (ISF) is reckoned to raise up to \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.2bn) a year , not much but it&apos;s supposed to make other taxpayers feel better. Or should it? Some tax buffs claim it has driven far more wealth out of France over the years \u2013 hence the joke that ISF stands for incitement de sortir de france. Is that true \u2013 or just bluff, like all those city types who keep telling the FT that they will decamp to Dublin, Singapore or Zurich but rarely do? Here&apos;s where finesse is required. The very rich are mobile and in many cases their loyalty is to their money. Hence my advice to tour the rich neighbourhoods of London at night. Like the Grand Canal in Venice \u2013 so glorious in sunlight \u2013 they present a sad spectacle because so few lights are on in Mayfair or Belgravia. The owners are not there. They&apos;re somewhere else wasting their money on foolish things to keep boredom and death at bay. Not all rich people are foolish, any more than poor people are. They know the value of family, place, community and more than pay their way via their taxes, their commitment, their charity. Think Bill Gates, think Warren Buffett. Nearer to home think the Rowntrees or the Sainsburys. So do remember that Fred &quot;the Shred&quot; Goodwin \u2013 that&apos;s Mr Goodwin to you \u2013 is not the only type of banker or plutocrat out there. So Clegg needs to refine his ideas cautiously and play down expectations that arouse the party faithful but alarm the unpatriotic rich. Small practical measures may make for feebler headlines but will divide society less and should end up producing more tax revenue \u2013 which is the prime purpose of the exercise, not phoney feel-good. Invest more money in HMRC staff (they&apos;ve been cutting them back) especially the special units which tackle avoidance and fraud. By all means close more tax loopholes and hammer loophole merchants harder. Do create some higher property bands for council tax, which now hits middle income families hardest and urge a revaluation of property values. That&apos;s a form of wealth tax which most Americans, the sane ones, accept. Don&apos;t give in to the temptation of easy conference applause, Nick, and demand that Dave and George raise the top income tax rate to 50% again. You voted for the cut to 45% with a bad conscience under duress, but vote you did. We don&apos;t want to drive away the rich, because we need their taxes. We do, however, want to make their role less central to the way we conduct our society. If you really do want to make the tax system fairer so that those who won&apos;t miss it pay more, go for small but effective changes, enforced with greater determination. If all you want to do is get through a difficult party conference season, bellow away to your heart&apos;s content. But voters nowadays believe what you do, not what you merely say."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/29/wales-top-gastro-tourism-destination", "sentences": ["A touring kitchen showcasing Welsh food at festivals is going global, with visits to Singapore, Barcelona, Paris, Cologne, Shanghai, Washington and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-29T19:00:00Z", "title": "Wales becomes a top gastro-tourism destination", "tags": ["British food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Wales", "UK news", "Wales holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Travel"], "article": "Bryn Williams is looking for a new butter.

Fantastic.&quot; Williams has long been banging the drum for Welsh food, serving up the finest produce from the valleys at his acclaimed London restaurant Odette&apos;s. Now, he has company \u2013 Wales is ready to be noticed, with a government-funded True Taste of Wales brand and a flurry of gastro-inspired initiatives. True, Wales has always been respected in food circles, chiefly for its renowned Abergavenny food festival, but now there is a concerted effort to put the country firmly on the global food map. A touring kitchen showcasing Welsh food at festivals is going global, with visits to Singapore, Barcelona, Paris, Cologne, Shanghai, Washington and Dubai. Gastro-tourism is growing, with young companies such as Snowdonia Safari taking visitors to sample local produce at homegrown businesses \u2013 think stewy cawl and Welsh cakes \u2013 and Turnstone Tours taking tourists to people&apos;s houses for home cooking. And it is paying off, with companies reporting increased business. &quot;One beer company&apos;s exports have grown from 5% to 17% in the past three years,&quot; says Nerys Howell, True Taste food consultant. Wales is also listed as one of the top three destinations for gastro-tourism, according to the journal Rural Geographies. &quot;People are discovering how good their produce is,&quot; says Shaun Hill, from Michelin-starred The Walnut Tree, near Abergavenny. &quot;We have first-class lamb, good beef, game, cheese and some very good charcuterie such as Trealy Farm&apos;s. Wales has always been a poor country so the culture is simple food \u2013 baking, and good meat or fish.&quot; Ah, the produce, testament to Wales&apos;s grassy slopes, mountainous farmland and, as Williams says, the fact that &quot;it never stops bloody raining&quot;. Speak to most chefs in Wales about the country&apos;s produce and their eyes grow dewy. &quot;The coastline is fabulous,&quot; says Stephen Terry, from The Hardwick, Abergavenny. &quot;Great crab and lobsters, fantastic Welsh samphire, salt-marsh lamb and cheese. Perl wen kicks the ass\u00a0off brie.&quot; There is a strong spirit of localism. &quot;Research shows that 80% of visitors are looking for a Welsh food experience,&quot; says Howell. Elisabeth Luard, author of A Cook&apos;s Year in a Welsh Farmhouse, points out an interesting mix: &quot;Incomers are keen on green self-sufficiency; locals, who lived isolated lives on the mountains, have a tradition of necessity.&quot; Most people bake, she says, many own pigs and chickens, and she used to get home-churned butter from her neighbours. So what are chefs rustling up? Terry does a Welsh rarebit made with pressed ham hocks, acclaimed Hafod cheese and Welsh beer (&quot;there&apos;s a brewery in virtually every valley&quot;), Black Mountains Smokery smoked salmon with laverbread (made from seaweed) and rye bread from nearby award-winning baker Alex Gooch. Back at Odette&apos;s, Williams does a light bara brith (&quot;speckled bread&quot;), a Welsh cheeseboard \u2013 perl las, caerphilly and perl wen \u2013 with Welsh buttermilk soda bread and panna cotta. Then there&apos;s Welsh black beef, pedigree Welsh pork and mutton \u2013 and, of course, slow-roasted Welsh lamb (new season and salt marsh).&quot;They would kill me at home if I didn&apos;t!&quot; For Williams, who has staked his reputation on bigging-up Welsh food, its growing clout is vindication. &quot;I&apos;m known as a chef who uses Welsh ingredients,&quot; he says, &quot;It took years to gain the confidence to stick it on the menu. Welsh food isn&apos;t well-known, people found it strange, but Welsh produce can easily compete with [that of] anywhere else in the world.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/29/paralympics-2012-sailors-olympic", "sentences": ["Among the 23 nations that will be represented this time are Japan, Puerto Rico, Malaysia and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-29T21:41:28Z", "title": "Paralympics 2012: Sailors ready to outshine their Olympic counterparts", "tags": ["Paralympics 2012: sailing", "ParalympicsGB", "Paralympics 2012", "Sport", "Paralympics", "Disability sport"], "article": "In the past they may have felt overwhelmed at the prospect of following Team GB&apos;s world-beating sailors. This time it could just be the turn of the Paralympic sailing team to outshine their Olympic counterparts. All six of the British sailors who will compete in the three classes of boat in the Paralympic regatta are veterans of previous games. And all six feel they have something to prove as they try to win a first ever Paralympian medal in sailing for GB. Helena Lucas, who sails solo in the 2.4mR keelboat, said the team had been disappointed not to come away with a medal at Beijing and were determined to make sure GB&apos;s Paralympic medal account is opened at London 2012. Lucas, who finished seventh in China, said this team had a tremendous chance of success this time. &quot;It&apos;s the same team that went to Beijing so we know each other really well, which I think is a massive benefit. &quot;We are all capable of coming away with a gold medal. Hopefully all three teams will be standing on the rostrum in front of a home crowd. To medal here would make up for not medalling in Beijing 100 times.&quot; The 37-year-old Lucas is an interesting character. She was born without thumbs but that did not stop her becoming one of GB&apos;s most talented sailors and winning a silver medal in the 2006 Olympic test event in Beijing in the Yngling class. By that time she was already also competing in the 2.4mR Paralympic class, probably the most competitive of the three boats. There has been intense competition between Lucas and her training partner, Megan Pascoe, for the place in the team and Lucas was among the last batch of Olympic and Paralympic sailors to be picked. &quot;Selection&apos;s been a tough road,&quot; she said. &quot;We&apos;ve pushed each other really hard and we&apos;ve definitely improved.&quot; Sailing has been a full part of the Paralympic Games since Sydney 2000. The Germans have won more golds than anyone with two while the Americans have won the most medals overall \u2013 five. Other nations that have done well include France, Australia, Canada, Holland and Israel. Among the 23 nations that will be represented this time are Japan, Puerto Rico, Malaysia and Singapore. Up to 80 athletes will take part. The boats are, if anything, more technical than the Olympic versions. They are all keelboats, making them less likely to capsize and they are adapted in different ways so that sailors with many disabilities can compete. A complex classification system based on an athlete&apos;s ability to perform tasks on the boat is designed to ensure fairness. But the most impressive element of the national sailing team, Skandia Team GBR, is that the Paralympians are an integral part of the set-up rather than an extra. Hannah Stodel, one of the trio competing in the Sonar class, said they were one of the &quot;luckiest teams&quot;. &quot;When I look at some of the foreign teams, I think: &apos;How are they surviving? How are they managing to get to events without the support of their governing body and their Olympic team?&apos; Skandia Team GBR is 13 Olympic and Paralympic classes. It&apos;s not an us-and-them approach. Our team is very integrated and that is really powerful.&quot; So they might be working on their boat and have double Olympic gold medalist Iain Percy walk past and give them some advice. Or they might bump into four-time gold medalist Ben Ainslie pushing his body to the brink in the gym. Being part of such a machine means that life can be tough. Just like the Olympians, the Paralympians are all too aware that their funding is constantly reviewed. At one point the Sonar trio&apos;s money was pulled. &quot;They took our funding away to make us realise we needed to work harder,&quot; said Stodel. &quot;We were becoming a bit arrogant, we were winning medals. But they said: &apos;No, not good enough.&apos;&quot; They got their act together and the funding was restored. The Sonar sailors (Stodel, who was born without a right forearm, John Robertson, the victim of a motorcycle accident, and Stephen Thomas, who lost his legs below the knees after contracting meningococcal septicaemia), have won six medals in world championships but have failed at the Olympics, finishing sixth in Athens and Beijing. Stodel suggests they might have been put off by the success of the Olympic sailors. &quot;Our Olympic sailing team is hugely successful so to follow on from them, the pressure&apos;s always going to be on.&quot;Thomas, who was a good rugby player before his illness, first dreamed of competing in the Paralympics as he lay recovering in his hospital bed. He said it took a long time to get over the disappointment of not winning in China. &quot;I felt I let myself down and everyone else down because we hadn&apos;t performed to our ability. I&apos;m ready now. I&apos;m ready to win a medal.&quot; The final boat, the two-person Skud 18, will be sailed by Alex Rickham and Niki Birrell. A tetraplegic athlete, Jamaican-born Rickham began sailing during rehabilitation in Miami following a diving accident when she was a teenager. Birrell, who has cerebral palsy, learned to sail on the same lakes in the north-west of England as Stuart Bithell, who won silver during the Olympic regatta with Luke Patience. He campaigned for the Olympics with his brother before striking up the partnership with Rickham in the Paralympics. At Beijing Birrell was helm and they came fifth. They have swapped this time and post-Beijing have won every world championship. Like the Sonar sailors they also won gold at Sail for Gold, the last regatta at Weymouth and Portland ahead of the Olympic and Paralympic events. They accept that they are seen as an odd couple with Rickham admitting that she could find her partner &quot;very annoying&quot;. &quot;He doesn&apos;t shut up about Formula One, Manchester City and sailing.&quot; Birrell said: &quot;Alex loves the organisation, loves the planning, likes the textbook way and concentrates. She&apos;s very good at helming the boat. I&apos;m a it more out there. I use instinct to get me through.&quot; Like all six members of the team, Birrell is hoping to lay rest the demons of Beijing. &quot;We&apos;ve got a score to settle.

Although little is known about the group, it is thought that they did not discover the flaw themselves but may have bought it from a commercial group that specialises in selling details about &quot;zero-day&quot; flaws in software that can be used to penetrate commercial or government systems, even when they have the most up-to-date cybersecurity in place. &quot;We can confirm that some of the attackers behind this latest round of attacks are actually the Nitro gang,&quot; Symantec says. Orla Cox, senior manager for security response, told the Guardian that the gang had first been spotted online in October 2011, using a command server located in Singapore that was used to control the siphoning of information from 29 US, UK and Bangladesh-based chemical manufacturing companies, many listed on the stock market. She declined to name them, citing customer confidentiality. The latest attacks, which have led to widespread advice that users should disable Java on their browsers, were spotted last week. But Cox said that new evidence collected by Symantec indicated that the Nitro group was sending out targeted emails, again to chemicals companies, since 22 August \u2013 before the vulnerability was spotted by security researchers. The emails contained a link which, if clicked, would take unsuspecting users to websites. Those then exploited the flaw in Java to load malware on their machine and leave it open to being surreptitiously controlled, so that information on it or its network could be siphoned to the gang. &quot;They haven&apos;t used a zero-day attack before, which indicates that they don&apos;t as a group have that expertise,&quot; Cox said. She said that suggests that they acquired it commercially rather than discovering it themselves. Zero-day flaws are a burgeoning commercial field in the underground hacker economy where some gangs work to order for commercial or government clients which want to break into systems. Discovering them can take a long time and special expertise; deploying them tends to require much less skill. Symantec said it could not identify the Nitro gang&apos;s location, as the Singaporean command computer could be controlled from anywhere in the world. But it seemed likely, said Cox, that the gang is based somewhere in the region."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/01/readers-favourite-photographs-songs-recipes", "sentences": ["My parents met in Singapore in 1978.", "My little brother arrived and everything seemed to be going well until a change in political attitudes in Singapore meant our family had to move back to the UK, ostensibly temporarily, in 1983."], "publicationDate": "2012-08-31T23:05:11Z", "title": "Family life", "tags": ["Family", "Photography", "Art and design", "Life and style", "Culture", "Music", "Food & drink"], "article": "Snapshot: My parents meeting Joan Crawford When I was young I never understood why my parents seemed so pleased about this photograph \u2013 known in the family as &quot;the one with Joan Crawford&quot;. They told me she was a famous movie star, but I had not seen her movies and, from the photograph, I\u00a0thought her less beautiful and glamorous than my mother, so I wasn&apos;t much impressed. Now, many years later, I look at this picture and I am filled with admiration for what it tells me of my parents&apos; story. It was taken in Beirut around 1958. My father was posted to the Pakistani embassy there and Joan Crawford&apos;s husband Alfred Steele (on the left) was visiting in his role as head of Pepsi-Cola. My parents had spent the day on the beach before going on to enjoy their usual evening&apos;s socialising. During their decades as a diplomatic couple they travelled around the world. They enjoyed and explored every foreign capital they lived in \u2013 Nairobi, Beirut, Cairo, Algiers, Khartoum, Buenos Aires. They took a\u00a0great interest in all the countries they went to and made lots of friends locally, with many of whom they are still in touch. Although my parents tried to give their three children opportunities to expand our horizons in any way possible, none of us quite inherited their zest for life or their adventurous spirit. My father&apos;s face is only partially visible in the picture. Now, ironically, it is the world that is no longer visible to him. He lost the sight in one eye in his 40s and went completely blind in his 70s. With that, he also lost the well-loved pursuits of his independent life: the long hours of\u00a0bridge, his reading, research and writing. He lives in darkness now, frail and linked up to dialysis machines three times a week \u2013 yet despite all his physical setbacks, he has written two books and retains a fierce interest in history and food. My mother attained a degree of celebrity late in life through her acting work in television drama in Pakistan. People now ask her for an autograph and want to have their pictures taken with her. For me, she was always more of a star than Joan Crawford. My parents were definitely the main leads in the film of my childhood. Umber Khairi Playlist: Dad&apos;s crazy Spanish disco style When You&apos;re in Love with a Beautiful Woman by Dr Hook &quot;When you&apos;re in love with a beautiful woman, it&apos;s hard \u2026&quot; Later on in life I became aware of boys sniggering at the innuendo of this line, but the first time I heard the song, in 1979, I was an innocent nine-year-old on holiday in rural Spain. The fact that I hadn&apos;t heard it before might have been because our household didn&apos;t have an extensive modern music collection. My parents had Beatles records and I remember dancing to Abba at a friend&apos;s house, but I wasn&apos;t au fait with pop. We were on holiday with a family friend, who was between marriages and had what might be termed a wild streak. Tales of her adventurous rambles were legion. She would announce that we must attend some fiesta that was supposed to be marvellous. It would always turn out to be several hours drive away, with a mournful troupe of guitarists playing interminable Spanish love songs until 3am, by which time I&apos;d have fallen asleep on my mother&apos;s knee. On one of our nights out we came across an open-air disco. We joined in in a desultory fashion in the corner, Europop hardly being the best thing to shake your tail feathers to. Suddenly Dr Hook came on and my father seemed galvanised by the novelty of a song, albeit cheesy, with a recognisable tune and sung in English. He began to dance, a dance like no other. The song is reasonably fast anyway, but my father moved at double speed, with a strange little flourish of the hands and a look to the heavens at the end of each flourish that made it seem like an eccentric foxtrot. It certainly intrigued the DJ, who played\u00a0Dr Hook at least twice more so\u00a0everyone could see the strange Engleeesh dancing. Maggie Brierley We love to eat: Our Asian chicken rice Ingredients 1 chicken, preferably free-range, about\u00a01.75kg 375ml soy sauce  375ml cold water 5-10 sections (whole stars) of star anise 2.5cm ginger root, peeled and sliced 5-10 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 1 tbsp sugar 4 tbsp Chinese rice wine (or dry sherry) Sesame oil to taste Remove any loose fat from the interior of the chicken. Place it breast down in a\u00a0pan just big enough so that as much of the bird as possible will be covered by the cooking liquid. Put the rest of the ingredients, except the oil, into the pan and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat to a brisk simmer, cover and cook for about 30 minutes. Turn the chicken over and cook for another 30 minutes, basting occasionally.\u00a0Remove the chicken and check the juices are running clear (if not, return to the pan until fully cooked). Allow to cool on a plate, then shred the flesh and drizzle with sesame oil. Serve with steamed rice, the hot cooking liquor, shredded cucumber and spring onions or salad and chilli sauce. My parents met in Singapore in 1978.\u00a0 It was a classic boy-meets-girl story, except she was a divorced, middle-class woman in her late 20s who fancied my dad&apos;s mate Dave; and he was an oil worker, from Gateshead, who had been living in the far east for a while and was fed up with attempting to have meaningful relationships with Asian women who didn&apos;t get his accent, British attitude to alcohol or his jokes.\u00a0They met a few days after she arrived in the country and he introduced her to water-skiing.\u00a0Once Dad made sure Dave was out of the way,\u00a0things were pretty whirlwind and within a couple of years they had married and had a child. Throughout this period, they spent a great deal of time in restaurants, often with me in tow, drinking G&amp;Ts and eating chilli crab or prawns with black beans.\u00a0 We moved to Indonesia when I was about 18 months old, where further culinary delights awaited. My little brother arrived and everything seemed to be going well until a change in political attitudes in Singapore meant our family had to move back to the UK, ostensibly temporarily, in 1983.\u00a0 My parents instilled a love of food in me, my brother and my sister, who was born in Scotland in 1986. Chicken rice was a weekday staple and the fragrant smell of ginger often filled the house.\u00a0 I spent the rest of my childhood in Aberdeenshire but left at the first opportunity, taking the recipe with me.\u00a0My mum loosely based her chicken rice on one of Ken Hom&apos;s recipes and I\u00a0copied it into a notebook.\u00a0 \u00a0 Since I have been &quot;a grownup&quot;, I cook chicken rice whenever I want to eat something comforting and delicious, particularly if I am getting over a cold.\u00a0It is a bit like an Asian version of Jewish chicken soup.\u00a0I also make it when I want to look like a culinary genius, with very little effort.\u00a0Let&apos;s be honest, it is an extremely tasty boiled chicken.\u00a0 \u00a0 I&apos;ve adapted the recipe I wrote down 15 years ago, but still have it. I keep the original notepaper in my jar of star anise, which I buy in bulk from a Chinese supermarket.\u00a0That greasy, soy-sauce-stained, aniseed-scented piece of paper is one of my prized possessions.\u00a0It links me to my parents, a life I can&apos;t remember and my childhood home.\u00a0It makes me happy, even though I don&apos;t need it any more.

Great Britain continued their strong showing in team para-equestrian sport, winning the team dressage gold, a result that takes Lee Pearson&apos;s tally to 10 gold medals, one short of the number achieved by Tanni Grey-Thompson. The Germany team, always the biggest threat, took silver in the team event with Ireland third but neither could better a British team whose unbeaten run now stretches over four Games. Deb Criddle, Lee Pearson and Sophie Christiansen \u2013 with the help of the newcomer Sophie Wells \u2013 held on to the gold they won in Beijing. The result \u2013 an average of riders&apos; scores in the team test and the individual championship test \u2013 means the British team has now not been beaten in 16 years. Pearson had already taken silver on Saturday in the grade 1b individual championship test, while Natasha Baker, the 22-year-old newcomer to the team, went one better with gold in the grade II, but on Sunday it was the turn of their team-mates to demonstrate their talents. The ride of the day was by Christiansen \u2013 who won two golds in Beijing \u2013 in the Grade 1a test for the most impaired riders. Christiansen scored an astonishing 82.750% on her horse Janeiro 6. The first rider to compete, she had a near flawless performance, putting a huge distance between herself and the silver-medal winner, Ireland&apos;s Helen Kearney, who scored 76.700% riding Mister Cool. Singapore&apos;s Laurentoa Tan on Ruben James 2 took bronze. &quot;As long as I stayed relaxed and focused on what I had done in training, I knew I could pull out an 80%-plus test,&quot; said 24-year-old Christiansen, who has cerebral palsy. &quot;It was always going to be tough going first in the competition but I did my best. I&apos;ve worked so hard this year.&quot; Earlier in the day the 46-year-old Criddle \u2013 a triple gold medal winner in Athens \u2013 won silver with her horse LJT Akilles. Apart from a few minor mistakes she put in a strong performance in the Grade III test, scoring 71.267%, which was beaten only by penultimate rider andthe defending Paralympic champion, Hannelore Brenner, who scored 74.133% with Women of the World. Denmark&apos;s Annika Dalskov took bronze, coming within three hundredths of a point of Criddle&apos;s silver medal with a score of 71.200%. &quot;For the mistakes I made, it was a really good score,&quot; said Criddle. &quot;It happened, and I had to move on, so it was a case of getting him moving again and getting the swing back, which we managed to do, and we did some really good work.&quot; The rookie team member Wells, who was born with amniotic band syndrome that affects her joints and competes in non-disabled events, also put in a silver-medal winning performance on her horse Pinocchio in her grade IV test, behind Belgium&apos;s Michele George. &quot;If I hadn&apos;t had the mistake, it might have been a different story,&quot; she said. &quot;I knew I would have to do the best test I had ever done but the Paralympics is when everyone is at their best. You can&apos;t afford a mistake but unfortunately I had one and I take complete responsibility for that.&quot; She realised immediately that she had made a mistake, she said. &quot;I knew I had blown it. But I know why I lost it, rather than not knowing why I lost it,&quot; she said. &quot;But the horse has brought me a long way and I am pleased with him. These things happen.&quot; Pearson, who has promised a &quot;show-off&quot; performance in the grade Ib freestyle, will attempt to win his 11th gold on Monday \u2013 matching the number of golds won by Grey Thompson. Baker \u2013 who has already achieved two top scores and won gold in her individual championship test \u2013 will be looking for her second Paralympic gold in\u00a0the grade II freestyle, in which the riders choreograph their own routine to chosen music."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/03/tender-outsourced-policy-thinktanks-decline", "sentences": ["The Cabinet Office said it had received &quot;a high level of interest&quot; from bidders to work on the &quot;detailed and substantial evidence-based review and assessment&quot; of the structure of governments abroad, including Australia, Singapore, the US, France and Sweden, and the balance of accountability and impartiality between ministers and civil servants in those countries."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-03T07:52:00Z", "title": "Thinktanks fear lack of independence in Cabinet Office tender", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Policy", "Central government", "Politics", "Civil service"], "article": "No sooner had Cabinet Office minister Francis announced the commission of a review into the workings of civil services overseas, than the bids were in. The \u00a350,000 contract, the first of a tranche of government policy making to be &quot;opened up&quot; or &quot;outsourced&quot; (depending on how you want to look at it), was put out to tender in mid-August to thinktanks, academic institutions and private sector organisations, outside the Whitehall machine. The Cabinet Office said it had received &quot;a high level of interest&quot; from bidders to work on the &quot;detailed and substantial evidence-based review and assessment&quot; of the structure of governments abroad, including Australia, Singapore, the US, France and Sweden, and the balance of accountability and impartiality between ministers and civil servants in those countries. New Zealand is to be given special consideration because of the contractual relationship between ministers, who set outcomes, and department heads, who are accountable for their delivery. The commission is the first piece of work to be awarded under the contestable policy fund, which allows ministers to &quot;draw on thinking, evidence and insight from experts beyond Whitehall&quot; with the winning bidder required to make policy recommendations for how these approaches might work in the UK by 31 October. The Cabinet Office has already had to fend off attacks about the implications of more political systems of administration but some have complained that the time to deliver the work looking at these models is much too short. Organisations interested in the bid process were given a month to put together their proposals after the commission was announced, with the tender process officially opening on 14 August. But both the Reform and Institute for Government (IfG) thinktanks have been notably absent from the process. While insiders say the IfG would have been a leading contender for the Cabinet Office, the thinktank said it hadn&apos;t bid for the project because of its own impartiality issues. It added that it is already working on similar research. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to do it because it would potentially compromise our independence and we&apos;re already doing our own work on accountability models, which we are happy to share,&quot; a spokeswoman said. &quot;We wouldn&apos;t call it policy outsourcing but would say it was opening up policy-making, something we welcome.&quot; While the thinktank would remain supportive, &quot;our number one priority is that we remain independent and have the perception of independence,&quot; she said. She added: &quot;It will be a good thing for organisations out there who want to do it, but you have to be careful about the impartiality of organisations.&quot; Andrew Haldenby, director of Reform, also said the thinktank hadn&apos;t put in a bid despite it being a key area of expertise. &quot;The reason we didn&apos;t do it is that we don&apos;t do sponsored research. The tender came along and because it&apos;s so close to our hearts \u2013 we&apos;ve been working on this for the last three or four years \u2013 we had to look at it, but the rule still stands. &quot;The reason people support us is for our independence and there are quite a lot of constraints in the tender, for example on which subjects to concentrate on. The timescale is too short but it was a secondary factor.&quot; Haldenby said that the only way the contract could be delivered would be through an organisation that had already done a lot of the work on these issues or a large consultancy. &quot;We&apos;d never take only two to three months to write something on this scale. From scratch, it would need a consultancy with lots of teams in different countries \u2013 though it&apos;s not impossible.&quot; But on that scale, Haldenby admitted, the \u00a350,000 fee offered on the contract would seem rather paltry. &quot;We&apos;re all for government getting more bang for its buck so if they can get a consultancy to do it at a very low rate, all the best to them,&quot; he said. So just who will win the contract? The Cabinet Office said the result would be announced shortly but was unable to comment on individual organisations who had made submissions to an ongoing procurement process. The winning bidder will meet with the relevant minister and submit an interim report midway through the project. &quot;The meetings will be an opportunity to present the minister with early conclusions and for him to provide direction for the project and its focus,&quot; the bid notice said.

Heineken has just taken a big step towards completing the latest money-spinning deal as it gained the approval it needs to buy Asia Pacific Breweries, makers of Tiger beer, for up to \u00a34.1bn. It comes two years after it bought Femsa Cerveza, makers of Sol beer, in Mexico for $7.6bn (\u00a34.8bn). The Dutch brewer is not alone \u2013 last year rival SABMiller, which makes Peroni and Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell among others \u2013 snapped up Foster&apos;s for a cool \u00a37.5bn. And in 2008 a \u00a333bn merger created the world&apos;s biggest brewer by putting together Anheuser-Busch and InBev \u2013 a megadeal that united Budweiser, Beck&apos;s, Stella Artois and Hoegaarden. Heineken&apos;s new-found taste for Asian and Mexican beer is not hard to understand. As people get richer in the emerging markets of Latin America, China and Africa, the drinkers of Europe and North America become increasingly irrelevant to the global brewers. In Africa some in the industry believe the continent could soon outgrow both North America and Europe. Only last week SABMiller opened a multimillion-pound brewery in Nigeria. But the biggest cash cow, as in so many industries, could be in China, where the popularity of beer has increased rapidly alongside the traditional desire for spirits. The country already accounts for one in four pints sold worldwide, double that of the US, and could account for 40% of total worldwide sales by 2016. Twenty years ago the Chinese barely touched beer, drinking an average of just 12 pints per person each year. By 2001 that consumption had nearly trebled to 32 pints; last year it was 63. By 2021 the number of pints consumer per head is expected to increase to 93. Ian Shackleton, from Japanese bank Nomura, said recently: &quot;Historically, China has had a strong &apos;spirits culture&apos;, with consumption skewed towards the Chinese traditional spirit baijiu. Beer, as a proportion of total alcohol, increased from 21% in 1997 to 51% in 2011, with the beer category growing at the expense of local, cheap spirits.&quot; AB InBev is expected to generate 6% of its group profits by 2021 from China, compared with just 1% last year, while SABMiller \u2013 which owns a 50% stake in China&apos;s most popular beer, Snow \u2013 will take 19% of its profits from the country. It currently takes 2%. The Heineken deal for Asia Pacific Breweries is important enough that the Dutch firm has increased its initial offer to buy out its joint venture partner Fraser and Neave (F&amp;N), after ThaiBev&apos;s billionaire owner, Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, made a counter bid. Heineken and F&amp;N formed a partnership in 1931 and jointly control a majority stake in Singapore-based Asia Pacific. The\u00a0Dutch brewer wants to buy out F&amp;N&apos;s\u00a040% stake to increase its far east business interests and eventually take full control of the company. It currently has a 42% stake. An offer of S$53 (\u00a326) a share has been approved by F&amp;N&apos;s board and will be put to shareholders. However, 40% of those shareholders are rivals ThaiBev and Kirin, with the latter already trying to derail the bid by offering S$55 a share, causing Heineken to increase its initial S$50 a share bid. ThaiBev \u2013 maker of Chang beer \u2013 knows how important the deal is for Heineken, which needs the new markets to reduce its reliance on a poor-performing European region. Analyst John Mullane, from Dolmen Stockbrokers, explained: &quot;This deal is a positive development for Heineken because they have been overexposed in a weak European market, and behind the curve in exploiting growth opportunities in emerging markets. &quot;The fact they are willing to pay such a high premium shows how keen they are to expand in these markets and how important it is for them.&quot; Alcoholic drinks analyst at Euromonitor International, Zsuzsa Szilagyi, agreed. She said: &quot;There are very few targets left to acquire, which is why it is very important for Heineken, because it doesn&apos;t have its own presence in the region. &quot;The leading players are building their presence very smartly. There is sluggish growth in mature markets at the moment, so companies have to find growth prospects elsewhere.&quot; Despite their fast-growing appetite for beer, Chinese and African drinkers do have some catching up to do if they are to drink their European counterparts under the table. Admittedly, the Chinese do have some catching up to do if they are to be anywhere near the same league for drinking compared to their European counterparts. In terms of consumption per person, nine of the top 10 nations are in Europe \u2013 and the 10th is Australia. Topping the list is the Czech Republic, where an unnerving 244 pints are drunk each year on average by individuals. Ireland comes second with 195, followed by Germany with 186 pints. But drinking habits in Europe are changing. John Mullane from Dolmen said: &quot;Consumers are becoming more discerning and want higher quality and craft beers. Big breweries are recognising this and are likely to be looking at craft beers for expansion.&quot; In the US, sales of craft beers brewed usually by independent breweries on very small scales, have had double digit percentage increases, with Europe catching up. James Watt, co-founder of the Scottish craft beer firm BrewDog, said companies such as his are tapping into an area that drinkers feel has been missing. He said: &quot;I think there has been a lack of choice in the UK for the last 30 to 40 years from industrial beers from monolithic brewers and we&apos;re trying to fill that gap. &quot;There has been an explosion in craft beers in the US and I think that will happen over here. People want to know how their beer is made and what&apos;s gone into it.&quot; But Watt is clear that Aberdeenshire-based BrewDog, which was started in 2007 and now has more than 60 employees and a turnover of \u00a312m, is not for sale. &quot;I&apos;d sooner shoot myself in the head than sell to the big breweries. It would be like the Clash selling out to the Spice Girls.&quot; However, it won&apos;t stop the likes of Heineken, SABMiller and AB InBev continuing to reshape the beer-brewing landscape and with combined revenues of nearly \u00a350bn a year don&apos;t expect them to stop spending any time soon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/03/hillary-clinton-visit-south-east-asia-china", "sentences": ["But the US secretary of state&apos;s arrival in Jakarta was overshadowed by claims that the Obama administration is ignoring worsening political and human rights abuses in its haste to lock Indonesia and states such as Malaysia and Singapore into its 21st century Asia-Pacific strategic vision in which China is strong but constrained.", "The US has formal defence arrangements with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and Australia, and close security partnerships with Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-03T16:25:00Z", "title": "Hillary Clinton won't unite south-east Asia against China", "tags": ["Asia Pacific", "US foreign policy", "China", "World news", "Hillary Clinton"], "article": "Faltering US efforts to forge a united front with less powerful Asian countries in the face of an increasingly assertive China have resumed in earnest today with Hillary Clinton&apos;s visit to Indonesia, a leading light of the 10-member Association of South-East Asian nations (Asean) and the world&apos;s most populous majority Muslim country. But the US secretary of state&apos;s arrival in Jakarta was overshadowed by claims that the Obama administration is ignoring worsening political and human rights abuses in its haste to lock Indonesia and states such as Malaysia and Singapore into its 21st century Asia-Pacific strategic vision in which China is strong but constrained. In Washington&apos;s favoured scenario, China becomes a sort of Gulliver-style giant held down and tied in place by feisty multitudes of tiny Lilliputians. What the state department may have forgotten is that, in Jonathan Swift&apos;s tale, Gulliver and his undersized captors reach an uneasy accommodation, then fall out violently. To the US dismay, the last Asean summit, held in Phnom Penh in July, ended in unprecedented confusion after member governments failed to agree a final communique. The Philippines and Vietnam, US allies, wanted to insert a reference to China&apos;s attempts to assert ownership over disputed, possibly oil-rich island territories in the South China Sea. But others were less ready to beard the Beijing behemoth. Cambodia, which hosted the meeting and is heavily dependent on Chinese aid and investment, blocked the proposed text. Now attention is switching to the next Asean summit in Phnom Penh in November. During a meeting in the Cook Islands on Friday with leaders of South Pacific island nations, Clinton pledged to continue helping to maintain security in the region and to protect the flow of maritime commerce. She also called on China to &quot;act in a fair and transparent way&quot; in the Pacific, the Wall Street Journal reported. &quot;We want them to play a positive role in navigation and maritime security issues,&quot; she said. &quot;We want to see them contribute to sustainable development for the people of the Pacific, to protect the precious environment, including the ocean, and to pursue economic activity that will benefit the people.&quot; Some progress has been made on an agreement between Asean and China on a &quot;code of conduct&quot; for managing territorial disputes before they become flashpoints. But Beijing continues to want to deal with such issues bilaterally, while the US believes the Asean countries will be more able to stand up for themselves if they act collectively in multilateral forums. &quot;The most important thing is that we end up in a diplomatic process where these issues are addressed in a strong diplomatic conversation between a unified Asean and China rather than through any kind of coercion,&quot; a senior Clinton official said. US involvement (many in China prefer to call it meddling) has deepened since Barack Obama decided last year to switch attention and resources to the Asia-Pacific region as American commitments in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Europe ebbed. In controversial remarks in Vietnam two years ago, Clinton said freedom of navigation in the South China Sea was a US &quot;national interest&quot;. Clinton has made numerous visits to the region since then. Later this week she will travel to Beijing to raise her concerns directly with China&apos;s leaders. She will also visit Brunei, another Asean member. The US has formal defence arrangements with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and Australia, and close security partnerships with Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia. The latter is valued as a Muslim, pro-western business partner and an important counter-terrorism ally. Obama also announced new deployments and facilities in the Philippines and Australia. The other main areas of potential confrontation with China are the East China Sea, where Japan is embroiled in long-running disputes, and Taiwan. Regardless of American assurances, growing fears about China&apos;s long-term intentions are producing tangible changes. &quot;Military budgets are growing rapidly. China&apos;s defence budget will nearly double in three years, south-east Asian countries increased defence spending by an average of 13.5% in 2011, and Asia&apos;s overall military spending will likely outstrip Europe&apos;s for the first time this year,&quot; said Rowan Callick in an article in Foreign Policy entitled Powder Keg in the Pacific. The focus on security is in danger of obscuring other issues. Human Rights Watch said Indonesian authorities had failed adequately to address increasing incidents of mob violence by militant Islamist groups in Java and Sumatra against religious minorities, including the Ahmadiyah, Christians, and Shia Muslims. &quot;Secretary Clinton should press the Indonesian government to take concrete steps to address rising religious intolerance. Indonesia needs to recognise that oppressive laws and policies against religious minorities fuel violence and discrimination,&quot; Human Rights Watch said. Clinton should also quiz her hosts about the detention of nearly 100 political prisoners, HRW suggested. It highlighted the cases of a former Papuan civil servant, Filep Karma, serving a 15-year prison term in Abepura prison, and a Moluccan farmer, Ruben Saiya, serving a 20-year prison term in Nusa Kambangan Island prison."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/04/sophie-christiansen-britain-paralympic-2012-gold", "sentences": ["Her score of 84.750 was clear of Singapore&apos;s Laurentia Tan who was second on 79.000, with Ireland&apos;s Helen Kearney winning bronze with a score of 78.450."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-04T21:53:02Z", "title": "Paralympics 2012: Britain's Sophie Christiansen wins third gold medal", "tags": ["Paralympics 2012: equestrian", "ParalympicsGB medals", "ParalympicsGB", "Paralympics 2012", "Sport", "Equestrianism", "Paralympics", "Disability sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "     For those spectators not completely au fait with the intricacies of dressage, clarity has come via the scoreboard. In every event, across six days of competition, a GBR symbol has seemed permanently superglued on the medal positions. Another gold and two silvers came on the final day, taking Britain&apos;s final medal tally in the equestrian events to 11 at these Games, the country&apos;s most successful ever haul in the Paralympics. And, wholly appropriately, the last gold was won by Sophie Christiansen, who guided and cajoled her horse Janeiro\u00a06 to a third gold medal at London 2012. Allow that to sink in: a third gold medal, a feat no one else in the ParalympicsGB team has yet managed at these Games. But Christiansen, a 24-year-old from Maidenhead, is a very special athlete. She not only won, she dominated. She rode Janeiro\u00a06 three times during the Games, and on each occasion scored more than 80. To put that into context, anything over 70 is good and a score around 75 excellent. And consistently in the 80s? Well, that&apos;s up there in the stratosphere, with the gods and the clouds. Christiansen, who has cerebral palsy after being born two months premature, also proved an exquisite judge of the crowd&apos;s mood. Her music freestyle routine included Land of Hope and Glory, Big Ben&apos;s chimes and a quotation from Shakespeare&apos;s Richard II. The union flags that fluttered afterwards were the perfect accompaniment. This was Last Night of The Proms transported a few miles east to Greenwich Park. Her score of 84.750 was clear of Singapore&apos;s Laurentia Tan who was second on 79.000, with Ireland&apos;s Helen Kearney winning bronze with a score of 78.450. Afterwards they shouted &apos;we love you Sophie&apos;. The feeling was clearly mutual. &quot;I was always going to enjoy that and that was key,&quot; said Christiansen. &quot;Sometimes I get a bit carried away because I do love it so much, so I kind of played it a little safer to stay relaxed and keep the horses&apos; rhythm going, and it paid off. I knew I could potentially win three gold medals but I wanted to keep that quiet and then let the results speak for themselves.&quot; They certainly have. Christiansen, who won a bronze medal as a 16-year-old in Athens in 2004 and two golds and a silver in Beijing in 2008, now has five gold medals. She counts Tanni Grey-Thompson, who has 11 Paralympic golds, and her team-mate Lee Pearson, who has 10, among her heroes. At the rate she is going, she will be chase both their tallies down sometime in the next decade. But Christiansen was not the only hero on a giddy day in Greenwich. Sophie Wells and Deb Criddle both secured silver as Britain finished with 11 individual medals \u2013 five gold, five silver and a bronze. The five-strong squad also won a medal in all sections across five grades \u2013 individual and freestyle \u2013 in addition to collecting a fifth successive Paralympic team title, a sequence that started at Atlanta 16 years ago. Wells, who won her second silver medal of the Paralympic Games after producing a personal best score of 81.150 in the Grade IV freestyle, was pragmatic after finishing behind Belgium&apos;s Michele George who pipped her with a PB of 82.100. &quot;I had to take some risks today to have a chance,&quot; she said. &quot;Some of the risks paid off, some of them maybe didn&apos;t, but I am absolutely thrilled with my horse. He has coped like a star with the atmosphere. &quot;You win some, you lose some. You have got to come back fighting, and I loved it in that arena. It has been an absolute dream to compete here.&quot; Meanwhile Criddle, who was competing in her fourth Games, won silver in the grade III freestyle with a score of 78.550 behind Germany&apos;s Hannelore Brenner, who scored 81.700, summed up the mood of the British squad. &quot;This has been the best Games I&apos;ve ever done,&quot; she said. &quot;I am so honoured to have been here \u2013 words cannot describe the feeling \u2013 and we will never forget these Games. Being part of ParalympicsGB has been inspirational. To have medalled in all grades this time with our five riders is fantastic.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/05/uk-competitive-country-world-economic-forum", "sentences": ["Singapore, currently the country of choice for bankers fleeing the City for a lower-tax regime, comes in second."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-05T06:37:25Z", "title": "UK ranked as 8th most competitive country in world", "tags": ["Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "World news"], "article": "George Osborne may have been booed by the crowd at the Paralympics on Monday night, but Britain&apos;s economic performance has received a rare accolade from the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, which says the UK is now the eighth most competitive country in the world. The WEF \u2013 organiser of the annual Davos gathering of business and movers and shakers \u2013 says the UK has moved up from 10th position in its global competitiveness league table, to eighth over the past 12 months, and is now &quot;settling firmly back in the top 10&quot;. However, the WEF points out that the UK&apos;s &quot;macroeconomic environment&quot; \u2013 the general health of the economy \u2013 remains weak, with the country ranking 110th in the world, down from 85th in 2011. Economic growth in the UK has been negative for three successive quarters, according to the latest official statistics, and although Olympics-related spending is expected to have boosted output in the third quarter of the year, business groups including the CBI are now predicting growth in 2012 as a whole will be negative. In its annual Global Competitiveness Report, the WEF scores each country according to 12 &quot;pillars of competitiveness&quot;, from the state of its infrastructure to the effectiveness of its health and education systems. The UK&apos;s flexible labour market \u2013 making it easier for firms to hire and fire workers \u2013 is singled out as a strength by the WEF, which says &quot;the country improves its performance in several areas, benefiting from clear strengths such as the efficiency of its labour market, in sharp contrast to the rigidity of those of many other countries&quot;.      The Treasury welcomed the WEF assessment: &quot;The UK is becoming more competitive thanks to this government&apos;s reforms \u2013 creating a more flexible and educated workforce; simplifying our tax system, and reducing the main rate of corporation tax as well as and scrapping burdensome regulation and simplifying planning rules.&quot; Switzerland, the WEF&apos;s home country, comes top of its Global Competitiveness Index, praised for its sophisticated scientific research; high-quality training for workers; and stable political institutions. Singapore, currently the country of choice for bankers fleeing the City for a lower-tax regime, comes in second. Finland is third. The schism within the crisis-hit eurozone is also laid bare by the WEF&apos;s analysis, which ranks Germany as the world&apos;s sixth most competitive country, and France at number 21, while bailed-out Greece comes 96th, down six places from last year, and far behind Cambodia (85) or Kazakhstan (51). The WEF&apos;s economists argue that the lack of competitiveness in southern European countries, including Greece, but also Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy, has been at the heart of the sovereign debt crisis. It calls for &quot;a holistic set of competitiveness-enhancing measures&quot;, including &quot;introducing labour market reforms, fostering competition, and making more and better investments in growth-enhancing areas such as education, technology and innovation&quot;. Among the major emerging economies, China scores best, at 29th, while India is 59th, and Russia, where the Putin regime has been tightening its grip on the levers of economic power in recent months, 67th, down one place from last year. However, the WEF expresses concern about the business climate in China, where it argues that &quot;insufficient domestic and foreign competition is of particular concern, as the various barriers to entry appear to be more prevalent and more important than in previous years&quot;.

The Central American nation hopes the plan for model development zones, which will have their own laws, tax system, judiciary and police, will emulate the economic success of city states such as Singapore and Hong Kong. But even as the government signed a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; with a group of international investors on Tuesday, opponents tried to lodge a suit at the supreme court for the arrangement to be declared illegal because the &quot;state within a state&quot; risked undermining national laws, sidestepping labour rights, worsening inequality and creating a modern-day enclave that impinged upon the territory of indigenous groups. The Honduran president, Porfirio Lobo \u2013 a landowner from the rightwing National party \u2013 has given his full backing to the plan, which was inspired by US economic advisers. During the signing ceremony, government officials said the initial $14m phase of the project would start in October and create 5,000 jobs in the first six months and 40 times that number in the future \u2013 a major incentive in a country where one in four of the workforce are unemployed. &quot;This is the most important project in half a century for Honduras,&quot; said Carlos Pineda, head of the Commission for the Promotion of Public-Private Partnerships, which represented the government at the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the business consortium NKG. Details of the arrangement remain sketchy. Three possible locations were mentioned \u2013 Sula valley, Agalta valley and the southern region of Honduras \u2013 and the initial investments seemed small compared to the scale of the ambition. The plan appears to have been thrown together in the space of less than a year, partly to boost the economy and partly to make Honduras more attractive to foreign investors who fear crime (Honduras has the world&apos;s highest murder rate) and political instability (Lobo was elected following a coup d&apos;etat in 2009). It is the realisation of a proposal for &quot;charter cities&quot; proposed by the US economist Paul Romer, a graduate of the University of Chicago school of economics, who is currently professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University. Citing Hong Kong as an example, Romer argues that cities based on a &quot;charter&quot; of strong, pro-business laws and institutions are the key to rapid growth, particularly when they can act as international gateways to larger regions such as China. In countries that lack such fundamentals at a state level, he proposes the creation of special zones where they can be established from nothing. Soon after Romer visited Tegucigalpa at the start of the year, the Honduran congress approved an enabling bill for the creation of economic development zones. Lobo has reportedly taken fact-finding delegations to Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai to look at possible models. None of those cities, however, attempted the urbanisation from scratch now being eyed in Honduras. Proponents say this is an advantage because the governance systems and rights can be designed. &quot;It&apos;s easier to create something new that will be healthy and safe than to go and deal with the serious problems that exist across the whole nation,&quot; said Mark Klugman, a government adviser. But the idea has provoked controversy in a country already suffering from one of the worst levels of inequality in the world. Critics say it will allow a foreign elite to set up a low-tax, sympathetically regulated enclave where they can skirt labour standards and environmental rules. &quot;This would violate the rights of every citizen because it means the cession of part of our territory to a city that would have its own police, its own juridical power, and its own tax system,&quot; said Sandra Marybel Sanchez, who joined a group of protesters who tried to lodge an appeal at the supreme court. Ismael Moreno, a correspondent for the leftwing Nicaraguan magazine Envio, compared the charter cities to the banana enclaves, which were run on behalf of a foreign elite. He also spelled out the environmental risks, particularly if one of the development sites is the Sico valley, an area of virgin forest on the Mosquito Coast. &quot;This model city would end up eliminating the last agricultural frontier left to us,&quot; he wrote. Indigenous and ethnic groups also expressed hostility to the move. Miriam Miranda, president of the Fraternal Black Organisation of Honduras, said a project in the Puerto Castilla \u2013 close to one of the three sites \u2013 would threaten the continuity of the Garifuna people and culture. Michael Strong, an NKG executive, insisted, however, that the project would be a driver for poverty elimination. &quot;The main goal of our project is to create the basis for a safe and prosperous future for Hondurans,&quot; he was quoted as saying by local media."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/07/student-visas-foreign-value-education-export", "sentences": ["The next two years will see young writers from Brazil, Singapore, Nigeria and the Philippines arrive in Norwich, newly dubbed a Unesco city of literature."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-07T19:30:00Z", "title": "Britain needs the cultural value these international students bring | Giles Foden", "tags": ["London Metropolitan University", "Education", "Higher education", "Students", "International students", "Politics", "Immigration and asylum", "UK news"], "article": "The fiasco at London Metropolitan is making every university with non-EU students sit up and rub its eyes. While British people of all ethnicities may well be becoming more hawkish on immigration, the proposed clampdown on student visas seems designed to appeal to those whose idea of Britain is not imaginative or comprehensive. Teaching on the master&apos;s in creative writing at the University of East Anglia \u2013 which last year won a Queen&apos;s Anniversary Award for Higher and Further Education \u2013 I have encountered students from China, Sweden, India and North America. The Man Booker fellowship at UEA has twice been awarded to Canadians. The next two years will see young writers from Brazil, Singapore, Nigeria and the Philippines arrive in Norwich, newly dubbed a Unesco city of literature. A third of the 2012-13 intake will be non-EU. The idea that visas might be denied to these applicants, who have competed with around 250 other candidates for 30 places, is as barmy as a bottle of spiders. Many international creative writing students retain British agents and publishers when they go home. Going beyond creative writing, a recent Oxford Economics case-study of Exeter University showed that every 10 international students support six British jobs. Foreign students add cultural value to their British peers, who need an international outlook. As TS Eliot once put it: &quot;Uniformity means the obliteration of culture, and \u2026 self-sufficiency means its death by starvation.&quot; The woman of letters knows this too, no doubt. It&apos;s perilous, this cocksure assumption that the UK higher education sector can hold its own financially without foreign students. We&apos;re in danger of ensnaring our best export \u2013 education \u2013 in the deadly red tape that the prime minister so abhors. Canada recently resolved to double international student numbers. Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France and Japan all distinguish for policy purposes between foreign students and other migrants. Britain needs to follow through and take university-sponsored students out of its net migration target. Even the Home Office&apos;s own analysis indicates that university-sponsored students are no less than 98% visa-compliant, and very likely more. The tiny fraction of fraudulent student visas must be balanced against the huge cost of alienating foreign applications wholesale. And that is happening already. This week, the Times of India reported that Indian students are cancelling applications to UK universities. We just don&apos;t seem welcoming any more, despite Olympic bonhomie. This is squarely the fault of a government bent on tearing itself in two. One part stretches our narrow island into the world, adept and flexible and exploratory, seeking trade and influence; the other is chained to the salt-lick of atavistic localism, batting away global opportunities like a cow&apos;s tail in June. We need to tool our development and diplomacy policies to meet the causes of migration at source, in partnership with the countries where they occur. Declining paying students will empty Treasury pockets much more quickly than useful initiatives abroad (in all likelihood the applied product of British university research anyway). While most academics have come to accept a market economy in education, the very institutions which enable that idea are now under threat. The proposed visa policy could bring universities crashing down, as if they were birds suddenly given wings of lead. Luckily, there are some wise voices on parliament&apos;s business, innovation and skills committee, which published a report on the issue this week. It reveals cross-departmental vellication about the Home Office&apos;s plans: &quot;Despite the view of the Home Office, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills appears to be sympathetic to removing overseas students from the government&apos;s migration figures.&quot; The report&apos;s conclusions come out strongly in favour of recording overseas students in a separate classification and not counting them against the overall limit on net migration. That would be the right decision, recognising the vital importance of the international student to our economy.

I lived in KL, as everyone calls this crazy metropolis, for five years, and it is still like a second home. But this time there is no hanging around, as my wife and I are setting out towards the northern border with Thailand, through the heartland of the Malay peninsula. This part of the country is often overlooked by tourists, who prefer the golden beaches of the east coast or paradise islands such as Tioman or Langkawi. Our final destination will be Penang, an island my Malaysian friends tell me has suddenly become one of south-east Asia&apos;s hottest destinations. KL is the modern face of Malaysia, a skyscraper city of the future, where Blade Runner meets Bollywood. There are few reminders of the complex history of a country that declared independence from Britain only 55 years ago. Driving out of the centre we soon find ourselves lost in a sprawling urban mass as intimidating as Los Angeles, and it is only with a little luck that we reach the busy north-south highway.     Kuala Lumpur station    The road is surrounded on both sides by rolling hills, marked by geometric lines of palm oil and rubber plantations. The scene resembles an Escher drawing, and there is little trace of the dense rainforest that once covered most of Malaysia. After we&apos;ve been going an hour, the landscape changes suddenly and dramatically, with massive limestone outcrops leaping hundreds of craggy feet out of the flat plains. Up on a hill, a giant but rather tatty billboard announces that we have arrived at Ipoh \u2013 City of Millionaires, and our first stop-off. Soon we are sitting in the legendary Sinhalese Bar, the sole Sri Lankan bar in Malaysia, whose decor is unchanged since it opened in 1931. I&apos;m sipping a Tiger beer in an iced glass so cold it almost takes the skin off my fingers, and talking to our guide for the next few days, Hong Law Siak, who runs the local heritage association. &quot;People tend to forget that the modern, developed Malaysia owes its existence to the riches generated by tin and rubber,&quot; Hong says. &quot;And in those days Ipoh was as important as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.&quot; But when the bottom dropped out of the tin market in the 1980s, Ipoh missed out on all the development that so radically altered the face of KL. &quot;So instead of glitzy, high-rise office blocks and space-age shopping malls, Ipoh has remained pretty much unchanged from the pioneer era. The traditional Chinese shop-houses have been left intact, as have grand colonial landmarks like the Anglo-Moorish railway station, known here as the Taj Mahal of Ipoh.&quot; We leave the bar and wander along the street. Hong points out ornate Chinese clan houses, an abandoned photographer&apos;s studio with 1960s black and white prints in the window and a Madras textile shop, where the aged assistants still wear dhotis, scribble sales into a dusty, giant ledger, and an ancient poster on the wall proclaims that their checked sarongs were once Made in British India. We disappear down the narrow Panglima Lane \u2013 known as Concubine Lane when it was lined with gambling and opium dens, brothels and the discreet residences of the many concubines kept by rich Chinese tin tycoons. I&apos;m not surprised when Hong tells me that Ipoh was used as a backdrop for the French film Indochine, starring Catherine Deneuve, about the final days of French colonial rule. Discovering the eclectic cuisine of Malaysia is always one of the most exciting parts of travelling here, and Ipoh is no exception. Hawker stalls around Pasar Besar, the teeming wet market, specialise in kway teow \u2013 wok-fried rice noodles with egg, prawns and juicy cockles \u2013 pork satay, paper-thin poh piah spring rolls stuffed with bean sprouts, and claypot chicken. Indian restaurants offer a dozen different curries around a mountain of rice on a banana leaf. But the best meal we eat here is Malay nasi kandar, a self-service feast of at least 40 dishes, where a plate heaped with delicious okra and bitter gourd, spicy beef rendang, squid and fish curry costs less than two pounds. The next day, Hong turns up in his car to drive us around the surrounding Kinta valley, where there used to be 1,000 tin mines. These are now deep, manmade lakes. Today, virtually none of the mines is still functioning: there is still tin beneath the ground, but extracting it is too expensive.     Assam lakha, hot and sour soup, Penang    The century-old mining town of Papan is certainly no Klondike boom town: most of the shop-houses that line the main street are abandoned or dilapidated. People pass the time playing mah jong or talking tin prices in the Lee Seow Yoon coffee shop. Papan is Hong&apos;s special project: he has lovingly recreated the dispensary where Sybil Kathigasu, known as the Malaysian Florence Nightingale, secretly treated guerrilla partisans during the Japanese occupation in the second world war. The war theme continues down the road at Batu Gajah, whose eerie Anglican cemetery is named God&apos;s Little Acre. Here stand the graves of three British planters whose violent deaths in 1948 sparked the Malayan Emergency \u2013 12 years of fierce fighting between Chinese communists, British forces and, later, the newly independent Malaysian government. The inscriptions are chilling: &quot;died at the hands of terrorists&quot;, &quot;murdered by terrorists&quot;. The mood lightens when Hong unveils his next surprise, a quite amazing ruined castle, straight out of a Somerset Maugham story. I had heard about Kellie&apos;s Castle many years before, but it used to be inaccessible, hidden in the jungle. Now this grandiose folly has become something of a tourist attraction, sitting majestically atop a grassy hillock. William Kellie Smith arrived in Malaya in 1890, aged 20, and after rapidly making a fortune as a planter he decided to build a romantic castle for his wife \u2013 his childhood sweetheart, Agnes. Kellie designed it in ornate Moorish revival style, and planned a rooftop terrace for parties, a basement wine cellar, even a lift to get to the top of the tower. But he died before it was completed. The castle was never inhabited, and after years of abandon it is now overgrown with vegetation and the gnarled roots of towering banyan trees, occupied by monkeys. This being Malaysia, it is apparently also home to numerous ghosts. We finish the day 10 miles south in the town of Tanjung Tualang, whose enterprising inhabitants had the original idea of transforming their mining lakes into farms for freshwater prawns. Every single shophouse here houses a noisy seafood restaurant, drawing busloads of gourmets each weekend. The succulent prawns are enormous, and steamed to perfection in Chinese rice wine, egg white and ginger. This is pricy for Malaysia, though \u2013 a kilo will set diners back \u00a315. Next day we head north from Ipoh, following winding backroads through shady rubber plantations to Kuala Kangsar, which looks at first like a quiet provincial town in a bend on the Perak river. In fact, this is a royal capital, home to the Sultan of Perak, some of the grandest palaces and mosques in Malaysia, and the prestigious Malay College, the nation&apos;s answer to Eton. The Sultan, whose predecessors have ruled Perak since the 1500s, lives in a grand pastel art deco palace, the Istana Iskandariah, but visitors can only get a peek from afar. The far more beguiling Istana Kenangan is a magnificent example of Malay architecture \u2013 all wood, but without a single nail. This is open to the public, because it houses the Royal Museum. But nothing compares to the first view of the Ubudiah mosque, a swirling vision of marble turrets and golden cupolas. It was designed in 1917 by Arthur Benison Hubback, an unsung British government architect whose idiosyncratic Indo-Saracen buildings still stand out in most of Malaysia&apos;s major towns. Walking round its cool arcades I spot a young Malay couple, resplendent in pale blue wedding robes, posing shyly for photos. Malay hospitality is so generous (and foreign visitors to Kuala Kangsar so rare) that they even invite us to the reception. Before reaching Penang, we plan a break in Malaysia&apos;s oldest hill station, one of the cool mountain resorts where you can escape the 30C temperatures and 95% humidity that is the daily climate throughout the year. The road signs may say Bukit Larut, but everyone still uses the colonial name of Maxwell Hill. Most of the hill stations have been modernised, but not Maxwell Hill. The one road up to the 1,250m summit is a rough path with 72 hairpin bends, which only the official government jeep is allowed to tackle. Every hotel development here has ended up closed or abandoned, and although there are a couple of ramshackle bungalows and nature hostels, I have been warned to prepare for minimal facilities. The reward, though, is a solitary paradise for birdwatchers, butterfly enthusiasts and jungle trekkers, with amazing views as far as the Andaman Sea. We are not to be rewarded today, though: usually in Malaysia, everyone&apos;s favourite catchword is boleh \u2013 can do \u2013 but at the jeep office, where a &quot;ticket sold out today&quot; sign foils our plans, and no amount of persuasion, or bribery, can get us a seat. So we head back to the road, and after a couple of hours are sailing over the eight-mile-long Penang bridge, which links the mainland to the island known as the pearl of the orient.     Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, Penang    I must admit I did not really believe all the buzz about Penang, but the moment we arrive at our designer B&amp;B it is obvious that the island&apos;s capital, George Town, is no longer the rundown place I remember. Unesco world heritage status (granted in 2008) has saved historic buildings from the wrecking ball and bulldozer. Instead of making way for high-rise office blocks and shopping centres, the sumptuous Chinese mansions and maze-like shop-houses are being elegantly transformed into boutique hotels, art galleries and boutiques, funky restaurants and bars. And down in the street, there are still the teeming markets, artisan workshops, strange medicinal shops and delicious 24-hour hawker stalls that make George Town one of the last surviving authentic Chinatowns. We&apos;re staying in Cheong Fatt Tze mansion \u2013 known as the Blue Mansion because of its distinctive painted walls \u2013 which was built in the 1880s by a Chinese entrepreneur dubbed the &quot;Rockefeller of the East&quot;. I actually wandered in here years ago when the house was falling apart and inhabited by squatters. Now it is a symbol of George Town&apos;s transformation, restored to its former glory, guestrooms furnished with antiques from mainland China alongside art nouveau treasures over from Europe. Our room, in the old kitchen, has the original hearth and cooker. For an even better glimpse of Penang&apos;s opulent past, there is the nearby Peranakan Museum (pinangperanakanmansion.com.my), a perfectly preserved private mansion filled with treasures.

Paul Romer, an influential professor at New York University, is seen as crucial to the credibility of the plan, which aims to transform enclaves in the Central American nation into magnets for investors similar to Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Singapore. But days after the deal was announced, Romer said he had not been given the powers and information necessary to fulfil his role as chairman of the transparency commission, which is meant to ensure governance of the new development zones. Romer said he and four other international figures were appointed by presidential decree to the commission, which has wide-ranging powers to appoint and fire governors, nominate judges and hire auditors in the proposed new zones. But the five will issue a statement distancing themselves from this week&apos;s announcement and calling into question the legality of their appointment, which they say has not been published in the official gazette as required by Honduran law, ostensibly because of a challenge in the constitutional court. &quot;Thus the conditions have not existed to permit the transparency commission to play the role envisioned for this ambitious and important project,&quot; they write in an open letter to President Porfirio Lobo Sosa, to be released online. &quot;As you continue to work to attract foreign investment ... in this period of uncertainty, we feel it would be wise to release you from any sense of obligation to proceed with publication of the decree and thus with our formal appointment.&quot; Romer said he was surprised to hear the announcement this week that the Honduran government had signed a $14m memorandum of understanding with the business consortium NKG. &quot;We&apos;re not involved in any discussions with anyone involved in this deal. Our statement is an attempt to clarify to the public what our role is. At the moment the commission does not exist, we do not have any information, or means to check or look into any aspect of the negotiation... We cannot serve the guarantor or endorser function the commission was that supposed to provide.&quot;The five commission members said they continued to support the project and were willing to work with the government in the future. But their lack of involvement at this initial state is likely to alarm potential investors. The Honduran administration said the issue was overblown. &quot;This was not a legally binding agreement. It was a memorandum of understanding,&quot; said presidential adviser, Octavio Sanchez. &quot;We want the area to become a successful place so the models that work there can be adopted elsewhere. It&apos;s not an isolated island of success. It is an inspiration for others to follow. It is a showcase.&quot; Government officials said earlier this week that the project was the most important in Honduras for 50 years and would start in October. However, Sanchez said that everything must await a ruling by the Supreme Court, which could take anything from a week to 10 years. Romer&apos;s plans to build &quot;charter cities&quot; \u2013 which are envisaged as ideal locations for wealth creation \u2013 have long been controversial. Critics fear they may become states-within-states for a privileged elite, worsening inequality and bypassing labour and environmental laws. But Honduras&apos; new plan may go a step further, due to the influence of radical libertarians who are now talking of creating &quot;private cities&quot;. Romer appeared unsure what direction the government was taking: &quot;I don&apos;t know what people mean when they refer to private cities. But if it suggests that there will be no institutions or government, then I fear that misses the essential requirement for successful urbanisation. I would be concerned about how a private attempt to provide things like policing services could be held accountable.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/08/reflections-on-golden-summer-sport", "sentences": ["In 2005, children from Newham travelled to Singapore with Tony Blair and Seb Coe to help win the bid."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-08T17:07:30Z", "title": "London 2012: it changed us, and how the world sees us", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Paralympics 2012", "Sir Philip Green", "Paralympics", "Disability sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "THE LEGACY COLIN MOYNIHAN  The promise to deliver a genuine and lasting sports legacy is just as important as the successful hosting of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The extraordinary public enthusiasm and momentum has created an unprecedented opportunity to fulfil that promise beyond all expectations \u2013 if it can be harnessed effectively. But there is no magic bullet. We need a strategic approach that addresses the following five priorities. Physical education has a vital role to play in the school curriculum. The root to encouraging young people to participate in sport lies in the quality of the teaching they receive at the beginning of their school lives. If Ofsted inspected and reported both on curriculum-time physical education and on &quot;out of hours&quot; sport, this would ensure that school leaders treated physical education as a core subject. There should be a central role for sport in policy-making. It would make sense to bring the minister for sport to occupy a central co-ordinating role. Improve coaching. You cannot deliver a gold-medal athlete without a gold-medal coach. We need many, many more coaches at all levels. Stem the flow of local authority closures. There should be a statutory requirement to ensure adequate local government provision of facilities for community sport and recreation, backed by a planning policy to support the retention of playing fields. \u00a0 Restructure delivery mechanisms in government. Empowering governing bodies, clubs, communities, the enthusiasm and willingness of volunteers and families with the lightest of touches from Whitehall is the way forward and the basis for ensuring that today&apos;s national Olympic inspiration is permanently converted to tomorrow&apos;s lasting nationwide participation. Lord Moynihan is outgoing chairman of the British Olympic Association MULTICULTURALISM JACKIE KAY Mo Farah may have changed my opinion of the Union flag: when it was draped round his shoulders I was shocked by how attractive it looked. I noticed the stunning design as if for the first time. It&apos;s not the flag&apos;s fault, the way it has frightened me for years. Well, it seems the tide of the river of blood may be turning. Farah&apos;s got the flag back. That Hurrah Farah photograph will become one of the iconic images of Britishness. In the world of sport, at least, Britain is positively Whitmanesque, confidently asserting: &quot;We are large, we contain multitudes.&quot; Sheffield&apos;s own Jessica Ennis running through the finishing line changed the colour of the finish on what is British. We have much to learn from the world of sport. In that multi-coloured world black is surely beautiful and there is no questioning who belongs. (Which is just as well; imagine the diminishing golds!) Will it reduce the number of innocent black guys who get stopped by the police? Was the sight of Doreen Lawrence bearing the flag into the stadium healing? Will that prevent the racist murders of the future? Dream on. But wouldn&apos;t you like to think so? It seems we have lived through an almost utopian summer. I know, though, that the world of sport is far ahead; how long will it take the rest of society to catch up? Winter comes suddenly and all too quickly the nights draw in.

Art, in turn, has lent sport our love of character and narrative, making it more than a set of results on a board, from Bolt&apos;s awesome heroics to Martine Wright&apos;s journey as 7/7 survivor and Paralympic athlete. In these Games, youth reclaimed its rightful place as a force of creativity and change. No more were the young just the destroyers of shop fronts and challengers to ever-rising house prices. In joy-filled motion in the Olympic stadium the young were reinstated as those who have always made the best records. They then went on to break some too. Art has had its place in defining our Britishness alongside the sport. From the brilliant Twenty Twelve to Boyle&apos;s glorious showmanship, we remembered that we can both love something and mock it. This British peculiarity is something of which we should be proud. It brought us the excellent The Last Leg on Channel 4, finding the comedy in the Paralympics, and allowed Rowan Atkinson to affectionately joke to Vangelis&apos;s music without disrespect. If this creaking, powdered government takes anything from these Games, other than the credit, I hope it is the idea that work is not defined by money and power but by effort and love. Anything built from these things, from sport to art, is the cause and effect of our being. In the Games, as in art, we are not watching something other, but glimpsing our true selves hurling, racing, flying through the air; humanity in motion. Lucy Prebble is a playwright whose works include of The Sugar Syndrome and Enron. Her new play, The Effect, opens in November  HOW TO BUILD SUCCESS WILL HUTTON  For decades, Britain has been starved of success. Instead, it has been a long pattern of underachievement, retreat and decline. The credit booms that defined the Thatcher and Blair years, bringing apparent economic success, felt ephemeral and built on sand. So it proved. The Olympic and Paralympic Games allowed the British to be proud and patriotic again. To be in the top three in both medal league tables is unambiguous success. The excellence of the sporting infrastructure showed that Britain can be a world leader. Failure can be challenged. The lesson is a vast reproach to our dominant centre-right political and media culture, unerringly wrong on almost everything \u2013 whether economics, Europe or the predicted failure of the Games. Public investment, picking and coaching winners and a sense of patriotic purpose combined to deliver an astonishing success. The Olympic Park was built on time, with an eye to its legacy impact and within budget. The spillover effects have been enormous. Money has been carefully channelled to sports organisations to develop their athletes. All the common sense of the last 30 years that Britain cannot pull off grand projects has been challenged. The result has been stunning. Will Hutton is an Observer columnist, economist and author VOLUNTEERING MAURICE GLASMAN  One of the least acknowledged facts about London 2012 is that it was the first living wage Olympics. When it came to the cooks, cleaners, security guards and shop workers, there was 98% compliance throughout the building of the stadiums and then during the Games. This is a tremendous success for London citizens. This was a genuinely ethical Games. The spirit of that spread. Workers were paid properly and honoured in the opening ceremony, which meant that the volunteers were not there to replace workers but to add to the sense of civil virtue. Participating in an event that was ethical, that was based on hospitality, honesty and civility, tempered the threat of corporate domination. Ordinary people were moved to give of their time in helping people with directions, welcoming them. It gave a meaning to the &quot;big society&quot; that the government has been incapable of grasping. Then there was the recognition of excellence. The sight of a craft being improved \u2013 in this case track and field craft \u2013 and of a tradition of excellence that was constantly renewing itself indicates how far we have to go in honouring and developing a sense of vocation in the economy. When negotiating the legacy, it is important to recognise that the vocational college for local people and the commitment to local employment was not honoured. There is also the issue of land and housing and the Community Land Trust for local housing that is yet to be finalised. It was the combination of living wage, civic engagement and craft excellence that gave a real meaning to the patriotism that rightly clings to London and these Games. The important thing is to ensure the institutional legacy in terms of vocation, housing, wages and civic pride are sustained as the enduring meaning of London 2012. Lord Glasman of Stoke Newington is a Labour peer  BRAND BRITAIN GRAHAM HALES  The Olympics certainly helped to brand Britain. The opening ceremony really helped to capture that British eccentricity that is difficult to explain, but is one of the most interesting things about us. Speaking to international business people over the past few weeks, it&apos;s clear that it has changed people&apos;s views. My beef is that Britain has great creative industries and a great financial services sector and they don&apos;t always trust each other, but the opening ceremony showed we&apos;re at our best when we combine left brain and right brain. It has created huge expectations \u2013 it&apos;s as if we grew up a little. The closing ceremony was going really well until the handover to Rio, which just seemed so predictable: it&apos;s as if samba dancing just won&apos;t do it for us any more. Britain still has as many problems as there were before, but it&apos;s as though the grey clouds have parted \u2013 and it&apos;s our job to keep them parted. Graham Hales is UK boss of the global branding agency Interbrand DISABILITY HANNAH COCKROFT I can already see a change in people&apos;s attitudes towards disabled people. We have a young team \u2013 the average age is 20. I hope young people see us and see that they can do something in life, even if they&apos;re disabled. People are starting to accept us for who we are. Which is cool. It&apos;s what the Paralympics is all about. The fact that we&apos;ve filled stadiums every night is the biggest show of acceptance. That&apos;s never been done before. It&apos;s like people went: &quot;You are athletes. You do work hard. We&apos;ll come and watch you.&quot; We&apos;ve stepped out of the Olympics shadow. It&apos;s, like, make the most of it because it&apos;s never going to happen again. There&apos;s never going to be 80,000 \u2013 or 70,000 because not everyone comes to support us \u2013 people just there, supporting us. I hope the Games have inspired a lot more people to join the sport. Hannah Cockroft, a wheelchair sprinter, is a BT ambassador  THE EAST END ROBIN WALES  London 2012 exceeded expectations. It wasn&apos;t just GB&apos;s outstanding medal haul; there was genuine warmth as we welcomed the world. Newham&apos;s volunteers took to the streets to inform and guide the athletes, officials and fans, while our residents, in the most multicultural place in the world for its size, embraced the Games. More than 270,000 people welcomed the Olympic torch and Paralympic flame into Stratford. Every Newham school sent children to experience the Games and more than 1,000 people, including 230 children, took part in the ceremonies. The Games&apos; legacy will be measured against the promises in London&apos;s original bid. First, to inspire a generation. In 2005, children from Newham travelled to Singapore with Tony Blair and Seb Coe to help win the bid. We want future generations to take part in sport. We have ensured massive expansion of local sports clubs and with the University of East London will give every child the chance to try 20 sports to find the perfect fit. Second, to transform the East End. Employment is the key as Newham needs 20,000 more people in work just to match the London average. Workplace, our jobs brokerage service, helped 5,000 people into jobs this year. We&apos;ve made a strong start but against a backdrop of savage government cuts to London&apos;s host boroughs, securing the legacy of London 2012 will remain a challenge for generations. Sir Robin Wales is the Labour mayor of Newham LEADERSHIP PHILIP GREEN  You have to say &quot;bravo&quot; to all those who delivered this great experience. And there are lessons to be learned from the Olympics, not least the advantages of a positive attitude and getting the right people in place doing the right job. Starting with the opening ceremony, Danny Boyle and his team showed what can be achieved when creative people who know their audience put on a great show. Similarly with Lord Coe and his team. Coe was someone who had competed himself. He knew what athletes needed and he gave it to them with an acute sense of detail. But first we really need to step back and scrutinise exactly how all the buildings were put up, visitors accommodated and thousands of media people dealt with. You need to study all the planning, how people on the ground were selected, what size of teams were used and how they worked with each other. It is hard to say which industries could immediately benefit from a fresh approach but clearly one is tourism. We need to remove the queuing at the airport and give visitors the kind of warm welcome given by the Olympic volunteers. Happy tourists might be likely to go shopping too. But if there is a lesson for UK plc, it&apos;s that you need people in top positions who wake up in the morning and love what they do. We need that positive attitude and to be excited about the future. Sir Philip Green is owner of Topshop and Bhs &apos;CAN-DO&apos; SPIRIT SAM RODDICK  Before it started I was a Debbie Downer about the whole thing. I even wanted to leave the country. This was until my friend, who was volunteering, invited me to the technical rehearsal for the opening ceremony and I was blown away. Danny Boyle touched on the issues that make England a truly great country, such as the NHS, CND and the suffragettes, and I was overwhelmed when he even celebrated homosexuality with a lesbian kiss. I was proud to be British for the first time in my life and I think this will have a lasting effect. Shockingly, I also became a royalist; I believe the ceremony did more for the royal family than the jubilee. I have an active dislike for sport but the Paralympics has changed that. It is inspirational. Above all, I found the volunteers around London so moving, they were always kind and enthusiastic. They gave us an insight into how England rose to the occasion and this strong sense of generosity provided an opportunity to see that part of who we are. From an emotional perspective, it has done a lot for London.

A deal to build Europe&apos;s biggest gambling mecca has been struck between Adelson and the regional government of Madrid, bringing with it the promise of tens of thousands of construction jobs. The Spanish capital beat its arch-rival Barcelona in the battle to win the controversial EuroVegas gambling project. Adelson, the Las Vegas Sands chairman and chief executive, said in a statement released in Las Vegas late on Friday: &quot;The regional government of Madrid has been a strong advocate for this potential development, and we are appreciative of the energy they have brought to this process. &quot;Barcelona is an outstanding tourism destination, and choosing Madrid over Barcelona was not an easy selection.&quot; However, he announced that Las Vegas Sands was only willing to finance 35% of the multibillion-euro resort, and that it would demand certain changes in local planning laws. Adelson, rated America&apos;s eighth richest person with a net worth of $24.9bn (\u00a315.6bn) by Forbes magazine, visited both Madrid and Barcelona in recent months as negotiations over where to locate the gambling resort progressed. The project is expected to be half the size of the famous Las Vegas strip, the four-mile stretch of megacasinos in Nevada. It is also expected to be split into a dozen sectors, built one by one, eventually offering some 36,000 hotel beds, although Adelson held back from confirming details of the project on Friday. Adelson is hoping to attract visitors from around Europe and areas of the former Soviet Union. Gambling would reportedly account for one-third of income. While the deal may bring jobs to a country suffering 25% unemployment, it has provoked outrage among an unlikely coalition of opponents, including local Catholic bishops and the indignado protest movement. Local bishops have warned that the complex will bring gambling addiction, bankruptcies and suicides. Indignado protesters have pointed to reports of investigations by US authorities into allegations of corruption, dealings with Chinese mafia members and failure to report potential money-launderers. Neither Las Vegas Sands nor Adelson have been formally accused of any of those things, and the company insists it helps investigators with inquiries. Adelson is one of the chief financial backers of the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. His casino empire stretches to Singapore and Macao, where sales are 13% of local GDP. It runs several Las Vegas casinos, but 90% of profits come from Asia. Madrid&apos;s regional president, Esperanza Aguirre, from the liberal wing of the centre-right People&apos;s party (PP), has promised to introduce whatever law changes are needed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/10/mclaren-lewis-hamilton-build-bridges", "sentences": ["As for Hamilton, he didn&apos;t want to add the speculation and instead was anxious to concentrate on the next race in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-10T21:59:01Z", "title": "McLaren hoping to build bridges and persuade Lewis Hamilton to stay", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Formula One 2012"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton left Monza following the Italian Grand Prix with a number of his McLaren team convinced he will walk away and join Mercedes next season. Hamilton has upset some of his team with his increasingly idiosyncratic behaviour in recent weeks, in particular his decision to tweet confidential McLaren data before the Belgian Grand Prix \u2013 a race that was won by Jenson Button with Hamilton crashing out on the first corner. The race in Spa was sandwiched between Hungary and Italy, both of which Hamilton won and it is those victories that the McLaren team are hoping will help persuade their prize asset to stay. If he does remain the relationship will never be quite the same, because his behaviour has angered a number of people. He has badly scorched \u2013 if not burned \u2013 his bridges at McLaren, where team-mate Button&apos;s easy-going style has made him the more popular driver with engineers and mechanics. The body language between Hamilton and his employers was muted on Sunday evening despite a weekend which had shown him at his scintillating best. Neither were the noises coming from the executive chairman, Ron Dennis, and the team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, conducive to bending over backwards to accommodate the demands of the driver&apos;s agents, XIX Entertainment. So one of the most remarkable relationships in Formula One, which started with Dennis taking Hamilton under his Woking wing when he was 13, is in danger of breaking up, although Whitmarsh sounded hopeful of a deal when he said yesterday: &quot;My feeling is that this is a great team for Lewis to stay in. He has got to want to stay here, and we will figure that one out when we&apos;ve had some celebrations. &quot;I think we are working together well. We are a winning team, he is a winning driver and we are great together. There is a lot of sense in us working together. We have a finite amount of time and I haven&apos;t, I hope, wasted any of that on matters other than on working together, having a quick car, winning races and winning championships.&quot;But Whitmarsh&apos;s earlier dismissal of the Hamilton-to-Mercedes story as nothing more than &quot;a fantasy&quot; and media speculation look a bit short of the mark this morning. McLaren appear to have been caught on the hop. As for Hamilton, he didn&apos;t want to add the speculation and instead was anxious to concentrate on the next race in Singapore. &apos;We&apos;ve obviously had a certain package the last two races which has been very strong,&quot; he said. &quot;We were good in Hungary but so was the Lotus. I anticipate it&apos;s going to be a tough battle. Ferrari may bring a package ahead of ours and we may bring a stronger one at the next race. We always target consistency. Commenting on the championship table, where Kimi Raikkonen is only a point behind him in third place despite having not won a race this season, Hamilton added: &quot;That&apos;s incredible. So he got 10 points today. I consider everyone in the top five or six a major title threat. He could have won maybe in Hungary if he had a quicker pit stop. &quot;It&apos;s the closest we have been since 2008. Because we&apos;ve finally got a car in which we can challenge and compete. We didn&apos;t have that in some other years.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s possible replacements Heikki Kovalainen is the surprise name on McLaren&apos;s short-list if they have to look for a replacement for Lewis Hamilton. Kovalainen, 30, drives for Caterham and hasn&apos;t scored a point in his three seasons with the team. But he drove for McLaren in 2008 and 2009, where he immediately impressed with his pace. Very experienced. Paul di Resta, 26, is the only British driver in the paddock outside McLaren and, ideally, they would like another Brit. He recently signed for Jenson Button&apos;s agents, Sports Partnership. Button said yesterday: &quot;We train a lot together, cycling in the south of France together. I think he is very, very talented and he has got his head screwed on.&quot; Destined to join a leading team. Kimi Raikkonen, 32, is another former McLaren driver, between 2002-6, and is thrillingly fast. He is just one point behind Hamilton in the championship table, even though he has not won a race, and Lotus will want him to stay. Valtteri Bottas, 23, is a test driver with Williams but has caused an impression and would be an outside bet."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/11/world-university-rankings-2012-analysis", "sentences": ["Hong Kong University, the National University of Singapore and the University of Tokyo all appear in the top 30."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-11T10:05:33Z", "title": "World university rankings \u2013 analysis", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "Management and administration", "Student experience", "Research", "Higher education", "MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Harvard University", "University of Cambridge", "UCL (University College London)", "University of Oxford", "Imperial College London", "Education"], "article": "The UK has four of the top six universities in the latest edition of the QS World University Rankings, but the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has taken over from Cambridge in first place. Cambridge has dropped to second place after two years heading the rankings, but remains ahead of Harvard, the only other university to have led the table in its nine years of publication. The other UK universities in the top six are University College London, Oxford and Imperial College London. Perhaps the biggest revelation in the rankings, however, concerns the increasingly international character of the leading universities. Despite consistent growth in the number of international students over the past decade, the new rankings show the top 100 universities raising recruitment by almost 10% in a single year. The figures suggest that students looking for an overseas education are becoming more choosy about where they go. And they confirm growing competition for international students \u2013 and reliance on their fees - in leading universities all over the world, not just in the traditional host countries. Even some universities in the top 100, like Cambridge, that have registered modest increases in overseas student numbers, have been overtaken on this measure. The top 500 universities in the QS rankings have added no fewer than 120,000 international students in the latest edition. The figures demonstrate why universities of all types were so concerned at the UK government&apos;s tightening of visa regulations, culminating in the suspension of London Metropolitan University&apos;s licence to sponsor students from outside the EU. University College London, which has overtaken Oxford to move into fourth place, has almost 10,000 international students. It is growth in international faculty that accounts for MIT&apos;s move to the top of the rankings for the first time, however. The university has overtaken both Cambridge and neighbouring Harvard to take first place, having led 11 of the 29 subject rankings published by QS in June. MIT is one of a number of universities specialising in science and technology to improve their positions this year. Nine of the top ten technological universities have moved further up the rankings, with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology enjoying the biggest rise in the top 100. Scores in the QS rankings comprise an equal balance of expert opinion and data on staffing levels, research citations and international students and faculty. More than 46,000 academics and 25,000 employers have contributed their views in the most extensive polling ever undertaken on global universities. American universities dominate the QS rankings, as they have every year since they were first published in 2004. US institutions occupy six of the top ten places, 13 of the top 20 and 31 of the top 100 \u2013 the same numbers as last year. Harvard, in third place, remains the favourite of both academics and employers. It also tops four of the five broad faculty rankings published with the institutional ranking. The UK is again the next most successful country, although it has lost one university from the top 20, one from the top 100 and one from the top 200. Its four universities in the top ten and 18 in the top 100 show a system continuing to punch well above its weight. The strong performance of UK universities will surprise some observers but, with research funding protected in cash terms and revenue from international students rising, the leading institutions have not experienced the level of cuts suffered by some of their competitors. Even the wealthy US Ivy League institutions have reined back spending as they tried to repair the damage done to their endowments during the recession. Academics and employers continue to rate UK universities highly and the leading institutions have begun to make significant progress on the key measure of research quality \u2013 the number of citations per academic. All but three of the top 20 UK universities achieved higher citation rates than last year, although they still have ground to make up on their American counterparts. The results will give little encouragement to those predicting a wave of UK student emigration to the universities of Continental Europe, where fees are much lower than in England. The nine leading French universities have all dropped down the ranking, while there are no German or Dutch universities in the top 50. ETH Zurich is by far the highest-placed Continental university, at 13th. Canada has two universities in the top 20 for the first time, with Toronto joining Montreal&apos;s McGill University among the elite. But Australia again has more universities in the top 100 than any country outside the US and UK. Asian universities continue to make progress up the rankings and to attract more international students, rather than simply being the favoured recruiting ground of Western institutions. Hong Kong University, the National University of Singapore and the University of Tokyo all appear in the top 30. A record 72 countries are represented among the 700 universities that will feature in the full ranking. The six leading universities in the Middle East have all improved their positions and there has been a big increase in the number of Latin American universities ranked globally. Overall, the institutional ranking is more stable than it has ever been.

His opinions will be familiar and respected. His books will grace their shelves. They will, though, be a bit surprised to learn that after years of trying to persuade London politicians to make bold but sane changes to they way people get around the capital he is now seeking office himself as Labour&apos;s mayoral candidate for 2016. Why? Wolmar writes:  At the last two mayoral elections, neither Boris [Johnson] nor Ken [Livingstone] set out anything that could remotely approximate to a vision. Both their manifestos were a ragbag of vague ideas designed to appease various interest groups rather than an attempt to set out what a 21st century city should look like. The 2008 hustings focussed on whether bendy buses were suitable for London streets, while this year the main source of debate was over fares \u2013 an important issue but not one that should have dominated the debate.  True enough. He continues:  Let&apos;s instead begin to look at what is wrong with central London. There is no doubt that London is a very successful city, but it could do so much better. By introducing the congestion charge, Ken Livingstone started what should have been a coherent process of gradually shifting the focus away from a policy that had the needs of motorists at the heart of transport policy towards a recognition that there was a need to restrict the movement of cars. He also greatly improved bus services and supported investment in the Tube and London Overground. Trafalgar Square was part pedestrianised but then Livingstone somewhat lost his nerve and failed to press home the advantage he gained from these changes.  Right again. And Mayor Johnson?  Boris, on the other hand, has been a muddle. He proclaims his support for cyclists but actually in many respects has made life more difficult for them by insisting that nothing should be done that might affect the &quot;smooth flow of traffic.&quot; The bike hire scheme is a nice innovation and is a useful way of introducing people to the joys of cycling but it is not a substitute for the type of provision for cyclists seen in many European cities. For all Boris&apos;s supposed pro-cycling policies, very little will change over the next four years to attract more of them or to make existing ones safer. His cycle superhighways are a dangerous mirage, encouraging cyclists on to main roads while doing nothing to protect them.  Not only a muddle but a regressive one, putting pals, private interests and self-publicity before the economic and environmental needs of the metropolis. By contrast, Wolmar&apos;s transport vision for London is of a city that functions more cleanly, enjoyably and efficiently.  A core priority would be, as Wolmar puts it, &quot;weaning the city off its addiction to the car,&quot; which would mean setting targets to reduce the number of vehicles coming into central London and developing a more sophisticated congestion charging system. &quot;Singapore started off with something very basic like ours,&quot; he says, &quot;but it has evolved using newer technology.&quot; In an article on his campaign website, originally written for the Times, he argues for a far more radical approach to cycling provision:  Doing everything from creating a high-class set of priority lanes for cyclists to making the roads safe enough for children and their parents to cycle to school. The idea is not necessarily to get a few more cyclists on the road tomorrow but, rather, to ensure that there is such a radical step change in the provision of both education and facilities that London will never be the same again. Only when we see old ladies cycling on London&apos;s streets, as they do in Copenhagen or Amsterdam, will we know that we have succeeded.  He argues that once a target is set for reducing the numbers of cars, &quot;every others policy will flow: pedestrianisation schemes, bus priority, 20 mph zones, and one-hour tickets for bus users (an idea the London Assembly Liberal Democrats have long argued for) among them. Wolmar will be an outsider to secure Labour&apos;s nomination, but he assures me that is is deadly serious. A long-time party member (in case you were wondering), he&apos;s been taking soundings and preparing his candidacy since despairing at the poverty of debate during this year&apos;s mayoral contest. He says he has two objectives: one is to win the contest to become Labour&apos;s candidate, the other is to get his ideas discussed and absorbed into the mainstream where they belong. The Olympic and Paralympic period has shown that people living and working in London can use public transport differently and that road space can be rationed without the sky falling in - essentially the points made in a different way by Transport for London commissioner Peter Hendy to the London Assembly&apos;s transport committee on Tuesday. London 2012 has provided a glimpse of an achievable brighter future for the capital&apos;s transport networks, and few are better equipped than Christian Wolmar to build on and articulate that hopeful theme."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/sep/13/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["The good news: the UK ones work in Germany, Australia, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-13T05:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: infected PCs, LTE compared, Windows 8's browser choice, Zuck's typing and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrencies"], "article": "A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team EU to banks: assume all PCs are infected &gt;&gt; Krebs on Security  An agency of the European Union created to improve network and data security is offering some blunt, timely and refreshing advice for financial institutions as they try to secure the online banking channel: &quot;Assume all PCs are infected.&quot;   From a few weeks ago, but very relevant. iPhone 5 - View countries with supported LTE networks &gt;&gt; Apple Worth noticing: different models exist and will work with different networks (or not) in different countries.

It includes the letter, which is extremely long. He may have written it on the phone, but we suspect it was edited on a larger screen. But it points to a key trend: smartphones can be content creation devices for more than trivially short content. (Did he dictate it, we wonder? That would be really interesting.) Key disclosure laws can be used to confiscate Bitcoin assets &gt;&gt; Forbes  Key disclosure laws may become the most important government tool in asset seizures and the war on money laundering.

One was &quot;inertial scrolling&quot;--when you flick at a list of items on the screen, the list moves as a function of how fast you swipe, and then it comes to rest slowly, as if being affected by real-world inertia. Another was the &quot;rubber-band effect,&quot; which causes a list to bounce against the edge of the screen when there were no more items to display.

One of the joys of this role is that no two days are the same. Although I am based in London, I may be in our offices in Leeds or Edinburgh or meeting members in other countries. MPS is a mutual membership organisation, providing advice, assistance and professional indemnity to more than 270,000 doctors, dentists and health professionals around the world, including the UK, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand, the Caribbean, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. My role includes ensuring that members are supported with the legal and ethical problems that arise from their professional practice including clinical negligence claims, complaints, disciplinary processes and inquests. A key part of MPS&apos;s work is informing and influencing the statutory and regulatory framework in which clinicians practise. Responding to consultation documents and meeting with departments of health, colleges and medical councils in all countries in which we offer membership ensures that we maintain a dialogue with decision makers. We find that our international experience is helpful to the development of public policy for the benefit of members and their patients. These meetings are generally scheduled well in advance, but the day is punctuated by current issues. These can be as diverse as whether we should defend a particular clinical negligence case to trial, the pros and cons of a legal challenge in a disciplinary procedure or the expectations on a doctor when faced with a patient&apos;s request for a report in order to seek assisted suicide. This latter aspect was one which caused significant concern to GP members and is an example of where we are able to provide guidance to members when faced with such ethical dilemmas. Our team of about fifty doctors are specialists in legal medicine and take nearly 20,000 telephone calls for advice every year. One of the most enjoyable parts of my job is speaking with groups of doctors across the world, through our educational programmes. Although there are differences from country to country, many of the medicolegal issues are universal. I often see a doctor experience that &apos;light bulb moment&apos; during a presentation or workshop and I know that the training will make a difference to how they provide care. At these events I am often asked how I became involved in this area of medicine. For me it was as a result of an interest in medical law and forensics during my time in GP and hospital medicine. MPS recruits regularly and we look for doctors with a sound clinical background who want to combine that with legal training and qualifications. Education, not just in clinical skills but also in how we communicate effectively, is key to reducing the rising numbers of claims and the adverse impact that claims can have on public confidence in healthcare. In recent years we have seen a significant rise in the cost and frequency of clinical negligence claims. The NHSLA paid over \u00a31.2bn last year to compensate NHS patients and we have seen over 40% more claims against UK GPs than the comparable position last year. When something goes wrong, it is absolutely right that patients receive fair compensation, it is what doctors want and why we exist, but in 7 out of 10 claims the claimant&apos;s lawyer receives more than the patient. This cannot be acceptable, particularly at a time when the NHS is so financially constrained. We shared our experiences to help shape the civil litigation reforms that are being implemented to address disproportionate legal costs. One of the benefits of city living is the accessibility of entertainment and so my day ends with ample opportunity to indulge my passion for theatre and in particular, live comedy.

In a statement issued on Friday morning, St James&apos;s Palace said the move by Closer magazine was &quot;reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press during the life of [Princess] Diana&quot; and lawyers were being consulted. The incident may yet have wider political implications, as Closer magazine in France is owned by Mondadori, a publishing company owned by the former Italian president Silvio Berlusconi The royal couple, who are touring south-east Asia, are &quot;furious&quot; and &quot;very very angry&quot; according to close aides travelling with them in Malaysia on Friday, after the magazine published what it described as exclusive pictures of Kate topless under the headline: &quot;Seulement dans Closer: Kate et William, leurs vacances tres hot en Provence.&quot; The officials said a red line had been crossed in terms of the couple&apos;s privacy . The pictures were apparently taken on the terrace of a guest house during a brief holiday with William in France last week. Royal photographer Harry Page told Sky News that they were taken on a 640 acre estate on the south of France and from what he had seen they were taken with long lenses and the couple would have had no idea they were being taken. In an extraordinary move, which underlined the fury of the royal couple, St James Palace issued a strongly-worded statement. &quot;Their royal highnesses have been hugely saddened to learn that a French publication and a photographer have invaded their privacy in such a grotesque and totally unjustifiable manner,&quot; it said. &quot;The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to the Duke and Duchess for being so. &quot;Their royal highnesses had every expectation of privacy in the remote house. It is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs, let alone publish them. &quot;Officials acting on behalf of their royal highnesses are consulting with lawyers to consider what options may be available to the Duke and Duchess.&quot; &quot;The Duke and Duchess remain focused currently on their tour of Singapore, Malaysia, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu on behalf of the Queen.&quot; The couple were staying in Provence at a chateau owned by Lord Linley, the Queen&apos;s nephew, ahead of their diamond jubilee tour of south-east Asia and the South Pacific on behalf of the Queen. They did not know anything about the photos until the magazine&apos;s website showed an image of its new front cover with a heavily-pixellated image of a woman with dark hair that it claimed was the Duchess, in a bikini, apparently about to remove her top. On Friday morning, the magazine emerged on the streets of Paris with the pictures of Kate. Sources said that royal officials did not make contact with Closer in Paris last night, because the magazine had already come off the printing presses. But St James&apos;s Palace was consulting French lawyers, with royal officials saying the publication was &quot;turning the clock back 15 years&quot; to when Princess Diana was pursued by paparazzi. It was reported that the photos were offered to British papers last week, but they all turned them down. However, one picture desk executive on a national tabloid said the set of photos being touted around last week were different. &quot;They were also long lens, but you couldn&apos;t see anything. These pictures nobody has seen, as far I am aware,&quot; the executive said. Page, a photographer who has worked with national newspapers for the past 30 years, said: &quot;From what I have seen, these photos have been taken from a very long way. Kate and William would have had no idea they were being taken. &quot;They were on a 640 acre estate in the south of France. I think they would have expected a certain degree of privacy. They were on a private holiday. &quot;Remember the toe-sucking photos of Fergie, again in the south of France. That is exactly 20 years ago this month and there was a scramble for them. But now there is not a single newspaper in Britain who would publish these pictures.&quot; The publication of the topless pictures of Kate will not just reignite memories of Princess Diana but will also feed into the Leveson report on the ethics of the press. Lord Justice Leveson is currently drafting his final report and recommendations and this controversy will underline the difficulties any future British regulator will have in controlling overseas press and internet publication. Closer&apos;s audacious decision to go to press comes just weeks after the US showbusiness website TMZ published photos of a naked Prince Harry cavorting in a Las Vegas hotel room. William and Kate were told about the allegations on Friday morning before they visited the Assyakirin Mosque and had also looked at the images on the Closer website. Speaking about the royal couple, a source said: &quot;They&apos;re saddened their privacy has been breached \u2013 if it has been breached. &quot;We will talk to our lawyers in London and counterparts in Paris to see what options are available. We&apos;re not aware of anyone [in the UK] seeking to publish so the Press Complaints Commission is not coming into it.&quot; The Sun was the only British newspaper to defy the palace&apos;s request not to publish photos of Harry in the nude with an unnamed woman. Prince Charles had issued the request to newspapers, via the PCC, along with a letter from his personal lawyers at Harbottle &amp; Lewis warning them that he had an expectation of privacy under English law, saying there is no possible justification for printing the photos apart from prurience. In 1994 the German Bild magazine published photos of Prince Charles naked on a balcony while on holiday at a French chateau near Avignon, but no British papers published them. French Closer was launched in 2005 as a version of the British magazine then owned by UK publishing company Emap. It was sold in 2006 to Mondadori France, a subsidiary of an Italian company, and sells 400,000 copies a week. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest after surveillance ships entered the area around the island group \u2013 known as the Diaoyu to China and Senkaku to Japan \u2013 which is controlled by Japan. Vessels from the two countries radioed each other with warnings to leave the waters. There were signs of the row spilling over at street level: a Japanese man in Shanghai was reportedly injured when hot noodles were thrown into his face\u2013 the sixth such attack in recent days. Brad Glosserman, executive director at Honolulu&apos;s Pacific Forum CSIS, told Reuters: &quot;The dangers of miscalculation are real.&quot; Taylor Fravel of the security studies programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: &quot;Neither side wants to see the situation spiral out of control, but both felt that they had to act. We should be concerned, but it has not yet crossed a point of no return.&quot; The island group is surrounded by rich energy resources and fisheries. The sovereignty dispute reignited when both Chinese and Japanese activists landed there last month and protests broke out in several Chinese cities, with attacks on Japanese cars and businesses. It became even more fraught when Tokyo&apos;s nationalist governor Shintaro Ishihara said the city would buy and develop the uninhabited islands from their private owners, who are Japanese. The central government then arranged to buy them, despite Beijing&apos;s protests. &quot;From the Japanese side it was the best outcome\u00a0\u2026 Ishihara is extremely rightwing and ultra-nationalist and if he controlled these islands there is no telling what he might do with them. It seems almost like he wants to provoke China on this. The Japanese government clearly does not,&quot; said Ian Storey, an expert on maritime issues at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. Although Chinese vessels have entered the area before, their voyages have not been announced. This time the foreign ministry in Beijing said the ships were there to conduct maritime surveillance and that China was carrying out a mission of &quot;law enforcement over its maritime rights&quot;. Japanese foreign minister Koichiro Gemba told reporters: &quot;We lodged a strong protest and also we made a strong case that the Chinese side should leave from the territorial waters around the Senkaku islands. &quot;I&apos;d like to underscore that we should never let the situation escalate and we have strong hopes for the Chinese to respond in an appropriate and calm manner.&quot; Kyodo news agency reported that the Chinese ships withdrew from the disputed waters on Friday afternoon. China is Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner. But deep-rooted popular mistrust endures, fuelled by memories of the brutality of the Japanese occupation in the 1930s and 1940s. Complicating matters further is the impending leadership change in China and a looming election in Japan. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, warned that the possibility of military conflict could not be eliminated. &quot;Chinese leaders actually talk tough and act carefully, but sometimes it&apos;s out of your control. Chinese public opinion has become so powerful. They have to talk very, very tough. By doing so, they will help enhance the tensions,&quot; he told AP. With popular feeling running high, Beijing saw small scale anti-Japanese protests on Thursday and Friday. One shopping centre in the capital was showing images of anti-Japanese demonstrators and the Diaoyu islands on its giant screen, rather than the usual entertainment videos.

After all, as Richard Jeffery from Business Growth Hub pointed out in his recent blog post, why limit yourself to domestic trade when the UK makes up just 1% of the world&apos;s population? Here at the Guardian Small Business Network we have seen some really inspiring examples of small businesses who&apos;ve successfully gained a foothold in the global marketplace. SMEs have exported the best of British around the world: top-quality food from an idyllic Lake District base, timepieces from a Derby clockmaker, and ice cream from Somerset. Keen to follow in their footsteps? Well, as our bloggers often point out on the network, there&apos;s plenty of groundwork to be done beforehand. Adam Marshall from the BCC suggests small businesses think local in order to act global, explaining that establishing contacts within the UK can open the door to international trade. Others have offered more detailed advice about how to conduct shipping inspections and investigate international compliance management. If you&apos;ve never exported before though, we wouldn&apos;t blame you for being apprehensive about taking the first steps into international trade. Despite the numerous success stories out there, small businesses can view exporting as a complex, risky, and difficult thing to do against a backdrop of economic uncertainty.  So, what better than to provide you with a panel of experts who can share their experience and answer all your burning questions in a live Q&amp;A? Whether you&apos;ve got a specific question about the likes of currency fluctuations, managing risk and regulations for a particular market, or you&apos;d just like to get a flavour of the benefits exporting as an SME can bring, join us on Wednesday 26 September for tips and insight.  There will also be inspiration for experienced small business exporters keen to explore new opportunities - so post your questions and comments anytime in the comments section below, and join us between 1pm and 3pm.

Reviewers have taken Beevor to task for devoting more than half his latest book to events on the eastern front and Asia. But by doing so, for me at least, he has filled in a lot of hitherto puzzling gaps. I know more or less what happened when and where in the main theatres of war outside Europe. I&apos;ve read The Balkan Trilogy, The Singapore Grip The Naked and the Dead etc. It&apos;s the whys I need \u2013 why the Nazis invaded Serbia, why the Russians supported Chiang Kai-shek, why, after Pearl Harbour, Roosevelt still honoured Churchill&apos;s &quot;Germany first&quot; priority. In the same clear, compelling prose that we recognise from his previous histories, Beevor methodically assembles the pieces of his vast jigsaw and explains how they fit together. He&apos;s a past master of pr\u00e9cis. In a couple of sentences he sums up what others take chapters to analyse \u2013 Hitler&apos;s rise to power, for instance: &quot;The critical mass of the population, desperate for law and order, were eager to follow the most reckless criminal in history. Hitler managed to appeal to their worst instincts \u2013 resentment, intolerance, arrogance and, most dangerous of all, a sense of racial superiority.&quot; As for the horrific Nazi retreat from Moscow in the winter of 1941, I&apos;ve read Tolstoy&apos;s unforgettable account of the tattered remnants of Napoleon&apos;s Grande Arm\u00e9e stumbling home through the snow a century earlier. But for a single snapshot of pure hell, Beevor is unbeatable. German infantry, still wearing the lightweight uniforms they were issued the previous summer, would saw the legs off Russian corpses and heat them over camp fires to remove the boots. After a while, you too become battle-hardened, inured to the cruelty, the slaughter, the casual acceptance of death. Late entries found it tougher. The sight of young, American GIs traumatised by the Ardennes offensive prompted Godfrey Blunden, an Australian war correspondent, to write: &quot;They were more pitiful because they were only boys, drafted from nice homes in a nice country, knowing nothing about Europe. Not tough like the Australians, or shrewd like the French, or irreducibly stubborn like the English. They just didn&apos;t know what it was all about.&quot; It&apos;s a long, gruelling but utterly gripping book, read with the familiar grim resignation Sean Barrett reserves for Beevor&apos;s work, but not without the occasional glimpse of black comedy. In adherence to Nazi eugenic law, the registrar officiating at Hitler and Eva Braun&apos;s marriage, days before their joint suicide, asked the couple if they were both of pure Arian descent. Pride and Prejudice, a listener&apos;s guide to the myriad versions available to download, ranging from \u00a33 to \u00a325 Marriage was Austen&apos;s war zone, her opposing forces lined up like second world war battalions. P&amp;P is the book every actress wants to read, hence the embarras de choix. For me, Juliet Stevenson reading Austen unabridged on CD for Naxos takes the gold. But no one under 40 has CDs, they download. Famous busy actresses such as Jenny Agutter, Jane Lapotaire, Joannas Lumley/David settle for pitifully short abridgements (Angela Lansbury&apos;s is less than an hour), but beware, they can be dearer than the whole book read by unknowns. I&apos;d recommend Kate Reading and Carolyn Seymour over Lindsay Duncan and Emilia Fox. And Neil Conrich, the only male reader, is good value. Miriam Margolis in a dramatisation makes Mrs Bennet sound like a &quot;Carry On&quot; character. The chicklit versions, Mr Darcy&apos;s Letter by Abigail Reynolds and Hidden Lust by Mitzi Szereto are fatuous. But Vampire Darcy&apos;s Desire by Regina Jeffers, all 18 hours, is a bargain at \u00a317.69, a cross between Twilight and Tristram Shandy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/14/working-abroad-best-job-uk-graduates", "sentences": ["Kendall joins an exodus of 10,000 Britons to New Zealand this year, plus many more who are heading to Australia and Canada and less-traditional destinations for emigrants, such as Germany and Singapore.", "Singapore Visa restrictions Graduates up to the age of 30 will need to secure a place on the Work Holiday Programme, which entitles them to work in Singapore for up to six months.", "Jobs With more than 110,000 expatriates and 7,000 multinational companies operating in Singapore, the opportunities for career advancement are good.", "ContactSingapore.sg is a good place to start."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-14T21:58:18Z", "title": "Working abroad: what countries offer the best job prospects for UK graduates?", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Job hunting", "Graduate careers", "Moving overseas", "Money"], "article": "After months of searching for work since graduating in June from the University of Kent, Lindsey Kendall has had enough. Next week, the 21-year-old from Bishop&apos;s Stortford in Hertfordshire will be boarding a plane to New Zealand, leaving behind the gloom of Britain&apos;s jobless economy. Kendall joins an exodus of 10,000 Britons to New Zealand this year, plus many more who are heading to Australia and Canada and less-traditional destinations for emigrants, such as Germany and Singapore. &quot;The only available jobs I could see were hospitality or general low-entry jobs \u2013 nothing for a graduate. So I decided that if I&apos;m going to work in a bar or on reception, I might as well do it in a new country as part of a new experience. I&apos;m heading to New Zealand to start my working holiday visa, and hopefully it shouldn&apos;t take me too long to find a job.&quot; Kendall says that few of her fellow leavers have had much luck landing a graduate job. &quot;There&apos;s only one I\u00a0know who has got what you might call a proper graduate job. Everyone else is still looking.&quot; Youth unemployment in the UK has reached one million and is continuing to rise, with figures this week showing 1,017,000 16-24-year-olds now claiming\u00a0benefit. Sitting out the UK recession by heading to a stronger economy will give graduates new life skills and experiences that, when they return, may help them land a better job. A lucky few may also obtain high-paying graduate-style jobs in their chosen country \u2013 but don&apos;t bet on it. Online forums used by Britons on visa programmes for 18-30-year-olds warn others not to expect it easy when they arrive abroad. One commenter on Backpackerboard.co.nz says: &quot;My girlfriend and I arrived in Auckland with just more than \u00a310,000. The accommodation costs are expensive, food is expensive too. Jobs are hard to find this year. We went everywhere in Wellington and Auckland with our CVs \u2026 I don&apos;t have a full-time job yet after one month of looking, but my girlfriend luckily does. Don&apos;t be too confident about getting jobs and don&apos;t bring too much luggage.&quot; Earnings are never going to be that high. Don&apos;t expect to get much more than \u00a310 an hour in &quot;hospitality&quot; jobs, though it may be a little more in jobs in the construction industry. After its earthquake last year, Christchurch in New Zealand is going through a rebuilding boom, although most of the vacancies are for workers in skilled\u00a0trades. Many individuals, such as Kendall, are happy to head out alone, but others will want help from travel agencies that assist in putting together visas, bank accounts and accommodation. Lucy Fenwick, 20, from Hampshire, has spent a year in Australia, which was partly organised by STA Travel. &quot;I started in Sydney and worked in a restaurant as a waitress for a few months, which gave me the chance to see the city through the eyes of a local. I moved from Sydney and worked behind a bar in Melbourne and in a clothes shop in Brisbane. &quot;I loved feeling part of the community rather than just another young Brit passing through on her travels, and the experience has totally boosted my confidence. I&apos;ve got a far broader outlook on life and hopefully it will make me stand out a bit from the other thousands of graduates.&quot; But although Australia and New Zealand play host to the bulk of Britons heading abroad for short-term work \u2013 not least because they speak English and offer more generous working visa programmes than other destinations \u2013 other countries may provide just as many opportunities, and will prove to employers you&apos;re not just a semi-permanent gap-year traveller. Canada&apos;s economy is relatively strong: it didn&apos;t suffer the banking crash that affected Europe and the US, and young British people can work there for two years on the International Experience Canada programme. According to the Canadian high commission, the programme has been very popular this year. &quot;There are opportunities in a number of sectors for graduates, specifically in the hi-tech gaming industry, and there is always a high demand for workers in construction and hospitality,&quot; a commission spokeswoman says. Visa restrictions effectively make the US off-limits to British graduates seeking work, and elsewhere job seekers will run up against language barriers. One traditional route is to obtain a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (Tefl) certificate, then head to Spain, Italy or Japan for work. But there is a sting in the tail for already debt-laden graduates heading overseas: many countries demand evidence that you have enough money\u00a0in the bank to look after yourself. Japan wants to see \u00a32,500 in cleared funds before admitting you, while in New Zealand you need to have NZ$350 per month of your stay. This represents around \u00a3180 a month. Staying for a year would require more than \u00a32,100. So what are the rules and prospects for young people heading abroad? Guardian Money looked at some of the leading, and less obvious, destinations Australia Visa restrictions Up to 12\u00a0months for people aged 18 to 30 interested in a working holiday. Apply online (A$280/\u00a3190 fee) at immi.gov.au. You can do any kind of work in Australia, but can only be with the same employer for six months. You may be asked on arrival to prove that you have\u00a0&quot;sufficient funds&quot;, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Anything less than A$3,000 (\u00a31,950) is considered risky. Jobs The greatest demand is in Western Australia, home to the mining boom. A cafe job in Sydney will pay about A$18 (\u00a311) an hour. Head to the outback to try your hand as a jackaroo (boys) or a jillaroo (girls) working on a sheep or cattle farm. Roles may include caring for livestock, maintaining the cleanliness of the farm or even &quot;mustering&quot; (rounding up) on horseback. Full-time work could pay as much as \u00a3300 a week and accommodation is often provided. Cost of living For a one-bed apartment you might pay between \u00a3750 and \u00a31,000 a month depending on if you are in a city centre or not. Generally, the cost of living is slightly higher in Australia than in the UK, something that is worth considering. New Zealand Visa restrictions There are two options: a 12-month visa or a 23-month visa for UK citizens aged 18 to 30. Apply at immigration.govt.nz. With either option you are only entitled to work for 12\u00a0months, and each is based on certain\u00a0requirements \u2013 one being access\u00a0to \u00a3180 (NZ$350) per month of your\u00a0stay. Jobs The usual hospitality roles in Auckland, Wellington and Queenstown. Construction jobs in Christchurch. Seasonal fruit-picking is ideal temporary work and can be done all over the north and south islands. It is hard-going and not especially well paid, but you could earn up to \u00a310 an hour for your toil. On the upside, agricultural work is a chance to get up close and personal with the stunning landscapes of New Zealand. Cost of living The New Zealand dollar, as with the Australian dollar, has soared in recent years against sterling, so food and drink is on a par with, or indeed above, the UK. But rents are still affordable: accommodation in the form of a one-bed apartment might be about \u00a3450 a month. Canada Visa restrictions Working visas available to adults aged 18 to 35 under the International Experience Canada programme. Apply at international.gc.ca/experience (\u00a390 fee). Unfortunately, applications for 2012 have already closed (there was a quota of 5,350 for the UK), but will open for 2013 later this year. You will also need to demonstrate cleared funds of C$2,500 (\u00a31,600). Jobs The usual hospitality and construction jobs, but the high commission in London says jobs in the hi-tech gaming industry are aplenty. If you want a job in the public sector you will need decent French language skills. And don&apos;t be put off by the cold winters; you could turn it into\u00a0an opportunity. A ski instructor in\u00a0Whistler \u2013 a job with perks such as a free\u00a0lift pass \u2013 might earn you up to \u00a3500 a month with food and accommodation included. Cost of living Canada is another country whose currency has appreciated strongly in recent years. Vancouver often appears in lists of the most expensive cities in North America. US Visa restrictions Very stringent. There is no working holiday visa programme of the type UK citizens enjoy in Australia and New Zealand. You need to have a job offer in place before even applying for a visa. Jobs One option is the &quot;J-1&quot; visa, which allows those between the ages of 18 and 26 to work as an au pair for up to 12\u00a0months, with the possibility of an extension if all goes well. You will be provided with food and board to work at least 45 hours a week, but must also complete certain courses before you are eligible. Cost of living Generally, the cost of living is similar to that of the UK, but it can be cheaper depending on where in the US you are. Accommodation costs are extremely varied. A one-bed apartment in suburban New York will be well over \u00a31,000 a month, and \u00a32,000 in town, but elsewhere in the country will be much lower. Germany Visa restrictions None. All EU nationals, including those from Britain, have the right to look for work in Germany. The country is a much better bet than Spain or Italy (suffering from high youth unemployment) or the Nordic nations (which suffer from high\u00a0living costs). Jobs Unemployment is lower than Britain, at about 7%, but while jobs are available they could not be described as plentiful. Search for work at the arbeitsagentur.de, Germany&apos;s job centres. Head to Bavaria where unemployment is less than 4% rather than the old East Germany where unemployment is widespread. Speaking German helps \u2013 so why not perfect your German as a tour guide? There are plenty of travel companies that will be happy to have you, and your job will undoubtedly expose you to some of Germany&apos;s finest attractions. Don&apos;t expect to get rich, though: rates of pay will not be much higher than \u00a310 an hour. Cost of living Less than in the UK, and surprisingly so in high-profile places such as Berlin. A one-bed flat can be in the region of \u00a3300 a month. Japan Visa restrictions Under the Working Holiday Scheme, a limited number of British citizens aged 18 to 30 may be granted a visa that allows them to enter Japan and work for up to a year. You must have \u00a32,500 in cleared funds and have the last three months&apos; bank statements to hand to show to immigration officials. Jobs The official &quot;Hello Work&quot; job centres in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya help foreigners find jobs. Most British graduates heading to Japan find work as English teachers. Cost of living Notoriously high, particularly in Tokyo. Look to arrange accommodation before you arrive in the country. Singapore Visa restrictions Graduates up to the age of 30 will need to secure a place on the Work Holiday Programme, which entitles them to work in Singapore for up to six months. This visa comes with an issue fee of about \u00a375. Jobs With more than 110,000 expatriates and 7,000 multinational companies operating in Singapore, the opportunities for career advancement are good. ContactSingapore.sg is a good place to start. Cost of living Food is relatively cheap, but accommodation costs may prove to be expensive."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/sep/15/hillsborough-bradford-daniel-taylor", "sentences": ["Strange, though, that a national newspaper would stick a story of such magnitude back on page six behind, among other things, an item headlined &quot;Thief hid 20 mobile phones in his tights&quot; and what is commonly known in the trade as a fluff piece, namely a photo-spread of William and Kate touring a Rolls-Royce plant in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-15T21:00:07Z", "title": "How Bradford fire neglect left Hillsborough doomed to disaster", "tags": ["Hillsborough disaster", "Liverpool", "Bradford", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "They didn&apos;t manage a single line about Hillsborough on the front page of the Daily Telegraph the day after it all broke. One of the biggest scandals in modern history and still not enough to get past a story about speed cameras or the obligatory picture of the Duchess of Cambridge. Which is funny because it is difficult to imagine they would not have cleared a few column inches if there had been 96 people killed in a disaster at, say, Lord&apos;s or Twickenham. Not the biggest issue, perhaps, at a time when, bar one obvious exception, there are actually plenty of reasons to look through the newspaper industry \u2013 a beleaguered industry right now, let&apos;s be honest \u2013 and be lifted by the way certain journalists have made a difference since 15 April 1989. My colleague, David Conn, for one, who had always suspected a cover-up and set about trying to expose it. Brian Reade of the Daily Mirror. Tony Evans of the Times. Plenty of others, too. Strange, though, that a national newspaper would stick a story of such magnitude back on page six behind, among other things, an item headlined &quot;Thief hid 20 mobile phones in his tights&quot; and what is commonly known in the trade as a fluff piece, namely a photo-spread of William and Kate touring a Rolls-Royce plant in Singapore. Later editions were changed to plug a &quot;Sport Special&quot; on the subject. Except Hillsborough was not a sports story, just as you would not expect to find 9/11 in the travel section, and it does leave the lingering sense that in some places football is still not quite free of its old stigmas, whereby the people who go to games are somehow not deemed as important, or worthy, as those who watch other sports, or engage in other activities. Even now, when the demographic has changed at football matches, with shinier, better-kept stadiums and less chance of a brick flying past your head. Hillsborough was always a national disaster but it is now, officially, a national scandal that goes right to the top of the country, and the sheer scale of wrongdoing will never lose its ability to shock. Hillsborough is probably better described as not one scandal but a whole series of them, one after another. The collusion, the doctoring of statements, the lies and spin and political manoeuvring. The letters that were sent to the authorities \u2013 all ignored \u2013 from fans caught up in dangerous crushes at previous Hillsborough semi-finals, warning that it was &quot;a deathtrap&quot;, that fans had been collapsing, that it was so bad people were being sick and fainting, that someone&apos;s umbrella had actually snapped in two against the metal barriers. As for the alcohol-testing of the 96 corpses, purely to bend the story in favour of the South Yorkshire police, it takes a special kind of bastard to pass those orders when the victims included so many young. Thirty-seven of the dead at Hillsborough were teenagers. Jon-Paul Gilhooley, Steven Gerrard&apos;s cousin, was the youngest who never came home. Ten years old. &quot;A boy whose life was snatched away just as it was starting,&quot; Gerrard writes in his autobiography. &quot;Crushed to death in a stand unfit for human beings.&quot; Something else about Hillsborough, too. Something that isn&apos;t in the report and goes back to what happened when Bradford City played Lincoln City, on the final day of the 1984-85 season, and the way football was too arrogant, too damned pleased with itself and utterly dimwitted to take on board the crucial lessons of what happened when a fire engulfed the old wooden stand at Valley Parade. Fifty-six people died in the Bradford disaster, but it is difficult to imagine what the death toll would have been had the pitch not been an open and accessible escape route. Hundreds? Martin Fletcher, one of the survivors, is absolutely clear: &quot;There&apos;s never been any doubt in my mind,&quot; he says. &quot;The lack of fences that day saved thousands.&quot; Martin, to introduce him properly, is an old schoolfriend, someone I still see at the odd match and whose courage never ceases to amazes me. Goodness knows how he still goes to football matches after everything he has endured. But he does. He was 12 at the time of the Bradford fire, sitting with his family when the smoke started to lick through the floorboards. When the flames took hold, Martin managed to get on to the pitch. His brother, Andrew, 11, their father, John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63, didn&apos;t. Four years later, on that sunny day in Sheffield, he was in one of the stands housing the Nottingham Forest fans. &quot;The afternoon after Hillsborough I broke down in my mum&apos;s car and asked her: &apos;Why didn&apos;t the fences come down after Bradford?&apos; It was obvious to me as a 12-year-old, let alone as a 16-year-old, that it was the one lesson that should have been learned.&quot; What ought to have happened \u2013 a complete overhaul of football-ground safety, akin to the one that followed Hillsborough \u2013 should have been obvious to everyone considering the gross negligence, bordering on criminality, that occurred at Bradford, what it said about our football clubs and stadia at the time and what subsequently happened 40 miles or so across Yorkshire. Bradford, with a turnover in excess of \u00a3600,000, had the money in place to make their ground safe. They chose to spend it on creating a promotion-winning team, chasing the dream despite the potential fire risk of litter gathering beneath a timber structure being drawn to their attention by the Health and Safety Executive, twice, in 1981, and the county council in 1984. After the fire, most likely started by a discarded match or cigarette, a charred copy of the Bradford Telegraph and Argus, from Monday, 4 November 1968, was discovered in the debris. An empty packet of peanuts was also found, costing six old pennies. Decimalisation being in 1971, it had been there at least 14 years. Valley Parade was a monument to neglect, a ticking time-bomb that should have told us football desperately had to change its ways. Except football, more or less, carried on as it was. The Popplewell inquiry into Bradford did make safety recommendations, including that all grounds should require a safety certificate, and that fences must be designed to deal with emergencies. But they were not met. The politicians moved on to the next subject and, on Merseyside, they set off for a football match at a ground with no safety certificate, a history of crushes and a fence caging them in. Ten feet high, padlocked, with spikes on top. &quot;Two days after the fire,&quot; Martin remembers, &quot;the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, promised Parliament &apos;there is no question of putting up a fence that would create a trap.&apos; For all the Tory contrition, the key question that remains unanswered is why did it take another 96 deaths for the Thatcher government to make good on that promise?&quot; There is probably only one answer: they just didn&apos;t care enough.

His impromptu speech on Saturday ended an absence that had sparked rumours about his health and raised questions about the stability of the country&apos;s succession process. In a brief English-language report that broke the official silence on his whereabouts, the Xinhua news agency said the vice-president arrived at China Agricultural University in the morning for activities to mark National Science Popularisation Day. A picture on the government&apos;s website showed a healthy-looking Xi, with a slight smile and wearing a black informal jacket over a white shirt, walking around the university. A second picture, from Xinhua, showed a relaxed, laughing and gesticulating Xi inspecting some ears of corn. Sources said Xi hurt his back while swimming earlier this month and that he had been obeying doctors&apos; orders to get bed rest and undergo physiotherapy. Xi had not been seen publicly since 1 September, when he made a speech at the ruling Communist party&apos;s official training academy. Since then, he has cancelled meetings with visiting foreign dignitaries including the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton; the Singapore prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong; and the Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. The Chinese government has yet to explain Xi&apos;s public absence. Speculation over Xi&apos;s absence highlights the scrutiny China&apos;s succession process is under, tempered with uneasiness about the country&apos;s opaque political system, which often seems at odds with its rising global importance. &quot;The leadership needs to realise how the world perceives this.

Xinhua said Xi, while visiting the university, spoke about food safety and made an impromptu speech in which he praised the university for sharing science with the public.

ARGENTINA: ZonaindieSobrenadar \u2013 1859Born in Chaco, Paula Garc\u00eda relocated to Buenos Aires for the first time in 2006 to study music production. Since then, coming and going between Chaco and the capital, she adopted the Sobrenadar identity, developing it through two LPs and three EPs, self-released digitally. 1859 is her latest album, and the highest point of that constant evolution. Released through Bandcamp during the first half of this year, it has already obtained several reviews that name her as one of the most promising new local electronica artists. The song 1859 is a bonus track from a special reissue by Mamushka Dogs Records.  AUSTRALIA: Who the Bloody Hell Are They?Bad Dreems \u2013 Too OldAny of our overseas friends who are fans of the Twerps, do tune in. Sydney via Adelaide four-piece Bad Dreems are one of the best Australian bands at the moment (in our humble opinion). Too Old is about a fizzling relationship, with a nod to the humdrum routine somewhere in between. Its delivery is anything but boring, though. Loose treble riffs, vocalist Ben Marwe&apos;s casual drone and arguably the catchiest hook being passed around all make this track so great. If only everyone else took a cue from these guys and stopped trying so hard to sound good. Downer-pop at its best.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigDust Covered Carpet \u2013 Fragile Soul/Heavy Heart&quot;A rooftop above concrete or a cliff above the shore or an accident on the street.&quot; The first lines of Fragile Soul/Heavy Heart set the tone for the rest of this strangely calm, reduced and peaceful song that is, after all, about suicide. It is no surprise, then, that Dust Covered Carpet are based in a city with a well-known affinity for all things morbid: Vienna.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoDibigode \u2013 Mariposa (A Lagartixa E O Urubu)Dibigode is a creative band formed by five young multi-instrumentists who make post-rock music full of melodic lines and dynamic sounds. This version of Mariposa (A Lagartixa E O Urubu) is part of the new remastered version of their debut album, Naturais E Id\u00eanticos Ao Natural De Pimentas Da Jamaica E Preta, available for free download at the band&apos;s website.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsEvening Hymns \u2013 ArrowsOn his second album as Evening Hymns, Jonas Bonnetta has made public his very private and personal response to his father&apos;s passing. There are moments of sentimentality and sweetness, and there are times when raw nerves are exposed, stinging with pain and heartache. Arrows is a touching, haunting song about the ghosts that linger long after a loved one has passed away.  CHILE: Super 45Ases Falsos \u2013 La Sinceridad Del CosmosAses Falsos present their debut album, Juventud Americana (Arca Discos), a collection of songs that refer to the Latin American ideology yet manage to sound contemporary at the same time. The classy use of synthesizers, the meticulous vocal harmonies and the melodic wrapping are, along with irony-filled lyrics with a strong political and social meaning, the highlights of this work. Our pick is La Sinceridad Del Cosmos (&quot;The sincerity of the cosmos&quot;), a song that questions police brutality \u2026 from an animal&apos;s point of view.  CHINA: WooozyBaby Formula \u2013 Warm SongBaby Formula, currently the only shoegaze band in Beijing who play dream pop live, are formed by an artist who dedicates himself to being a loser, a senior who doesn&apos;t know where to get a master&apos;s degree and a writer who hasn&apos;t sold any work yet. Their music is influenced by a wide range of bands from Slowdive to The Radio Dept.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloBomba Est\u00e9reo \u2013 Pa&apos; RespirarAfter four years of waiting, electro-cumbia group Bomba Est\u00e9reo return with a more reflective album in which they explore their essence, but without forgetting their Caribbean power. Pa&apos; Respirar means &quot;to breathe&quot;, a theme that reflects the band&apos;s new vibe, where you can feel the world they inhabit.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianIndianna Dawn \u2013 I Always Miss YouThere&apos;s been a new wave of Americana and country music sweeping Denmark in the past few years (I say &quot;new&quot; \u2013 I don&apos;t really think there&apos;s ever been one before) and one representative of this is the quintet Indianna Dawn, centered around singer and songwriter Dianna D\u00f8nns. MAP exclusive download I Always Miss You is from their great debut album, Somebody&apos;s Dead.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraDuluc \u2013 La Mano Part\u00edaFrom the depths of rural laments, La Casetera&apos;s first MAP submission is all about Dominican folklore. Jos\u00e9 Duluc is part of our musical history, playing alongside iconic rock star Luis &quot;Terror&quot; D\u00edas for many years. His nostalgic approach to peasant work on his latest song, La Mano Part\u00eda, makes us contemplate the aspirations of the less fortunate and their longing to be generously rewarded someday.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogWoodpecker Wooliams \u2013 CrowWoodpecker Wooliams, aka Brighton girl Gemma Williams, is a 27-year-old singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, and for once that term is true: the former midwife plays harp, kora, omnichord, keyboard, harmonium, electric organ, accordion, penny whistle, clarinet, bells, glockenspiel, electric shruti box, recorder and drums. She&apos;s also more Bj\u00f6rk than Beyonc\u00e9, a kookstress with a high chirrup of a voice and a backstory involving a bird obsession and a bee fetish. Don&apos;t expect wall-to-wall cute, though. On Crow, one of several avian-related titles on her The Bird School of Being Human album, she sings about building &quot;a great funeral pyre&quot; as the music becomes increasingly clanging and industrial. Prepare to be haunted long after it ends.  FINLAND: GlueSkip Zone \u2013 Leaving Planet BoredomSkip Zone are a six-piece folk-rock band from Helsinki that perform mid-tempo cosmic Americana songs with some outstanding vocal harmonies and catchy pop melodies. A little bit early Wilco here and a little bit Ryan Adams there makes for well-crafted songs. Skip Zone&apos;s debut EP can be heard on SoundCloud in its entirety.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredAud \u2013 VioletsAud is a folk-pop duet hailing from Nancy, heavily influenced by Patrick Watson, Sufjan Stevens, Beirut and other indie acts. Their first EP, Origami, released in 2010, brought them much success, and Violets is taken from their second one, The Death of the Stag God, released on 14 September. Not only are they brilliant lyricists, they&apos;re also exceptional musicians, who use guitars, drums, pianos, glockenspiel and harmonica to create a diverse spectrum of sounds and feelings.  GERMANY: BlogparteiStabil Elite \u2013 HydravionLet&apos;s conclude our series on new Kraut with this fine trio from Duesseldorf, whose debut Douze Pouze had quite an impact on German music scene. They combine the charm of monotony and repetitive patterns with distinctive lyrics reminiscent of Neue Deutsche Welle. But Stabil Elite is not just one of those retro bands \u2013 it&apos;s mature, handmade music with great range and originality.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnMonotown \u2013 Can DenyMonotown just finished their debut album in a collaboration with four-time Grammy-winning mixing engineer Michael Brauer. While the album&apos;s narrative may have roots in their motherland, its sound will be equal parts American western film score and Beatles psychedelia, flavored with haunting textures reminiscent of contemporary indie-rock bands.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarBrilliant At Breakfast \u2013 Gundala Putra PetirBrilliant at Breakfast are one of this country&apos;s finest indie-pop/twee-pop bands. Hailing from Yogyakarta, they already enjoy a global reach, distributing their records around the world via Apple Crumble (Japan), Hands and Arms (France), Susy Records and many more. Enjoy their heartfelt tune Gundala Putra Petir.  IRELAND: Nialler9Forrests \u2013 TarifaThe duo of Paul O&apos;Reilly and Owen O&apos;Mahony only have two Forrests tracks available online but form from their other band, Channel One, and a couple of super live shows have confirmed them as a vital prospect. Their music reaches for the night sky, a la M83 or Fuck Buttons, with a crisp digital sheen and warm breaths. Tarifa is a beauty.  ITALY: PolaroidGo Dugong \u2013 White Sun (feat. Welcome Back Sailors)Listening to this song in September may be painful: the level of nostalgia for the summer that just faded away (at least on this side of the globe) can become dangerously high. In any case, the music Go Dugong makes is so good it&apos;s worth it \u2013 sunny synths, samples lost in the echoes and lots of beats. Go Dugong is the solo project of Giulio Fonseca (from the brilliant band K\u00f8benhavn Store) and he just released his first EP on the Czech label AMDISCS.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesFancy Books \u2013 Sister Carry StarsSaitama duo Fancy Books takes a lot of cues from groups currently generating buzz in Tokyo, especially blog-approved outfits Jesse Ruins and Sapphire Slows, whose sounds swirl dance music with unsettling ambient touches. Sister Carry Stars, though, leans closer to pop, with a jaunty melody and sweet vocals that sound inviting. Still, Fancy Books take an otherwise summer-friendly number and turn it woozy with their synths.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaTollens \u2013 Beautiful DayTollens (real name Ryan Formosa) bought his first guitar at age 13, but it was only recently that he started recording proper songs. He came up with the name as a nod to Bernhard Tollens, the German chemist. After unleashing his first EP on SoundCloud to good feedback from friends and even people he&apos;d never met, he decided to take it further. Beautiful Day is taken from the EP Drowning in a Dream \u2013 a proverbial bedroom-pop rollercoaster, available as a free download from Bandcamp.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaEddie Mercury \u2013 In MexicoMexico&apos;s National Day falls on 15 September, and to set the mood for a party we&apos;ve brought in local Electrique Music genius Eddie Mercury. On this eight-minute bouncing trance, a digitally bloated voice emphasises he wasn&apos;t born in New York, Chicago or Detroit\u2013 he was born &quot;In Mexico&quot;. So let&apos;s dress in red, white and green and insanely dance to this new national (house) anthem.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!Spilt Milk \u2013 Our Despised DecayDuring the dark days of December 2011, Amsterdam-based quintet Spilt Milk found comfort in the first eight published poems by American modernist poet Wallace Stevens (1879-1955). Gathered under the title Carnet De Voyage (&quot;Travel Notebook&quot;), these songs are full of stars, sunsets, landscapes and rivers. Although Stevens&apos;s poetry may not be the easiest or permeable, listening to Spilt Milk&apos;s drone-folk adaptations makes entering his Buddhist-like, abstract view of the world a rewarding experience.  PERU: SoTBThe Cocainers \u2013 Let&apos;s DanceAlthough The Cocainers&apos; career is very new - they formed only five months ago in Lima - it looks very promising. They are in the process of making their first album, but already we can find songs at the level of Let&apos;s Dance. With its old school rock, vibrating vocals, electro touches and an inherent indie flavor, it&apos;s a powerful song which will make your muscles move without you noticing.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogMuzyka Ko\u0144ca Lata \u2013 Dok\u0105dOK, so this track might be from 2011 and the name of the band means &quot;music of the end of the summer&quot;, but Dok\u0105d is earning international fame, having been voted Song of the Summer 2012 in a contest run by popular Seattle-based podcast Too Beautiful To Live. Muzyka Ko\u0144ca Lata is influenced by bigbit - a popular genre in Poland in the 60s - and you can check out the beautiful lyrics of Dok\u0105d here.   PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Minta &amp; The Brook Trout \u2013 FalconMinta &amp; The Brook Trout are one of the most interesting Portuguese bands around. They were first in MAP in December 2010; Now they are back with their new album, Olympia, out on September 17. To celebrate the release, here&apos;s the first single, Falcon.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieDandy And The Walkers \u2013 Video HoOut of the blue, Dandy And The Walkers broke into the Puerto Rican independent scene late this summer with this single, Video Ho. A shared love of The Shirleys and The Ronettes brought Michelle Fern\u00e1ndez, Melissa Collazo and Enrique Olivares together, while their sonic exploration led them to recruit Laira D\u00edaz, C\u00e9sar Jim\u00e9nez and Juanto Arrroyo. Mario Negr\u00f3n (of psych-rockers, Fantasmes) got them to record at Casa Fantasmes, producing this track which showcases the raw talent and contagiously fun vibe the ensemble is able to create. Dandy And The Walkers are currently recording their first album.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoisePopa Sapka \u2013 Stinky BastardsThe music of Popa Sapka, heavily influenced by Balkanic melodies and rhythms, is a mix of ska, pop, punk, gypsy, reggae, folk and the traditional music of &apos;mother Russia&apos;. Their lyrics, originating from the band&apos;s multicultural background, present a twisted mix of English, Russian, Romanian and Gagauzian languages. The light-heartedness and sincerity of their songs are what makes Popa Sapka so appealing.  RUSSIA: Big EchoFPRF \u2013 Crystallization PointNovosibirsk-based shoegaze band FPRF prepares for its next full-length release with Crystallization Point, a calm and beautiful slow-burning jam backed with remixes by beats producer Ta-ku and future garage from Nocow.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopSiobhan Wilson \u2013 All Dressed UpSiobhan Wilson&apos;s music pursuits have taken the 24-year-old from her native Scotland to a surprise pop career in France, back to Scotland and now London, where she finds herself charming all-comers with her folky, jazzy bilingual storytelling and cartoon-like glamour. Unrequited love is the dish of the day in All Dressed Up, the captivating standout track of her just-released mini-album Glorified Demons.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...FAUXE \u2013 Be My LoveA mysterious force has been brewing in Singapore, bubbling beneath the shiny veneer of saturated city lights. The glitchy imperfections of static haunt the corridors of abandoned buildings, a sign of life from androids realising self-awareness. FAUXE leads a charge into this unknown realm, stirring up quite the storm with his debut EP Ubuntu and letting his music trickle down your window panes on a rain-sodden day.  SOUTH AFRICA: Musical Mover &amp; Shaker!Al Bairre \u2013 Youth De FreitasSymphonic indie-rock band Al Bairre was formed at the begining of 2011, drawing influences from bands such as Arcade Fire, Ra Ra Riot, Vampire Weekend and Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros. The five-piece have seemingly perfected the indie-dance genre, combining cello, violin, keys, Fender guitars and ukulele to produce an exciting sound that has seen them scale the local scene.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieBig Baby Driver \u2013 My GoodbyeAfter many years of crafting lovely music, singer-songwriter Big Baby Driver recently rose to fame after having a few songs featured in Korean television drama series A Gentleman&apos;s Dignity. Last month she released a collaboration single with former MAP artist Kim Mokin. My Goodbye, with its bossa rhythms, is Big Baby Driver&apos;s contribution to the release.  SPAIN: MusikornerNaturalesa Salvatge \u2013 Sota L&apos;aiguaNaturalesa Salvatge are a five-piece from Barcelona who make melancholic but dreamy melodies. Their main influences are The Smiths, Teenage Fanclub and The Radio Dept. Formed during a national lo-fi explosion, Naturalesa Salvatge have shown they&apos;re not as ephemeral as similar acts, most of them now defunct.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaCaviare Days \u2013 You&apos;ll QualifySwedish sisters Lina and Maja Westin formed Caviare Days in New York, which isn&apos;t at all surprising since one could easily compare them to a couple of other female-fronted garage bands linked to the city&apos;s scene. This is a good thing, of course. Their 60s-inspired psychedelic rock is as refreshing as it is really, really good. The duo&apos;s self-titled debut LP is out now in Sweden and will be released in North America on October 9.  SWITZERLAND: 78sFai Baba \u2013 Peach Orchard MamaThe first time Fai Baba was on a stage he had just come back from a spiritual journey through India. Then he picked up his guitar, wrote a few songs and played his ass off in cellars, whisky bars and squatted houses. His psychedelic blues-rock is best enjoyed during live shows, they tend to get ecstatic. His debut album Snake Snake was released in August.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATOn Your Horizon \u2013 Untitled #1On Your Horizon is a four-piece experimental post-rock gathering from Eskisehir and Istanbul. Their album Home is a DIY production released for free in 2010 via Bandcamp. Having made a tremendous impact, the band&apos;s self-confident has increased and their new track Untitled #1 is an ironclad song which builds splendidly.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouSeamonster \u2013 Normandy LandscapeThe music of Seamonster is a slow-moving invasion of simple yet powerful movements of sonic exploration that ultimately transports the listener to another world. Every layer upon layer reveals itself slowly until every instrument is swirling and floating above. Melt into this track, let itself wrap around you and take over.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sHolySexyBastards \u2013 Getting Over YouWhen we decided to include HolySexyBastards in this month&apos;s MAP, they were just another competitor in Festival Nuevas Bandas, one of the biggest new music festivals in Venezuela. Today, this power trio formed in Valencia are the winners (along with Okills, who were on MAP in January 2012). HolySexyBastards offer us the track Getting Over You, included on their self-titled album released in May."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/17/english-baccalaureate-exam-reform", "sentences": ["Singapore&apos;s examination system, so praised by Gove, was achieved by a consensus involving teachers, parents and industry."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-17T18:42:58Z", "title": "English baccalaureate: another dog's dinner of a plan for exam reform", "tags": ["English baccalaureate", "Exams", "GCSEs", "Schools", "Education", "Education policy", "Michael Gove", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Once again a government is making a dog&apos;s dinner of examination reform. In 2005, Mike Tomlinson wrote a wide-ranging exam review and achieved an almost impossible consensus \u2013 only to see it blown out of the water by a general election in which neither the Conservatives or Labour wanted to be the party about to scrap A-levels. This time we have a proposed English baccalaureate certificate, about which there are still many questions. We don&apos;t know for how long students will continue to do GCSEs, and we don&apos;t know what will happen to the accountability and league tables. The death of the GCSE could be much slower than Gove had wanted. One thing is clear, the proposed Ebacc has absolutely nothing to do with evidence, successful reform or standards. The regulator Ofqual has produced no evidence that the GCSE is beyond repair. Neither has it produced any evidence of difficulties with the concepts of modularity and controlled assessment. We don&apos;t know who might take the Ebacc, or whether disadvantaged groups might be adversely affected. Most pressing for a generation of children and their parents is that there seems to be no thought for the potentially lost cohort of young people who will continue to take the existing GCSE up until 2017, an exam now so traduced by Gove that employers and universities will have difficulty in taking it seriously. Despite Gove&apos;s declaration on entering government that he would liberate teachers, there has been no prior consultation with the teaching profession. The consultation is the result of the iron agreement between the two coalition parties rather than any meaningful input from teachers, academics, parents and indeed the young people who will take them. In no other profession would such a significant reform be imposed in such a way. The introduction of the Ebacc brings with it the possibility of moving from a criterion-based exam system to one based on norms, with each grade having a quota of passes allocated to it. The current grade inflation objection is that too many students are getting high grades. Would the same criticism be applied to a rising percentage of people passing the driving test? Here we have perhaps the only government in the developed world determined to drive down the percentage of high achievers. Norm-based exams have another pernicious effect: the possibility of maintaining standards over time is undermined by arbitrary quotas that obscure a consistent picture of what young people can do. Internationally, there is no correlation between this type of reform and countries with outstanding education systems. Singapore&apos;s examination system, so praised by Gove, was achieved by a consensus involving teachers, parents and industry. Finland&apos;s system of evaluation is the product of a society valuing its education system and cross-party consensus. We need to fine-tune the exam system. But this isn&apos;t the way to do it. \u2022 John Bangs is an honorary visiting fellow at Cambridge University"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/18/minister-civil-service-reform", "sentences": ["The IPPR beat 20 other bidders for the \u00a350,000 contract and will by late autumn produce a menu of options for ministers based on experiences in New Zealand, Singapore, France, the US and Sweden."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-18T05:00:00Z", "title": "Minister commissions study into civil service reform", "tags": ["Civil service", "Thinktanks", "Francis Maude", "Politics", "Public services policy", "UK news", "Society", "Public sector careers"], "article": "In an attempt to secure cross-party support for civil service reform, the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, has commissioned the left-of-centre IPPR thinktank to undertake a study on how to make the civil service more effective and politically accountable. The study is the first example of Whitehall commissioning outsiders to undertake policy work for government. The IPPR beat 20 other bidders for the \u00a350,000 contract and will by late autumn produce a menu of options for ministers based on experiences in New Zealand, Singapore, France, the US and Sweden. The IPPR undertook an international comparative study back in 2006 that has impressed Maude. He wants to look at radical options including formally contracting departmental permanent secretaries to complete certain ministerial objectives. He also wants to look at the balance between political and civil service appointments. In the US large numbers of civil servants leave after a presidential election, although Maude said on Monday this trait was exaggerated. The head of the civil service, Sir Bob Kerslake, has endorsed the concept of policy work being undertaken by outsiders, but stressed that final decisions rested with ministers on the advice of civil servants. Both Maude and Kerslake said the aim was not to politicise the civil service, although Maude conceded there had been difficulties when civil servants failed to carry out ministerial instruction and said the aim was to sharpen accountability. Maude has been struck privately by the extent to which former Labour ministers told him how frustrated they became at civil service obstruction. He said the civil service reform plan, including the use of external policy-making, has &quot;a high level of buy-in from senior civil servants&quot;, adding &quot;we are in the unusual position of three political parties having experience of government, with senior politicians knowing what the issues are&quot;. The 2006 IPPR paper argued that &quot;real accountability can only really be achieved by recasting the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, which militates against effective accountability&quot;. &quot;Without clarifying the respective roles and responsibilities of ministers and officials, it makes it very difficult to distinguish between the performance of the Civil Service and that of ministers,&quot; it said. It also accepted that there was &quot;no binary distinction between policy and operations&quot;, but asserted &quot;clearer division of labour is possible&quot;. The author of the study, Guy Lodge, who is still at the IPPR, wrote in 2007: &quot;The Whitehall policy-making process is very insular, often conducted behind closed doors with little attempt to engage stakeholders or capitalise on external expertise. In particular, there is a gulf between those designing policy and those delivering it. In contrast, Lodge praised the French unified civil service, saying it &quot;guarantees that senior officials are exposed to other parts of public service in local and regional government, giving them direct experience of public service delivery. At the very least, Britain should ensure that central government officials spend more of their careers in local government and other parts of the public sector.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/fashion-kate-duchess-of-cambridge-asia", "sentences": ["Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images     Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (R), British High Commissioner to Singapore Antony Phillipson (2-R), his wife Julie  (3-R) and other guests look on during a review of the guard of honor during a welcome ceremony at the Istana, or Presidential Palace in Singapore, 11 September 2012.", "EPA/LUKAS COCH AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND OUT Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPA    Fashion diplomacy is where Kate shines, and someone in her team had done their homework: this dress is by Prabal Gurung, who was born in Singapore and is now based in New York.", "Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPA     epa03396097 Catherine Duchess of Cambridge pays her respect at the graves of Commonwealth soldiers at Kranji War Memorial in Singapore, 13 September 2012.", "EPA/LUONG THAI LINH Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/EPA    This Jenny Packham dress, worn while paying her respects at the graves of Commonwealth soldiers at Kranji War Memorial in Singapore, was arguably the style highlight of Kate&apos;s tour wardrobe.", "Photograph: Tony Prcevich/AFP/Getty Images     Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge meets members of public as she attends a cultural event in Queenstown on day 2 of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge's Diamond Jubilee Tour of the Far East on September 12, 2012 in Singapore.", "Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images      SINGAPORE - SEPTEMBER 12:  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (shoe detail) tours the Rolls-Royce Seletar Campus during the Diamond Jubilee tour at Seletar Aerospace Park on September 12, 2012 in Singapore.", "Photograph: Pool/Getty Images     epa03394959 Catherine Duchess of Cambridge greets a young boy while on a tour of Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, 12 September 2012.", "EPA/STEPHEN MORRISON/POOL Photograph: STEPHEN MORRISON/POOL/EPA     This dress, worn at the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, is by Alexander McQueen, a flagship brand for modern Britain, but the fitted jacket and full skirt reference the style of the era of the Queen&apos;s coronation, so the royal family&apos;s past and present are both present."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-18T12:10:00Z", "title": "Kate's wardrobe: The Duchess of Cambridge's key looks in south-east Asia \u2013 in pictures", "tags": ["Fashion", "The Duchess of Cambridge", "UK news", "Life and style"], "article": "Immediately following those pictures, the duchess opted for a headscarf during a visit to Assyakirin Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Kate, who is a fan of matching accessories, appears over the moon that her crown works with her primrose frock. She looks like a pastel Frida Kahlo.

Sometimes the novelty fades and the excitement remains. Afghanistan are by far the most interesting team at the World Twenty20 which started in Sri Lanka on Tuesday; it&apos;s just that they are no longer new. They are now part of international cricket&apos;s furniture. It is not a shock they qualified. It would have been a surprise had they not done so. Afghanistan \u2013 who play India in Group A on Wednesday before facing England on Friday \u2013 are a team of irrepressible optimists; full of character, charm and innocence; free of the cynicism and entitlement that pollute modern sport. They are subject to the unique goodwill, affection and gratitude that only occurs when you are exploring virgin territory on behalf of your country. Theirs is a tale the whole cricket world has embraced. The more you delve into their story, the more you fall in love with it. If you have not yet seen the life-affirming documentary Out of the Ashes, your LoveFilm list is in urgent need of\u00a0revision. &quot;There is a lot of problems in the world today, you know?&quot; the then national coach Taj Malik says in the documentary. &quot;And everywhere, everywhere, there is complex fighting. The solution of all the problems\u00a0... is cricket.&quot; Nawroz Mangal, the captain, estimates the cricket-playing population of Afghanistan at more than 500,000. &quot;After participating in this World Cup, if we do better, I expect 30 to 40% of the population to start playing cricket.&quot; The swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Shahzad says their participation &quot;could be a positive step towards bringing peace to the country&quot;. The word &quot;journey&quot; has become a little hackneyed in the reality TV age, but Afghanistan&apos;s journey is worth revisiting. It began in refugee camps during the Soviet occupation of 1979-89, where cricket was played using shoes for stumps and balls made out of torn-up shirts. The national team became affiliated to the ICC in 2001, when they went on their first tour, a trip across the Pakistan border from Kabul to Rawalpindi. As recently as 2008 they were playing in Division Five of the ICC World Cricket League against Japan, Jersey, Singapore, Botswana and the Bahamas. That was the start of a series of qualifiers for the last 50-over World Cup which took them to Jersey, Tanzania, Argentina and finally South Africa. Their dream of World Cup qualification ended with defeat to Canada in 2009 but they received ODI status at the end of the same\u00a0tournament. Afghanistan then qualified for the World T20 in 2010, where they were beaten by India and South Africa. Last month they played their first ODI against Australia and were far from embarrassed during a 66-run defeat. Mohammad Nabi clubbed four sixes while the boyish No9, Gulbodin Naib \u2013 whose endearing fixation with his Popeye muscles was a recurring theme of Out of the Ashes \u2013 showed the value of that gym work by hammering three sixes in nine balls off Mitchell Johnson and James Pattinson. That match is one of only two ODIs against a Test-playing nation \u2013 they also lost to Pakistan by seven wickets in February \u2013 but they have an overall record of 12 wins and 11 defeats in that form of the game. In T20 internationals their record is won six and lost five, again with defeats in both their matches against a major nation. They have not played enough games to qualify for a place in the ICC T20 rankings, although their points total would put them 10th, above Ireland and Zimbabwe \u2013 and, for a few days a fortnight ago, Australia. Afghanistan are probably not yet ready to beat one of the big nations. That day will come, however, and a victory against England \u2013 who have lost to Associate nations in two of the past three global tournaments \u2013 should not be completely discounted. &quot;We have a very competitive team,&quot; says the ACB chief executive Hamid Shinwari, &quot;and I hope that they will put up a better show in this year&apos;s event.&quot; They were comfortably beaten in both matches in the Caribbean two years ago, although they left their mark. The lower order swung merrily to recover from 14 for six and 32 for eight to reach 80 against South Africa, while Hamid Hassan took three for 21 in that match and one for eight from three overs against India. Hassan is the best fast bowler among the Associate and Affiliate nations. Afghanistan are not yet Associate members of the ICC, and share Affiliate status with, among others, Cameroon, Luxembourg and the Isle of Man. His former coach, the Pakistan wicketkeeper Rashid Latif, says he is &quot;good enough to represent even a full nation in a developed team&quot;. His strength, yorkers and ability to swing the ball both ways, prompted Clive Lloyd to say that he reminded him a little of Waqar Younis. As a child he played in secret, because his father hated cricket. Now he loves expressing his talent in public. Hassan&apos;s aggression and love of wearing bandanas \u2013 with a lick of sunblock on his cheek \u2013 have led to him being described as the &quot;Rambo of Afghanistan cricket&quot;. He has been included in the squad despite fitness concerns. Hassan was badly injured playing for an Associate and Affiliate XI against England in Dubai in January, when he dismissed Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott during a lively spell, and has bowled only a handful of overs in the past eight months. In his absence, Dawlat Zadran has been Afghanistan&apos;s premier new-ball bowler: he was the only non-Irishman included on the five-man shortlist for Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year at last week&apos;s ICC Awards. Fast bowling is probably Afghanistan&apos;s strongest suit, but batting is their most eye-catching. They are not especially savvy and do not really do nurdling, instead preferring to embrace an unashamed six-addiction. Nabi clouted five in a 22-ball half-century during a warmup against Sri Lanka A on\u00a0Saturday. Overall Afghanistan hit 13 sixes in their 20 overs. It has almost become a cliche to refer to Afghanistan&apos;s cricketers as fearless, yet that is the way they play the game. Nobody exemplifies that more than the hard-hitting opener, Karim Sadiq, who goes after bowlers from the moment the umpire calls &quot;play&quot;. In the final of the World T20 qualifiers against Ireland, he pulled the first ball of the match from Warwickshire&apos;s Boyd Rankin over the\u00a0ropes. When Afghanistan met Pakistan in February, Shahzad reverse swept Saeed Ajmal, the world&apos;s best spinner, for an amazing six. And in a warmup game ahead of the last World T20, Sadiq smashed consecutive short balls from Shoaib Akhtar to the boundary, one of them on to a roof. As Shoaib prepared to share a few four-letter insights, Sadiq got in with the pre-emptive sledge: &quot;This is not club cricket.&quot; It was international cricket, and it is where Afghanistan unquestionably belong.\u2022 This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian&apos;s free weekly cricket email.

Open to all final year undergraduates studying fine art in the UK, the awards total \u00a340,000 a year, or almost twice as much as the Northern Art Prize whose 2013 shortlist was reported by Alan Sykes in the Guardian Northerner this week. The gift of art collector Wee Teng Woon, an arts graduate of Northumbria University who recalls his student days with affection, the Woon Foundation Painting and Sculpture Art Prizes will be based at the university and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. Wee Teng Woon lives mostly in Singapore but also has a home in county Durham and greatly likes the beauty and character of the north east. Founded in memory of members of his family, the prizes area headed by a top award, the Woon Tai Jee Art Fellowship \u2013 which is a \u00a320,000 bursary to pay for a Fellowship at the BxNU Institute for Contemporary Art at Baltic 39 in Newcastle. Its holder will be given studio space at Baltic 39 and partnership with &apos;a high-profile and experienced mentor.&apos; The annual awards will also include the Lim Ai Fang Art Prize worth \u00a39,000 and the Cheong Kam Hee Art Prize worth \u00a36,000. Two consolation prizes of \u00a33,000 and \u00a32,000 will be given at the discretion of the judging panel. Woon says:   This award is about recognising new talent while also enhancing the standing of the North East in the arts world. I wanted to set up an award for emerging artists that complements other major art prizes in the UK and supports their art practice, career and early professional development.      A fan of the north and one who is giving generously back: Wee Teng Woon with Northumbria's pro-vice chancellor Lucy Winskell    \u00a0Dr Heather Robson, associate dean in the Faculty of Arts, Design and Social Sciences at Northumbria, welcomes the gift:  This generous offer to emerging talent is a tremendous boost to the arts scene in the North East. It will promote the region&apos;s standing in the arts world as well as providing the winner with an unrivalled opportunity to work in a community of academics and artists at the BxNU Institute of Contemporary Art.  The nationwide entry qualification, wider than the Northern Art Prize limit of artists living and working in the north of England, is seen as a way of attracting talent to the north east, as well as encouraging that already there. The Economist newspaper last week argued that tempting professionals and creative talent north would be a powerful way of easing the worsening effects of the north-south divide. The prize money also matches that of the Turner Prize whose presentation in 2011 at the Baltic was a major fillip for the north east. The judges will form a panel of artists from the region, the UK and overseas and all shortlisted entrants will be asked to take part in an exhibition at Northumbria university in 2013. Entries can now be submitted - the application form is here - and the deadline is 30 January 2013.\u00a0For more information, or to submit an application, contact Barry Nicholson, from the Region, Engagement and Partnerships Office, on (0191) 227 4651 or email\u00a0woonartprize@northumbria.ac.uk. \u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/sep/20/exporting-to-new-markets-allen-ip", "sentences": ["Our main export markets are Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, Russia and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-20T13:43:24Z", "title": "Exporting: Allen IP", "tags": ["Best practice: Exporting", "Best practice exchange"], "article": "Name: Allen IP City: Birmingham Website: http://www.allenip.com/  Allen IP provide UK, European, and international patent, trademark and design services.  It was always our goal to export overseas, but it seems particularly appropriate in the current economic climate where some overseas countries are exhibiting an increasing share of worldwide IP filings compared to our home market. Our main export markets are Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, Russia and Singapore. It is fairly straightforward to export services to these countries, much more so than exporting a product where you often need permissions and physical storage and distribution means. I have identified and qualified several contacts in overseas markets and made an effort to establish relationships with them. Communication can sometimes take longer so a degree of patience is required. In my field, you sometimes have an inquiry from a foreign attorney asking for a quick quote or brief piece of advice on behalf of their client, and for whatever reason their client may not proceed. As long as they are reasonable, I take a long term view of such inquiries. You may hear nothing for some time, but when the foreign attorney has another firmer inquiry they&apos;ll come back to you if your advice has been creditable. Feedback from clients is that our success can be partly attributed to clients having continuity of service from a single qualified European patent attorney.  In the IP industry, one benefit of solid relationships with export partners is that they can be useful when it comes to acquiring overseas IP rights on behalf of UK-based clients.

If P\u00e9rez has not caught McLaren&apos;s eye, then the Woking-based outfit are unique among Formula One&apos;s dozen teams. The Mexican, who came seventh on his Formula One debut last year and has driven his Sauber to three podium finishes this season, finished a thrilling second last time out in Monza. He is ninth in the championship table with 65 points, 30 ahead of his team-mate Kamui Kobayashi, whose own pace and eye-popping overtaking manoeuvres have long since persuaded the wary to keep an eye on their mirrors. P\u00e9rez, 22, said: &quot;I feel ready to do a good job for a top team, to be able to fight for the title. In that respect I feel ready.&quot; P\u00e9rez has been linked with McLaren despite the team principal Martin Whitmarsh&apos;s assertion that there is no Plan B if they fail to re-sign Hamilton. The Sauber man added: &quot;In the position I am in, when I have a good result because I am fighting for points and sometimes able to get some good podiums, it is when rumours start. There are so many rumours. Before it was Ferrari, now it is McLaren. So always when I have a good race they put me in a different team.&quot; P\u00e9rez has become used to being linked with Ferrari but that team&apos;s president, Luca di Montezemolo, last week distanced himself from the speculation when he said the driver needed &quot;more experience&quot;. In return P\u00e9rez appeared to distance himself from the prancing horse. When asked whether his connection with Ferrari could preclude a move anywhere else he said, a little airily: &quot;No, not really. I have a nice connection to Ferrari through the Ferrari Academy but I am just part of the academy, not part of the Ferrari team, so it does not affect me.&quot; Hamilton, meanwhile, was in no mood to field any more questions about his immediate future. &quot;I am here to talk about this weekend,&quot; he said. &quot;I have no more news so there is no more need to even bother asking the questions you are constantly asking me. Let&apos;s discuss something else.&quot; There is always a slightly surreal atmosphere in the heat of the night in Singapore. It is as if the night riders of the Marina Bay street circuit, and everyone else, are intoxicated by the sweltering humidity. This is the annual nocturnal race, though the 1,500 halogen lamps, which seem to add to the oppressive temperatures, make it brighter than daylight in some countries. But it is more than just the heat and the late hour of the activity \u2013 we are seven hours ahead here, but everyone sticks to a European timetable. We are also close to the season&apos;s run-in, when speculation and rumour in this most gossipy of sports achieves an even greater intensity. And Singapore, perhaps more than any other venue, is where business folk gather and thrash out deals; Monaco for the champagne, Singapore for the dosh. Hamilton was in a bountiful mood, though, regarding this season, compared with his subdued demeanor in Italy, after winning for the second time in three races. He is now second in the championship, 37 points behind Fernando Alonso. McLaren, it seemed, was the only team one could possibly drive for \u2013 they have won the last three races. &quot; We have always been a team that has been able to turn things around even if we start badly,&quot; he said. &quot;When we had troubles in the pit-stops we eventually got it right. You trust the people you are working with \u2013 there has to be a lot of trust in every team. When the driver is going around the track at 200mph, you have to have confidence the team has done a good job, which I have always had.&quot; But does he have more confidence in Mercedes? That is the question."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/21/blackberry-outage-europe-rim-confirms", "sentences": ["In Hong Kong and Singapore, buyers had to sign up online for the chance to pick up the device at a prearranged time."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-21T11:20:38Z", "title": "BlackBerry outage hits Europe", "tags": ["BlackBerry", "BlackBerry corporation", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Europe", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "Apple", "iPhone 5"], "article": "It was a case of worst possible timing as BlackBerry maker Research In Motion (RIM) confirmed it had suffered a significant outage across Europe on Friday morning, just as the iPhone 5 was launching to the now familiar queues in Apple stores around the world. Vodafone customers across Europe, the Middle East and Africa experienced difficulties with BlackBerry Messenger, email and the internet for more than four hours from 8am (BST), with owner RIM admitting that difficulties with its smartphone continued until about 12.30pm. The company tweeted: &quot;Some users in Europe, Middle East and Africa are experiencing issues with their BlackBerry service.&quot; And an hour later it tweeted again: &quot;We are investigating and apologise for any inconvenience.&quot; Service was fully restored about 12.30pm, four-and-a-half hours after the BlackBerry service went down, the company said. &quot;Our apologies to any customers impacted by the BlackBerry service issue today. We can confirm that services have been restored and are now operating normally,&quot; RIM said in a statement. The glitch was only affecting Vodafone users, a RIM spokeswoman in London said. &quot;We are currently experiencing a BlackBerry service issue impacting some users in Europe, Middle East and Africa. All relevant support teams are working to resolve the issue. We apologise to any customers who may be affected.&quot; The outage was not expected to be as damaging as the one RIM suffered last year when BlackBerrys were hobbled for several days. But the timing is far from ideal as Apple continue to lap up worldwide publicity with the much-hyped launch of its iPhone 5. In a now familiar global ritual, Apple fans queued outside shops from Sydney to Tokyo to pick up the tech juggernaut&apos;s latest iPhone. Eager buyers formed long lines on Friday at Apple stores in Australia and Japan to be the first to get their hands on the latest version of the smartphone. In Hong Kong and Singapore, buyers had to sign up online for the chance to pick up the device at a prearranged time. The first customers in Hong Kong were greeted by staff cheering, clapping, and chanting &quot;iPhone 5! iPhone 5!&quot; and high-fiving them as they were escorted one-by-one through the front door. Apple&apos;s new smartphone is also being launched in the US, Britain, Canada, France and Germany. It will go on sale in 22 more countries a week later. The iPhone 5 is thinner, lighter, has a taller screen, faster processor, updated software and can work on faster fourth generation mobile networks. The iPhone 5 has become a hot seller despite initial lukewarm reviews and controversy over its decision to dump Google Maps from its standard collection of pre-loaded apps and replace it with its own map app which has been criticised for losing towns, moving zoos and renaming key locations such as Paddington railway station in London. Apple received 2m orders in the first 24 hours of announcing the iPhone 5 release date, more than twice the number for the iPhone 4S in the same period when that phone launched a year ago, and analysts estimate it will ship as many as 10m by the end of September. The controversy over the decision to drop Google Maps is threatening to overshadow the launch as complaints flood in from users.

In the first session Vettel and Hamilton were separated by less than a tenth of a second and they finished ahead of Jenson Button and Alonso. There was some predictably nervous running in the first 30 minutes before Hamilton and Vettel swapped blows at the top of the leaderboard. In the second session Vettel was once again dominant, this time finishing ahead of Button, Alonso and Mark Webber. But this time Vettel was more than three tenths ahead of Button. The second session may have had greater meaning for Sunday&apos;s race, because it was run in dry conditions. The two form cars, the McLarens of Hamilton and Button, dominated the early action but the Red Bulls of Vettel and Mark Webber soon took in turns to go top.

He told Hannah Gould: &quot;We did a wonderful project in 2010, when the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Winter Olympics game was released and we had a video project with a school in Canada. The Canadian teacher we spoke with kept her kids in school all night for a kind of sleepover and when they connected to us at 6am their time, it was 3.30pm and we had kept our kids back after close. The fascinating thing about this was that our kids thought it was a project about the Olympics, but really it was about connecting rural communities across the world, with all kind of lessons about citizenship. The teachers then applied the experience to lessons on time zones, which is something children really struggle with. All of this came from the contextual hub of the computer game. The learning had little to do with the Winter Olympics game but it provided a stimulus to get children excited about learning.&quot; You can almost feel the excitement anticipation from this snippet. Students up all night, eagerly waiting to play - and hopefully thrash - their peers at a school in Canada.

After 13 rounds there are five drivers, realistically, still standing. And the three favourites are, appropriately, the three best: Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, driving the three best cars. There are a number of prominent people in F1 who have described this as the best season ever. They should know better: results were simply too random early in the season. But in recent weeks the coherent narrative the season so badly needed has emerged to present us with a compelling finale and, despite all the tinkering with the regulations, the cream has risen inexorably to the top. Kimi Raikkonen has not won a race in his Lotus yet but he is a single point behind second-placed Hamilton. Can he go one better than Keke Rosberg, who won the 1982 title with just one victory? Probably not. Fifth-placed Mark Webber&apos;s results have fallen away since he signed a new contract with Red Bull so it looks like being a shootout between the most consistent driver, Alonso, the fastest and most gifted, Hamilton, and the double world champion, Vettel. Alonso is the most complete driver but it is McLaren who have the momentum, having won the past three races, with Hamilton topping the podium twice. Martin Brundle, lead commentator for Sky F1 HD, says: &quot;I think Fernando is going to have to fight hard to keep ahead in this championship. But the one driver-car combination that could be there every weekend from here on in is Lewis and McLaren, provided Lewis&apos;s head isn&apos;t scrambled by other matters. Fernando needs two things: help from his team-mate, Felipe Massa, and McLaren, Red Bull and Mercedes sharing points. But it&apos;s Fernando&apos;s title to lose.&quot; Singapore, Sunday 23 September F1 debut 2008 Laps 61 Last year&apos;s winner Sebastian Vettel The only night event on the calendar is a steamy street race that lasts almost two hours. But it&apos;s spectacular, too, and the drivers love it. A big downforce track so Red Bull should be better here. Brundle&apos;s verdict: &quot;My money is on Lewis here. This is a pivotal weekend, a critical weekend.&quot; Japan, 7 October F1 debut 1987 Laps 53 Last year&apos;s winner Jenson Button Fast and flowing, Suzuka is a figure-of-eight thriller, a classic circuit that is also one of the favourites among the drivers. Brundle&apos;s verdict: &quot;This is a chassis circuit, a driver&apos;s circuit. Again I fancy Lewis, but if it&apos;s wet Fernando and Seb could also be strong.&quot; Korea, 14 October F1 debut 2010 Laps 55 Last year&apos;s winner Sebastian Vettel The industrial port of Mokpo is nobody&apos;s favourite and this race could be living on borrowed time. But the track is a challenge with a fast first sector. Brundle&apos;s verdict: &quot;There is a very long straight here and Red Bull are hopeless in a straight line. So Lewis or Fernando for me.&quot; India, 28 October F1 debut 2011 Laps 60 Last year&apos;s winner Sebastian Vettel Last year&apos;s track was only put together at the last minute but it was judged a success and very quick in places. Brundle&apos;s verdict: &quot;Difficult to pick. The thing really is that the cars are so good they don&apos;t have favourite and least favourite tracks any more.&quot;   Abu Dhabi, 4 November F1 debut 2009 Laps 55 Last year&apos;s winner Lewis Hamilton This lavish venue beside the desert may lack tradition but it&apos;s a very technical and challenging circuit. Brundle&apos;s verdict: &quot;Again, there is a long back straight, which Red Bull won&apos;t like.&quot; USA, 18 November F1 debut 2012 Laps TBA Last year&apos;s winner N/A An unknown track but drivers have been impressed by what they have seen of Austin, Texas, on the simulator \u2013 plenty of undulations and a few reminders of the best bits of other circuits. Brundle&apos;s verdict: &quot;Should be a typical new-style circuit. It could be predictable.&quot; Brazil, 25 November F1 debut 1973 Laps 71 Last year&apos;s winner Mark Webber The great Interlagos is short on lap distance but full of atmosphere. It is simply the favourite race of the season for most people. Brundle&apos;s verdict: &quot;It can throw up surprises. It can be bumpy and slippery, part wet and part dry, a real lottery of it goes this far.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/21/f1-2013-british-grand-prix-silverstone", "sentences": ["Singapore and Korea, in the last year of their current contract with the FIA, have been pencilled in for the 2013 provisional itinerary, which was announced on Friday.", "2013 Formula 1 calendar (provisional) March: 17 March Australia (Melbourne); 24 March Malaysia (Sepang); April: 14 April China (Shanghai); 21 April Bahrain (Sakhir); May: 12 May Spain (Barcelona); 26 May Monaco (Monte Carlo); Canada: 9 June Canada (Montreal); 16 June America (New Jersey)*; 30 June Britain (Silverstone); July: 21 July Germany (N\u00fcrburgring)*; 28 July Hungary (Hungaroring); September: 1 September Belgium (Spa); 8 September Italy (Monza); 22 September Singapore (Marina Bay)*; October: 6 October Japan (Suzuka); 13 October South Korea (Yeongam)*; 27 October India (Buddh International Circuit); November: 3 November Abu Dhabi (Yas Marina); 17 November United States (Austin); 24 November Brazil (Interlagos)."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-21T19:11:43Z", "title": "F1 switches 2013 British Grand Prix date from July to last day in June", "tags": ["Formula One", "British Grand Prix", "Silverstone", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Singapore and Korea, in the last year of their current contract with the FIA, have been pencilled in for the 2013 provisional itinerary, which was announced on Friday.

According to reports last week, Hamilton has been offered just two-thirds of his current \u00a315m-a-year deal by McLaren, while Mercedes are believed to have offered more than \u00a320m. Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren&apos;s team principal, admitted on Friday night: &quot;I am sure he will want more money and I am sure we will want to pay him less. That is how business normally works.&quot; Whitmarsh also seemed to suggest that the signing of Hamilton was not one of McLaren&apos;s top priorities, saying: &quot;It seems a long time because of the speculation that people have made but when you sit down and seriously put your mind to entering into a new contract it doesn&apos;t take too long. I think it is a question of priorities and other things we have been doing.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s immediate future has once again dominated the agenda in Singapore before Sunday&apos;s race, with the driver apparently undecided over whether he should leave the team that have guided him for more than half his life. A decision is expected in the next fortnight. Meanwhile, Jenson Button has spoken up for the eye-catching abilities of Sergio P\u00e9rez, one of Hamilton&apos;s potential replacements. P\u00e9rez says he is ready to drive for a leading team and Button, who has already championed the cause of another potential team-mate, Paul Di Resta, spoke up for P\u00e9rez when he said: &quot;I think he is a quick learner. A guy who can look after his tyres as well as he does is not stupid. He learns well. I don&apos;t know what he is like setting up a car but he can&apos;t be bad if he&apos;s doing as well he is.&quot; Button, who is professionally but not socially close to Hamilton, is not reticent about speculating over who may replace Hamilton. At one point he appeared to nominate Di Resta&apos;s Force India team-mate, Nico H\u00fclkenberg. &quot;I would like as my team-mate the Incredible Hulk, he&apos;s amazing!&quot; he said, but he was referring to the comic character. He added: &quot;I just love the speculation when it is not about me. I had so much of it in my career, especially back in 2004-05.&quot; Button has said that he has not often been friendly with his co-driver and he commented: &quot;It is not important if you are friendly with them. You want someone who is quick and experienced. You don&apos;t want a newcomer stepping into the car next year.&quot; Despite all the talk of a transfer \u2013 and some of it has clearly turned Hamilton&apos;s head \u2013 it is still very possible that he will decide to remain where he is. That would be the sensible outcome, from a purely racing point of view. In fact it&apos;s a no-brainer. But Hamilton can hardly have been encouraged from the noises he heard coming from his employers yesterday evening. Sebastian Vettel topped both practice sessions here on Friday after heavy rain had fallen on the Marina Bay street circuit. For a double world champion and the man who won here last time out it is remarkable how Vettel has been under the radar for most of this week, as attention has focused on the current leader, Fernando Alonso, and Hamilton, his closest pursuer. In the first session Vettel and Hamilton were separated by less than a tenth of a second, and they finished ahead of Button and Alonso. In the second, drier session Vettel was again dominant, this time finishing ahead of Button, Alonso and Mark Webber. The Red Bulls should be stronger here than they have been of late."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2012/sep/22/secret-teacher-spending-cuts-workloads-long-hours", "sentences": ["Our best graduate teachers are lining up to take up posts in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai; competitive salaries, all expenses paid accommodation, flights home for Christmas and a juicy tax-free bonus can&apos;t be argued with now can it?"], "publicationDate": "2012-09-22T07:00:00Z", "title": "Secret Teacher: spending cuts and 90% timetables stop us making a difference", "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Education", "Schools"], "article": "Five years ago my fellow PGCE students and I met with the then minister for schools, Lord Adonis. We were bubbling with energy and enthusiasm for the career we were about to enter. He questioned us with interest, keen to find out if the Labour government incentives were working to entice the best the UK has to offer into a career of teaching. As Oxbridge PGCE students we certainly felt we fitted that mould; already established as accountants, journalists and PhD qualified scientists, we had all chosen to enter this profession to help to build the future society, really make a difference to the lives of children today. That was five years ago and sadly the reality of the profession has taken its effects. Even though we had gained our PhD on the former TDA&apos;s highest rated PGCE course, numbers actually working as state school teachers five years on are depressing. Some were quick to jump ship into the private sector \u2013 and with longer holidays, better pay and conditions, smaller class sizes and less behaviour issues, who can blame them? Even worse, some have fled to international schools. Our best graduate teachers are lining up to take up posts in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai; competitive salaries, all expenses paid accommodation, flights home for Christmas and a juicy tax-free bonus can&apos;t be argued with now can it? Others have left teaching altogether. They swapped other people&apos;s children for their own, went back to university to study something else or are using the multiple skills they have gained in a short period teaching to rise through the ranks of an easier job. A few like me are still holding on though. Since the change in government, the notion that I can actually make a difference is feeling more and more futile. Hidden cuts to schools are taking their toll.  Teaching jobs are not being filled on resignation, leading to rising class sizes and teachers on maximum timetables. Classes of 32 on a 90% timetable does not give me the opportunity to be the teacher I really want to be. To mark more than 200 books and homework tasks, and to give the work the time and feedback it deserves would take thousands of hours. The notion that I can deliver outstanding lessons hour after hour after hour with five hours of planning time a fortnight is ludicrous and even devoting every evening and weekend to the job only touches upon what I would actually have to do to be a really good teacher. On top of that there is the reports, the meetings, the phone calls home, the planning of school trips, the &apos;voluntary&apos; revision sessions and the extra detentions. The result? A state of permanent near exhaustion.  The students are astute to adult weakness. They can smell a poor night&apos;s sleep a mile off so even if I have planned them the best lesson, chances that I can deliver it in a satisfactory way under these conditions are unlikely. Yet one day I still hope that I can make a difference. I wonder how many of my elite university peers will still be doing this in another five years time? Or maybe those of us that have stayed will have escaped the throes of being a main scale teacher and risen to the lighter timetabled ranks of SLT and will have finally found job satisfaction?

Hamilton achieved his third pole in four races for Sunday&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix. It was his fifth of the season and the 24th of his career. It was also the first time since 1999 that McLaren have secured four poles in a row. &quot;He&apos;s creating barriers around him \u2013 he realises the championship is achievable,&quot; Whitmarsh said. &quot;He has been strong all weekend. He&apos;s driven perfectly.&quot; On the day it was announced that Singapore had extended its F1 contract until 2017, Hamilton had a memorable battle with Red Bull&apos;s Sebastian Vettel, but in the end the German went quicker in Q2 than Q3 and the pair were divided by the Williams of Pastor Maldonado, who will line up with the McLaren man on the front row. Vettel had to make do with third place, ahead of Jenson Button in fourth, who was followed by Fernando Alonso and Paul Di Resta. But Hamilton, who was almost half a second quicker than Maldonado, was the only topic in town, as he has been for most of the year, over his plans for next season. He just did not look particularly pleased. &quot;The guys have done a fantastic job all week,&quot; he said with a shrug and a half-smile. &quot;Sebastian was incredibly fast through most of the sessions so I&apos;m very happy that I managed to pull that time out at the end. Trying to find a gap in qualifying is hard and making sure everything is up to temperature is hard too, so I feel very fortunate that I got the time I needed.&quot; At least Vettel had some reason to look subdued. &quot;I&apos;m a little disappointed, especially with Q3,&quot; he said. &quot;Nevertheless, it&apos;s a good place to start from on the grid. The pace is there within the car but we didn&apos;t do the last step in qualifying and it&apos;s a shame it didn&apos;t come together at the end.&quot; Button had struggled, said Whitmarsh. &quot;He had issues with the car,&quot; he said. Marussia&apos;s Charles Pic became the first F1 driver to be handed a &quot;community service&quot; penalty. The 22-year-old Frenchman overtook under red flags in the closing stages of qualifying and will have 20 seconds added to his race time. But in a groundbreaking step the stewards have also ordered Pic and his race engineer to perform a day of community service for the FIA&apos;s Action for Road Safety campaign at the instruction of Jean Todt, the governing body&apos;s president. Pedro de la Rosa also received a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, but as the Spaniard finished last anyway it made no difference to the grid. If Hamilton wins here on Sunday, his momentum for the title will become almost irresistible. Fernando Alonso may lead the table by 37 points but Hamilton is a fire that is difficult to put out. The week started with talk about a possible move to Mercedes and it has ended that way too. Mercedes, it seems, are ready to pay the sport&apos;s major box-office attraction more than \u00a320m a year over three years. McLaren, meanwhile, have reportedly responded by offering to cut his pay by a third, from his current, expiring deal of \u00a360m over five years. McLaren admitted on Friday night that they wanted him to take less money. Hamilton, after driving so brilliantly, certainly wore the expression of a man who had been asked to take a pay cut. For a great driver, at the very peak of his powers, that would certainly be difficult to take, however bizarre has been his behaviour recently, and whatever the financial climate is right now. When he was asked whether he felt confident that the team was still behind him he replied: &quot;Yes, 100 \u2013 no, 1,000% confident. I have 1,000% confidence in my team.&quot; Life is a much more sedate affair in Camp Button. Unlikely to win the title this year, Button talked more about the constructors&apos; championship, a title McLaren last won in 1998. &quot;It&apos;s crazy,&quot; said Button. &quot;When you think, a team like this. Amazing. It&apos;s a really long time. The constructors&apos; title is important because it means so much to the team. And we love winning and doing a better job than the rest of the paddock. &quot;I&apos;ve only been here for two and a half years. A lot of the guys who are working in the team have been here a whole period of time when they haven&apos;t won the constructors, so it&apos;s so important to them. They&apos;ve grown up with this team. And that&apos;s the great thing about McLaren. They don&apos;t really pick and choose people from other teams. They nurture them. You gain experience here. So for them to win the constructors&apos; would be massive.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/23/lewis-hamilton-f1-singapore-grand-prix", "sentences": ["Lewis Hamilton&apos;s world championship bid, which appeared to have developed an irresistible momentum, looks to be in ruins after he dropped out of the Singapore Grand Prix with more than half the race remaining."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-23T14:48:33Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton's F1 title chase hits buffers at Singapore Grand Prix", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One 2012", "Fernando Alonso", "Formula One", "Jenson Button", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton&apos;s world championship bid, which appeared to have developed an irresistible momentum, looks to be in ruins after he dropped out of the Singapore Grand Prix with more than half the race remaining. Hamilton came to a standstill with mechanical trouble on the 23rd lap. &quot;We have a gearbox failure,&quot; said a race engineer. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, we did everything we could yesterday.&quot; Hamilton was looking to cut into the championship leader Fernando Alonso&apos;s 37-point lead in the 2012 F1 championship lead. But now he is 52 points behind the Spaniard with just six races remaining. Sebastian Vettel won here, just as he did last year, and has now replaced Hamilton as Alonso&apos;s closest challenger, 29 points behind. Before the race, which was ended on the two-hour cut-off because the cars did not have time to complete the 61 laps, Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, said he had never seen Vettel so focused. It could be 2010 all over again, with the German now within sight of a hat-trick of titles. For Hamilton, though, he is either winning or retiring at the moment. Having won two of the previous three races he has now failed to finish four times in seven outings. That&apos;s more retirements than Frank Sinatra. He is back in fourth place in the table. This was also the fourth time in five races that McLaren, the form horse in terms of the pace of their car, have failed to bring both cars home. But there was some consolation for the team, with Jenson Button taking second place at the Marina Bay street circuit, ahead of Alonso, Paul di Resta, Nico Rosberg and Kimi Raikkonen. It was also the best career result for Di Resta, which is sweet timing for the Force India driver, who is being linked with a drive with one of the big teams. But there was yet another disappointment for Rosberg&apos;s Mercedes team-mate Michael Schumacher, who failed to make the finish for the seventh time this season. This time he crashed into the back of Jean-Eric Vergne \u2013 the oldest driver on the circuit colliding with the youngest. When the celebratory post-race fireworks went off in the warm night air they might have been going off for Alonso. Every time he looks behind there seems to be someone else in second place, which is just as he likes it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/23/mayfair-cork-street-development-threat", "sentences": ["Cork Street has been killed off by the greed of the landlords.&quot; Under another deal announced in August, a 7,700 sq m (83,000 sq ft) site at 29-30 Burlington Street, which includes a stretch of Cork Street, will be bought by an international partnership made up of developer Native Land \u2013 45% owned by Qatari investors linked to the royal family, Singapore company Hotel Properties Limited (HPL) and Malaysian investment firm Amcorp."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-23T15:52:54Z", "title": "Mayfair's Cork Street art hub under threat from developers", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Arts policy", "Politics", "Culture", "London", "UK news", "Communities", "Society"], "article": "Half the galleries in one of London&apos;s most important art hubs face being forced out with the announcement of a second multimillion-pound property development on Mayfair&apos;s Cork Street.

If approved, the project could be completed by late 2016. The proposals come six weeks after seven galleries on the opposite side of the street were given notice to leave as early as next year. Their landlord, the British insurance firm Standard Life Investments, has agreed a \u00a390m deal to redevelop the building as luxury apartments designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners, the architects of the Candy brothers&apos; One Hyde Park. A spokesman for Pollen Estate said the proposals would provide new office, retail and art gallery spaces behind existing facades. He added: &quot;Gallery owners affected \u2026 are being consulted beforehand to give them a first-hand opportunity to comment and for us to listen to feedback on the design proposals.&quot; But gallery owner Bernard Jacobson said: &quot;They showed us these gorgeous plans and then said, &apos;By the way goodbye and thanks for being a good tenant&apos;. &quot;I&apos;ve been forced out.

The report from the campaign group Oceana warns of growing food insecurity, especially for poorer people, from the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic to the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, Eritrea, Guyana, Indonesia, Kuwait and Singapore. Some of the countries at highest risk were in oil-rich \u2013 and politically volatile \u2013 regions. &quot;The Persian Gulf is actually expected to be one of the hardest-hit regions. In terms of fish catch, they are supposed to lose over 50% of their fisheries,&quot; said Matt Huelsenbeck, an Oceana marine scientist and author of the report. The report put Iran, Libya, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates among the top 10 countries most at risk because of the decline in fish stocks due to climate change. &quot;There are definitely tens of thousands of artisanal fishermen operating in the Persian Gulf and they will be hardest hit by the impacts,&quot; he said. The United States is expected to lose about 12% of its catch potential by the middle of the century, the report said. The study used climate models created by the University of British Columbia to rank countries&apos; exposure to degradation of the oceans due to climate change and ocean acidification. Low-income countries, with high levels of malnutrition and rapid population growth, such as Pakistan, were viewed as high risk. So were small island states that depend heavily on coral reef fisheries and on conches, oysters, clams and other shellfish. About 1 billion people depend on seafood as their main source of protein. But some of those countries most dependent on fishing are expected to lose up to 40% of their fish catch by the middle of the century. The changes in ocean chemistry, when sea water absorbs rising levels of carbon dioxide, have upset the balance of marine life. Coral reefs in the Caribbean are on the verge of collapse. Oysters and clams are unable to produce their hard protective shells. Meanwhile, rising temperatures are driving fish species from the tropics towards deeper and colder waters. The study looked at potential impacts in mid-century. But the first effects of climate change and the changing ocean chemistry are already evident, however, in Kenya, where the loss of coral reefs is pushing down fish stocks, and on the US Pacific coast, where oyster beds have died off in Oregon. \u2022 This article was amended to remove references to the &quot;Persian&quot; Gulf in accordance with the Guardian and Observer style guide, which specifies that the region should be termed &quot;the Gulf, not the Persian or Arabian Gulf&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/24/downton-abbey-andrew-marr", "sentences": ["Earlier in the day, coverage of the Singapore Grand Prix averaged 443,000 and a 3.3% share on Sky Sports F1 between 11.30am and 4.15pm."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-24T09:50:47Z", "title": "Downton Abbey outclasses Andrew Marr's History of the World | TV ratings \u2013 23 September", "tags": ["TV ratings", "Television industry", "Media"], "article": "Andrew Marr returned to BBC1 on Sunday night with just more than 3 million viewers for his History of the World, losing out to Downton Abbey.

They expect their driver to stay, probably making a decision within the week, even though the new offer is still short of what Hamilton is currently paid. The anticipated success is why McLaren executives left Singapore on Sunday looking a little more relaxed than they were entitled to after Hamilton retired on the 23rd lap when in the lead. It could have been his third victory in four outings but the retirement dropped him from second to fourth in the championship table, where he trails Fernando Alonso by 52 points. McLaren, though, believe they have won the more important competition to secure the services of Hamilton over the next three years. His existing contract, which ends in November, is often reported to be \u00a375m over five years, or \u00a315m a year, but is believed to be a little less than that. According to sources at McLaren, the money on offer from Mercedes is not as substantial as the \u00a320m a year that has been reported. It is fair to say that Mercedes, who hold a board meeting on Wednesday, have been prepared to match McLaren&apos;s terms, with more money on offer through image rights. Mercedes pay Michael Schumacher, who at 43 has failed to finish seven of his races this year, \u00a316m. The deal to secure Hamilton is still not complete and, according to the Formula One commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, Hamilton had at one point decided to join Mercedes. Ecclestone said on Monday: &quot;I don&apos;t think Hamilton knows what he will do. These last couple or three races he has been doing very well. Before that, why he was upset I don&apos;t know but he was definitely going to move no matter what. He had made up his mind that he was going. Whether he has changed now I don&apos;t know.&quot; Many at McLaren had also concluded their driver was to switch to Mercedes but Hamilton has been impressed by the renewed competitive qualities of the car that until Sunday&apos;s breakdown saw him emerge as Alonso&apos;s strongest challenger. McLaren, with whom Hamilton won his only world title in 2008, have won more races this season (five) than any other team. Moreover, there are no opportunities at the other two big teams, Ferrari and Red Bull. Jenson Button, second in Singapore but out of the championship race, said that McLaren are throwing away points. &quot;It was not a bad result for me personally but I am sure that the team is disappointed.&quot; Button, who failed to finish the previous race in Italy because of fuel pump problems, added: &quot;The team is doing such a good job in every other area. Two failures in two races is not what McLaren is about. We have to solve these issues. The pace is there, so that is why it&apos;s tough, because we&apos;re throwing away a lot of points. That&apos;s 43 points we have lost [in two races].&quot; Despite an impressive run of form \u2013 McLaren have won four successive poles for the first time since 1999 and almost made it four wins in a row \u2013 Button, surprisingly, feels his team are still playing catchup. &quot;I don&apos;t think we have the best car. We are very strong in qualifying but Red Bull have good pace. They will be very competitive now. Fernando has not just got the McLarens too worry about, he has the Red Bulls and that makes it tough for him.

It has sold 152m shares in Cairn India in the market for $910m, representing 8% of the business and leaving it with a 10% shareholding. Last year Cairn sold a controlling stake in the Indian business to Vedanta Resources for $8.7bn. Cairn closed 2.3p lower at 282.7p while Vedanta finished 9p lower at \u00a310.47, down with the rest of the mining sector.

On Monday the US group created a new mining unit and said it was on the lookout for acquisitions. Weir, whose oil and gas division could already be seen as attractive to the likes of GE, also has a minerals business. Oriel Securities was one broker to suggest Weir could be on GE&apos;s shopping list. So after a 1.7% decline in its shares on Monday, Weir rose 70p to \u00a318.11.

But it is him, not the current unity government, who threatens the future of the island&apos;s &quot;hard-won liberal democracy&quot;. I should know: I served as a special adviser under both him and President Mohammed Waheed, and have witnessed at first hand Nasheed&apos;s efforts to topple the government by direct action. Nasheed is popular with the international media, has been a vocal champion of the climate change cause and has friends in high places, notably in the Conservative party. He is extremely close to the foreign secretary William Hague, and just before his fall from grace, David Cameron reportedly described him as his &quot;new best friend&quot;. Nasheed has often stated that he was\u00a0tortured and illegally imprisoned under the former President Gayoom. Yet\u00a0when in power he behaved in exactly the same way when he illegally arrested the chief judge after he passed a ruling he did not like. In his article Nasheed repeats the claim that he was forced from office by a coup, and that a bunch of extremists &quot;orchestrated February&apos;s overthrow of the Maldives&apos; first democratically elected government&quot;. Unfortunately the facts do not bear out this assertion. An exhaustive report by the Commonwealth last month found there was no coup, and that in fact Nasheed resigned voluntarily. The inquiry took six months to compile and interviewed nearly 300 witnesses who gave more than 200 hours of statements. Nasheed&apos;s accusation of a coup was\u00a0reported around the world, but when the evidence didn&apos;t stack up, large sections of the media chose to ignore an inconvenient truth. Crucially, at the time the report was published, its conclusions were also accepted by\u00a0Nasheed. In a recent speech to the Royal Commonwealth Society he claims that there was a &quot;cover-up&quot;. If so, the cover-up includes a professor of constitutional law from Canada, a senior judge with 25 years of experience from New Zealand, and a retired supreme court judge from Singapore, all of whom were on the inquiry panel. When it comes to hyperbole, Nasheed is in a league of his own. A large pinch of salt is need when considering his article&apos;s claim that &quot;Numerous members of parliament from my party, the Maldives Democratic party, have been taken before pliant judges and stripped of their seats&quot;, or previous claims that he was &quot;forced to resign at gunpoint&quot;. The facts are that on 7 February 2012, confronted with serious unrest over his illegal arrest of the chief judge, Nasheed resigned on his own volition and then, belatedly realising what he had done, tried to claim it was a coup in order to court international sympathy and media coverage. This leaves a lot of unanswered questions about his judgment as a person, suitability as candidate, and credibility as a politician. Nasheed states that he doesn&apos;t want\u00a0the Maldives to &quot;once again become a police state, and our cherished democracy relegated to a footnote in the history books \u2013 a one-off\u00a0experiment\u00a0that failed&quot;. I agree, and\u00a0would ask him now to work with the unity government to bring peace back to the streets, so that next year we\u00a0can have free and fair\u00a0elections.

The Catlin Seaview Survey will allow internet users to share the discoveries of scientists who are using new technology to study the composition and health of the Great Barrier Reef. Up to 50,000 high-definition panoramic images of the reef will be taken by the world&apos;s first tablet-operated underwater camera and geolocated. When the rapid-fire images are linked together, users will be able to choose a location along the reef, dip underwater and go for a viewer-controlled virtual dive using the street view feature of Google Maps. Dives already completed at three islands on the Great Barrier Reef, as well as sites in Hawaii and the Philippines, will be available today, with more images virtual dive sites added as the scientists map 20 separate reefs along the 2,300km system to a depth of 100m. The imagery will be available to more than 1 billion monthly users of Google Maps around the world, as well as through a dedicated YouTube channel, Google+ and Panoramio, a geolocation photo-sharing website. The survey was launched with a live night dive via a Google+ Hangout at the Blue Ocean film festival in Monterey, California. The three-month survey of the Australian reef system is the first in a series of Catlin Seaview surveys to explore and record the world&apos;s coral reefs. Next year, the expedition will move on to Hawaii, the Philippines and Bermuda. The survey aims to make the underwater experience accessible to the public in a way that has never before been possible, and help bridge the gap between scientific awareness and public knowledge. It is sponsored by the UK-based insurance company Catlin, and backed with technology from Google and support from NGOs, research institutes and the University of Queensland (UQ).           Reading on mobile? Click here for the video&quot;From a scientific point of view, this survey is about getting a baseline record of the world&apos;s coral reefs and how they are being affected by climate change,&quot; said the project&apos;s chief scientist, Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, from the Global Change Institute at UQ. &quot;But it&apos;s also about engaging the public with this issue. Most of us haven&apos;t been lucky enough to dive on a reef but by using these tools, people will know what we mean by the beauty and diversity of our coral reefs.&quot; Around 50% of the world&apos;s coral reefs have been lost in the past 30 years to pollution, overfishing and climate change, which is increasing sea temperatures and elevating levels of ocean acidity. Coral reefs support the lives of millions of people worldwide and a quarter of the world&apos;s marine species, and are an important indicator of the health of the seas. Shallow reef surveys will involve scientists using state-of-the-art digital technology to capture images of the reef that can be linked to create a virtual dive experience. Automated technologies for rapidly assessing the amount of amount of coral cover and other life forms will provide a &quot;baseline&quot; for understanding change. The cameras for the shallow reef survey, the SVII, have been specially designed to take 360-degree, geolocated panoramic images every 4-6 seconds while travelling at 4kph. The deep reef survey will use diving robots and HD cameras to explore and reveal habitats that are rarely visited by humans. In ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef, more than 90% has not been explored because it is more than 40m \u2013 too deep for scuba divers. Scientists will use the deep survey to assess the potential for the deep reef to host &quot;refugee&quot; communities of species under stress because of bleaching and changes in the shallow reef due to climate change. They also hope to discover new species \u2013 a pilot study on Heron Island revealed a new species of pygmy seahorse and four new species of coral. &quot;This is a real opportunity to understand the story of climate change and natural ecosytems, Hoegh-Guldberg said. &quot;At the end of the three-year survey we will have an important snapshot and understanding of the state of coral reefs across the planet.&quot; All of the data gathered will be made public in a database called the Global Reef Record, a &quot;game-changing scientific tool&quot;, according to Hoegh-Guldberg. &quot;We will be able to monitor change in marine environments now and in the future. Marine scientists researching researching any aspect of the reef will be able to study these environments from any of the surveys we conduct \u2013 shallow reef or deep reef.&quot; &quot;We want to make these special underwater locations as accessible to people as the roads and landmarks they explore in Google Maps each day,&quot; said Jenifer Austin Foulkes, Google&apos;s oceans manager.

Budgets and programmes stand or fall on some combination of the funding and pricing regime for public places for domestic students, tapping market demand for private places from international students, competing for research grants with other universities, and attracting third stream income wherever this may be found. Institutional strategies require a much wider-angle lens than previously, with immigration regulations and currency markets now relevant to the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analyses that university plans depend on. In administrative terms, universities have become extremely complex, with more moving parts than the London 2012 Olympics. And as academic enterprises, it&apos;s a given that many of these parts will have minds of their own. So the leadership challenge is large: an external context that keeps shifting, typically, makes internal changes very hard to introduce successfully. In the face of the uncertainties of a mixed economy, Australian university leaders have always argued for much more funding, and much less regulation. But since we know neither may come through, many are also building some version of what we might call an all-purpose, all-weather, multi-platform business model. Curtin University is a case in point. With its main campus in Perth, it is Australia&apos;s largest west coast university. It has 47,000 enrolments in programmes from pre-degree to PhD. One in five of its students is in a postgraduate programme; two in five are international students. Through Curtin College, the university offers pathways into degree study through certificate and diploma programmes. With private operator Navitas, Curtin offers business degrees at its campus in the heart of Sydney on Australia&apos;s east coast. With 10,000 international students onshore and another 9000 offshore, it has more than 3000 studying at its East Malaysian campus at Sarawak, and more than 2000 at its Singapore campus. As a member of Open Universities Australia, Curtin also enrols 16,000 students through this online channel in award and non-award programmess. And in its own right it has launched Curtin Online to make its degrees in humanities and business available through online study. For university managers \u2013 both in Australia and abroad \u2013 these new risks and complexities present both technical and adaptive challenges. Though the world of higher learning is changing rapidly, parts of academia don&apos;t get or want all this change. Many still see university management as an alien import from the corporate sector, and terms such as &apos;business model&apos; part of the problem. We see more anecdotal critique of managerialism than research examining university management as a profession that needs to work in tandem with scholars. For all its insights, the critique of &apos;management as ideology&apos; has become a solution-free zone in a sector that is desperately in need of solutions. Given these factors, it is unsurprising that university staff often step into academic and administrative management roles without much preparation. So what exactly do department heads, programme leaders and administrative managers need? They need to be in touch with the big trends shaping tertiary education and how these affect the outlook for their own institutions. They need a clear grasp of the aims and values that scholars and other professionals bring to the work of a modern university. They need a shared vocabulary and a wide repertoire of management roles and practices. They need a realistic strategy for the future of their institution or department. But just as importantly, they need a clear process for engaging their colleagues in discussing, designing and introducing well-considered changes.

The remarks are contained in instant messages, similar to emails, some of which were sent in the months before RBS was bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds in October 2008. With reforms to Libor expected to be unveiled on Friday, the filings in the Singapore court show how traders around the globe appeared to find it easy to move the interest rate benchmark for at least four years. The filings are part of a sworn statement by Tan Chi Min, senior trader at RBS in Singapore until he was fired last year for attempting to manipulate Libor. The 231-page statement is part of his case for wrongful dismissal, claiming the bank condoned manipulation of the rate and sought out scapegoats. Bloomberg reported that RBS, in a letter dated 29 August 2011, sent Tan copies of instant message chats he had with others as evidence of potential wrongdoing and informing him the bank was bringing disciplinary proceedings against him. In April 2008, Tan sent an instant message to a number of traders, saying: &quot;Nice Libor ...

RBS, 81% owned by the taxpayer, expects to be fined as a result of investigations by a number of regulators. The scale of the penalty is not yet known. Barclays is the highest-profile bank to be penalised so far, with a \u00a3290m fine after regulators in the UK and the US found its traders offered each other bottles of Bollinger champagne for attempting to move the rate. The case also forced chief executive Bob Diamond and other top bankers out of Barclays. While the identities of individuals involved in the Barclays case were concealed, the documents in Singapore offer no such protection, citing messages with a number of former RBS staff and traders at other banks. RBS has asked for the documents to be sealed by the Singapore high court while investigations by the FSA and US regulators such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Justice are completed. But Bloomberg said it had inspected the filings before they were closed to viewing. &quot;Our investigations into submissions, communications and procedures relating to the setting of Libor and other interest rates are ongoing. RBS and its employees continue to cooperate fully with regulators,&quot; RBS said. The process of setting Libor, which determines borrowing costs on $300tn of financial products around the globe, is expected to be overhauled following recommendations to be set out on Friday by Martin Wheatley, top regulator at City watchdog the FSA. The British Bankers&apos; Association is to lose its role in setting the rate to a formal body. It is also expected the rate will be set on levels at which banks have borrowed rather than their predictions. At present a panel of banks is asked the pricethey expect to borrow over 15 periods, from overnight to 12 months, in 10 currencies. The instant messages released in Singapore quote Tan as saying in May 2011, when investigations into Libor had begun: &quot;This whole process would make banks pull out of Libor fixing. &quot;Question is what is illegal? If making money if bank fix it to suits its own books are illegal ... then no point fixing it right?

He would survey the region&apos;s wildlife and ship specimens back to London for sale to museums and wealthy collectors. His financial security rested on the foreign exotica for which Victorians had a seemingly insatiable appetite. The British naturalist amassed thousands of insects and birds during eight years in southeast Asia. And though Wallace&apos;s strange creatures sold for good money back home, the collection had a more profound value. Through studying the animals, Wallace hit on one of the world&apos;s greatest scientific discoveries: the theory of evolution through natural selection. Wallace&apos;s work on the theory, along with major insights into biodiversity, are described in thousands of pages of books, articles, drawings and paintings, which appear together for the first time today, in a web project directed by John van Wyhe, a historian at the National University of Singapore. The Wallace Online project was funded by an anonymous US donor, and comes ahead of next year&apos;s centenary of Wallace&apos;s death. Wallace&apos;s publications were distributed among thousands of magazines and newspapers, and had never been collected together in one place. The project contains 28,000 pages of searchable documents and 22,000 images. They include stunning pictures of blue-throated bee eaters, asian fairy-bluebirds and meticulous drawings of butterflies and beetles.     The new bird of paradise that Wallace discovered, Wallace's standard-wing. Photograph: Wallace Online    Van Wyhe, who directed a similar project for Darwin&apos;s works several years ago, said the Wallace collection was intended as a reliable source of information on the naturalist whose name was so eclipsed by Darwin&apos;s. &quot;This needed to be done for Wallace. He&apos;s far less well known than Darwin, and it&apos;s high time people had reliable material on his work,&quot; van Wyhe said. The history of science is littered with names overlooked, but few so much as Wallace. In July 1858, the first papers on natural selection were read aloud at the Linnean Society in London, one from Darwin, the other from Wallace. Though both men announced the theory at the same time, Darwin&apos;s publication, On the Origin of Species, the following year was the seed of revolution that made senior scientists take notice. The book was not the only factor. Victorian modesty played a part in Wallace&apos;s diminished place in history, and perhaps some deference to what he, a poor and unprivileged man, saw as the great figures of science. &quot;The Victorians were falling over themselves to be more modest than everybody else. Modesty was a high virtue. So Wallace, from the very beginning, referred to it as Darwin&apos;s theory, and he never relented to the end of his life,&quot; said van Wyhe. From 1855, Wallace published a series of articles that came ever closer to declaring the theory of evolution through natural selection. In the midst of a malarial fever, on the island of Ternate in Indonesia, he had a moment of clarity, that many are born, lots die, and only a few survive. He sent an essay from the island to Darwin, who passed it to the great geologist, Charles Lyell, who then proposed it to the Linnean Society alongside an essay from Darwin. &quot;It&apos;s one of the greatest ironies in history. Wallace sends his essay to the one man in the world who has been working on this for 20 years. And Darwin, again the perfect gent, passes it to Lyell, and they decide to publish essays from them both,&quot; said van Wyhe. Wallace&apos;s thorough survey of wildlife led to another breakthrough in 1859, known today as the Wallace line. He noticed that species on either side of an invisible line between Australia and Asia were substantially different, despite being close geographical neighbours. The observation clashed with the thinking of the day, that species were created for their particular environment. Wallace proposed the animals came from two ancient, larger landmasses, a Super Asia and a Super Australia, which had long since sunk beneath the waves. &quot;He couldn&apos;t have imagined plate tectonics, which is the real explanation, and that Australia started out in South America,&quot; said van Wyhe. Among Wallace&apos;s other writings are notes on local cuisine. In a passage on the durian fruit, Wallace describes a large coconut-sized fruit with short, stout spines, liable to fall from trees and cause spectacular wounds to the unwary. &quot;When brought into a house the smell is often so offensive that some persons can never bear to taste it. This was my own case when I first tried it in Malacca, but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater,&quot; he writes. Having declared the taste almost impossible to describe, he offers &quot;a rich butter-like custard, highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it, but intermingled with it come wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, brown sherry, and other incongruities&quot;. In other papers, Wallace laments the rate at which species are being forced to extinction, and makes one of the earliest calls for conservation. He likens species to letters that make up the volumes of Earth&apos;s history, and their loss obliterating an invaluable record of the past. &quot;Future ages will certainly look back upon us as a people so immersed in the pursuit of wealth as to be blind to higher considerations,&quot; he writes from the Malay archipelago in 1863."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/27/britannia-unchained-global-lessons-review", "sentences": ["The comparisons the authors make are also of interest \u2013 praise is given not just to the usual Singapore and South Korea, but also to Brazil and even parts of Europe."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-27T07:00:03Z", "title": "Britannia Unchained: Global Lessons for Growth and Prosperity \u2013 review", "tags": ["Politics", "Books", "Culture", "ConservativeHome", "Conservatives"], "article": "What is the modern Conservative party? How coherent is its ideology? Is it united? Not in the sense of the day-to-day policy skirmishes around David Cameron, but rather at the party&apos;s deeper levels, the real potential source of prime ministerial instability. The central paradox facing the modern Tory party is obvious. On the one hand, Cameron carries it all pretty lightly; he enjoys, and is pretty good at, the job. He purports to lead a modern, liberal, cosmopolitan government \u2013 all mainstream politicians now tend to call themselves &quot;progressive&quot;. He presides over a radical, reforming administration \u2013 think deficit reduction, health reform and the overhaul of welfare \u2013 and faces an opposition recovering from arguably its worst ever election defeat. Not a bad place to be. All other things being equal, the party should be united behind the leader. Yet the hallmark of the modern Tory party is fragility. It is a dangerously brittle thing. After 13 long years of opposition, and barely two years into government, it appears to be sinking, devoid of pragmatism. The recent reshuffle exposed its inner wiring \u2013 a medium-term modernisation strategy surrendered before the concerns of day-to-day party management. Cameron is captive and weak. Boris is mean and hungry. New right-wing factions are launched almost weekly. Hostility to the Liberal Democrats is simple transference; real venom is directed in private at the Tory leader. Is there any better example of a new government stalling so dramatically after initial suggestions of energy and vitality? The leadership response from Westminster is to paper over the cracks \u2013 to remind us these are the usual mid-term travails ramped up by sacked or passed-over MPs and the pathologically oppositional. Meanwhile, from the grassroots, the admirable Tim Montgomerie of the influential website Conservative Home calls for renewed vigour on the part of Osborne, Hague and IDS in drilling into Ed Miliband&apos;s leadership, and a focus on immigration and welfare. Both sides look to the impressive 2010 intake to square the circle; to import grit, ideas and rigour into the Tories, and to deal with the pesky Lib Dems. All roads lead to Britannia Unchained, the short tract written by a group of young, right-wing Tory MPs that is considered a route map to political renewal. Forget the small beer, shallow-end stuff of the news cycle: real unity is to be secured through rallying to the ideas in this book, and its generation of Tory &quot;stars&quot; putting a spark into their party and securing outright victory in 2015. That is quite a task for the MP authors Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss, yet they appear up for it. The book received some unfavourable attention before it was published \u2013 newspapers picked up on the suggestion that the British people are &quot;among the worst idlers in the world&quot;, too many of whom &quot;prefer a lie-in to hard work&quot;. But first things first: there is still much here that we can agree on. The task at hand is to rebuild this country. We start with an extraordinary economic history, but one we cannot simply rest on. The reality is that Britain does, as these authors suggest, face a fundamental choice \u2013 whether to manage decline or confront today&apos;s global challenges. How can we do this and build a successful 2020 Britain? Many of the remedies put forward here are pretty self evident: good quality childcare, applauding hard work, high quality education and skill formation, embracing risk and innovation, regional balance, cutting unnecessary red tape. The comparisons the authors make are also of interest \u2013 praise is given not just to the usual Singapore and South Korea, but also to Brazil and even parts of Europe. The authors demonstrate their socially liberal credentials on race, sexuality, gender and identity, and they make other interesting arguments: for example, they question the cult of celebrity, and emphasise the importance of virtuous parenting and the nurturing of appropriate attitudes in our children. Yet at its core this book is not about social liberalism. Scratch off the veneer and all is revealed: a destructive economic liberalism that threatens the foundations of modern conservatism. The state is assumed always to be malign, and it&apos;s taken for granted that the labour market is not flexible enough (is it ever?). For reform read marketisation and intensified commodification. In this world, safety nets stifle a &quot;can-do&quot; culture, weakening our work ethic and muscular individuality. Banking crises are simply part of the natural order of things; Britons are working fewer hours because they can&apos;t be bothered or are wilfully avoiding work. The role of politics and public policy and the impact of structural problems in markets and institutions are absent from the analysis. For these authors \u2013 all members of the party&apos;s right-leaning Free Enterprise Group \u2013 it is a binary world, where everything is forward or back, progress or decline, sink or swim, good or bad. They do not appear to see the world as a complex place. The choice is between regulation and dynamism: their ideal worker is one prepared to work long hours, commute long distances and expect no employment protection and low pay. Their solution to the problem of childcare is unregulated, &quot;informal and cheap childminders&quot;. We need dramatic cuts in public expenditure, they argue, to be matched by equivalent tax cuts. The demonisation of the welfare recipient continues apace; a broad dystopian worldview dominates the future. The bottom line for these Tory radicals is that the notion of community, society or indeed country is always trumped by textbook economic liberalism. A few years ago I asked a high-flying commentator about the notion of &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot;. This young columnist is hardwired into the project set out in Britannia Unchained and gives his readers a weekly report from the frontline. His contempt for the compassionate version of Tory ideology was total. Why, I asked. Because &quot;we&quot; are &quot;liberals organising within the Conservative party,&quot; he replied. It is this economic liberalism that has sought, albeit in vain, to sell off our forests. It seeks a planning free-for-all; it celebrates chaos. It would dismantle valued national institutions \u2013 in broadcasting, policing, transport and health. Such libertarianism is unpatriotic \u2013 the nation&apos;s best interests wouldn&apos;t be pursued in industrial strategy, defence or indeed Britain&apos;s place within Europe. It threatens the &quot;national-popular&quot; foundations of the Thatcher revolution; it is a brutal and destructive creed at odds with national interest as she understood it. Put simply, Margaret Thatcher knew she had to meld together the economic liberalism of the new right and the traditional, patriotic sentiment of both her party and the country. This was never framed as &quot;either-or&quot;. Her pragmatic brilliance built a coalition that contested the centre ground and bolted in parts of the working class. In contrast, although claiming to be the true descendants of Mrs T, the authors of Britannia Unchained represent a project that is extreme and destructive, and which threatens the essential character of our nation. It is because this faction is in the ascendancy that Cameron is actually failing; he remains captive to an economic reductionism that could well destroy conservatism \u2013 in the proper sense of valuing and conserving the nature and assorted institutions of the country. Cameron is not one of this crew. Tactically, in the short term he might survive; but in the medium term he is toast. The economic liberals&apos; march through the Conservative party will continue; every day there is less and less opposition, and they will eventually win. The coalition with the Orange Book Liberals in Clegg&apos;s party might well stumble on. But the cost, over time, will be two lost traditions: a recognisable conservatism and a recognisable social liberalism. \u2022 Jon Cruddas MP is a member of the shadow cabinet and leads Labour&apos;s policy review."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/28/lewis-hamilton-formulaone", "sentences": ["McLaren, who have been caught out by Mercedes from the start and described the original story linking their star driver with their opponents as &quot;fantasy&quot; earlier this month, felt confident that Hamilton would renew his contract as the team left Singapore on Monday following the latest grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-28T00:12:29Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton set to leave McLaren to join Mercedes", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Sport", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Formula One 2012"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton will walk out on McLaren, the Formula One team who have nurtured his extraordinary talent for more than half of his lifetime, and sign for Mercedes, the German car giant is expected to announce later on Friday. Contrary to widespread speculation that the 27-year-old Hamilton was about to re-sign for McLaren, the team he joined as a 13-year-old and with whom he won the world championship in 2008, the fastest and most gifted driver of his generation has decided to join Mercedes, despite the fact that they have won only one championship race this season and languish in mid-table in the constructors&apos; title race. Mercedes are expected to announce that seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher will quit the team at the end of the season in November, making room for Hamilton&apos;s sensational switch, a move that will reverberate through the Formula One paddock for the remainder of this season. Hamilton will sign for Mercedes on a three-year deal worth \u00a315m a year. The irony of that is that it is not significantly more than Hamilton is being paid at the moment. He is coming to the end of a five-year deal that has been repeatedly reported as being worth \u00a375m, or \u00a315m a year, but which in fact is worth about \u00a313m-\u00a314m per annum. McLaren, who have been caught out by Mercedes from the start and described the original story linking their star driver with their opponents as &quot;fantasy&quot; earlier this month, felt confident that Hamilton would renew his contract as the team left Singapore on Monday following the latest grand prix. Hamilton, it seems, never really wanted to leave McLaren but after being offered a mere two-thirds of his original pay packet \u2013 and, it is alleged, asked to increase an already heavy load of sponsorship commitments, he has changed his mind. It is a huge gamble for the driver. McLaren, who have won five races this season and have had the fastest car for the last four races, on very different circuits, have won 180 races \u2013 second only to Ferrari, who have been competing for longer \u2013 and have topped the podium in one of ever four races in which they have competed. Mercedes, as a works team, are expected to be more competitive when major regulation changes are introduced in 2014. But there is no guarantee of that. But it is, perhaps, an even bigger gamble for McLaren to lose the biggest box office attraction in the sport. Even if they succeed in signing Sergio P\u00e9rez \u2013 the favourite for the vacant seat \u2013 or one of the Force India pair of Nico H\u00fclkenberg or Paul Di Resta \u2013 Hamilton is simply irreplaceable.

But for anyone leaving McLaren, and he wants to win, I think that&apos;s a mistake because I have faith and belief in this team. &quot;Whether you measure it over the last four races, four years or 40 years, we&apos;re a fantastic team. So I would say to any driver who wanted to win in this sport: &apos;Come and join McLaren and aspire to join McLaren&apos;. I wouldn&apos;t advise anyone to leave McLaren if they want to win, but I&apos;ve got to respect Lewis&apos;s decision and really wish him well.&quot; Whitmarsh, who has filled the vacancy with the exciting Sauber driver Sergio P\u00e9rez from Mexico, said that Hamilton had informed him of his decision to leave two days previously, and had since phoned him again. McLaren appeared confident of retaining Hamilton when the team left Singapore last weekend, having won their fourth pole position in a row. Whitmarsh said: &quot;I know we made a very big financial offer, bigger than I believe any Formula One driver is enjoying today. That is something that I am comfortable with. But ultimately we move forward now.&quot; But McLaren&apos;s original offer was believed to be just two-thirds of Hamilton&apos;s current deal. The contract with Mercedes is more lucrative at \u00a315m a year and gives the driver potential to earn more commercially than he did at the Woking-based team. Hamilton spoke on Friday of &quot;a fresh challenge&quot; and added: &quot;&quot;I have been incredibly fortunate to have been part of McLaren and Mercedes since I was 13 years old, and I even remember signing my first contract with them. I will be forever grateful for the opportunity that they have given me and for their support throughout the years. &quot;I have had the pleasure of working with a fantastic team of genuine people and would like to thank them all for their hard work and support.&quot; McLaren, at least, have saved millions by agreeing a three-year deal with P\u00e9rez, worth \u00a320m over that period. Whitmarsh said: &quot;We have selected Sergio because we think he is one of the best talents in Formula One. He is very young and undeveloped and yet he has had some stunning performances. &quot;There are a lot of people who have supported Sergio and they are excited by the prospect of him joining a great team like McLaren. We have an exciting young Mexican who can add a new dimension to this team and to the sport.&quot; Perez said: &quot;&quot;I&apos;m under no illusion I&apos;ve made a very big step \u2013 as it would be for any driver \u2013 but I&apos;m ready for it.&quot; The challenge facing McLaren, for the remaining six races of the season, is maintaining a good professional relationship between Hamilton and Jenson Button as they attempt to win the constructors&apos; championship for the first time in 14 years.

The other mega-merger between British arms manufacturer BAE Systems and Airbus parent EADS was the subject of intense political wrangling as both companies attempt to convince German, French, US and British politicians that the deal is in their interests. Again, a deadline extension is the most likely outcome. The makers of Scotland&apos;s favourite fizzy drink, Irn-Bru, AG Barr, continues its talks with rival Britvic for a \u00a31.6bn merger. It has until Tuesday morning to make a decision. Sticking with drinks, the spirits group Diageo confirmed it was in discussions with India&apos;s United Spirits. The deal could see the Guinness maker become one of the biggest drinks operators in India. However, both firms are cautious after a similar takeover attempt failed in 2009. The unsubstantiated rumour also had its place, with supermarket J Sainsbury plc said to be in the sights of 26% shareholder and failed bidder the Qatar Investment Authority (also Xstrata&apos;s second biggest shareholder). Construction supply group Weir could attract the attentions of GE, following the US group&apos;s move to set up a mining subsidiary, while National Grid is supposedly being eyed up by Chinese and American predators. Even Bumi \u2013 Nat Rothschild&apos;s mining baby, which announced an investigation into &quot;financial irregularities&quot; on Monday \u2013 could be vulnerable, with a handful of hedge funds said to be looking over the\u00a0numbers. Finally, Standard Chartered may face a takeover challenge if rumours that Singapore&apos;s Temasek sells its 18% stake in the Asia-focused bank. Simon Willis at Daniel Stewart speculated: &quot;Who are the most likely buyers? A Chinese bank or the sovereign wealth fund; or a middle eastern sovereign wealth fund. We believe the former is the more likely, which may reignite bid speculation, though Standard Chartered clearly has no need to sell out, and certainly not on the cheap.&quot; The hope must be that all the talk can turn to deals or the City&apos;s M&amp;A bankers will be forced to twiddle their thumbs a little longer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/sep/29/travel-awards-2012-winners", "sentences": ["1 Viking River Cruises2 Swan Hellenic 3 Cunard 4 SilverSea Line 5 Azamara Cruises Best economy airline In these straitened times, it&apos;s never been more important to be comfortable in the cheap seats, and this year readers have voted Singapore Airlines the one they&apos;d be most happy to have take care of their derrieres in the air.", "1 Singapore Airlines 2 Emirates 3 Virgin Atlantic 4 Malaysia Airlines 5 Air Canada Best business airline Another win for Singapore Airlines.", "1 Singapore Airlines 2 Air New Zealand 3 Swiss 4 Cathay Pacific 5 Delta Airlines Best ferry company As Bryan is no longer quite up to topping the charts, we had to let the award go to Calmac/Caledonian MacBrayne."], "publicationDate": "2012-09-29T02:00:00Z", "title": "Travel Awards 2012 winners", "tags": ["Travel"], "article": "Best UK city For some, 13 is an unlucky number. But not for Edinburgh, which dances off into the night again as the top UK city for the 13th year on the trot. It will be interesting to see if London in 19th position can capitalise on its time under the Olympic spotlight this summer and climb up the table or even put in a challenge to Edinburgh&apos;s crown next year. But northern cities tend to dominate this category, and it&apos;s to the historic charms of York and Durham, and the vibrant arts scene and nightlife of Liverpool and Glasgow that our readers tend to turn for their city breaks. 1 Edinburgh 2 Bath 3 York 4 Liverpool 5 Cambridge Best overseas city     Tokyo was voted your favourite overseas city. Photograph: Jose Fuste Raga/Corbis    Tokyo retains its title for the third year running, despite the fact that it faced one of the biggest challenges in its history, persuading tourists to return in the wake of last year&apos;s devastating earthquake and tsunami which hit the north-east of the country. The policy of the city&apos;s hoteliers to cut rates and run promotions appears to have paid dividends in winning back the confidence of visitors. Elsewhere, Seville enters the top 10. 1 Tokyo 2 San Francisco 3 Seville 4 Berlin 5 Cape Town Best European country Iceland wins the crown this year, no doubt attracting visitors intrigued by all the footage of a landscape evolving and forming before our very eyes following the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in 2010, whose ash cloud forced the closure of European airspace.

Photograph: Jeremy Woodhouse/Spaces Images/Corbis    We&apos;re delighted to see that Japan has won this category for the second year. Japan saw a 28% fall in the number of visitors arriving in the country in 2011 compared with a year earlier, as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. But despite gloomy predications, by January 2012 the numbers were just 4% below those for the previous year, an extraordinary recovery in large part thanks to the tireless efforts of the Japan Tourism Agency to promote the country abroad and to welcome back tourists with the &quot;Japan: Thank You&quot; campaign. Cambodia, with its magnificent Khmer temples at Angkor Wat, takes the runners-up spot. 1 Japan 2 Cambodia 3 South Africa4 Argentina 5 Peru Best travel agent In an age when the traditional travel agent is sometimes dismissed as unnecessary, Journeys \u00e0 la Carte is a shining example of what a brilliant service the good ones provide.

Since then it has acquired Tim Best Travel (in 2009) and Simoon Travel (in 2012) and created an innovative worldwide long-haul portfolio offering bespoke trips for honeymooners, families and adventurers. McKinlay Kidd are praised for their brilliant programme of enticing holidays that take in the best of Scotland from its wildlife to its whisky.

That&apos;s exactly what Helen Howitt and Adam Lloyd have managed to achieve with their website sheepskinlife.com. It&apos;s all about the user experience \u2013 choosing the right properties, showcasing them and making them easy to book. Sounds easy, but it&apos;s surprising how many companies get it wrong. With a carefully selected and limited selection of cottages \u2013 the website lets only 24 properties and plans to close its books at around 30, recognising that it is more important to discriminate than populate a portfolio \u2013 they showcase some stunning rural escapes from a converted watermill in Snowdonia to a couple of cosy cottages in the Tamar Valley, with full-screen pictures making the most of the digital platform. The site has been developed with the user experience at the fore and couldn&apos;t be easier to navigate with clear tabs for descriptions, galleries, user reviews, prices and availability. Even if you&apos;re not planning to go away, it&apos;s a pleasure to snoop around the properties on this site. Best ethical travel award \u2013 chosen by Guardian Travel editors     Best ethical travel award goes to Wild Frontiers, who run trips to some of the most exciting and difficult-to-reach places in the world, such as Afghanistan. Photograph: Ric Ergenbright/Corbis    Winner: Wild Frontiers Having worked with Wild Frontiers on many stories over the years we were amazed to realise they hadn&apos;t yet won one of our editorial awards. Where were our manners? Here is a tour operator offering some of the most fascinating, unusual and carefully executed adventures on the planet, and one which cares deeply about the impact its tours have on the regions and people they encounter. Founded by Jonny Bealby in 2002, the operator quickly amassed a team of like-minded travel obsessives and employed truly special local guides, with the primary aim of enabling passionate travellers to visit the most spectacular but difficult-to-reach corners of the world, in comfort and safety. To learn what astounding times can be had on these holidays, you only have to read the features we have run over the last year or so, about horseriding in Georgia, desert-camping in Oman, or, from the new family-friendly Wild Child collection, a Maasai-run safari in Kenya that writer Kevin Rushby and his young daughter adored. That many of Wild Frontiers&apos; most exciting destinations \u2013 Syria, Yemen, Libya, \u2013 have recently been inaccessible is a tragedy, but we know the company and its devoted clients will be one of the first to jump back in to help those whose tourism businesses have been damaged or lost. Indeed it was the first back to Pakistan after 9/11, the first back into Kashmir, and the first to run commercial trips into Afghanistan, where it offers a tour of the Band-i-Amir lakes by pedalo among other things \u2013 just one example of the unique yet authentic and, of course, joyful experiences this company can provide. As he has launched new trips, Jonny has frequently linked up with local NGOs, such as the Hope Foundation in Calcutta, the Mines Advisory Group in Cambodia and Children of the Caucasus in Georgia. To help facilitate the company&apos;s ethos of responsible and sustainable travel, which it has been committed to from the off, it established the charitable Wild Frontiers Foundation in 2009, to channel funds to these projects and its own. Clients can visit these projects if they want to, and Wild Frontiers automatically carbon offsets every client&apos;s international flight, when booked through them. Best UK hotel This category has been dominated by UK-based boutique chains Hotel Du Vin &amp; Bistro and Malmaison for the past decade as well as the Hoxton, which has won for the past two years but now slips out of the top 20. This year&apos;s winner is Sofitel, the French-based luxury chain with 130 hotels spanning London to Shanghai and with hotels at St James, Heathrow and Gatwick. The brand&apos;s stated aim is to balance the French touch with local features and design. 1 Sofitel 2 Hotel Du Vin &amp; Bistro 3 Malmaison 4 YHA5 Marriott Best overseas hotel Hyatt Hotels and Resorts climb eight places to win the day, while last year&apos;s winner the Dubai-based Jumeirah group slips out of the rankings. The company has come a long way since founder Jay Pritzker bought the Hyatt House motel adjacent to the Los Angeles International Airport in 1957 \u2013 the Chicago-based company now has 492 properties in 45 countries. The category is dominated by high-end international chains. 1 Hyatt Hotels and Resorts 2 Shangri-La Hotels &amp; Resorts 3 Intercontinental Hotels &amp; Resorts 4 Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts 5 Marriott Best ski company     Ski Olympic scoop gold for best ski operator. Photograph: Pierre Jacques/Hemis/Corbis    Ski Olympic wins gold this year \u2013 how could it not with a name like that? This independent tour operator runs ski and snowboarding trips to several top resorts in France \u2013 Tignes, Courchevel, Les Arcs, La Plagne, La Rosiere and Meribel \u2013 providing cosy chocolate box chalets and larger chalet-hotels to the country&apos;s powderhounds. Why have its customers been inspired to vote for it this year? Well, it could be the friendly, well-trained staff that cater to their every whim, the free ski hosting around the resorts&apos; pistes or the hot-tubs, saunas and pools in many properties. Peak Retreats, which has won for the last three years, has dropped into second place. 1 Ski Olympic 2 Peak Retreats 3 Le Ski 4 Erna Low 5 Inntravel Best cruise line Viking River Cruises tops the charts with the highest rate of satisfaction from its customers, just beating off Swan Hellenic and Cunard. Not only do this company&apos;s cruises not make you seasick, but their boats look like a floating Grand Designs project, and the choice of holiday destinations ranges from Russia and Ukraine to Vietnam and China. 1 Viking River Cruises2 Swan Hellenic 3 Cunard 4 SilverSea Line 5 Azamara Cruises Best economy airline In these straitened times, it&apos;s never been more important to be comfortable in the cheap seats, and this year readers have voted Singapore Airlines the one they&apos;d be most happy to have take care of their derrieres in the air. Maintaining the top spot from last year it held off the similarly luxurious Emirates and Virgin Atlantic who came second and third respectively. 1 Singapore Airlines 2 Emirates 3 Virgin Atlantic 4 Malaysia Airlines 5 Air Canada Best business airline Another win for Singapore Airlines. This is the third year \u2013 it also won in 2009 and 2010 \u2013 at the top of this category. Business class travellers with this line can expect a full flat bed on long-haul flights, and there is a new medium-haul option, with an inclined flat seat. Air New Zealand maintained its runner-up position from last year. 1 Singapore Airlines 2 Air New Zealand 3 Swiss 4 Cathay Pacific 5 Delta Airlines Best ferry company As Bryan is no longer quite up to topping the charts, we had to let the award go to Calmac/Caledonian MacBrayne. Almost as sexy and stylish as the 70s Roxy Music popstar, this company does its rocking across the waves of the Little Minch and North Minch, between the west coast of the Scottish mainland and the Hebridean islands, Mull and Skye. 1 Calmac/Caledonian MacBrayne 2 Northlink 3 North Sea Ferries 4 Wightlink 5 Brittany Ferries Best train company Eurotunnel has remained at the top or near the top of this category for several years now, and this year it wins, even though the tunnel itself still hasn&apos;t been extended to any countries other than France \u2026 maybe one day. For now, customers are more than satisfied with the 35-minute Folkestone to Calais ride, and the wide choice of ticket options.

Last year for the first time they decided to send a member of the teaching staff to experience their education system and to do some teaching. That was to be me. Last February I made my way to Singapore and after a grueling 24 hours of travelling, alone, (including an amusing but embarrassing incident with an Indian man on one of the flights) I arrived, to find some of the most hospitable people on the planet. I observed and was greeted by teachers around the school, but most bizarrely I achieved something akin to celebrity status in the eyes of the children without actually doing anything. Some of the children still send me emails. I teach some of my history lessons dressed up in character (see my Twitter profile pic). So I planned to teach in Singapore in character. Owing to the need to have my own clothes in my suitcase and the fact that it is outrageously hot in Singapore, I chose to dress as a Chicago gangster for a lesson and I attempted to speak in a stereotypical US gangster accent. I spent much of my time followed by giggling children and I had to keep stopping on corridors so that they could have their photograph with me. When I spoke in assembly to the whole school the students went mad, cheering and whistling when I took the stage, it did wonders for my ego. While out there I learnt how they use technology and in particular the iPad with their teaching. Since returning I have started teaching with an iPad myself and I must say it has revolutionised the way I teach. In Singapore the teachers had class groups on Facebook on which they communicated with the students, bizarrely I also observed a teacher answering a phone call from a student asking about their homework one evening. Obviously this is never going to happen in the UK but I have set up an Edmodo account and use it frequently with my classes, all as a result of my visit. I also let pupils contact me on Twitter if they have any problems with their homework. Going to Singapore is something I will never forget and I have made some very long distance friends that I intend to keep. Craig Nunn, primary teacher, Norwich Road School, Thetford, Norfolk In my early twenties, straight out of university, I spent almost two years teaching English in China and one year teaching English in Poland. Previous to this experience, I hadn&apos;t considered becoming a primary school teacher, and saw travelling as a way of avoiding thinking about a career. However, after three years of living out of a suitcase, I decided to apply for a PGCE at Cambridge and when offered a place grabbed it with both hands. Between my PGCE and my NQT year I also spent three months travelling India. My experiences abroad have, both directly and indirectly, influenced my teaching. I definitely think I am more prepared for life in the classroom now than if I had entered teaching straight from university. I&apos;m definitely a more confident person having met, interacted and sometimes become friends with vastly different people from all walks of life around the world. Experiencing somewhere like China has made me a more diplomatic person who understand how to handle difficult parents, for example. Being able to share my experiences of travelling with the children has helped me bring topics to life. For example, one of our topics in year 3 is &apos;A Taste of India&apos;. Being able to tell the children stories of first hand experiences, show them videos and photographs and tell them about witnessing a Hindu funeral on the banks of the Ganges, being an extra in a Bollywood movie, staying and helping out at the Golden Temple in Amritsar has meant the children can see a different India to the often simplistic one shown in KS2 textbooks. I work in a school in Thetford in Norfolk, and around a third of our children don&apos;t speak English at home. Having taught TEFL, and experienced those first awkward moments of hearing and attempting to use an unfamiliar language helps me to empathise with these children. Having picked up a little Polish, seeing a new Polish child come to meet me for the first time with his or her parents and being able to greet them in their own language is greatly rewarding and helps put both the parents and child at ease. My experiences have also helped me understand how children acquire language, but also the importance to maintain using their first language in and around school. The dual-language children in out school act as translators for new arrivals, and when learning new topic words at the beginning of term we will learn them in all the languages spoken in our class. Dhamayanthi Sangarabalan, principal teacher, Blackhall Primary School, Edinburgh As a child, I travelled quite a lot and lived abroad in developing countries. I was always aware that some people have a lot and some so little. As I was growing up, I always felt that at some point in my life I wanted to have a chance to share my skills with people who didn&apos;t have those things. It was finding the right time to do that; I had to study, decide what I wanted to do, become a teacher, get a job and get the experience. VSO don&apos;t take people who don&apos;t have any experience. I was placed in Ethiopia two years ago and spent two years training teachers in the town of Abi Adi. Doing VSO is a chance to reflect and get away from the rat race of living in the developed world and a chance to identify and realise that you do have really good skills. I think we&apos;re so busy here as teachers, we have heavy workloads, we&apos;re marking, the curriculum is changing and there&apos;s always something new we have to do. So, for me, it was a chance to step away and reflect on why I became a teacher in the first place and what I love about teaching. That&apos;s what you&apos;ve got to try and get across to the people you&apos;re working with to motivate them. I wanted to get across why I wanted to be a teacher and my vision for young people. I think it gives you a lot of personal satisfaction that way. I don&apos;t think I would have thought about it that deeply having just been here all the time. I&apos;m a school teacher here but in Ethiopia I worked in a college of teacher education and I was liaising with the local ministers for education and advisors from different departments. I was gaining valuable management and leadership skills in terms of professional development learning to negotiate, compromise, learning to run meetings, learning to run training. I went into teaching with the idea that we were raising young people to be global citizens. You do have to get your literacy and numeracy follow the curriculum but it&apos;s also about helping young people realise their place in the world. Having been away, and done several voluntary experiences before VSO, I always brought that back into the classroom. So whenever we were learning about something it was never about sitting down and looking at a text book, but looking at the world around us and asking &quot;how is this going to help you become a young citizen of the world?&quot; If you go away on VSO, or other voluntary experiences, and you come back into the classroom, whenever you share your experiences with your children they are so engaged because it&apos;s you talking and they know you. It&apos;s not just something they saw on a news clip. The minute I say &quot;I met this child at a school once&quot; or &quot;I worked with a teacher in Ethiopia...&quot; they immediately prick up because it&apos;s your story, so they understand that from you. Chris Ewing, head of PE, Ridgewood High School, Stourbridge After a hectic five years at a high performing Catholic school in Hagley, I decided to resign in 2002 and see a bit more of the world. With a friend who was also a teacher, we headed to the West Coast of the USA taking in LA, Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Yosemite and San Francisco. We then flew to Fiji, had a campervan experience in New Zealand and then Brisbane in Australia. We spent new year in Sydney and got a flat in Bondi. I signed up with some supply agencies and sent out a few CVs. I started with some PE supply but got lots of general supply which put me well out of my comfort zone, including some primary work. I kept a diary while away which I still read regularly. I often talk about what I experienced and saw to my pupils. While away I was lucky enough to see some spectacular sights, climb the Sydney Harbour bridge, peer into the Grand Canyon, sail under the Golden Gate bridge, snorkeled off the barrier reef and walked around Uluru. I have eaten Kangaroo kebab and own a Didgeridoo purchased in Alice Springs. I got lost in South Central Los Angeles and have seen a roller skating granny in Venice beach. I could go on. I speak to my pupils about all of this. I come from a working class family from Tamworth (can you get any further from the sea?). By getting an education and some sports qualifications I have been able to coach football in USA numerous times and teach abroad while seeing all of this. Why can&apos;t they? I did just enough at school and eventually left Loughborough with a PE teaching qualification. I share this with the pupils on what is possible if they can apply themselves and get educated. It can lead to better job prospects and ultimately the possibility of a different type of education of experiencing different cultures. I am not showing off to them, but trying to make them realise what is there is outside of Stourbridge. My geography teacher Mr Snowden when I was at school was forever going on about his trips to South America, Asia - everywhere in fact. Other students would say &quot;he&apos;s boring&quot; or &quot;who cares?&quot; but I would look at a map and wonder what it would be like. So if it motivates at least one pupil, I would be happy with that. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

As part of this series, we ran a live chat so that schools of all types - and in a range of locations - could come together to share best practice, new thinking and ideas. Here are some of the highlights and tips shared by our panel of education professionals. Andr\u00e9e Jordan is international coordinator at The Ravensbourne School Collaboration is key to raising engagement and quality of work: Students collaborate by designing and creating a car to go the fastest, furthest and with the best design. They shared their project by video conference with a school in South Africa. Realising that they were doing the same thing at the same time changed their view of the world. Real working together, where students work with other students is by far the best way to engage, to raise motivation and create excellent quality work. Lizzie Holden is deputy curriculum leader of humanities at Tong High School, Bradford Share good teaching and learning practice: Visits and technology seem to be the most successful aspects of our [international] project in terms of being able to provide students with a real meaningful impact and in sharing teaching practice. Through Skyping regularly we have been able to greatly open up the opportunity of greater numbers of students to be involved in the project and for long discussions and joint work to be done on environmental and citizenship issues. It&apos;s the visits that have really opened up the opportunity of sharing good teaching and learning practice between our three schools.Where technology was not readily available or reliable it was definitely a challenge to teach with no computers/smartboards or photocopiers for new resources and that I have definitely brought back into my teaching at Tong. Share your experiences with others: Our students are proactive in this. The sharing of their experiences is one of the most powerful tools in terms of bringing new students on board and in having an impact on those who haven&apos;t had the opportunity of visiting the partnership schools or being part of a hosting visit. This has also help with interest from younger students (ours is a secondary school) who wouldn&apos;t be able to go on the current visits that we do. Also, build it into learning for whole school (as simple as through lessons which will be taught again)- this raises its importance on the school agenda and resparks interest if the project wanes. Damian James is curriculum manager - health and life services - at South West College, Northern Ireland International work benefits staff development, enthusiasm and confidence: Collaboration on international projects, has seen staff benefit significantly in terms of professional development. The sharing of ideas and resources within the college and between partners, the skills required to manage projects successfully and the increased enthusiasm and self-confidence for teaching all result from project involvement and achievements. Top tip: Careful planning, realistic expectations and time frames, an understanding of the need to give gift time and appreciation of the significant and potentially life-changing impacts will help to ensure, among other things, that the collaboration will realise it&apos;s full potential. Jos\u00e9 Picardo, head of modern foreign languages, Nottingham High School Keep projects personal: We talk about connecting schools, but it&apos;s really about connecting people. Find someone at the other end who&apos;s just as passionate as you are and take it from there. When it&apos;s not possible to travel abroad, it all comes from actual teaching practice. Adam Otway, history teacher, Manor Church of England Academy, York Learn from others: Singapore schools were way ahead of us in the use of technology. Sometimes we&apos;re held back by online horror stories, but in Singapore I remember being shocked to observe a teacher, one Saturday, answer his mobile phone to a pupil regarding maths homework. I now use Twitter and Edmodo so that learning is not just a process that occurs within the classroom. My short time in Singapore has fundamentally changed the way that I teach. I am part of a pedagogical group set up for Singaporean teachers on Facebook and continue to share ideas and resources with my colleagues out there. Sandra Underwood is school link coordinator at LSA Technology and Performing Arts College, Lancashire Use technology to learn a language: Being involved with eTwinning since 2008 and working with other teachers abroad has been a great experience. I have had students really work hard on the projects because they felt a real connection to their learning and improved their ICT skills as well. I started a project called QR-U? last year with our French Comenius school. The idea was to get students to talk about themselves and school in the foreign language (us French, and them English). We then created QR codes which were pinned up around the school - it was fabulous because everyone was scanning, learning and reading French in a very fun way. It brought the curriculum to life and it also got the whole school interested. Social media help to get around time-zone trouble: Use Twitter or a blog where time difference is a problem. This might also allow for some varied communication; for example students communicating with others in their own time. Alison Leonard is a doctoral research student at the Development Education Research Centre at London&apos;s Institute of Education. Set up a partner school: Consider having a partnership agreement at the outset. Additionally, if a UK school is intending to link with a school whose circumstances are very different (in terms of resources, ICT and so on) it needs to think very, very carefully about the implications of helping their partners. Materials available from the British Council are very helpful in this context and in particular now from their Connecting Classrooms team. Steven Mark, director of the International Primary Curriculum International links can put lessons and world events into context: One of the good things about working with so many schools around the world is that we&apos;re able to help them connect to each other, not only to form long lasting collaboration, but also to respond to classroom questions as they arise and current events as they happen. We had a year 1 class in London who were studying Night and Day and the kids wanted to find out what it&apos;s like to live in a country where there is 24 hours of darkness in the winter and 24 hours daylight in the summer. So we teamed them up with a year 1 class at the International School of Iceland and the two classes then video-conferenced each other on Skype to explore their questions, which made the learning all the more real and purposeful. A similar project with a year 4 class wanting to find out what it&apos;s like to live in an earthquake zone were partnered with a school in Japan (time difference made real time video conferencing difficult) but the class were able to email and video blog their questions and got a great response from the students in Japan who described how they carry out earthquake drills and so on. Commenter Lucy Harvey Involve the local community - they have international links, too: Has anyone had any success in involving people in their local community who have &apos;life history&apos; to share from another part of the world? I asked a young mum who has only been in the UK for two years to talk to my class about her life and family back in Costa Rica and she was amazing. The children asked her really interesting questions and she was able to talk about her first hand experiences of life in a different part of the world. She really helped bring another perspective into the classroom. Sometimes you have to look at the resources and interesting people we have available on our doorsteps.

Until recently Cheil UK has been one of London&apos;s best-kept secrets. It&apos;s a 100-strong integrated advertising agency \u2013 my job there as head of innovation is to make sure we stop being a secret and grow beyond our original Samsung heritage with new clients. That means working hard to build a culture that fosters innovation and ideas. It also means staying on top of current trends, understanding any impact they could have on our clients and their communications issues, and consequently delivering better ways to solve problems for them. Before Cheil I ran a global digital marketing agency called Profero with two friends. We grew it from 22 people in London to more than 300, with offices in London, Madrid, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney and New York. I left to run my own consultancy for 18 months, and then joined Cheil. What does your average day look like? Fortunately, there&apos;s no such thing as an average day (one of the reasons I left Profero after 10 years is because all of a sudden I found I was constantly doing the same things). Now my days will comprise of anything and everything including work on client briefs, team brainstorms, new business meetings, internal team talks and external recruitment interviews. And I always make an effort every week to meet someone interesting, preferably at lunch or for a quick drink after work! What are the biggest challenges to your job and how do you overcome them? My biggest challenge is figuring out where to focus my energy; my role inevitably means there&apos;s so much I could cover, but not enough time to cover it. Lists are my saving grace \u2013 I&apos;ve become much better at using them to prioritise, and working closely with my boss and peers to bounce ideas around also helps to maintain perspective. What first made you want to work in advertising? Not many people know this, but my first work in advertising was actually starring in a TV commercial (it was for a series of karaoke tapes from Italian publisher Fabbri Editori and I&apos;m thankful there was no YouTube in those days). That was my first taste of the energy that&apos;s inherent in this business, but my big break came when I was looking to leave PwC (I started my career as an accountant) and one of my best friends asked me to join his little digital advertising agency. I was extremely lucky to get that opportunity \u2013 that agency was Profero \u2013 and I&apos;ve never looked back since. What&apos;s do you think is the key to being a good at what you do as head of innovation? Innovation for me is about finding better ways to solve problems as well as opening up opportunities that weren&apos;t there previously. It&apos;s left brain and right brain working in sync to create compelling and practical solutions. My business background coupled with my agency experience allows me to really marry an idea with solving a business problem in that way. One of the big attractions of Cheil is that it&apos;s unavoidably integrated, which means ideas aren&apos;t limited by a media discipline or channel. The other key ingredient is an interest in people, something which I&apos;ve always had \u2013 it&apos;s this inherent curiosity about what motivates people to make decisions that also helps in my role. Finally, you need to be a self-starter because a lot of the time, it really is up to you to create opportunities. What would you say your management style is? When I was 18 years old my parents let me manage their restaurant for 6 months, with very little interference. That experience taught me a lot, with the most notable lesson being: give people the room and space to make their own decisions and mistakes while still giving them direction and support when they need it. I hope that&apos;s how I manage. My expectations are high, certainly, and I can be quite tough, but I always try to be fair too. This approach clearly isn&apos;t for everyone but I hope I foster good team communication, and people enjoy working with me. What online resource can you not do your job without? That&apos;s impossible to answer because I&apos;m constantly online and hungry for ideas and inspiration. But if push really came to shove, I&apos;d hate to lose the people I follow on Twitter. What in advertising is really exciting you the most at the moment? No question, it&apos;s the fact that social media has changed the communications landscape forever, and we still don&apos;t really know what the long term impact will be. The one sure thing is that ad land is going to have to change accordingly, despite the fact that insight into people and their behaviour, coupled with ideas and creativity, will always be at its heart. Where do you see advertising and digital marketing in the next 5 years? Wow! I&apos;m not sure I really know where it&apos;ll be in the next 6 months, but I am convinced that any distinctions between advertising and digital marketing will be gone forever \u2013 everything will be digital (in my mind, it already is). We&apos;re also going to have similar issues with the distinction between digital, mobile and social very soon. What three tips would you give to a advertising professional or graduate looking to get to where you are? Be curious, work hard (but have fun), and get out there and meet people Any last words?  I&apos;m with Confucius: &quot;Love what you do and you&apos;ll never work a day in your life.&quot; Daniele Fiandaca is head of innovation at Cheil \u2013 follow Daniele on Twitter @yellif To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, sign up for free membership to the Guardian Media Network.

Coe attended a 90-minute session on Team GB as delegates heard tributes to those who took part, but Labour also took its turn in the limelight by highlighting the instrumental role it played in delivering the Olympics when in government. Some delegates had brought their union flags to the event, at which a video montage was played spanning the time from the announcement of the successful bid in Singapore in 2005, when London beat Paris, through the seven years of preparations \u2013 five of them under Labour \u2013 to the Games itself, which came to a close less than a month ago. Olympic medallists boxer Nicola Adams, canoeist Jon Schofield, and Paralympics sprinter Graeme Ballard were joined on stage by comedian Eddie Izzard, who helped train the volunteers. After a summer in which David Cameron and London mayor Boris Johnson basked in the success of London 2012, delegates were delighted as Coe singled out Dame Tessa Jowell for praise. Coe paid tribute to all who took part, before turning to the former culture secretary who persuaded the Labour government led by Tony Blair to support the Olympic bid and who continued to be involved right up to the closing ceremony. To applause, he told Jowell: &quot;We couldn&apos;t have got this across the line without you&quot;. Coe, chair of the London 2012 Olympic organising committee (Locog) who was appointed by Cameron to advise on securing the long-term benefits of hosting the Games, highlighted Jowell&apos;s willingness to see beyond party politics to create a successful Olympics. He said the cross-party approach had been crucial to the Games&apos;s success, because it would have been &quot;absolutely unsustainable&quot; for them to become a &quot;party political property&quot;, and called for the same spirit to secure a fitting legacy. Jowell remained on Locog after the 2010 general election despite no longer being a government minister, and was made deputy mayor of the Olympic Village. She served as minister for the Olympics until last month, when she resigned and returned to the backbenches. &quot;Tessa, I am not going to spare your blushes for a moment. You know we couldn&apos;t have got this across the line without you. You&apos;ve been our longest and truest friend we have had\u00a0\u2026 in 2010, you stayed on board, you wanted to make sure that you played your part right up to the closing ceremony and that&apos;s what&apos;s distinguished this project and it&apos;s going to be very important as we go for the legacy because that has to be looked at in a consensual way as well.&quot; Hosting the session, Jowell rollcalled all those who took part in the Games, from construction workers, apprentices and contractors, to the trade unions who worked to ensure the biggest construction project in Europe was built &quot;with not even one reportable accident, let alone a death, of a worker in the Olympic Park&quot;, and the organisers, the &quot;70,000 representatives of the best of the British people&quot; and the athletes. Jowell echoed the call for cross-party working to ensure sport provision at every level as she issued a veiled rebuke to the coalition government. &quot;When we won the right to host the Games we made a promise. That the 2012 Games would inspire a generation. Until the election this was happening in schools across our country. The dismantling of this world-class organisation for sport in our schools is beyond belief. So in order that we keep our promise I have invited the government to work beyond party to develop the facilities, coaching and curriculum space so that we keep our Olympic promise to young people across our country. &quot;Building the next generation of Olympic champions starts with that \u2013 a plan for sport at every level, showing the young people of our country that when we said we would inspire a generation, that we meant it&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/02/human-face-of-big-data-smartphone-app-launch", "sentences": ["Today marked the launch of The Human Face of Big Data, with separate events taking place in Singapore, London and New York."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-02T16:05:46Z", "title": "New smartphone app maps personal beliefs and attitudes across the world", "tags": ["Data visualisations", "Technology", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Apps", "Culture", "Big data"], "article": "Today marked the launch of The Human Face of Big Data, with separate events taking place in Singapore, London and New York.

Three English universities are in the top 10. Cambridge is seventh and Imperial College eighth in the rankings published on Wednesday. Bristol, Sheffield, Leeds, Birmingham and Newcastle have all fallen down the rankings, as have Glasgow and Aberdeen. St Andrews and Sussex have dropped out of the top 100 altogether this year. Phil Baty, editor of Times Higher Education rankings, said: &quot;Outside the golden triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge, England&apos;s world-class universities face a collapse into global mediocrity, while investment in top research universities in Asia is starting to pay off,&quot; he said.

After two weeks of fixating over exactly whose bum would be on which seat next season, Sunday&apos;s Japanese Grand Prix is a chance to return to the other business of Formula One, behind the wheel. Which is as it should be, because the world championship is finely poised with six races to go, even if Lewis Hamilton&apos;s switch to Mercedes remains hard to escape from in the paddock. Suzuka is celebrating its 50th anniversary, a longevity matched by the passion drivers have for this technically demanding track that combines fast, medium and slow corners which offer the best drivers the chance to demonstrate the edge they have over the rest. A point that is illustrated at the top of the drivers&apos; championship, where Fernando Alonso is 29 points ahead of Sebastian Vettel. Maximising points on Sunday will be crucial for them (each have won here twice). Alonso&apos;s reliability has been key this season, with only one retirement \u2013 rudely ejected on the first corner at Spa rather than a car failure \u2013 and eight podium finishes. Vettel, then, must ensure he finishes in front of the Spaniard to keep narrowing the gap. There are some calculations to be done and it is these that occupy the minds of team principals. Mathematically, 1-2 finishes in Vettel&apos;s favour at the remaining races would give him the title by 13 points. More realistically, taking five points a race (the gap between third and fifth places) from Alonso would make Vettel champion by a single point in Brazil. He has the car to do it, with the Red Bull quicker than the Ferrari and pretty much on a par with the McLaren now in race pace, if not qualifying. What the German really needs is another did-not-finish from Alonso but the chasing pack need it even more, for they will definitely struggle to catch up without a retirement. Kimi Raikkonen lies 45 points back, Lewis Hamilton 52 and Mark Webber 62. For all of them Japan represents the start of a crucial time in the title race but the defending champion knows it can be done. &quot;Obviously I don&apos;t want misfortunes to hit others,&quot; Vettel said. &quot;We are confident and we believe that we can do it on the track. We have to focus on ourselves and whatever happens, happens. We need to make sure to finish the races and score a lot of big points.&quot; The final driver chasing Alonso and Vettel is last year&apos;s winner here, Jenson Button. Now 75 points adrift, his chances of the title have all but gone. However, despite incurring a five-place grid penalty for this race because of a gearbox change after Singapore, he remains confident he can challenge here. &quot;The car is working really well and we have some things here that should help us,&quot; he said. &quot;Sixth is the best place I can start the grand prix but, in the engineering meetings, we don&apos;t talk about finishing second or third, we are talking about winning.&quot; They are also, inevitably, talking about his team-mate and Button admitted Hamilton&apos;s departure had been unexpected. &quot;I was very surprised when I heard Lewis was going,&quot; he said. &quot;Because every season you race for this team you win grands prix. We all have different challenges and things we want to achieve. He wants to try something new.&quot; Hamilton will be trying to do so with Nico Rosberg, his team-mate next season, whowas bombarded with questions about his forthcoming partner and revealed that he had discussed the move with the British driver. &quot;I didn&apos;t necessarily talk him into it,&quot; he said. &quot;I tried to stay quite objective. Yes, I mentioned the positives but he asked me a few things and I gave him honest answers. My answers are all positive because I am positive about the team.&quot; They had discussed racing together in F1 while youngsters in karting but Rosberg does not believe their friendship will be a factor when they go head-to-head in the same machinery. &quot;We&apos;ve managed that very well in go-karts already so I don&apos;t see any issue or concern there,&quot; he said. &quot;We were team-mates for two years and we even shared hotel rooms and it all went fine.&quot; McLaren&apos;s team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, insisted the door was still open for Hamilton to return, saying: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s Lewis&apos;s intention to hop from team to team on an annual basis. But never say never and we&apos;ll see what happens in the future. I don&apos;t think it will be in the very near term but who knows?&quot; A return would have a precedent. Alain Prost drove his debut season for the team in 1980 and returned five years later to win three titles for them. For Button, at a circuit he loves and in contrast to his departing team-mate, there is contentment in the Japanese sunshine with McLaren. Undoubtedly buoyed by the knowledge that he will be the de facto No1 driver next season when he is joined by Sergio P\u00e9rez, he said: &quot;I will definitely be the person McLaren turn to if they want a world champion next year.&quot; The correct place for him then? &quot;I am happy here, but for Lewis Hamilton, he has made the right decision.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/06/japan-grand-prix-vettel", "sentences": ["Britain&apos;s Jenson Button was in third but will start from eighth with a five-place grid penalty after changing his gear box in the wake of the Singapore Grand Prix.", "Final positions 1 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 1min 30.839secs 2 Mark Webber (Aus) Red Bull 1:31.090 3 Jenson Button (Gbr) McLaren 1:31.290 4 Kamui Kobayashi (Jpn) Sauber-Ferrari 1:31.700 5 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Lotus F1 Team 1:31.898 6 Sergio Perez (Mex) Sauber-Ferrari 1:32.022 7 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Ferrari 1:32.114 8 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Lotus F1 Team 1:32.208 9 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) McLaren 1:32.327 10 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Force India No Time 11 Felipe Massa (Bra) Ferrari 1:32.293 12 Paul di Resta (Gbr) Force India 1:32.327 13 Michael Schumacher (Ger) Mercedes GP 1:32.469 14 Pastor Maldonado (Ven) Williams 1:32.512 15 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Mercedes GP 1:32.625 16 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:32.954 17 Jean-Eric Vergne (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:33.368 18 Bruno Senna (Bra) Williams 1:33.405 19 Heikki Kovalainen (Fin) Caterham 1:34.657 20 Timo Glock (Ger) Marussia 1:35.213 21 Pedro de la Rosa (Spa) HRT-F1 1:35.385 22 Charles Pic (Fra) Marussia 1:35.429 23 Vitaly Petrov (Rus) Caterham 1:35.432 24 Narain Karthikeyan (Ind) HRT-F1 1:36.734 Jenson Button and Nico Hulkenberg both have five place grid penalties for gearbox changes and Michael Schumacher has a ten place penalty for causing an accident in the Singapore Grand Prix "], "publicationDate": "2012-10-06T08:36:45Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel takes pole in Japan as Lewis Hamilton struggles | Giles Richards", "tags": ["Formula One 2012", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport", "Sebastian Vettel"], "article": "Sebastian Vettel took pole position in Suzuka on Saturday but only after a lengthy investigation by the FIA race stewards when Ferrari pointed out that he had appeared to block Fernando Alonso during the final qualifying session. Vettel would been given a grid position penalty had they ruled against him. However, after a three-hour delay the stewards returned a decision that Vettel would receive a reprimand and no further action, confirming his place on the front row of the grid. Vettel had set a time of one minute 30.839 seconds in Q3 for what will be his fourth consecutive pole in Japan. It was a very quick lap that might well have fully deserved the top spot, although fans were denied the chance to see whether he would have held it when a spin by Kimi Raikkonen interfered with some of the top runners&apos; final hot laps. The pole boosts Vettel&apos;s hopes of catching Alonso in the world championship. He needs to take five points per race from the Spaniard if he is to take the title by one point at the last race of the season in Brazil, and Alonso will begin the race in sixth. Vettel was joined by team-mate Mark Webber in second place, the first time Red Bull have locked out the front row this season. Britain&apos;s Jenson Button was in third but will start from eighth with a five-place grid penalty after changing his gear box in the wake of the Singapore Grand Prix. Button&apos;s drop elevates Japan&apos;s Kamui Kobayashi to third place, his highest grid position of the year and a hugely popular result with the local fans. Lewis Hamilton&apos;s championship hopes took a major blow when the best he could manage was ninth after he admitted he had his car set up wrongly, and what little chance he had on his last flying lap was undone when yellow flags were shown in the wake of Raikkonen going wide and spinning in the middle of Spoon corner at the end of Q3. The incident also appeared to put paid to Alonso&apos;s last quick lap while Raikkonen had already set a time good enough to claim seventh. &quot;I&apos;m very, very happy with today&apos;s result, I think we had a very, very smooth qualifying session, nearly perfect, so we couldn&apos;t really ask for more,&quot; said Vettel afterwards. &quot;The car felt fantastic from the start.&quot; He also believes qualifying shows the team are in good form for the race tomorrow but despite the Red Bull having generally shown much better pace in the race rather than qualifying, he was still cagey about their chances. &quot;I think we were able to improve the car from yesterday to today which also helps us on the long run and with tyre consumption. But you never know until you find out,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we&apos;ve seen a lot of races this year where probably we expected something, and people expected something, other teams had expectations but the last ten laps everything turned around. We have to stay focussed and see what we get from start to finish.&quot; As well as a boost to his championship hopes he has moved up the statistics table as well. The pole is his fourth of the year but importantly the 34th of his career, a total that puts him one ahead of Jim Clark and Alain Prost and behind only Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher in the all-time records. Webber too was pleased with the result as Red Bull finally achieved some of the dominance they had last season, when they ensured no other team took a front row slot up to an including this race in japan last year, losing out only to Hamilton in the following race in Korea. &quot;Obviously Seb got me a bit, so that was a good lap from him,&quot; Webber said. &quot;But to be this much further up for us, obviously we&apos;ve had a rough run with qualifying of late, particularly my side with penalties and bits and bobs. It just makes the race much more difficult: you have to start doing wacky strategies and stuff like that. So, I am happy to be on the front row.&quot; For Button, who won here last year, a good session was qualified by the grid penalty and both he and team-mate Hamilton, who explained afterwards that set-up changes had compromised his session, will struggle to catch the Red Bulls from their position in the midfield. &quot;We just made a mistake and now we are stuck with it,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;We made some changes going into P3 but it went the opposite way into oversteer so we didn&apos;t know what to do. We went back the other way and it was a disaster. &quot;I felt we had a great car all weekend, it was just the set-up changes and then the car would not turn anymore. We were miles off and when you start you first lap you think &apos;damn, I wish I had gone the other way.&apos;&quot; Button, in turn, expected a tough race after having to drop down the order. &quot;A good qualifying for us, just a pity we&apos;re starting back in eighth,&quot; he said. &quot;This place is such a nice place to fight for a win; it&apos;s going to be very difficult for me tomorrow but never say never.

As\u00a0a form of compensation for his years\u00a0of underwater claustrophobia, he\u00a0took up yachting, set out to sail solo\u00a0round the world and succeeded at\u00a0the third attempt. King was born in Hampshire, the\u00a0son\u00a0of a Royal Engineers officer who\u00a0was\u00a0a lieutenant colonel with the\u00a0Distinguished Service Order (DSO)\u00a0and\u00a0was killed on the western front\u00a0in\u00a01917. His mother sent Bill to Dartmouth\u00a0naval college and his initial posting was on a battleship in the Mediterranean as a midshipman. His first taste of the submarine service, for\u00a0which he volunteered, came in 1932\u00a0aboard HMS Orpheus on the China\u00a0Station, where he was promoted to lieutenant. Almost four years later he\u00a0became &quot;number one&quot;, or executive officer on a support vessel. Short stints on two more boats led to the notorious &quot;perisher&quot; course for would-be submarine captains at Portsmouth, which he passed. After four months on a depot ship, King was given his first submarine command, HMS Snapper, in April 1939.\u00a0Sent on patrols in the North Sea, Snapper&apos;s first taste of warfare was a very near miss from a bomb dropped off\u00a0Harwich, Essex, in December 1939 by\u00a0the RAF. The boat limped into the harbour without major damage and in the following eight months King sank six enemy ships off Jutland, earning his\u00a0first DSO\u00a0in spring 1940, followed by\u00a0the\u00a0Distinguished Service Cross in autumn\u00a0that year. During this period he also ran the boat\u00a0aground off the Dutch coast but managed to refloat her without damage. The customary inquiry did not lead to\u00a0a\u00a0court martial but an invitation to\u00a0drinks with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, not long before he became prime minister. In 1941 King was posted to the new and larger, ocean-going HMS Trusty, of\u00a0the T-class, for service in the Mediterranean. At the end of the year, Lieutenant Commander King and Trusty were assigned to the far east, just in time for the great Japanese onslaught in the Indian and Pacific oceans. Bombed but unhurt in Singapore, King found total chaos as the island faced being overrun by the enemy. On his own initiative he made two patrols in the South China Sea, without result. He briefly retreated to Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), before they too were overrun, to repair an oil leak in case it betrayed his boat\u00a0to\u00a0the enemy. A return to the Mediterranean for five months in 1943, as second-in-command of the Beirut submarine base in his new rank of commander, led to a meeting with the writer Anita Leslie, whom he married in 1949. After Beirut he was given another boat in the far east, the T-class Telemachus, on which he served out\u00a0the\u00a0war, sinking a troopship and a supply ship. He was awarded a bar to his\u00a0DSO for a successful duel with the Japanese submarine I-166, which sank. In September 1945 he began his last naval posting as executive officer of the large submarine depot ship HMS Forth. He resigned from the service rather than\u00a0return to submarines. After the war, King moved to Ireland to farm and acquired a ruined castle at Oranmore on the west coast near Galway. He and his wife spent an extended honeymoon sailing round the\u00a0West Indies before draining their 150\u00a0acres and starting an organic farm, regularly riding to hounds with the Galway Blazers, after whom his first yacht was named. In 1968 King made his first attempt to\u00a0circumnavigate the globe in the junk\u2011rigged Galway Blazer II in the first round-the-world yacht race, in which he\u00a0was the oldest contestant. Although relishing the contrast with serving on submarines, he had to give up when a record storm dismasted his yacht and he\u00a0was towed into Cape Town. He tried again in 1970 but was forced by illness to\u00a0go ashore in Western Australia. He started again from Fremantle at the end of 1971. His yacht was rammed by a\u00a0whale or huge shark, forcing him to\u00a0make hair-raising repairs at sea and\u00a0limp back to Fremantle, but he finally\u00a0sailed into Plymouth after two\u00a0years away. King wrote two volumes of autobiography and books on sailing. Anita died in 1984. Their son and daughter survive him. \u2022 William Donald Aelian King, submarine captain and yachtsman, born 23 June 1910; died 21 September 2012"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/oct/08/uk-universities-decline-world-rankings", "sentences": ["Furthermore, the success of universities in China, Singapore, Korea and Japan (and only a very small number of the thousands of Asian universities make it into any university rankings) is largely based on these institutions &apos;westernising&apos; their educational and research methods and pouring in money."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-08T11:23:01Z", "title": "Are British universities really destined for long term decline?", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "World university rankings", "Innovation", "Higher education", "Education"], "article": "The latest university rankings have prompted another round of questions about the future global distribution of higher education excellence and strength. There has been slippage in the position of some universities in the western hemisphere, with Ireland and Scotland both experiencing this phenomenon. Ireland no longer has any university in the top 100 universities globally; Scotland still has one, Edinburgh, in the top 100 (and rising), but other Scottish institutions have fallen, in some cases significantly. &quot;Outside the golden triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge, England&apos;s world-class universities face a collapse into global mediocrity, while investment in top research universities in Asia is starting to pay off,&quot; rankings editor Phil Baty told the Guardian. While there is some drift, the prediction of a British collapse into mediocrity may be a bit premature. It is absolutely right that some of the emerging countries have made major investments in higher education, as one would expect. But this has not produced any instant challenge for global leadership. This latest top 20 contains only one university not in the US or UK, and it is in Switzerland. Furthermore, the success of universities in China, Singapore, Korea and Japan (and only a very small number of the thousands of Asian universities make it into any university rankings) is largely based on these institutions &apos;westernising&apos; their educational and research methods and pouring in money. That hasn&apos;t just started last year \u2013 it has been a phenomenon of the past decade, and while the results are certainly there, they are not startling. It is obvious enough that as some countries make a transition into a more developed economic state, their universities will benefit from more investment and higher levels of ambition. But actually, it is rather remarkable that this has not had a much greater impact on the rankings. This is not to say that there aren&apos;t issues here to be addressed. The uncertainty about university funding in these islands has certainly had an impact, but so have other factors, including the inconsistencies and peculiarities of migration policies as they affect student movement, and the trend for major companies to seek university links away from the more traditional set. What may be much more interesting, however, is this: a hint in the rankings that the university of the future is no longer necessarily the ancient, classical, blue-skies-research institution. The new leader, depending on rankings consulted either the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or California Institute of Technology, may be a more focused, networked and translational university. Other institutions that also reflect this profile have climbed up the rankings. As we try to work out what the role of higher education is to be in the future, this may be the more interesting trend.

His 1995 memoir, The Railway Man, is a classic of\u00a0its kind, and work on a major feature film based on it is well advanced for release next year. It was only when he was in his 7os that Lomax achieved a kind of peace, by\u00a0meeting Takashi Nagase, one of the men who had interrogated and tortured him, and striking up an unlikely but profound friendship with him after they met in Thailand. Lomax was born in Edinburgh and on\u00a0leaving school at 16 began a career in\u00a0telephone engineering with the Post Office. Realising when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938 that war was inevitable, he postponed his wedding plans and volunteered for the army aged 19, joining the Royal Signals and earning a commission as a subaltern in 1940. His unit was in Singapore at the end of 1941 when the Japanese launched their great assault across a front stretching from the Malayan peninsula to the central Pacific. An all-conquering, lightning march down the Indochina peninsula brought 30,000 Japanese troops to the Strait of Johor, between Malaya and Singapore Island. The British garrison numbered nearly 140,000 but was in total chaos, under\u2011equipped with no aircraft or tanks, demoralised and disorganised. General Arthur Percival surrendered the island on 15 February 1942 \u2013 the greatest defeat\u00a0in British military history. The prisoners \u2013 British, Australian, Indian and Malayan - were initially force-marched to Changi, which rapidly became an overcrowded and insanitary concentration camp. From there, many thousands went to Burma to work on the railway to Siam (now known as Thailand) in appalling conditions. Brutal\u00a0interrogations and gratuitous torture became routine. Despite their suffering, Lomax and\u00a0fellow prisoners managed to build a\u00a0radio to try to keep in touch with the progress of the war. They also drew up a\u00a0map of their area of confinement with a view to escape. But in August 1943 they were caught; 10 men were arrested, severely beaten (two died) and moved to a special prison for prolonged torture.\u00a0Lomax &quot;escaped&quot; by throwing himself down a flight of steps in order to\u00a0be sent\u00a0to hospital. One in three western prisoners of the\u00a0Japanese are estimated to have died. Lomax thought David Lean&apos;s admired 1957 film, The Bridge on the River Kwai, was a sanitised epic that fell short of the truth. The censors would never have allowed the reality to be shown, he felt. After the war, he stayed on in the army for two years and then joined the\u00a0colonial service in what became Ghana.\u00a0In 1955 he went into personnel management before taking up a post at Strathclyde University as a lecturer in industrial relations, retiring in 1982. &quot;People thought I was coping,&quot; he told an interviewer later in life, &quot;but inside I was falling apart \u2026 I had no self\u2011worth, no trust in people and lived in a world of my own. The privacy of the torture victim is more impregnable than any fortress.&quot; He admitted that in some ways his family was made to pay for his suffering, and that he conceived an intense and implacable hatred for Japanese people. His first marriage broke up under the strain. Lomax dreamed of getting his hands round the neck of his tormentor and beating him to death. On his retirement, he embarked on a long and painstaking period of research, looking for the man who had tortured him. Nagase turned out to be still alive and engaged in charitable work: he had even built a Buddhist temple in Thailand to atone for what he had done in the war. In 1987 Lomax sought support from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, now Freedom from Torture, which helped him surmount his memories and attain a kind of catharsis. Encouraged by his second wife, Patti, who made the initial contact by letter, he went to Thailand a few years later to meet Nagase on seeing his compassionate and apologetic reply. They met at the bridge over the Kwai, an event which was filmed as part of a prizewinning documentary. Lomax had arrived in anything but conciliatory mood but was taken aback by the deep contrition of the Japanese veteran. After a few days in each other&apos;s company, they got to talking and even laughing about their wartime experiences. Lomax&apos;s autobiography appeared in\u00a01995 to great acclaim, winning two literary prizes. The book is an unusual memoir, in that it includes the results of\u00a0interviews with witnesses, as well as an account of Lomax&apos;s own experiences. It formed the basis of a docudrama entitled Prisoners in Time later that year, starring John Hurt as Lomax. The\u00a0feature film will have the same title as the book, with Colin Firth as Lomax and Nicole Kidman as his wife. Lomax is survived by Patti and by Charmaine, his daughter from his first\u00a0marriage. \u2022 Eric Sutherland Lomax, prisoner of war and writer, born 30 May 1919; died 8\u00a0Octobe"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2012/oct/10/bbh", "sentences": ["We are now 30 years old and employ over 1000 people across seven offices: London, Singapore, New York, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Mumbai and Los Angeles.", "Key executives Ben Fennell, London CEO Charlie Rudd, MDNick Gill, Executive Creative DirectorJon Peppiatt, Deputy ChairmanCarly Herman, New Business Director Contact details Carly Herman - New Business DirectorT: 020 7453 4521E: carly.herman@bbh.co.uk Website: www.bartleboglehegarty.com      Facebook      Twitter      LinkedIn      Google+      BBH Labs - blog Key facts Created: March, 1982Number of staff: 1000 worldwideNumber of countries: UK, Singapore, India, China, Brazil and USA Number of offices: London, Singapore, Mumbai, Sao Paulo, New York, Shanghai, Los Angeles Key clients Alpen, ASOS, Audi, Baileys, Barclaycard, Barclays, Barnardo&apos;s, British Airways, Dulux, Google, Gordon&apos;s, The Guardian, Huawei, J2O, Johnnie Walker, KFC, Lynx, Matalan, Mentos, Old El Paso, Persil, RAC, Robinsons, Rugby Football Union, St John Ambulance, Sol, Surf, Tango, Unicredit, Vigorsol, Virgin Media, Waitrose, Weetabix, Whitbread, Wolsey, World Gold Council, Yeo Valley Organic"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-10T15:18:05Z", "title": "BBH", "tags": [], "article": "Agency profile      Photograph: BBH Agency    When the world zigs, zag.

Gatabazi says the past five years have brought a tarmac road, street lighting and thriving businesses to the site of one of the worst massacres of the 1994 genocide. And he knows whom he credits for the transformation. &quot;Paul Kagame is an excellent man,&quot; he says proudly. &quot;Hero is the right word.&quot; President Kagame has similarly mesmerised Tony Blair (who called him a &quot;visionary leader&quot;), Bill Clinton (&quot;one of the greatest leaders of our time&quot;), Clare Short (&quot;such a sweetie&quot;) and Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, who was persuaded to invest here. Such idolatry raises the question, what spell does this flinty statesman with bookish, even nerdy looks, with no obvious charisma, cast over western leaders \u2013 and why is it now wearing thin? Everything in Rwanda must be seen through the prism of the genocide, a hundred apocalyptic days that wiped out 800,000 men, women, children and babies and left no family unscarred. As a guerrilla commander who marched from the bush to the capital, Kigali, it was Kagame who ended the nightmare and, his champions say, tilted the scales more towards reconciliation than revenge. &quot;I&apos;m not sure Rwanda would exist if not for him right now,&quot; one expat businessman said. At first glance, it is not hard to see why visitors are seduced by Kagame&apos;s Rwanda. Whatever post-traumatic disorders have been buried in the collective unconscious over 18 years, on the surface, life is orderly, pavements are clean and roads are free from the potholes that curse much of Africa. Kigali is nurturing a reputation as the safest city on the continent. American aid workers, entrepreneurs and tourists have poured in to a version of Africa that is both user-friendly and authentic. In the past decade, primary school attendance has trebled, child mortality has halved and parliament has achieved the highest proportion of female members in the world. Last week saw the opening of the country&apos;s first public library, its generous windows looking out directly on the US embassy. Kagame&apos;s wife, Jeannette, took a tour of the airy $3.5m (\u00a32.2m) building and heard from articulate 12-year-olds enjoying the fastest growing One Laptop Per Child project in Africa. It is no wonder that Rwanda is held up as a prime example of how donor support can work, proving a handy riposte to the aid sceptics who would slash the department for international development&apos;s budget. Kagame, 54, has been seen as a visionary, the face of a new, self-confident, economically vibrant African narrative that buries the passivity and victimhood of the past. In addition, some say, this might go some way to paying off western guilt over failing to intervene during the genocide. &quot;Clinton and Blair may be looking back to their time in the 90s and thinking, &apos;What could we have done differently, how can we put it right?&apos;&quot; one observer remarked. But in recent years, there has been a slow, sickening realisation that the west&apos;s favourite African leader comes with a sinister edge. Kagame&apos;s Rwanda, say critics, is an authoritarian state where democracy and human rights are trampled upon and dissenters are hunted down. When Kagame won the 2010 election with 93% of the vote, for example, three major opposition parties were excluded from the ballot. Two of their leaders were jailed and still languish there today. The third, Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green party, was also arrested briefly then went into exile after his deputy, Andr\u00e9 Kagwa Rwisereka, was found dead, nearly decapitated. &quot;It broke our hearts,&quot; recalled Habineza, who returned home last month after two years in Sweden. &quot;He was a man who came to our house to share a meal and was close to my family. It was a terrible death. I went to the mortuary to dress him for the burial. It was an intimate moment. It shattered us but we have to pull ourselves together.&quot; Habineza, who received death threats after breaking away from Kagame&apos;s ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), feels frustrated at international donors&apos; failure to push for genuine democracy. &quot;I requested Britain and others to take action regarding political space in Rwanda, but what they are doing, I don&apos;t understand. If the international community took a stand on political space and democracy, that would be the most helpful to us.&quot; Habineza welcomed the work of Blair&apos;s African Governance Initiative in Rwanda, but added: &quot;I ask him to always request President Kagame to look at these issues: democracy and economic development go hand in hand. We are saying Rwanda is ready for democracy. Tony Blair should tell him this. There cannot be democracy in a country where there is no opposition party and no freedom of expression.&quot; In the past few years, several journalists have been arrested or killed, an exiled general survived a shooting in Johannesburg, and Scotland Yard warned two Rwandans living in Britain that &quot;the Rwandan government poses an imminent threat to your life&quot;. A report this week by Amnesty International identified a series of unlawful detentions and torture including electric shocks. Coincidence? Kagame&apos;s government insists the incidents must be examined one by one. His critics join the dots and find a pattern that includes state-sponsored death squads. Jean Baptiste Icyitonderwa, general secretary of Social Party Imberakuri, claims its leader has been tortured in jail. &quot;As a person in an opposition party, you can&apos;t trust your own security,&quot; he said. &quot;Many times you hear some leader of the opposition parties got arrested, killed and some others disappeared, others are persecuted. That means no one who belongs to an opposition party can feel safe.&quot; Boniface Twagirimana, vice-president of the United Democratic Forces party, whose leader is also behind bars, said: &quot;President Kagame is a dictator. He&apos;s operating like he&apos;s still in the forest as a rebel. He&apos;s not a president for the whole country, only RPF members. He doesn&apos;t want to open the political space to allow freedom of expression.&quot; Kagame has pledged to step down in 2017, the end of his second term. But Twagirimana is doubtful. &quot;Maybe they will change the constitution so he can continue. I think he would like to rule for 20, 30, 50 years like Robert Mugabe.&quot; Some observers argue that the RPF government is torn between a faction of military hardliners, who regard repression as a small price to pay for post-genocide peace between Hutus and\u00a0Tutsis, and a more liberal wing sensitive to democratic concerns. Kagame, the military man turned statesman, faces a constant battle to balance the\u00a0two. He recently responded to critics of restrictions on free speech by invoking Holocaust denialism. &quot;They are mainly talking about laws related to genocide ideology, which I am more than happy to defend,&quot; he told the US Metro newspaper. &quot;Rwandans will not tolerate voices that promote a return to the ethnic divisionism that precipitated the genocide 18 years ago. To that extent, we place limits on freedom of expression in a similar way to how much of Europe has made it a crime to deny the Holocaust. Aside from that, Rwanda is a very open and free country.&quot; Kagame&apos;s government claims the west should not impose its own notions of democracy on Africa. His supporters include Gerald Mpyisi, managing director of the Institute of Management and Leadership, who said: &quot;The president is running the country like a CEO of a company who ensures that every director is accountable for their department. That is why, despite the lack of resources, you still find things happening. &quot;I believe for a country in the third world to develop there has to be a certain element of organising the population. The west tries to use its standards in the developing world and it isn&apos;t fair.&quot; If Rwanda had remained a kind of African Singapore, the west might have continued to turn a blind eye. But this year, it seems, the mask has finally slipped. In June, UN monitors accused Kagame of meddling in his mineral-rich neighbour the Democratic Republic of the Congo, supporting a rebellion led by a war crimes suspect and blamed for atrocities including mass rapes. Evidence gathered by Human Rights Watch supports the claim, which Rwanda fiercely denies. International donors finally had no choice but to rap Kagame on the knuckles. His domestic opponents now want them to go further. Twagirimana said: &quot;The money given by the UK should be stopped. It is being used to run the army and fund the campaign in Congo. In a country without a democratic system, it is not difficult to use the money how you want. That is why the money is being used to kill people in Congo and Britain should stop its support.&quot; Human Rights Watch is a constant thorn in Kagame&apos;s side. Its researcher Carina Tertsakian was in effect expelled from Rwanda before the last election. &quot;Paul Kagame is a figure that seems to fascinate people,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s been very clever and western governments have been very gullible in buying it and ignoring the violations and abuses. But by 2010 even the British government had to acknowledge things were not quite right. We are now seeing the Rwandan PR machine come unstuck.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-cities-innovative-urban-planning-singapore", "sentences": ["According to the latest Siemens&apos; Green City Index for Asia, Singapore is the best-performing city in the region when measured against a range of sustainability criteria.", "&quot;Singapore is at the leading edge of sustainability,&quot; says Nicholas You, chairman of the World Urban Campaign Steering Committee at UN-Habitat.", "&quot;It&apos;s an island state with limited resources so it had no choice but to go green if it wanted to survive economically.&quot; Singapore&apos;s experiences have important lessons for other urban centres.", "Two thirds of Singapore&apos;s land surface is now a water catchment area with water stored in 17 reservoirs, including the Marina Basin, right in the heart of the city.", "&quot;It&apos;s a way to demonstrate in the highly competitive environment that is Singapore, that we can bring energy efficiency to the next level in addressing all the basic needs of cities.&quot; EDF and Veolia recently signed an agreement with Singapore&apos;s Housing Development Board (HDB), the city-state&apos;s largest developer, to develop software that will help it develop sustainable, urban planning solutions in HDB towns.", "The tool will be trialed in the Jurong East district of Singapore.", "A decade ago, city administrators warned that congestion could cost Singapore&apos;s economy $2-3bn a year if transport infrastructure was not improved.", "All these measures combine to make Singapore a smarter city.", "&quot;What we have done is to research and try to distill the principles for Singapore&apos;s success in sustainable urban development \u2013 we call it a liveability framework,&quot; says Khoo Teng Chye, executive director at the Centre for Liveable Cities based in Singapore.", "These are the components that make cities liveable.&quot; As the competition for resources increases and cities expand to accommodate rising populations, even those without the geographic constraints of Singapore will have to embrace smart city principles."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-11T11:54:58Z", "title": "Sustainable cities: innovative urban planning in Singapore", "tags": ["Built Environment", "Guardian sustainable business", "Smart cities", "Technology", "Transport"], "article": "Cities present a sustainability conundrum: though they are the most efficient way to provide infrastructure and services for large populations, they are, in absolute terms, incredibly inefficient. Cities cover just 2% of the Earth&apos;s surface yet consume about 75% of the world&apos;s resources, and given that more of the world&apos;s population now live in cities than in rural areas, it&apos;s clear they are key to tackling climate change and reducing resource use. Urban administrators face huge challenges to make cities more sustainable. From traffic jams and inefficient buildings to social inequality and housing, the problems are complex and hard to tackle \u2014 but not insurmountable. Some cities are forging ahead with the use of innovative urban planning, technological and governance models, showing that with the right focus and resources, cities can become &quot;smart&quot; or more sustainable. According to the latest Siemens&apos; Green City Index for Asia, Singapore is the best-performing city in the region when measured against a range of sustainability criteria. &quot;Singapore is at the leading edge of sustainability,&quot; says Nicholas You, chairman of the World Urban Campaign Steering Committee at UN-Habitat. &quot;It&apos;s an island state with limited resources so it had no choice but to go green if it wanted to survive economically.&quot; Singapore&apos;s experiences have important lessons for other urban centres. Take its water treatment. In 1963, water functionality was shared between multiple ministries and agencies, which made it difficult to formulate a coordinated, long-term strategy. With a rising population and finite freshwater resources, action was needed, so ministers set up a national water agency, PUB, which became the sole body responsible for the collection, production, distribution and reclamation of water in the city. Today, its water operation has been transformed. Two thirds of Singapore&apos;s land surface is now a water catchment area with water stored in 17 reservoirs, including the Marina Basin, right in the heart of the city. Called NEWater, wastewater is collected and treated to produce water that&apos;s good enough to drink. This meets 30% of the city&apos;s water needs, a target that will be increased to 50% of future needs by 2060. Earlier this year, Siemens was contracted to identify CO2 reduction opportunities in transport, residential and non-industrial buildings, and IT/communications in the Tampines district. As part of the city&apos;s plan to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, Siemens will report back in 2013 with implementation costs, a plan to implement the changes and the design of pilots to trail three technological solutions. &quot;This will be a good test-bed for new technologies to prove what we can do,&quot; says Dr Roland Busch, Siemens&apos; CEO of infrastructure and cities sector. &quot;It&apos;s a way to demonstrate in the highly competitive environment that is Singapore, that we can bring energy efficiency to the next level in addressing all the basic needs of cities.&quot; EDF and Veolia recently signed an agreement with Singapore&apos;s Housing Development Board (HDB), the city-state&apos;s largest developer, to develop software that will help it develop sustainable, urban planning solutions in HDB towns. ForCity will simulate the built environment of a city and its impact on resources, the environment, people and intervention costs to help the HDB make its towns function more efficiently and become more pleasant to live in. The tool will be trialed in the Jurong East district of Singapore. Transport is another sector that has seen investment recently. On an island of 4.8 million people with limited space, moving people around as efficiently as possible is key to its economic viability. A decade ago, city administrators warned that congestion could cost Singapore&apos;s economy $2-3bn a year if transport infrastructure was not improved. Then, there were two separate transport-charging systems in the city: road tolls and public transport, including the metro and buses. But since 2009, after a series of smart card innovations, people have been able to use e-Symphony, an IBM-designed payment card that can be used to pay for road tolls, bus travel, taxis, the metro, and even shopping. The card can process 20 million fare transactions a day and collects extensive traffic data, allowing city administrators to constantly tweak routes to ensure the most efficient journeys and minimise congestion. All these measures combine to make Singapore a smarter city. &quot;What we have done is to research and try to distill the principles for Singapore&apos;s success in sustainable urban development \u2013 we call it a liveability framework,&quot; says Khoo Teng Chye, executive director at the Centre for Liveable Cities based in Singapore. &quot;Quality of life, environmental sustainability and competitive economics. These are the components that make cities liveable.&quot; As the competition for resources increases and cities expand to accommodate rising populations, even those without the geographic constraints of Singapore will have to embrace smart city principles. If they don&apos;t, they will lose out financially, unable to attract businesses and talent from cities that do. The planet simply can&apos;t sustain current levels of resource use and environmental degradation. It&apos;s not a choice; cities have to change.

An announcement about Gawker links in /r/politics &gt;&gt; Reddit politics  As some of you may know, a prominent member of Reddit&apos;s community, Violentacrez, deleted his account recently. This was as a result of a &apos;journalist&apos; seeking out his personal information and threatening to publish it, which would have a significant impact on his life. You can read more about it here  As moderators, we feel that this type of behavior is completely intolerable. We volunteer our time on Reddit to make it a better place for the users, and should not be harassed and threatened for that. We should all be afraid of the threat of having our personal information investigated and spread around the internet if someone disagrees with you. Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them. As a result, the moderators of /r/politics have chosen to disallow links from the Gawker network until action is taken to correct this serious lack of ethics and integrity.   Or &quot;Reddit discovers censorship&quot;, as it&apos;s being described elsewhere. Trolls filed 40% of patent infringement lawsuits in 2011 &gt;&gt; Ars Technica  A new study helps to fill the gap by providing systematic data on the growth of patent troll litigation. Robin Feldman, a professor at UC Hastings College of Law, teamed up with Lex Machina, a Stanford Law spinoff that collects data on patent litigation, to compile a systematic survey of patent litigation. Their results are striking: the fraction of lawsuits filed by troll-like entities grew from 22 percent in 2007 to 40 percent in 2011.

No Filter: Inside Hipstamatic&apos;s lost year searching for the next killer social app &gt;&gt; Fast Company  Hipstamatic&apos;s journey over the past year has been tumultuous, to say the least. As Fast Company has learned from speaking to more than a dozen players involved, Hipstamatic has wrestled with ever-growing social competition, internal tensions, and a lack of product vision--not to mention juggling acquisition interest and worsening term sheets in a post-Facebook IPO world.  But what the startup has most struggled with is remaining relevant in an unforgiving app market dominated by one of the hottest spaces in tech: photos.   They thought Instagram wasn&apos;t interesting because it was built around &quot;social&quot;, launched a terrible limited-pictures product, and turned down overtures from Twitter.

HTC tablets fade from US market, but firm keeps options open &gt;&gt; FierceWireless  However, [HTC global communications manager Jeff Gordon] acknowledged that Apple&apos;s iPad continues to dominate the tablet market and he said that HTC would only consider returning to the tablet space if it developed a product that could make inroads against the iPad and other tablets.

The study from Eurosif, the Brussels-based European Sustainable Investment Forum, claims that an exciting new phase in the development of ethical investment is now taking place in the UK. To mark National Ethical Investment Week, which starts on 14 October, Guardian Money looks at the latest themes on green finance and explains how you can join the ethical revolution. Rail: The right track for green investors It says a lot about the changing nature of environmental investing that the latest theme in some portfolios is the glamour stock of the Victorian era \u2013 railway companies. Amid rising petrol prices and congested roads, many rail firms, particularly in the US, have enjoyed a renaissance, supported by environmental investors keen to see polluting trucks taken off the highways.     US train.    In the 1970s and early 1980s many American railroad companies were on the verge of bankruptcy, having lost their passenger business to the car, and much of their freight as well. But they fought back with huge increases in fuel efficiency \u2013 America&apos;s railroads are three times more fuel efficient than sending freight by truck \u2013 and improved service reliability. Around 40% of freight in car-loving America is now carried by rail, a much higher figure than in Europe, while President Obama has agreed huge new federal investment in high-speed passenger lines. Shares in railroad companies have soared. Union Pacific, which dates back to 1862 and dominates west of Chicago, was trading at $30-$35 in 2004 but shares now change hands at more than $120. In 2009, legendary investor Warren Buffett bought America&apos;s second biggest rail operator, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, in a deal valuing the company at $44bn, while CSX, the third biggest operator, has seen its share price quadruple since 2004. Truck companies that work with the railroads rather than compete with them, have also benefited. JB Hunt, one of the biggest road hauliers in the US, partners with railroad firms to cut carbon emissions. As an example, it says, it can truck a shipment from a Procter &amp; Gamble plant in Delaware on the east coast to a rail freight terminal in Pennsylvania, then transport it by train to Chicago, where it is switched to another train to California, and for the last 100 miles by road truck \u2013 again to a Walmart store. So a 3,000 mile shipment travels just 150 miles by road. It tells customers: &quot;We can help you convert more of your over-the-road shipments to rail, saving you money and reducing greenhouse emissions by 50%.&quot; It&apos;s a win-win for customers, investors and the environment. JB Hunt&apos;s share price has jumped from $6 at the start of 2003 to $55 this week. Train companies form a key part of Jupiter Ecology&apos;s \u00a3340m portfolio, managed by Charlie Thomas. &quot;When investing in environmental solutions companies, rail businesses tick many important boxes,&quot; he says. &quot;They score well in terms of pollution abatement and efficient use of natural resources, while also responding favourably to the demographic challenges caused by a rising population (eg improving local air quality and reducing congestion).&quot; He has invested in Kansas City Southern, as well as Hub Group, which, like JB Hunt, is an &quot;intermodal&quot; company maximising efficiency between road and rail. But it&apos;s not just a US story. Jupiter Ecology counts East Japan Railway among his top 10 holdings. Water: the big new wave Ten litres of water is used to produce just one single sheet of A4 paper. Around 850 litres of water is needed to irrigate, grow and process the oranges squeezed to produce one litre of juice. And if you buy steak mince this weekend, consider this: it will have taken 7,750 litres of water to produce a half-kilo pack that&apos;s enough to make a few burgers.     Orange tree Photograph: Etsa/Corbis    It&apos;s little wonder that environmentalists are deeply concerned about &quot;water stress&quot;. Asia&apos;s industrial revolution is driving a vast increase in water demand \u2013 and the supply is running out. The United Nations reckons that if things stay as they are, by 2030 demand will exceed supply by 40%, leaving up to four billion people suffering acute shortages. Only 2.5% of the world&apos;s water is fresh, and two-thirds of it is in fast-melting polar ice and snow cover. China is particularly at risk as industrial expansion continues at a breakneck pace. The country has 21% of the world&apos;s population but only 7% of its available water. When countries industrialise, they use far more water. In the developed world, industry uses 42% of the water supply; in the developing world, 81% is used by agriculture. But as countries build power stations, steel plants and paper mills, their water consumption rockets. So how are ethical investors responding? Sue Round is head of investment at Ecclesiastical Insurance, which runs the Amity range of green and ethical funds. Her starting point is encouraging water-intensive companies to disclose how much water they and their suppliers are using, through what&apos;s called the Carbon Disclosure Water Project. The project aims to put &quot;water stewardship&quot; at the heart of every company&apos;s business strategy. But is it having real impact? Round insists big companies are taking it seriously, citing Tesco as an example. It has worked with suppliers and factories to cut water usage by 300m litres a year. But while that&apos;s undoubtedly good for the environment, how does it help investors? Round points to Marks &amp; Spencer. &quot;It has made considerable water savings in recent years. All their environmental efficiencies have added significantly to their bottom line.&quot; The Amity International fund also invests in companies that are engineering solutions to the coming water crisis, such as recycling industrial and residential waste water. It holds shares in Boustead, a Singapore firm specialising in waste water engineering and whose products are in 800 water plants across the globe. &quot;Its treatment systems can safely return waste water to drinking water quality,&quot; says Round. Its share price is currently nearly $1, double the level of three years ago but still below the peak before the financial crisis. Ecclesiastical is also investing in desalination as a potential solution to water stress. It is estimated there are currently 543 ongoing desalination projects across 90 countries, each costing between $100m-$300m. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the biggest investors, but there are major projects in the US and China. Even Thames Water has spent \u00a3250m on a desalination plant in Beckton, east London, which can supply drinking water for one million Londoners, and Southern Water is considering one on the south coast. &quot;Advances in technology have turned a proven but essentially uneconomic activity (boiling seawater to produce distilled vapour) into one increasingly attractive as a solution to water scarcity via membrane osmosis,&quot; concluded Ecclesiastical in a research note earlier this year. It believes desalination will be a significant investment play for ethical investors, naming GE, Suez and Siemens as potential stock beneficiaries. And most green funds now have a portion of their portfolio dedicated to water stocks, while others, such as Pictet Water, invest only in water. Agriculture: solutions, not speculation Big agriculture and the ethical and green investment community rarely see eye to eye. Two years ago a Swiss investment research firm named agricultural firm Monsanto as the world&apos;s least ethical company. Many ethical investors also despise the billions pouring into food exchange-traded funds (ETFs), where speculators are cashing in on constricted supply and rising food prices.     Sweetcorn USA Photograph:  /Alamy    But one British agricultural firm is catching the attention of green investors worldwide. Genus, based in Basingstoke, is the former breeding division of the Milk Marketing Board and is regarded as the world leader in improving pig and cow herds. &quot;Basically it is seen as a\u00a0green and ethical stock because it has developed techniques to reduce the amount of feed and water required to get meat on to people&apos;s tables,&quot; says Mark Hoskin of ethical financial advisers Holden &amp; Partners. Shares in Genus, now one of the 250 biggest stock market-quoted companies in Britain, have tripled since 2009 from 475p to 1474p this week. It is currently a top holding in Ecclesiastical&apos;s Amity fund. Other green and ethical fund managers focus on food quality. Triodos, the ethical bank, which is shortly to launch a sustainable equity fund, says food companies will make up around 12% of the portfolio. Cheviot Climate Assets, a\u00a0relatively new environmental fund, has 13.4% of its fund in food, specialising in grain production and harvesting, food testing and food processing. The staple food stock, so to speak, of most green funds is Whole Foods Market, the US\u00a0organic supermarket chain with an outpost in London&apos;s Kensington. It has earned a Waitrose-style reputation in the US, where its combination of high quality and high prices have prompted wags to label it &quot;Whole Pay Check&quot;. But its share price has hit $100 in recent trading, compared with just $10 in early 2009, and significantly above its 2006 peak of $77. Jupiter Ecology&apos;s largest holding is United Natural Foods, the biggest independent distributor of organic foods in North America. Despite the financial crisis, the squeeze on household budgets and rising unemployment, United Natural Foods&apos; share price has increased from $25 to $60 over five years. When the credit crunch first struck, analysts reckoned that households would cut back on costly organic produce but it seems the opposite is true, in North America at least. &quot;The sector has grown by 10%-15% a\u00a0year for the last 10 years but even after that it still only accounts for 4% of all grocery sales in America,&quot; says Charlie Thomas of Jupiter Ecology. &quot;However, the number of people putting an organic product in their supermarket basket has gone from 20% to 80% of households.&quot; Organic food suppliers and retailers may meet western levels for sustainable agriculture but John Ditchfield of ethical advisers Barchester Green acknowledges they do little to alleviate hunger in poorer countries. However, he points to WHEB Asset Management, a specialist fund manager focusing on challenges to the world economy, such as rising food prices and scarce water supply. It sees technology as part of the solution and is an investor in Trimble Navigation Systems, a GPS firm that tracks climate patterns to help farmers produce food more efficiently. Co-operatives: think small, think local Many green investors are more than happy for their money to go into companies based overseas \u2013 US railroad operators, Asian water treatment firms and so on. But what if you want to invest in projects on your doorstep?     Butcher's Arms. Photograph: Mark Pinder    The good news is that across the country there are growing numbers of schemes enabling people to give financial backing to local projects, and hopefully earn a decent return, too. During the last couple of years, Guardian Money has featured several, from cafes and renewable energy projects, to pubs and post offices. These community-owned and run businesses are becoming increasingly common, and often there is an opportunity for locals \u2013 and others sympathetic to the cause \u2013 to invest by buying shares or &quot;loan stock&quot; (ie you lend a sum of money for a set period). Since 2009, around 15,000 people have invested in more than 100 community share issues, raising more than \u00a315m, according to the government. But this looks like an underestimate. Only last week, communities minister Don Foster launched a &quot;Community Shares Unit&quot; to help local people become part-owners of much-loved assets and services such as their community pub or football club. Backed by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and run by Co-operatives UK and Locality, the unit aims to help more local enterprises use share offers to get projects up and running. There is clearly an appetite for such schemes: earlier this year, a share offer for a community solar power station called Westmill on the Oxfordshire/Wiltshire border raised more than \u00a34m in just six weeks. With these schemes there is usually a minimum investment, which is sometimes as low as \u00a310-\u00a350 but, more typically, \u00a3200-\u00a3250. The projected investment returns can vary, though 4%-6% a year is not uncommon. There does not appear to be a &quot;one-stop-shop&quot; website that rounds up all the community projects across the country that are looking for investors. However, both the Community Shares Unit and the Community Shares Fund feature details of current and past share offers. Guardian Money will continue to highlight some of the more interesting schemes that come to our attention. For example, ethical investors in Great Britain are being encouraged to look across the Irish Sea and invest in Northern Ireland&apos;s first community-owned wind energy co-operative. Drumlin Wind Energy Co-operative has plans to operate five 250kW turbines north of Belfast, and has already raised \u00a31.6m, which will fund the first two. Individuals, businesses and organisations can invest between \u00a3250 and \u00a320,000; it believes it can offer an average annual return of 7% to 10% over 20 years. The share offer is open until 30 November. Another site worth checking is Abundance, which describes itself as a &quot;community finance platform&quot; allowing people to put money into UK renewable energy schemes and receive a regular cash return based on the energy produced. It currently has two projects open: a wind turbine in the Forest of Dean, and a scheme to install solar panels on homes in the South Downs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/15/rbs-suspends-trader-libor-investigation", "sentences": ["They include Tan Chi Min, a senior trader in Singapore who is now suing the bank for wrongful dismissal."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-15T17:41:59Z", "title": "RBS suspends senior trader in Libor investigation", "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Libor", "Regulators", "Bob Diamond", "Financial Services Authority (FSA)", "Banking", "Business", "Financial sector", "UK news"], "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended one of its most senior traders in London in the latest development in the Libor fixing scandal for which the bailed-out bank is bracing for a hefty fine. Jezri Mohideen was suspended last week, according to Bloomberg news agency, as head of rates trading for Europe and Asia Pacific. He had previously been based in Tokyo, where he was head of yen products, and Bloomberg reported he had allegedly instructed colleagues to lower Libor rates while in this position. RBS has fired four traders for attempting to manipulate Libor and other interest rates. They include Tan Chi Min, a senior trader in Singapore who is now suing the bank for wrongful dismissal. The case involving Tan has given rise to embarrassing allegations with the release of instant messages in which an RBS trader quips &quot;hahahah&quot; and describes Libor as a &quot;cartel&quot;. The bank would not comment on Mohideen, whose suspension comes as the bank awaits a fine from a number of regulatory bodies, including the Financial Services Authority, for its role in the Libor scandal, which has already led to the departure of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond. RBS, 81% owned by the taxpayer, has also taken disciplinary action against a number of individuals involved in attempting to rig Libor while others have left of their own accord. A bank spokesman said: &quot;Our investigations into submissions, communications and procedures relating to the setting of Libor and other interest rates are ongoing. RBS and its employees continue to cooperate fully with regulators&quot;. Bloomberg had spoken to Mohideen last month, when he told the news agency he had not pressurised colleagues into lowering the submissions to the Libor panel. The latest allegations in the Libor affair came as RBS shares fell 1% to 268p amid warnings from analysts that the bank would need to cut the price of the 316 branches it was going to sell to Santander for \u00a31.6bn. The sale, forced on RBS by Brussels as a result of the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, fell through on Friday after more than two years of negotiations and after \u00a34.5bn was pumped into Santander UK business by its Spanish parent. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: &quot;Assuming that an alternative sale is agreed, we now anticipate that RBS may ultimately settle for terms \u00a30.5bn to \u00a31.0bn worse than those agreed with Santander in August 2010.&quot; The bank said it will &quot;commence a new process of disposal&quot; and its chief executive, Stephen Hester, is understood to have received at least three phone calls from potentially interested parties over the weekend. Virgin Money, which took over Northern Rock at the start of the year, and venture capitalist JC Flowers are among those interested. But NBNK, the stock market-listed company created to bid for a bank, seems unlikely to enter the fray after its chief executive, Gary Hoffman, quit to join insurance company Hastings. Hoffman had joined NBNK from Northern Rock but failed to buy 632 branches being sold by Lloyds Banking Group. RBS is stressing that 98% of the work required to separate the branches has been done despite the delay to the sell-off, which must be completed in the next 15 months under the current timetable, which led to some speculation that the branches could be floated off. Analysts at Credit Suisse said that if RBS did not complete all the agreed divestment by the end of 2013, &quot;the UK government will appoint a trustee which will dispose of the businesses &apos;at no minimum price&apos;&quot;. Last week RBS floated 30% of its insurance arm, Direct Line \u2013 a sale also imposed on the bank by Brussels."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/15/hirsch-core-knowledge-curriculum-review", "sentences": ["Countries such as Singapore and Finland \u2013 often cited by ministers as beacons of excellence \u2013 recruit the most able graduates as teachers and give them time and freedom to develop their skills."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-15T19:00:01Z", "title": "US idea of 'cultural literacy' and key facts a child should know arrives in UK", "tags": ["Teaching", "Schools", "Education", "Education policy", "Michael Gove", "Politics"], "article": "What are your views on ED Hirsch? Never heard of him? If so, you&apos;re in good company: only a small number of people in the UK have. But you might be well advised to look Hirsch up \u2013 his philosophy could be coming to a primary school near you, very soon. Hirschism, if there is such a thing, is spreading fast through the English school system. Two proposed new primary free schools \u2013 the West London free school, backed by journalist Toby Young, and the Pimlico Academy primary \u2013 are planning to base their lessons on it. A new curriculum centre is devoting its efforts to promoting it, and a right-leaning thinktank is publishing a series of how-to guides on it for teachers. Moreover, a new primary curriculum \u2013 due to be implemented in 2014 \u2013 has Hirsch at its heart. Both Michael Gove, the education secretary, and Nick Gibb, until recently his schools minister, and architect of a major review of the curriculum, have been profoundly impressed by his ideas. So who is ED Hirsch? What does he believe? And how on earth did he manage to influence the way children across England will learn \u2013 without even being aware he was doing so? Eric Donald Hirsch Junior is an 84-year-old retired professor \u2013 originally of English literature \u2013 from Virginia. He began his career as a professor at Yale, specialising in the Romantic poets. But by the 1970s, he was teaching at the University of Virginia, conducting research on reading with young people at local community colleges. He was shocked to discover those from poorer backgrounds struggled to read a passage on the surrender of General Robert E Lee near their home town of Richmond \u2013 because they lacked the necessary background knowledge of the American Civil War. The result was a hugely influential book, first published in 1983, on what he calls Cultural Literacy. In it Hirsch argued that all American children needed a body of &quot;core knowledge&quot; which would allow them to function as fully rounded citizens \u2013 and that, as some were not absorbing this knowledge at home, they needed to be taught it at school. He even added an appendix, with long lists of facts, words and phrases whose significance every US child should know: the Adirondack Mountains; the Alamo; Alaska; the Founding Fathers. In the ensuing years \u2013 during which Hirsch was greeted by the American right as a prophet and a saviour, and by the left as a scion of the empire of evil \u2013 these ideas solidified. Hirsch published a series of further works, which argued that children not only needed a clear body of factual knowledge but that they should also learn that knowledge in a very highly structured way \u2013 starting with basics and building up, rather than taking a more thematic approach. Hirsch&apos;s position as an influential figure in American education has long been established \u2013 he set up a body called the Core Knowledge Foundation, which has spread his philosophy across the States \u2013 but how did he come to be influential here? Several years ago, Nick Gibb \u2013 then shadow minister for schools \u2013 came across Hirsch and began reading his books. As long ago as 2008 he told fellow MPs they should read Hirsch for insight into an &quot;anti-knowledge ideology&quot; which, he said, was rife in American and English schools. The problem, he said, was that the education establishment had its roots in a romantic ideology that said skills, rather than knowledge, were the key to learning. Michael Gove, too, has spoken of his admiration for Hirsch, citing him in 2009 in a speech to the Royal Society of Arts. &quot;A society in which there is a widespread understanding of the nation&apos;s past, a shared appreciation of cultural reference points, a common stock of knowledge on which all can draw, and trade, is a society in which we all understand each other better,&quot; he added. Soon afterwards the thinktank Civitas began translating Hirsch&apos;s views into practical guides for English schools: What Your Year 1 Child Needs to Know, for instance, provides a comprehensive guide for teachers. Its index reads very much like an English version of Hirsch&apos;s lists of what American children should learn, with Hans Christian Anderson, the Angel of the North and the English Civil War replacing the basic touchstones of US &quot;cultural literacy&quot;. Since Civitas took up the cause, two proposed free schools have announced they plan to teach using Hirsch&apos;s methods. And a new curriculum centre has been set up, using funds from wealthy benefactors, to spread the ideas further. Toby Young, who is planning to follow such a knowledge-based curriculum at his new primary free school in west London, wrote on the Guardian&apos;s Teacher Network recently that more subjects would be taught by specialists and the aim was to raise attainment &quot;particularly among children from deprived backgrounds&quot;. When the government announced the initial outcome of its curriculum review \u2013 designed to overhaul and slim down what schools must teach \u2013 at the end of last year, Hirsch was writ large across it. &quot;The new national curriculum will set out only the essential knowledge that all children should acquire,&quot; runs the Department for Education website introduction to new draft programmes of study for primary maths, English and science. The drafts are &quot;very specific about the content to be covered, given the fundamental importance of these subjects as a foundation for further study and as the basis for our system of school accountability,&quot; it adds. Perhaps it was hardly surprising that some members of the expert panel set up to advise on the new curriculum were less than pleased. The panel had proposed broad, two-year blocks of learning which would give teachers freedom to decide what to teach and when. But the published programmes were detailed and far more prescriptive. Professor Andrew Pollard, who was a member of the panel, stepped down as a result. Ministers have shown &quot;a cavalier disregard&quot; for research evidence from the UK and elsewhere, he says. All the best evidence shows that it is excellent teaching rather than curriculum reform that raises standards, he points out. Countries such as Singapore and Finland \u2013 often cited by ministers as beacons of excellence \u2013 recruit the most able graduates as teachers and give them time and freedom to develop their skills. &quot;Ministers have a responsibility to do no harm and there is some risk that what they&apos;re proposing will actually reduce the quality of learning and reduce the breadth of education that&apos;s available in primary schools,&quot; he says. &quot;Despite the rhetoric about opportunities, it&apos;s quite possible that what is proposed will increase inequality and the disadvantaged will become more disadvantaged.&quot; Gibb, who arrives for an interview on the subject bearing a little pile of Hirsch&apos;s works adorned with yellow Post-it notes, is unrepentant. &quot;All the evidence from around the world is that the more autonomy professionals have, the higher the standards. But, in order to do that, you have to have a curriculum that sets out the key things, the core academic knowledge in those core academic subjects \u2013 maths, English, science in particular \u2013 that children need to learn,&quot; he says. He is confident his Hirschian curriculum will survive his departure from office in the September reshuffle: &quot;The work has been done. It&apos;s out for consultation. I know the secretary of state is pleased with the product. I think he broadly accepts this approach, so I think that will remain,&quot; he says. &quot;At every stage, as we&apos;ve drafted the primary curriculum, he [Gove] has been deeply engaged in it. He has his own views and they have not differed from my view.&quot; Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the man himself seems blissfully aware of the waves he has been making. &quot;Oh, I did not know that. How interesting!&quot; he exclaims after being told education ministers in the UK have seized on his idea of &quot;cultural literacy&quot;. He had a brief email exchange with Gibb a few years ago but apart from that there has been no contact between them, he says. But he is delighted to learn his ideas have spread across the Atlantic. &quot;I&apos;m very gratified, particularly if in fact it has some positive effect in England. That would be terrific. I&apos;m surprised and I&apos;m gratified.&quot; Fran Abrams will discuss the influence of ED Hirsch on BBC Radio 4&apos;s Analysis programme at 8.30pm on Monday 22 October 10 things every year-1 child should know   Acorns Brer Rabbit tales Continents English Civil War Jungles Machu Picchu Mexico AA Milne Musical pitch Henry Moore 10 things every year-2 child should know  Tap dancing Louis Pasteur Rabies Mosques Hansel and Gretel Atlantic Ocean Extinct animals and fish Great Wall of China Dinosaur bones Roald Amundsen \u2022 From Civitas&apos;s English &apos;translation&apos; of ED Hirsch&apos;s guide for schools"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/17/which-footballers-non-football-books", "sentences": ["This is why the team is nicknamed Puros Criollos (&quot;All-Creoles&quot;) or El Equipo Militar (&quot;The Military Team&quot;).&quot; The same source also explains the selection policy of Singaporean S-League team Young Lions.", "&quot;While the bulk of the squad is made up of members of Singapore&apos;s Under-23 team, the club also take in promising young foreign players.", "However, they are normally only recruited into the squad if they could potentially change their nationality to Singaporean and be eligible to play international football for Singapore at some point in the future.&quot; For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help?"], "publicationDate": "2012-10-17T07:44:00Z", "title": "Which footballers have written non-football books? | The Knowledge", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "&quot;Roma&apos;s Francesco Totti is about to launch his own guide to the city of Rome,&quot; wrote Warren Hull last week. &quot;That must be a first?&quot; Players writing books about something other than football?

His goalkeeping career was ended by TB while he was playing for the youth team of Racing Universitaire Algerios at the age of 18. It&apos;s a bit of a stretch, then, to put The Stranger or The Plague in the same category as Totti&apos;s travel guide. The same applies to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes and goalkeeper for amateur side Portsmouth Association Football Club in the 1890s. David Icke, on the other hand, made 37 professional appearances for Hereford United before penning such must-read volumes as Tales from the Time Loop and The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy. The former Colombus Crew and Houston Dynamo forward Jason Garey also turned his hand to fiction. Garey began writing in autumn last year after suffering a hip injury. &quot;I was on crutches for three or four weeks and just started writing, putting down my thoughts and beliefs, and it began to take form,&quot; he told the Washington Post. &quot;I just thought, &apos;What the heck? I&apos;ll turn this into a book.&apos;&quot; The result is Geauxing Galt. What is it about? A look at the back cover suggests it&apos;s probably not for us:  &quot;The year is 2020 and Wyatt Bourgeouis, a self-made, principled oil driller runs head on into the massive government leviathan. Does the current path of the United States lead to a progressive utopia, or economic collapse on a massive scale? From the backwoods bayous and French Quarter streets of South Louisiana, Wyatt Bourgeouis battles Harry Maddow, the latest member of a long line of corrupt Louisiana politicians, who seek power and control over the individual.&quot;  It could be argued that Steve Bruce&apos;s three novels are, like Jaws, about more than meets the eye. Jaws in book form, so the theory goes, is about infidelity rather than a gigantic shark that swims about the place eating people. Similarly it can be argued that Defender!, Striker! and Sweeper!, written when Bruce was manager of Huddersfield Town, are about murder, the bloodlust of the human condition and the scattered thoughts of a man staring into the abyss rather than football. Unfortunately, in the same way that Jaws really is about a gigantic shark that swims about the place eating people, so Bruce&apos;s three books really are about football, and particularly about &quot;Leddersford Town&quot; manager &quot;Steve Barnes&quot;. They&apos;re not particularly successful \u2013 Bruce himself described them as &quot;the biggest load of crap ever written&quot;. Along with Bruce in the bin marked Novels Too Much About Football To Count Here go Terry Venables&apos; They Used To Play on Grass, Jimmy Greaves&apos; The Ball Game (a fictional account following the adventures of cockney striker &quot;Jackie Groves&quot; worth checking out for the rather startling cover), and Theo Walcott&apos;s in-no-way-autobiographical TJ and the Hat-trick. WHICH FOOTBALLERS ARE KEEN CYCLISTS? (2) Last week we looked at the players and managers just as happy with their feet on the pedals as they are, or were, with their foot on the ball. This week reader Stig Nygard has pointed us towards two players who went further than just the odd commute.  The former Middlesbrough, Juventus, Marseille and Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli had been a fan of cycling as a child, but his interest really took off following Marco Pantani&apos;s victory double in the Giro d&apos;Italia and Tour de France in 1998. Ravenelli had met Il Pirate while playing for Juventus \u2013 &quot;He was prematurely bald, I was prematurely grey, so we got on famously&quot; \u2013 and his wins in the grand tours were an inspiration. But it was not until his retirement in 2005 that he was able to devote time to his new passion. And in 2008 he and his brother Andrea set up their own racing team, Umbria Cycling Team. &quot;As you&apos;d expect, I get recognised a fair bit by the other riders,&quot; he told FourFourTwo in 2008. &quot;Everyone&apos;s really friendly, though. I&apos;ll be chugging along and all of a sudden I&apos;ll hear &apos;Ravanelli, was football not hard enough for you? Why are you putting yourself through all this pain?&apos; They&apos;re right, too: I suffer a lot more on a bike than I ever did on the football pitch.&quot; He claimed at least one amateur victory and has taken on some of the biggest climbs in Europe. &quot;Last year I went with Caruso to the Swiss border to climb two of the most famous and hardest mountain passes in Italy \u2013 the Passo dello Stelvio and the Mortirolo,&quot; he said. &quot;The Stelvio is nearly 3,000m above sea level, and, at the top, we were riding between two vast walls of snow. The jubilation I felt at getting to the summit wasn&apos;t dissimilar to winning the Champions League. It&apos;s the same rush.&quot; But one player who would leave Ravanelli trailing in his wake in the mountains, if not on the pitch, is Norway&apos;s Knut Anders Fostervold. Fostervold enjoyed an eight-year career with Molde between 1994 and 2002, during which time the club were regular qualifiers for European football. Although his most famous moment will probably remain this dive against Stabaek (later mimicked by John Carew), in 1999-2000 he captained Molde during their most successful ever run in Europe when they reached the Champions League group stage. The club may have exited the competition after winning only one game and finishing bottom of the group, but Fostervold wore the armband at the Bernab\u00e9u against the eventual champions Real Madrid and that&apos;s a claim to fame not many can match. A brief loan spell at Grimsby Town followed in 2000-01 (it&apos;s not very fondly remembered at Blundell Park \u2013 &quot;Capable of playing centre-back, left-back or left wing-back apparently \u2026 sluggish with or without the ball and clumsy in possession&quot; is the recollection of Grimsby fansite, The Fishy) and his career came to an end due to a knee injury in 2002 at the age of 35. For a couple of years Fostervold cycled purely for fun, but in 2004 he began taking the sport seriously. In 2005 he came third in the Norwegian time-trial championship behind current Team Sky coach Kurt Asle Arvesen and future world champion Thor Hushovd. In 2006 he came third again, with Arvesen winning, and in 2007 he beat Arvesen for the first time only to finish second behind Edvald Boasson Hagen, who would go on to win five in a row. Despite the lack of wins in time trials he did at different times hold the Norwegian 10km, 20km and 30km time trial records. He even got the chance to fight for the world title. With Hushovd and Arvesen choosing not to compete in the time trial at the 2006 or 2007 world championships, Fostervold competed as Norway&apos;s representative. In 2006 he came 43rd out of 52 and in 2007 51st out of 69, each time finishing around five minutes behind the winner Fabien Cancellara. His VO2 max was, at his peak, registered at 94, the second-highest ever recorded by a Norwegian. But it was his bike-handing ability that held him back from the very top. &quot;I need to learn how to cycle, I&apos;m a junior,&quot; he said after the 2006 world championships. He never quite got there, however, and ended his second sporting career in 2009 \u2026 only to begin a third sporting career in triathlon, finishing sixth in the 2011 Norseman Extreme Triathlon. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TEAMS RELEGATED &quot;Last season Villarreal competed in the Champions League and got relegated,&quot; writes Chris Meli. &quot;Has this ever happened before?&quot; Plenty of times, Chris. A particularly interesting case was the collapse of Romanian minnows Unirea Urziceni, as pointed out by Jake Miller. Unirea finished second in the Romanian League in 2009-10 and enjoyed a solid Champions League campaign in 2010-11 (beating Rangers 4-1 at Ibrox in the group stage) and another second-placed league finish. Defeat in their qualifier against Zenit St Petersburg was the final straw for the chairman Dumitru Bucsaru. Bucsaru, one of Romania&apos;s richest men, had bankrolled the club&apos;s rise and now he wanted his money back. The Observer picks up the story in 2011: &quot;Bucsaru launched his exit strategy: selling off the best of the squad and, after defeat to Liverpool in the Europa League, watching the remnants slide to relegation. Last week, authorities confirmed Bucsaru had walked away, leaving behind a shell of a club with a tax debt of \u20ac1.5m. Fixtures and fittings are being sold off to help cover that \u2013 including the turnstiles, listed at \u20ac85k.&quot; (You can read more about the rise and fall of Unirea Urziceni here, here, here and here.) The 2009-10 season was also a fine one for Sampdoria. Under the tutelage of Gigi Del Neri, Giampaolo Pazzini and Antonio Cassano fired the Blucerchiati to fourth spot in Serie A and a place in the Champions League. The Piazza De Ferrari in Genoa saw a party the like of which it had never seen before. The 2010-11 season was not so vintage. Twenty-four hours after securing fourth place, Del Neri left the club for Juventus. Werder Bremen knocked them out of the Champions League in the play-off round with a 5-4 aggregate victory. Pazzini and Cassano followed Del Neri out of the door in the winter transfer window. And a season that began in the Champions League ended in relegation. Chievo suffered a similar fate in 2006-07. The previous season the Flying Donkeys were one of the beneficiaries of Juventus&apos;s off-field problems and saw their fifth-place Serie A finish turned into fourth and a Champions League spot. But their European adventure ended at the hands of Levski Sofia in the qualifying round. And on the final day of the season the Flying Donkeys lost at Catania, a result which kept the home side up at Chievo&apos;s expense. &quot;Kiss those asses goodbye,&quot; wrote our very own James Richardson. Several sides have fallen foul of off-field issues. Most recently Rangers competed in the Champions League in 2011-12, only to find themselves dumped down to the Third Division in 2012-13. Similarly, off-field problems saw Juventus, Champions League quarter-finalists in 2005-06, relegated to the second tier for the 2006-07 season. A similar fate befell Milan after the Totonero scandal in 1979-80. And Austrian champions Tirol Innsbruck were beaten in the qualifying round by Lokomotiv Moscow in 2001-02 and despite ending the season atop the Austrian Bundesliga once more, they were relegated two divisions to the regional leagues due to their financial difficulties and began the 2002-03 campaign as WSG Wattens/FC Wacker Tirol. The Danish side Hvidovre began 1974-75 facing (and losing to) Poland&apos;s Ruch Chorzow in the European Cup first round and ended it bottom and relegated. It happened again in Denmark in 2000-01, when Herfolge were battered 6-0 by Rangers in the third qualifying round of the Champions League and relegated come the season&apos;s end. And N\u00fcrnberg won the German title in 1967-68, were beaten by Ajax in the first round of the European Cup in 1968-69 and ended that season an unfortunate second-bottom of the Bundesliga, in one of the closest divisions of all time. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Here in the Basque country,&quot; wrote Tim Tregrenza back in those halcyon days of 2006, &quot;there are football teams that select only Basque players. Athletic Bilbao is the most famous, but there is also Eibar (in the second division) and other lower league teams. Are there any other clubs around the world who have a similar policy?&quot; Indeed there are, Tim, with the most famous being Club Deportivo de Guadalajara (also known as Chivas \u2013 Spanish for &quot;goats&quot;) in Mexico. The most widely supported team in the country, Chivas have fielded only Mexican-born players for a century. Their wealthy owner, the businessman and film producer Jorge Vergara, also owns two other clubs: Costa Rica&apos;s Deportivo de Saprissa (recently beaten by Liverpool at the World Club Championship) and US Major League team Club Deportivo Chivas USA. Saprissa only use Costa Rican players, but Chivas USA&apos;s original plan to recruit only Mexican players was denied by the MLS&apos;s restrictions on foreign players. However, when the expansion side first kicked off in 2005, all but four of the 28 players in their squad were Hispanic; even their Dutch coach Thomas Rongen enrolled in a Spanish language course. Ecuadorian side Club Deportivo El Nacional, from the city of Quito, are another team with a restricted selection policy. According to Wikipedia, &quot;Nacional is called so because it belongs to the Ecuadorian military and because only players with Ecuadorian nationality are allowed to play on the team. This is why the team is nicknamed Puros Criollos (&quot;All-Creoles&quot;) or El Equipo Militar (&quot;The Military Team&quot;).&quot; The same source also explains the selection policy of Singaporean S-League team Young Lions. &quot;While the bulk of the squad is made up of members of Singapore&apos;s Under-23 team, the club also take in promising young foreign players. However, they are normally only recruited into the squad if they could potentially change their nationality to Singaporean and be eligible to play international football for Singapore at some point in the future.&quot; For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? &quot;What is the biggest ever crowd at a match which has had to be called off the the last minute?&quot; tweets Andrew Toothill. &quot;Do you know which division has the most teams beginning with the same letter?&quot; asks Danny Last. &quot;The Championship, for instance, is very &apos;B&apos; heavy.&quot; &quot;I was wondering if an own goal as ever been intentionally conceded by a player in protest or out of anger at his own club/fans/manager?&quot; writes Thomas Houghton. &quot;The Wales v Scotland game got me wondering whether two opposing managers had ever both been sacked after facing each other,&quot; wonders Craig Foley. &quot;Has a British club side ever fielded a team represented by all the continents (excluding Arctic/Antarctica)?&quot; asks Ross Purnell.

So today, in the interests of fairness, the Fiver feels obliged to point out that after things turned ugly during England Under-21&apos;s victory against their Serbian counterparts in Krusevac last night, at least one Uefa official had the integrity to clamp down hard. Referee Huseyin Gocek apparently did not see or hear anything that required him to halt the match or discourage Serbian fans from hurling racist abuse and harmful objects at England players, but he didn&apos;t miss when the target of much of that violence as well as slaps and boots from opposing players, Danny Rose, went so far as to kick a ball in frustration! Whereas namby-pamby officials might have seen fit to congratulate Rose for his composure in the face of savage hostility, Gocek decided that showing a red card was the only sensible course of action. &quot;The Serbia players were surrounding me \u2026 I remember getting slapped twice and then I got ushered away,&quot; Rose told Sky. &quot;That&apos;s when I kicked the ball \u2013 and the referee sent me off,&quot; continued the Sunderland left-back, who described some of the ordeal he had to endure before that with no protection from the powers-that-be. &quot;I had two stones hit me in the head when I went to get the ball for a throw-in. Every time I touched the ball I heard monkey chants. After 60 minutes my mind wasn&apos;t really on the game after that, I was so angry and it was just so hard to concentrate.&quot; But concentrate he did, enough to help England to a place in next year&apos;s finals, part of which he could miss due to suspension. For kicking a ball. In response to sustained verbal and physical abuse. Now that the heinous Footballer Kicks Ball incident has been dealt with, inquiring minds want to know if anyone at Uefa will get around to addressing meaningfully some of the seemingly less important stuff that occurred last night, such as that pesky racist violence thing. Previously, the European governing body of football has wagged its finger quite sternly in the general direction of offenders, and even docked some of them an afternoon&apos;s pocket money. Indeed, Serbia has found itself on the receiving end of Uefa&apos;s half-baked wrath on several occasions, including after racist abuse and/or physical violence by its fans and/or players in 2003, 2007 and 2010. And you can see how deterred they have been by the authorities&apos; punishments to date. Not that the Serbian FA is having any of it. No sirree. &quot;[We] absolutely refuse and deny that there were any occurrences of racism before and during the match,&quot; wailed a statement. &quot;Danny Rose behaved in [an] inappropriate, unsportsmanlike and vulgar manner towards the supporters \u2026 In support of our statement, there are preliminary reports of the match officials. None of them in any moment did mention racist situation and we expect that human and sports culture of our football friends from England will win over misinformation spread.&quot; Hmm \u2026 &quot;I wonder if Blatter is gonna say they should just shake hands!??&quot; tweeted Anton Ferdinand pertinently. &quot;Disgraceful what happened in Serbia last night \u2013 manager/captain should just take team off the field and refuse to play c what UEFA do then,&quot; added Phil Neville. &quot;It&apos;s not about them winning its about making a proper stand-not wearing a t-shirt for 10 mins once a year-stop the game walk off shame them.&quot; All sorts of English authorities joined in the condemnation.

Or wondered why satellites don&apos;t crash into each other? Or why you dial 64 to reach New Zealand, but 65 for Singapore? These are some of the mundane but essential logistical achievements of the International Telecommunication Union, a specialist UN agency that dates back to 1865. Yet as it gears up for its first global conference in 14 years, the ITU has found itself under unprecedented attack. The first assailant is the powerful US technology lobby. Companies, including Google, are claiming that new ITU proposals would mean internet companies paying hefty fees to local telecoms companies, reigniting historic tensions between US internet giants and incumbent telecoms firms across the world. But that&apos;s not the only battle that will be played out this December when the ITU&apos;s 193 member states gather in Dubai. Russia and China have been explicit in their goal of taking control of the internet away from the US, while developing countries feel the western technology hegemony is limiting their economic opportunities. With the world&apos;s internet population predicted to reach 3.4 billion by 2016, there is everything to play for. The ITU has not helped its case. Suspected by some critics of encouraging the controversial proposals, comments by the eloquent secretary general Dr Hamadoun Tour\u00e9 seem designed to antagonise the US. He told Vanity Fair earlier this year: &quot;When an invention becomes used by billions across the world, it no longer remains the sole property of one nation, however powerful that nation might be. There should be a mechanism where many countries have an opportunity to have a say.&quot; The reaction to some of these new proposals, or ITRs, has been a comprehensive, well-organised and well-funded campaign by a cabal of powerful American corporates \u2013 including Google, Microsoft, Cisco, AT&amp;T and Comcast. Much of the resulting media coverage of the ITU, particularly in the US, has ranged from dismissive to aggressive, labelling the low-profile union obscure and irrelevant and exploiting American animosity for the UN. Expanding profile Much of the damning coverage has focused on proposed changes to the wording of several ITRs that appear to attempt to expand ITU&apos;s remit from telecoms to the internet. Given that the organisation began by co-ordinating telegraph communications and expanded to telephones, mobiles and data, it isn&apos;t unreasonable that its members might seek to expand its remit accordingly. But its members also include 700 private-sector organisations, and one of those, the European Telecommunications Network Operators (ETNO), has caused the most contention among the US tech lobby by pushing for a proposal that would effectively allow telcos to charge companies for delivering their content. &quot;What we want is a pricing model that ensures the revenue of operators and allows content providers to better compete in the market,&quot; ETNO&apos;s chairman Luigi Gambardella told La Repubblica this month. For a player like Google or anybody else delivering media over the net, that could prove very expensive. Google&apos;s chief internet evangelist Vint Cerf has been one of the big guns rolled out to lobby against the proposed regulations, describing the proposal to return to the &quot;sender pays&quot; principle as regressive. He claims that model had failed in the telephone world, particularly in developing countries where paying telcos high settlement rates had supposedly funded infrastructure, but instead ended up in the pockets of government treasuries or officials. &quot;It&apos;s the absolute antithesis of the internet where the participating parties on the edge of the network pay for access to it,&quot; he said. &quot;Freedom to innovate on the network has been largely a consequence of its economic model and its openness.&quot; The ad-hoc coalition lobbying against ITU proposals is made up of Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Comcast and AT&amp;T and 10 others, and is chaired by ambassador David Gross, a lawyer, past chair of several delegations to the ITU, and former government international communications policy coordinator. He represented the group when it testified at a congressional hearing in May. &quot;[The sender pays proposal] is asking for trouble because it&apos;s suggesting the model, a model that is clearly working, would need to be revised for no apparent, real reason, other than the economic benefit of a few carriers,&quot; he told Digital Trends in August. &quot;I will quickly add that my coalition has major carriers, like AT&amp;T and Verizon, and they also think that this is the wrong way to go.&quot;     Global pressure: the ITU faces attacks from tech giants and hostile governments. Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP/Getty Images    Campaigning for the open web For its part, Google has campaigned hard under the banner of the open web and the media-genic issues of free speech and-anti censorship that other ITU proposals allude to. But make no mistake \u2013 this is absolutely business as usual for a company worth $243bn (\u00a3150bn) because the sender pays principle \u2013 which is said to be gaining traction among African and Arab delegations \u2013 would be catastrophic for its business, effectively taxing every interaction with its 700 million or so daily userbase. Add to that the threat posed to Google&apos;s income by Facebook&apos;s monopoly of social data and related advertising and the trend for &quot;privatised&quot; data inside mobile apps, and suddenly Google&apos;s mission to &quot;index the world&apos;s data&quot; seems rather more precarious. No wonder Google has made a campaign for the open web such a priority. This is what Google&apos;s chief legal officer, David Drummond, describes as a &quot;happy coincidence&quot;. &quot;We are not ashamed,&quot; he says, &quot;to say the open web is good for the world, and happens to create good opportunities for business&quot;. On the other hand, administration and organisation of the internet has been dominated by the US since Arpanet, the precursor to the modern internet, was established between four US universities in 1969, and a handful of US-controlled authorities followed. The biggest point of contention is Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees management of internet address. Icann has responded to global pressure by internationalising its management board, though it is still a California-based non-profit. The US has, however, fiercely defended the root zone, the core domain name and numbering system run by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (Iana) \u2013 which remains on contract to the US Department of Commerce managed by Icann. On this, they will go down fighting.     Circles of influence: tech giants fear hefty fees to telecoms companies    Challenging western dominance Western dominance is the one of the biggest challenges for developing nations, says Alice Munyua, a researcher and policy development expert, representing Kenya and Africa on forums such as Icann. &quot;It is a big concern for African governments and stakeholders, and not just because of how the internet is governed, but how it is developed from a commercial and technical perspective,&quot; she said. &quot;There is a feeling that we are not able to participate or contribute effectively because of the lack of capacity, skills and resources, so there&apos;s a digital divide in terms of access, but also in appropriating the internet for our own development.&quot; This, she believes, is the reason most African governments are supporting Arab proposals that countries should be compensated, by websites and internet services, for the flow of internet traffic they generate, and that wide-ranging privacy protections be introduced with exceptions for law enforcement. Drummond said he was sympathetic with developing countries who feel excluded from the western-dominated internet industry. &quot;But the treaty route, and the lowest common denominator approach mandating a certain set of technologies or regulations, is not the way to go.&quot; Munyua says even finding delegates who understand issues of internet management and governance can be difficult, and that with problems as basic as a unreliable electricity supply, African nations have different priorities when engaging with the ITU. Elsewhere in the ITU, the battle for control is more like a cold war. Russia, backed by several Middle Eastern countries and by China, has pushed for more cybersecurity regulations and for more ITU control of domain names: this follows Russian president Vladimir Putin stating last year that Russia aimed to establish &quot;international control over the internet using the monitoring and supervisory capabilities of the International Telecommunication Union&quot;. It has mooted cutting off internet access for anyone who threatens network security, called for a new UN body to replace Icann, and campaigned, but failed, with a previous UN proposal to create a cybersecurity code of conduct. Eleanor Saitta, technical director of the International Modern Media Institute, is also a hacker and security consultant. She warns that one of the biggest threats is the increasing militarisation of the internet. Even as the 193 nations of the ITU meet in December, some of those nations will be silently unleashing state-sponsored cyber attacks on each other, as well as surveillance and censorship on their citizens. Occasional reports of this flourishing industry surface; just last month the UK government was moved to block software exports to Egypt after Gamma International admitted selling a product that could remotely copy files, log keystrokes and record video. &quot;We are seeing governments wanting to get involved in censorship and surveillance and that truly has the potential to break the internet, because it will not function as a network or community where people can collaborate and share,&quot; said Saitta. America&apos;s corporate internet industry has already had to battle on home turf, however. In 2011, the Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa) and Protect IP Act (Pipa) proposed significantly expanded power for US law enforcement in identifying and penalising copyright infringement. Google was one of the loudest voices in this lobby, putting its sophisticated Washington policy department to work. The campaign, which saw high-profile sites including Wikipedia and Reddit black out for a day in protest, has succeeded in postponing the legislation for now.     Public eye: Google's near-monopoly on search is coming under scrutiny. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA    Google in the dock But lobbying by Google and its contemporaries against the ITU may well end up backfiring. Google is likely to face an anti-trust hearing in the US by the end of the year, investigating whether Google gives preferential treatment to its own products in search listings. The European Commission is also building a case against Google; the combination could stop Google expanding its US and UK businesses where Google accounts for 65% and 90% of the respective search markets. The search engine is also fighting a privacy battle against European regulators unhappy at how Google shares data between YouTube, Gmail and its other products. On one hand, Google is preaching for an open web, while on the other operating a virtual monopoly in search. The lobby&apos;s arguments on cybersecurity look weaker in the light of America&apos;s own Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or Cispa, which was widely condemned by civil rights groups for sacrificing the privacy of its citizens to allow the government to trace hackers. Hot on the heels of Sopa, it was passed by Congress, killed off by the Senate and is now being revisited by the Senate. US defence secretary Leon Panetta claimed this week that the US risked a &quot;cyber Pearl Harbour&quot; if it did not resolve its cybersecurity issues. The US government itself was implicated in the development of the Stuxnet and Flame viruses which was intended to derail and spy on the Iranian nuclear programme, and the White House has also claimed it was subject to an attack in October from hackers linked to the Chinese government. With so much to contend with on home turf, why, asks internet governance policy analyst professor Milton Mueller, is the US technology lobby chucking so much firepower at the declining institution of the ITU? They might do better, he suggests, to focus attention on Icann, pointing out problems with how governments engage with the group on advisory committees. Mueller says: &quot;We&apos;re all &apos;prepared to fight the ITU&apos; \u2013 but we&apos;re ignoring threats that come from Icann, the US government and from nation states. We&apos;re not building the kind of new institutions we need to govern the internet and keep it free.&quot; \u2022 Jemima Kiss will be hosting a Google+ Hangout on Thursday 18 October at 5pm BST on the battle for the internet"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/europe-crisis-latin-america-view", "sentences": ["The Peruvian actor Jason Day remarks that &quot;although to this day a trip to Paris is still a trip to Paris, those who&apos;ve already spent a week in China or a couple days in Singapore won&apos;t be quite as appreciative."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-18T07:16:36Z", "title": "Latin America's view: 'We can't look up to Europe anymore'", "tags": ["Argentina", "Chile", "Uruguay", "Peru", "Americas", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "Latin America is no stranger to financial crises. But even so, the continent is perplexed at the extent of Europe&apos;s travails. Not just the mess, but the response: that Europeans appear to accept that the weakest members of society should shoulder the heaviest burden of the economic crisis. One of the most noteworthy critics of the dominance of markets over politics is Roberto Lavagna, the economy minister soon after Argentina&apos;s debt crisis of the early 2000s. Lavagna was largely responsible for getting his country out of the big 2001 crisis. He is now very critical of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez&apos;s policy, but agrees with her in asserting that the rest of Europe is doing badly by trying to meet the demands of Germany and the International Monetary Fund. &quot;The cuts destroying the people&apos;s purchasing power are recessionary and don&apos;t yield results in terms of fiscal equilibrium,&quot; he says. &quot;Germany directed this current, backed moreover by an EU government in Brussels with no power or influence, and an International Monetary Fund that had always supported this blueprint. That was the blueprint which they offered Argentina and which we rejected in 2002.&quot; He added: &quot;I&apos;m amazed at the enormous sums of money they give to the banks, and I wonder: why not help out consumers who are in debt? Because helping them, rescheduling their loans, lowering their interest rates etc will eventually help consumers regain some confidence, rekindle demand and get the economy going.&quot; Argentinian philosopher Ricardo Forster, a supporter of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez&apos;s government, recalls that in 1990s Argentina, orthodox economists dominated the political landscape \u2013 and the thinking at the time was &quot;it&apos;s inevitable&quot;. The worst austerity measures seemed inevitable. And yet even Argentina didn&apos;t witness the savage wage devaluation going on in Spain. &quot;I was in Spain recently and a few professor friends of mine told me how they were stripped of their half-yearly bonus [a bonus, equivalent to one month&apos;s salary, paid twice a year to Spanish employees]. That never happened in Argentina even in the worst days of the crisis.&quot; For many of us Latin Americans, Europe remains a mirror in which to take a good look at ourselves. But that mirror looks increasingly misty and remote. &quot;A financial crisis (or several crises together, with their respective social concomitants) cannot wipe out centuries of cultural development,&quot; asserts Dante Trujillo, the Peruvian founding editor of the literary journal MalPensante. But in view of Europe&apos;s decline, contrasted with the &quot;economic and cultural development of South America&quot;, Trujillo is reconsidering &quot;who is the noble savage now&quot;. The Uruguayan writer Mauricio Rosencof sees a fluctuating Europe &quot;that wants to and can&apos;t&quot;, a Europe in which rubbish bins in Spain, for example, are sometimes padlocked to keep people from fishing spoilt food out of the refuse. &quot;This, theoretically, ought to be left for America,&quot; he says. The Peruvian actor Jason Day remarks that &quot;although to this day a trip to Paris is still a trip to Paris, those who&apos;ve already spent a week in China or a couple days in Singapore won&apos;t be quite as appreciative.[\u2026] Your average Peruvian drives east Asian cars. Ferraris and Aston Martins are not for us. &quot;Although we admire and desire them, we know they correspond to a different reality. To what do we aspire? To &apos;beating Chile&apos;, speaking Chinese, negotiating with Koreans and perhaps some day, why not, getting to know Paris, where our beloved poet C\u00e9sar Vallejo died. Because having a photo of the Champs Elys\u00e9es still confers a certain social status. &quot;For a limited group of intellectuals, artists, academics and people with a lot of money, Europe remains the continent of high culture. Berlin, for those in the know, is the cultural centre of the world. It&apos;s in the vanguard of art, music, design, architecture\u2026 But none of this is of any importance in the everyday life of your average Peruvian. In any case, the number of Europeans coming to the country to stay has not escaped anyone&apos;s attention; we know they&apos;re not doing very well over there. And we know how it feels not to be doing well.&quot; This awareness that Europe is going through a very hard time can also breed distrust of European investors. Horacio A Losoviz, the Argentinian president of Indra (a Spanish IT and defence company) in Buenos Aires, believes the crisis has reduced &quot;credibility about the possibility of obtaining investments from those countries&quot;. And the lack of credibility &quot;fuels the notion that they will try to bring more profits and capital to the &apos;mother country&apos; to cover current losses in their own markets&quot;. Some intellectuals bemoan that the mirror has not only become remote and misted over, but shattered. The Chilean solicitor Carlos Pe\u00f1a, president of Diego Portales University in Santiago and political columnist for the daily El Mercurio, remembers that for many years, &quot;no less than during the first half of the 20th century&quot;, the model to be emulated by Chile&apos;s political and intellectual elite was European, a model regarded as &quot;a state of universal and expanding rights&quot;. However, &quot;the breakdown of democracy \u2013 the 1973 coup d&apos;\u00e9tat \u2013 was the final failure of that effort. The dictatorship subsequently replaced the European dream with the American dream.&quot; But in recent years, Chileans have begun complaining about the excessive privatisation of life: &quot;And then the elites began turning their gaze back towards Europe.&quot; Chileans began calling for expanded rights in the areas of education and healthcare. &quot;But at the time they came up against the fact that Europe was in a crisis and an expansion of rights was apparently not possible at all. This is the meaning the European crisis holds for Chile: that all the dreams seem to have been shattered,&quot; concludes Pe\u00f1a. Pe\u00f1a isn&apos;t the only one who thinks that sooner or later Europe&apos;s troubles will affect Latin America. &quot;Over the past 20 years, Europe achieved standards of democracy, transparency and pluralism, of caring about minorities, culture and social equity, unrivalled by any other region in the world,&quot; says the Argentine journalist and writer Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez Diaz. &quot;It was a role model and beacon for many countries. And so, its current crisis is having an adverse impact on those same emerging republics, where Europe&apos;s new troubles are used as alibis to violate the rules of democracy. &quot;For conservatives in our nations, the crisis is to be blamed on the &apos;excessive&apos; welfare state. For those on the left, it&apos;s due to the uniform practice of neoliberalism. In my humble opinion, it has been sufficiently demonstrated that letting the market vultures run amok and, at the same time, tightly controlling the exchange rate were the real reasons for this collapse.&quot; Amid so much frustration, Liniers, one of Argentina&apos;s most well-known cartoonists, seeks to draw an optimistic conclusion: &quot;You Europeans are not used to 10-year cycles. Here, the timelines have almost always been that way. In 2001 they stole our money. As they&apos;re stealing yours today. I remember that back in the 1980s, when I was a boy, my Walkman was stolen at a train station. A thief came up to me and said, &apos;I&apos;m going to beat the crap out of you if you don&apos;t give it to me.&apos; I felt furious and humiliated. But when I got home my folks consoled me. And very soon you realise that decent people are always there. In Europe their Walkmans are being stolen today, but creative people are still there. They don&apos;t disappear. Now if they took away Cervantes, Velazquez and Caravaggio \u2026 well, then they&apos;d be fleecing all of us.&quot; Translated from the Spanish by Eric Rosencrantz"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/19/brand-licensing-europe-report", "sentences": ["It is now being distributed across Singapore and Malaysia, with further publishing licenses and distribution agreements being lined up for neighbouring regions."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-19T11:21:01Z", "title": "Brand Licensing Europe report: Licensing shows its Turtle Power", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Advertising"], "article": "This year&apos;s Brand Licensing Europe event at Olympia is the 14th in its history. The world&apos;s biggest brands are here in force from the media, entertainment, sports and lifestyle sectors, with over 280 brand owners here showcasing over 2,200 brands, characters and images available for license. The premise of licensing is simple \u2013 I have a brand, you have a product that you believe can sell better through association with my brand, I agree and think fans of my brand will love it so we do a deal around some form of revenue-share and let&apos;s go. I can hear licensing professionals wincing as they read that but in principle that&apos;s it. Joining the brand owners and product creators are teams and teams of retail buyers from the powerhouses \u2013 Sainsburys, Tescos, Asda, Mothercare\u2026 the list goes on. They&apos;re here to discuss brand strategy with some of the worlds&apos; biggest brands and to spot &quot;the next big thing&quot; that will drive retail sales over the coming 18 \u2013 24 months. Licensed products for Peter Jackson&apos;s The Hobbit, tick. The full range of products for FIFA 2014 World Cup, tick. Physical products for digital sensations like Angry Birds and Moshi Monsters, tick and tick. Here&apos;s five trends that I&apos;ve identified from this year&apos;s show. 1. Licensing is increasing in importance as a revenue stream for all businesses, particularly those in the media and entertainment space. As established revenue streams, such as DVD sales, TV advertising and paid-media are challenged, licensing offers up an exciting new way to bring in revenue from fans. The world&apos;s biggest brands \u2013 World Cups, blockbuster films, hit TV shows, major sports teams and more \u2013 are investing in the development of powerful licensing campaigns to extend the reach and value of their brands 2. But its not just global businesses. Entrepreneurs are here too. One example is Hari&apos;s World: a cartoon character featuring in his own books to drive child safety awareness. Created by a father and son team, both of whom are experts in the risk business wanting to make a difference. One was a personal injury barrister and the other an ex-army major. They created the character to take children on adventures but to teach them to be safe along the way. It is now being distributed across Singapore and Malaysia, with further publishing licenses and distribution agreements being lined up for neighbouring regions. Meanwhile City of Friends is uniquely based on the adventures of real-life Norway state police officer Carl Christian Hamre. Hamre created bedtime stories for his young son based on his day job as a police officer and within four years, established CreaCon Group, one of Norway&apos;s largest independent children&apos;s entertainment production companies with businesses spanning television production, licensing, live events, music and digital operations. 3. Licensing is evident in how current / hyped brands of the moment are being extended. Examples include Caroline Mickler Ltd showcasing lingerie, sleepwear, apparel, bedding, home furnishings, stationery, jewellery and adult products for Fifty Shades of Grey. At the same time, CPLG is exploring opportunities for Downton Abbey and The Only Way Is Essex while FreeMantle Media is exploring opportunities with the X Factor &amp; Britain&apos;s got Talent. 4. The return of classic brands: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back as a highlight at this year&apos;s show, on the back of a new TV series and celebrating over 25 years since the characters&apos; first appeared. They are joined by Roobarb &amp; Custard, Batfink, Garfield, Where&apos;s Wally (celebrating its 25th anniversary), Purple Ronnie (celebrating its 25th anniversary), My Little Pony, Transformers, Monopoly, Power Rangers (another 25th anniversary), R Whites lemonade and Rainbow which is 40 years old this year. 5. There is an exciting future for licensing in mobile gaming which has emerged as an area of significant growth. People are interacting with gaming content in a different way on smartphones or tablets. With the forthcoming release of the Kindle Family Fire, this Christmas will see more tablets in UK households than ever before. Disney Mobile boasts award-winning studios that consistently develop chart-topping, critically-acclaimed apps. Disney is known for developing memorable characters and &quot;Where&apos;s My Water?&quot;, which boasts Disney&apos;s first original game character, Swampy the alligator, is no exception. &quot;Where&apos;s My Water?&quot; has reached the Number 1 spot on the App Store in 90 different countries and also made App Store history as the 25 billionth app downloaded. In June 2012, Apple recognised the game with the Apple Design Award, awarded for innovation and design excellence in developer products. In this world where everyone is fighting for consumer attention, licensing is a way of extending the attention span. If a consumer loves your brand, they will want to spend more time with it. Licensing gives your brand the opportunity to increase the time a consumer spends with you. What&apos;s evident at Brand Licensing Europe is how you do this is limited only by your imagination, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit.

With &quot;Thomas Muntzer&quot; he offered the condensed autobiography of a reformation revolutionary, while &quot;1815&quot; remains the definitive contemporary poem of the industrial revolution. Wainwright juxtaposes Wellington riding among the &quot;deep-chested rosy ploughboys&quot; killed at Waterloo, while an anonymous mill-girl is drowned in a canal, and a mill-owner is amazed to discover that his wealth cannot prevent a fatal seizure. All these are parts of &quot;the English miracle&quot; that thrives &quot;on coal and iron and wool&quot;, killing as it creates a new England as pitiless as any of which George Osborne could dream. These poems are richly suggestive and yet intimidatingly austere: Wainwright makes his own space between the packed allusiveness of early Geoffrey Hill and the fierce, stammering energy of Tony Harrison. He offers, sparingly, a powerful clarity, as in &quot;The Dead Come Back&quot;: &quot;Unable as we are to die, / The dead come back to us in dreams \u2013 / As we are told they do, so they come.&quot; This is something different from style or manner. The austerity extends to the bibliography: Wainwright has not published a great deal, and what he does publish makes no effort to ingratiate itself with the reader \u2013 which brings us to The Reasoner, a book that at times seems hardly to care whether or not it&apos;s a collection of poems or a series of lightly versified ruminations, a commonplace book of unanswerable inquiries. The Reasoner himself is a speaker continually in search of understanding through the application of reason to experience and observation. Yet he is always also at the mercy of the imagination&apos;s impulse to digress and to bridge gaps in sense as an inescapable consequence of being what it is. In poem 20 (there are 95), the Reasoner hears a percussive noise in the distance \u2013 a bird-scarer, perhaps, or fireworks. &quot;The mind can associate anything with anything / and casts about: will sounds go with sights / or movements, this wisp of thistledown going quickly by?&quot; Eliot is somewhere in the offing here, and at the close: &quot;Today, and maybe for all time, I will insist / that the percussions must also be met elsewhere / in a space that is more than this mind.&quot; It seems as though Wainwright is resisting the temptation to make the cadences more memorable, perhaps to expose the starkness of the need to be convinced that language belongs to the world and does not merely decorate it. The poet is going to considerable trouble not to write the kind of lyrics where such anxiety might be assuaged by submergence in the general music \u2013 the kind of thing Nietzsche condemned as &quot;sickly-sweet whimsy and tinkle-tinkle&quot;. Whether this is a good idea, only time will tell, since The Reasoner feels like a prelude to something else, perhaps to the grand conversion of notes and queries into a complete work (though of a kind the notes and queries may seem to forbid). In poem 18, while ironically sounding rather Brechtian, the Reasoner is found exposing in the baldest terms the sense of disconnection from the history of his own political formation: &quot;In the reading rooms for working men, / it was written: &apos;Get Knowledge, Get Understanding.&apos; / But what I keep thinking is / I don&apos;t know what the mind is.&quot; This seems both a luxury and a necessity, given the cultural and political climate. Returning to the theme from another direction in poem 64, Wainwright allows himself greater rhetorical latitude. Nature &quot;has a tendency towards / concealment, a disinclination to show its hand, / and the skeins of its web are thought all the stronger / half-disclosed, and its whole harmony \u2013 / could it but be sprung to view \u2013 / therefore shapelier and more certain sure.&quot; He enacts this beautiful casuistry as a preface not to the unified picture of nature we might have expected, a garden perhaps, but to an atomised view of discrete bits and pieces \u2013 banksia, a rose, a spider and, through closed eyes, &quot;a squarish red shadow shimmering in a shirt cuff&quot;. The last item sounds like a Rothko. There we end. It takes considerable stubbornness not to betray doubt and incompleteness into consolation before due time. The Reasoner calls himself a &quot;lucky fuck&quot;, with a rich life and room for manoeuvre, room to advance the claim in poem 94 (with a strange echo of King Lear) that &quot;this is not a wicked but a hard world, / and people struggle, without a scheme of things, / and deserve release. That&apos;s it, willing it so.&quot; There is a compelling tenderness in poem 73, &quot;at Kranji war cemetery, Singapore&quot;, where the Reasoner recalls the grief of Uncle Percy&apos;s mother at the loss of her son: &quot;sectioned for her grief, / locked in all that countryside / until she could say what he is now: / this photo, a frame of ordinary medals, / a stripe of wall, unvisitable, / where he is incised by race, /service-arm, rank, number, and alphabet, / in column 437, everything about him attended to daily / in this needful dream, this phantasm of order.&quot; This is worth the wait. Wainwright keeps his powder dry for the apt occasion, which then ushers the reader back into the maze \u2013 itself a &quot;phantasm of order&quot; \u2013 of this most uncommonplace book. \u2022 Sean O&apos;Brien&apos;s November is published by Picador."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/oct/22/francis-maude-learn-france-reform", "sentences": ["In September 2012, thinktank IPPR was appointed to carry out an external review of the government machinery in other countries, specifically Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, Sweden \u2013 and France."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-22T13:00:06Z", "title": "What Francis Maude can learn from France on civil service reform", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Central government", "Civil service"], "article": "Francis Maude, the minister for the Cabinet Office, is keen to look overseas for examples of civil service reform. If he looks across the Channel, he will conclude that reform can be neither part-time nor half-hearted. Just over two years ago, in June 2010,Maude said he was &quot;a big fan of the civil service \u2026 I do worship at the shrine of Northcote-Trevelyan&quot;. In June 2012, Maude published his civil service reform plan and his frustration with the civil service is becoming more palpable, as his speech in early October, on &quot;unacceptable&quot; blocking of government policies, revealed. In September 2012, thinktank IPPR was appointed to carry out an external review of the government machinery in other countries, specifically Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, Sweden \u2013 and France. That review will be published shortly. But a deep insight into the French model is available from a series of interviews carried out for consultancy KcKinsey with Francois-Daniel Migeon, the leader of Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la modernisation de l&apos;\u00c9tat, the body launched in 2007 to co-ordinate the transformation of French government reform, and one of the key architects of the major public sector reforms initiated in France in 2008. In the most recent interview, published in October 2012, Migeon says it is possible to transform the civil service and change how the workforce operates in order to improve quality and save money. The emphasis is about shifting from focusing on resources to focusing on results. &quot;Civil servants understand that in order to truly serve, their duty is to modernise,&quot; says Migeon. There are some valuable lessons for Whitehall. First, the commitment must come from the highest levels of government. Civil service reform was a crucial pillar of President Sarkozy&apos;s campaign platform when he came to office in 2007. As a result, he had a democratic mandate and a personal investment in the programme&apos;s success. Ministers were given the freedom to implement efficiencies in their departments and meet targets for the improvement of services. At the same time, the political profile of the scheme was maintained by a steering committee made up of the prime minister, budget minister and the president&apos;s chiefs of staff, who met ministers every three months to discuss progress. The information was made available to the public through an online portal that showed where progress was being made. Second, it pays to be clear and honest about the objectives of any reform programme. Migeon argues that the scale of the programme was &quot;second to none&quot;, aiming to achieve \u20ac15bn of savings during 2009-2013 across 18 government ministries employing 2.5 million civil servants. By communicating this early on, everyone knew there was going to be a radical overhaul of government. Such ambitious targets were never going to be achieved by tinkering around the edges. The programme has so far achieved \u20ac7bn savings and by the end of 2012 head count will have come down by 150,000. Third, focus on what matters to people. Migeon and his colleagues found that in general, most people perceived government services to be effective based on a small number of personal and professional interactions or &quot;life events&quot;. How easy was it, for instance, to obtain a marriage licence or register the birth of a child, and, for businesses, to open a new branch or office? The government made it a key goal to increase public confidence by simplifying these interactions. Recent assessments show that on an individual level, the perceived complexity of conducting these &quot;life events&quot; has decreased by 20% and for businesses by 25%. They used quick wins to get public confidence behind the programme. Good departments have been held up as an example to weaker departments, showing them that change is possible. Maude and the government are right to look overseas for examples of transformational change. We have much to learn. The French story shows that reform has to be an organising principle of government. To reform government, the government must reform the civil service and it must make this reform centre stage.

Wholly unconcerned with the trappings of stardom, they arrive, play their hearts out and exit stage left, blending seamlessly back into the crowds. On stage, however, the band transports audience members to a sonic wonderland coloured with soaring harmonies and unforgettable lyrics. The Gar just released their new EP, The City Of Burning Identities.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloOndatr\u00f3pica \u2013 3 Reyes De La TerapiaThis is what we call a supergroup. The union between Colombian musician Mario Galeano, from Frente Cumbiero, and English producer Will Holland, aka Quantic, resulted in Ondatr\u00f3pica \u2013 a musical research project through Colombian tropical sounds. Both Galeano and Quantic, scholars of Colombian and electronic rhythms, were given the task of recreating traditional sounds with vintage equipment and old recording techniques, but searching for its contemporaneity. Proof of this is 3 Reyes de la Terapia (&quot;3 Kings Of Therapy&quot;), featuring Juan Carlos Puello, which was made using a marimba, accordion and beatbox.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianKjartan Bue \u2013 Rosen And DannyHalf-Norwegian, half-Danish and raised in Denmark, Kjartan Bue debuts his five-track alt-country EP Man Riding Backwards on 15 November (I&apos;ve heard it and it&apos;s great). Here&apos;s Rosen And Danny as a MAP exclusive download, and do make sure you also check out the title track and closing ballad Old Woman here \u2013 the latter is also up for free download.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraEl Gran Poder De Diosa \u2013 Moriviv\u00edA Moriviv\u00ed is a minuscule tropical plant that has an unusual reaction when touched: it folds up and &quot;dies&quot; then &quot;comes back to life&quot; after several minutes. This song by reggae/Caribbean-influenced band El Gran Poder De Diosa reflects that internal debate between life and death, good and evil, through soothing tunes and clever wordplay.  ECUADOR: Plan ArteriaClo Sismico \u2013 Cassette PirataClo Sismico is a renowned musician, producer and MC. He is founder of two important bands in the local independent music scene, 38 Que No Juega (hip-hop) and Punto De Encaje (hardcore). This year Clo Sismico released his second album, Cassette Pirata, which blends rap, funk and Latin music with explosive, direct lyrics.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogNadine Shah \u2013 Aching BonesStraight out of Whitburn comes this singer and pianist-guitarist of Norwegian and Pakistani parentage who actually sounds more like the love child of Nick Cave and Polly Harvey. Shah&apos;s tales of lust and loss, revenge and regret are female takes on Trent Reznor&apos;s industrial blues, her voice redolent of the battle-worn Marianne Faithfull circa Broken English. The title track of her EP is vengefully dark business as usual for Shah as she roars over an insistent clang that provides the rhythm for the song. Her debut album Love Your Dumb and Mad, due early next year, should be a fiery, passionate hoot.  FINLAND: GluePaperfangs \u2013 EverydayPaperfangs is a dream-pop trio that draws inspiration from old movies, visual arts, geometric shapes, late-night biking trips, vintage girl groups, chamber pop and shoegaze, as well as the latest indie gems. A debut album will not be ready until next year, but in the meantime we can enjoy the band&apos;s take on one of the greatest melody makers ever as the trio covers Buddy Holly&apos;s Everyday.  FRANCE: Yet You&apos;re FiredTotal Warr \u2013 xxx Hate xxxTotal Warr are not complete unknowns in the blogosphere, having been widely praised for their sweet electro-pop. Stereogum premiered xxx HATE xxx back in May and now that the Corbay EP is out, you don&apos;t have any more excuses not to listen to it.  GERMANY: BlogparteiVIMES \u2013 UpStairsIt&apos;s getting cold really fast these days so let&apos;s turn to some music which may give us comfort. Cologne newcomers VIMES is a duo with a penchant for vibrant electronic music. The voice of Azhar Syed gives the electronics of Julian Stetter a melancholic and yearning touch, thereby making VIMES recognisable. Live they are accompanied by VJ Till Beutling for a complete audiovisual experience. They are currently recording their debut album.  GREECE: MouxlalouloudaCircassian \u2013 Eastern PatternsCircassian is a quartet formed in Athens in 2008. Their music demonstrates their traditions and habits, while their philosophy is based on bringing together experimental, neo-psychedelic patterns and forms of atonality along with ethnic melodies drawn from parts of Asia and Northern Africa. They create an eerie yet intimate atmosphere with a distinctive sound. Their second EP, Procrastinational, is available on Bandcamp.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnBorko \u2013 Born To Be FreeBorn To Be Free is Borko&apos;s first single from his long-awaited sophomore album, also named Born to Be Free, released in Iceland this month through Kimi Records and on 2 November through Sound of a Handshake for the rest of the world. Borko&apos;s first LP, Celebrating Life, was released to rave reviews.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarRock N Roll Mafia \u2013 Never Give UpIndonesia&apos;s finest electro band is back with their new album Prodigal, produced by Widi Puradiredja. Their sound is so fresh, optimistic and definitely danceable.  IRELAND: Nialler9Lar Kaye \u2013 EffectorWhile his main band Adebisi Shank are between things, guitarist Lar Kaye has been at his musical toy box and that bout of activity has resulted in a dizzying five-track solo EP. Effector is a hyperactive child of a song featuring pounding drum crashes, 8-bit melodies, cartoon samples, R&amp;B female vocals and spiralling guitar notes. The sound of one man having a lot of fun and dishing it out for free. Infectious.  ITALY: PolaroidMontgomery \u2013 RefrigeratorIt was very hard to choose just one song from the split EP by Montgomery and ED (available for free download on Bandcamp). Every track captures a perfect moment of acoustic pop, both light and moving, so my advice is to check out both acts. I picked Refrigerator by Montgomery because it&apos;s the best &quot;goodnight&quot; song I&apos;ve heard in a long time. Montgomery is a promising new group from Verona with members from the bands Canadians and Le Man Avec les Lunettes.  JAPAN: Make Believe Melodiesmus.hiba \u2013 Magical Fizzy DrinkMagical Fizzy Drink features vocals courtesy of Yufu Sekka. Thing is, Yufu Sekka is not a real person but rather a character tied to something called Vocaloid software, a singing synthesiser program. Tokyo-based artist mus.hiba uses this program in a way few in Japan have - instead of using the digital singing as a diva stand-in, Yufu Sekka gets turned into an electronic ghost haunting the background of this gorgeous, heady production.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaBrikkuni \u2013 Fil-Gallinar Tas-SultanTorn between their arty pretensions and a morbid fascination with kitsch, Brikkuni (&quot;scoundrels&quot;) try to have a stab at both. With Fil-Gallinar Tas-Sultan, the band leaves no stone unturned in its determined quest to marry reluctant bedfellows. The lyrics, sung in Maltese, recount a particularly tense day in a chicken coop owned by the titular Sultan. Riffs rise and ebb and rise again, leading to an an epic conclusion underscored by horns, strings and a pulsating bass line, all strung together by an insistent keyboard motif and \u2026 a purple chicken struggling to take flight. The song is taken from Brikkuni&apos;s sophomore album Trabokk.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rikaLos Macuanos \u2013 Sangre, Bandera, CruzLike a reveille amidst times of war against drug trafficking, Tijuana&apos;s Los Macuanos have released what may well be the curfew at the sunset of president Felipe Calder\u00f3n&apos;s administration, with his six years of futile strategies having left more than 70,000 human losses. Sangre, Bandera, Cruz (translated as &quot;Blood, Flag, Cross&quot;, written with witchcraft-associated symbols) is an ironic testimony that pictures the zeitgeist of Mexico during 2006-2012.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!WOLVON \u2013 UnicornyThis summer, Dutch bands WOLVON and Neon Rainbows set off on tour through the Balkans, playing in four countries of the former Yugoslavia. While battling the blistering heat, bored/corrupt border police, broken vehicles, stray dogs and their own preconceptions about south-eastern Europe, it was decided they&apos;d release a split 7&quot; to commemorate the experience. Unicorny is WOLVON&apos;s side of the record, launched during the independent culture festival Incubate last month. This noisy dream-pop trio has made a name for itself while touring the Dutch underground, thanks in part to their manic live antics. They&apos;re currently recording their debut full-length, which will be released through Subroutine Records in spring 2013.  PERU: SoTBPamela Rodr\u00edguez \u2013 Re-conozcoPamela Rodr\u00edguez is one of the best female voices in Peru, and recently received a Latin Grammy nomination for her third album Reconocer, which is both fresh and intense with a lot of pop inclination. The truth is that when her music starts to play, something magical happens in the ears of the listener. No matter what style she chooses, the true protagonist of her songs will always be her voice \u2013 sweet, free, sincere and perfect. Re-conozco is a beautiful and exciting piano song like few others.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogKAMP! \u2013 CairoIt&apos;s no exaggeration to say that KAMP! is the most popular band in Poland without an album to their name (although their debut record is due in November). Their elegant pop songs and fantastic live shows, including SXSW in Texas, have created a great buzz around this trio. Cairo was originally released as a single on Portuguese label Discotexas.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?The Weatherman \u2013 Proper GoodbyeAlexandre Monteiro (aka the Weatherman), after his presence on MAP in January 2009, is back with a new single which opens the way for his new album, Weatherman. A more intimate and autobiographical set of pure pop songs than his previous two albums, it&apos;s a sort of trip to outer space with plenty of time to think about life, where one can be viewed but can&apos;t view the observers.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieFantasmes \u2013 Redness MoonMario Negron and Dario Morales have been working together in psychedelic ensemble Fantasmes since 2007. For their third release, Redness Moon, Fantasmes required a space where they could compose, rehearse and record at their own pace, free from external pressures. And so a house in Santurce \u2013 San Juan&apos;s vibrant arts mecca \u2013 became Casa Fantasmes, where the duo worked tirelessly for months. The outstanding result of these sessions is their first release for New York indie label Last Bummer Records \u2013 a trippy, sci-fi, end-of-days dystopian video for first single Redness Moon was directed by Danilo Parra and is well worth your time.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseManfellow \u2013 WhyManfellow are an alternative rock band founded in Bucharest in 2011. They are known for their energetic and extravagant live performances and their fusion of many genres, including post-rock, progressive rock, alternative rock and electronic music. In December, they will represent Romania at The Global Battle Of Bands world final in London.  RUSSIA: Big EchoAnton Malinen \u2013 Rain SongAfter his successful debut Cape Of Good Hope, Anton Malinen from Saint Petersburg has released several songs through social networks. His impressive guitar and piano-based folk music continues to charm an online audience, but if Anton wants nothing more than some nice green tea for his songs, let it be the best supply for a few years at least!  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopKitty the Lion \u2013 Duck!There&apos;s cute and then there&apos;s Kitty the Lion cute, and the promo video for Duck! really does take this Glasgow band to unsurpassable levels of adorability. Frontwoman Anna Meldrum seems to have set herself a personal challenge of writing songs about subjects that are as mundane as possible, but first impressions can be deceiving. Closer inspection of her lyrics reveals exceptionally clever wordplay and crafty double-entendres. What isn&apos;t ambiguous is Kitty the Lion&apos;s pop heart, with a near-flawless grasp of melody flowing through their indie-folk veins.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up to \u2026Galactica \u2013 Saul&apos;s TighsIn a little-known recess in Singapore&apos;s music scene, there existed a group of science fiction aficionados with a common love for the space odyssey Battlestar Galactica. They went on to write some dreamily-inspired shoegaze with titles such as Saul&apos;s Tighs and Gaius Is Crying \u2026 Again, referencing series characters Colonel Saul Tigh and Dr Gaius Baltar. While the concept is an inside joke, the music is anything but. Their songcraft and taste in melodies evoke an immense sense of loss in the immeasurable vastness of space. It takes you back to the heyday of science fiction when the music was sprawling and searching, as opposed to present-day equivalents of over-budgeted pyrotechnics.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean Indie404 \u2013 WaterTwo-piece band 404 comes from the most interesting part of Korea&apos;s indie music scene. Not looking to put a label to their music, they say it&apos;s simply &quot;what a guitar/drum two-piece band would sound like in Korea in the year 2012&quot;. They recently released their first album, aptly titled 1, featuring their take on post-punk, modern rock, noise, folk-pop and a hint of blues in a surprisingly coherent mix. Water progresses playfully in a way that makes it impossible to sit entirely still while listening.  SPAIN: MusikornerWilhelm &amp; the Dancing Animals \u2013 ElephantWilhelm &amp; the Dancing Animals are from Pamplona, home town of a new wave of indie bands. Their sound can be described as folk with punk/rock influences and the animal kingdom is a feature that is often repeated in their work. They&apos;re certainly a band to follow, as we can tell from listening to their first album.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaThus:Owls \u2013 White NightThus:Owls is a Swedish/Canadian five-piece led by singer and composer Erika Angell. Together they craft carefully arranged, moving and melancholic pop with cinematic elements that&apos;s simply beautiful. Their widely and rightfully praised sophomore album Harbours is out now via Avalanche (North America) and Hoob Records (Sweden), and will be released in the rest of Europe next year on Kytopia.  SWITZERLAND: 78sMonotales \u2013 It&apos;s AlrightVelvet Underground, country, Americana, college-indie-rock, hair metal \u2026 you name it, Monotales have got it. They&apos;ve just released their sophomore album Hidden Thrills. Anything other than a lot of fun would have been a disappointment. And we looked anything other than disappointed after hearing it for the first time.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATSurrender! \u2013 ConflictedSurrender! is one of the newest emerging electronic music producers in the Turkish dance scene. Conflicted is one of his older tracks, but we are already excited about the upcoming album which will definitely be worth checking out.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouThe Cairo Gang \u2013 Everybody KnowsThe Cairo Gang make drifting seem like the only way to go about life. Their music hovers slightly above, moving at its own pace and coming down in a soft swoop at all the right moments. Hailing from Kentucky, the Cairo Gang bring warmth and introspection to the harshest country winters.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sSincr\u00f3nica \u2013 EsCupidoSincr\u00f3nica is a power trio formed in Caracas in 2001 when they participated in a college rock festival. Between 2002 and 2010 they recorded several EPs, before finally releasing their first album, Todo Lo Que No Sabes, in 2011. From this, we present the simple song EsCupido, which is also being included in the video game Rock Band."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/oct/23/creating-space-social-enterprise-singapore", "sentences": ["Six years ago, as a rebellious young adult, I left Singapore because of this.", "Singapore is a city nation whose wealth and modernity have been attained in an impressive four decades (it is predicted to be the wealthiest nation in the world by 2050).", "After 400 coffee chats and eight months of endless hours of space-finding, fund-raising and community-building, Asia&apos;s first HUB was founded in May 2012, in Singapore.", "I picked Singapore because of its hunger to be innovative and more so, to be a hub for social innovation.", "Also, if done well in Singapore, the region will follow.", "More personally, I wanted to address the pain point I felt in Singapore six years before.", "The doors of The HUB Singapore have been opened for five months to a throng of what we call &apos;purpose-driven individuals&apos;.", "The 5,400 sq ft space in the middle of Orchard, Singapore&apos;s main lifestyle and entertainment street, has quickly become the home for the outliers.", "The HUB Singapore seeks to be that micro-ecosystem where individuals can pursue their passions and be celebrated for it.", "Grace Sai is the co-founder of The Hub Singapore, a community and space for purpose-driven individuals, and the founder of Books for Hope, a social enterprise in the field of childrens&apos; education."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-23T14:47:00Z", "title": "Creating space for social enterprise in Singapore", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Asia Pacific", "Ethical business", "Social enterprises", "Singapore", "Society", "Business"], "article": "&quot;What do you want to be when you grow up&quot;? That is probably the most common question I was asked in my childhood from any family member, friends of family and adults in general. I enjoyed answering that question. The possibilities were endless. But I also wondered why adults liked asking that question. Did they like keeping up with our fleeting, crazy answers, or did they need to reminisce on &apos;what could have been&apos; for themselves? As I went through the next 19 years of conscious adult life, I understood that it was the latter. Something (call it the education system, parents or the economy) during our &apos;educated years&apos; has &apos;uneducated&apos; us from our sense of selves. It promoted conformity instead \u2013 often towards prescribed paths to making a living, not designing a life. While a certain level of conformity is needed for national progress, the danger of blind and excessive conformity is one of unfulfilled lives. Six years ago, as a rebellious young adult, I left Singapore because of this. Singapore is a city nation whose wealth and modernity have been attained in an impressive four decades (it is predicted to be the wealthiest nation in the world by 2050). Some would argue that it funded its speedy national progress through a general loss of individualism. I would argue that it is an innovative nation trying to find a balance of both. Ever since then, I have been obsessed with cracking the conundrum of what it takes to enable individual honesty in its highest form \u2013 to oneself; and the ecosystem factors needed to enable that to flourish in not only a permissible way, but a celebrated way. While the self part mostly revolves around self-introspection, the ecosystem part is much more complicated. Self-emergence, I found is highly dependable on the outer surrounding: family, school, neighbourhood, city and country. During my MBA year as a Skoll Scholar at the Said Business School in Oxford, I had the opportunity to mainstream the field of social entrepreneurship. Working closely with Pamela Hartigan at the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, I realised that an environment that allows people to come alive includes a concentration of intellectual content, stimulating conversations, role models, permission to experiment, tolerance for different personalities and ideologies, and a community of like-minded people. This was further heightened when I came across The HUB in San Francisco. It was then a 10,000 sq ft space in the old San Francisco Chronicle building. In that space were about a hundred entrepreneurs and non-profit leaders, impact investors and ecosystem builders, co-working on their own ideas, building ventures that have positive impact on the world. Some were chatting animatedly, others were attending start-up workshops. At one corner, an investor was being pitched to, and at another, a team was having a conference call with Ghana. Collectively, it was a kind of energy that could make anyone believe that anything is possible, and that it is fine to live by your passion and do some good for the world, even at a young age. I soon found out that The HUB is a global network of community, co-work space and events platform for individuals and teams who are using entrepreneurial approaches for sustainable impact. It existed in 30 cities, but there was none in Asia. Shocking. After 400 coffee chats and eight months of endless hours of space-finding, fund-raising and community-building, Asia&apos;s first HUB was founded in May 2012, in Singapore. I picked Singapore because of its hunger to be innovative and more so, to be a hub for social innovation. Also, if done well in Singapore, the region will follow. More personally, I wanted to address the pain point I felt in Singapore six years before. The doors of The HUB Singapore have been opened for five months to a throng of what we call &apos;purpose-driven individuals&apos;. They range from technicians to social entrepreneurs, film makers to bankers, Googlers to Linked-Iners. It is not a space for any one discipline, but for any discipline. The &apos;intention&apos; becomes the main filtering question to be a Hubber \u2013 not status, educational qualifications, wealth or profession. The 5,400 sq ft space in the middle of Orchard, Singapore&apos;s main lifestyle and entertainment street, has quickly become the home for the outliers. At 200-membered strong, companies, foundations and government agencies are starting to come to The HUB for entrepreneurial ideas, to meet with &apos;Hubbers&apos; and to have a casual chat over Chris&apos; coffee. The best part is that we are working with the government (National Youth Council) and this is how potential large scale change can happen. The vision is for the community to grow to 1,000 members in two years. That is 0.0002% of the five million strong population. A drop in the ocean, perhaps, but most movements, ecosystems and innovations start with a small group of individuals. The HUB Singapore seeks to be that micro-ecosystem where individuals can pursue their passions and be celebrated for it. On a national level, it is that incubator of new thinking models, unconventional career paths, novel solutions and big ideas, a safe place for both failures and successes. It is where new options are experimented daily because the common curse of conformity is the assumption that choices are finite to the availability of existing choices, when the advancement of progress and humanity relies on choices that have not yet been imagined. Grace Sai is the co-founder of The Hub Singapore, a community and space for purpose-driven individuals, and the founder of Books for Hope, a social enterprise in the field of childrens&apos; education.

Invesco Perpetual, which controls 13.3% of BAE shares, was joined in its call by two other institutional investors, understood to be Artemis and Henderson. The trio argue &quot;significant change&quot; is needed in the boardroom after the collapse of BAE&apos;s attempt to merge with aerospace giant EADS. BAE said it intends to stick with its plan for Olver, chairman since 2004, to depart in 2014 and claimed most shareholders are supportive. &quot;The company is aware that a minority of its institutional investors have recently made public their own views on board succession planning, which differ widely from those of the board and the majority of the company&apos;s principal shareholders,&quot; it said. The row came as a senior executive at Airbus, owned by EADS, said BAE and the Franco-German group have missed the &quot;last opportunity&quot; for consolidation in the European defence and aerospace sector. G\u00fcnter Butschek, chief operating officer at Airbus, said the maker of the A380 and A320 planes would now focus elsewhere, indicating that the failed \u20ac34.5bn (\u00a328bn) merger between the UK&apos;s largest defence contractor and the European industrial conglomerate would not be revived. &quot;We have missed an opportunity, possibly the last opportunity to consolidate on a European level. It is a critically important industry for Europe \u2026 The world will still spin and we are re-focusing on new opportunities,&quot; said Butschek. The A350 will carry up to 350 passengers and is a European manufacturing project, with wings made in the UK, a fuselage built in Hamburg, Germany, and final assembly at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France. The merger would have lessened BAE&apos;s reliance on UK defence and EAD&apos;s on civil aerospace, giving the Airbus maker access to the US defence market and reintegrating BAE with Airbus \u2013 the arms firm sold a 20% stake in the superjumbo maker in 2006. Speaking in Toulouse at the inauguration of the final assembly line for the long-distance A350 plane, Butschek said Airbus &quot;doesn&apos;t have any need to change our industrial footprint&quot;, referring to the company&apos;s pan-European manufacturing strategy. Because Airbus has no advanced plans for an entirely new plane, Butschek said, there is no need for a decision on the location of future Airbus work. &quot;As long as the decisions are not made [about next generation programmes] there is no need to decide on the allocation of the work package,&quot; said Butschek. However, the A350 carries an additional boost to UK manufacturing: it uses Trent XWB engines made by Derby-based Rolls-Royce. The UK accounts for around 15% of all Airbus manufacturing \u2013 and the company has a workforce of 10,000 in Britain, largely at its wing manufacturing plant in Broughton, north Wales, and at its design and testing facility in Filton near Bristol. The company&apos;s wide production footprint is a legacy of its complex origins as a combination of aerospace manufacturers. EADS, the Airbus parent, is controlled by the French and German governments, who control 22.35% each of the business through direct and indirect shareholdings. Concerns over their influence in a combined BAE/EADS helped scupper the deal, with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, considered the most implacable obstacle. The Airbus chief executive, Fabrice Br\u00e9gier, indicated that the company will focus on emerging markets such as China and increasing its presence in the largest aerospace market, the US, where it recently announced plans for a factory in Alabama. &quot;I am disappointed that EADS-BAE couldn&apos;t happen. It would have created a fantastic leader in both commercial aerospace and defence and this would have contributed to a more balanced group,&quot; said Br\u00e9gier. &quot;However, Airbus didn&apos;t expect any industrial synergies so what counts is our market, is our international development, in China, in the United States. So it has no impact on the business and the people of Airbus.&quot; The A350 order book \u2013 with more than 550 orders so far \u2013 indicates the growth trajectory of the international airline market, with Qatar Airways the biggest customer, alongside orders from Air China, Singapore Airlines, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, and Vietnam Airlines. By comparison, the Airbus A380 superjumbo has had 253 orders so far. According to Airbus, the Asia-Pacific region will account for 35% of new aircraft deliveries over the next 20 years, with China overtaking the US as the world&apos;s largest domestic airline market from 2031. The first A350, a test aircraft, will take to the air in mid-2013 with the first delivery to Qatar taking place in the second half of 2014. The A350&apos;s carbon fibre fuselage helps make it 25% more fuel-efficient than its counterparts that are in operation currently. The entire A350 programme will cost around \u20ac11bn. Airbus hopes to complete 10 A350s a month by 2018. The Toulouse facility, the size of nearly 300 tennis courts, has been named after Roger B\u00e9teille, the Airbus technical director who oversaw the first Airbus aircraft, the A300. The A350 comes in three versions: the 270-seater A350-800; the 314 seat A350-900 and the 350 seat A350-1000."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/26/sebastian-vettel-f1-delhi-grand-prix", "sentences": ["Sebastian Vettel dominated both practice sessions at the Buddh International Circuit on Friday as Red Bull maintained the momentum of their recent form in Singapore, Japan and South Korea."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-26T11:02:28Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel dominates F1 practice ahead of Indian Grand Prix", "tags": ["Sebastian Vettel", "Red Bull", "Formula One 2012", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Sebastian Vettel dominated both practice sessions at the Buddh International Circuit on Friday as Red Bull maintained the momentum of their recent form in Singapore, Japan and South Korea. In the afternoon, the Formula One world champion shaved more than half a second off his morning time to finish ahead of his team-mate Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso, Nico Rosberg, Kimi Raikkonen and the British pair of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. Hamilton&apos;s inconsistent times in the second phase suggested he was experimenting with high fuel loads and at one point his McLaren team told him that he was &quot;the fast guy on high fuel&quot;. There was some consolation for Alonso, who has seen his championship lead whittled down and finally obliterated by Vettel. He finished third behind the Red Bull pair and at one stage was the fastest car on hard tyres. It was a less happy outing for his Ferrari team-mate Felipe Massa, who had a spin, as did the accident-prone Romain Grosjean. Massa complained about the &quot;very strange balance&quot; of his car and damaged his tyres. Webber made a belated appearance on the track and when he did, he immediately went top. But it was not long before the remorseless Vettel chased him down. Paul di Resta was 11th, finishing ahead of Sergio P\u00e9rez and Michael Schumacher. In the first practice in the morning, Vettel finished on top, ahead of Button, Alonso and Hamilton, followed by Webber and Rosberg.

When he became the youngest grand prix winner in 2008, and the youngest world champion in 2010, it seemed as though he still had unfinished business with his pubescence. Even now, at 25, he would struggle to buy anything stronger than a ginger beer without being asked to produce ID \u2013 when he was told he couldn&apos;t drink podium champagne in Turkey last year, because the new alcohol limit was 24 and he was only 23, it seemed strangely appropriate. But his youthfulness makes his precocity all the more astonishing. Vettel could\u00a0win his fourth race in a row in Delhi and if he does he will look certain to become only the third driver to land a hat-trick of titles, following Juan Manuel\u00a0Fangio and Michael Schumacher. That may not be enough for Sir Jackie Stewart, who said recently: &quot;To really show you&apos;re one of the greatest, you have to deliver when you haven&apos;t got the best machinery. I have\u00a0the highest respect for Sebastian, but\u00a0he could not have achieved what he has without the [Red Bull design\u00a0chief] Adrian Newey factor. If you&apos;ve got a superior car, it&apos;s relatively easy to win the championship.&quot; There are others who feel that Vettel has achieved what he has on the back of Newey&apos;s genius \u2013 but that is only partly true. The seriously fast Mark Webber drives the same car, and he languishes 63 points behind his team-mate. Besides, Red Bull have not had the best car all season. Vettel&apos;s outstanding ability is enough to convince most judges. And most particularly it is enough for Bernie Ecclestone, the sport&apos;s 81-year-old chief executive, who believes that the German will go on to become the greatest driver of all. Ecclestone, taking time out from responding to reports that he is about to be sued by one of Germany&apos;s leading banks for \u00a3250m and may even be in danger of losing his grip on the sport, told the Guardian: &quot;I see no reason why Seb can&apos;t go on to achieve what Michael Schumacher has achieved in this sport, which is unsurpassed. And Seb is up against much tougher opposition than Michael was. He&apos;s very honest. He&apos;s very dedicated. And he&apos;s very talented. He has made sure that he&apos;s exploited his capabilities to the maximum. &quot;We&apos;ve always got on well. And I think it helped us get on when he came into the sport and I identified him, straight away, as someone who would be world champion. We get on, we chat together, joke together and play backgammon together. I have always looked for people I can beat at backgammon.&quot; Ecclestone and Vettel are the odd couple of Formula One, friends despite an age gap of almost 57 years. On Thursday evening Vettel and his girlfriend, Hanna, dined with Ecclestone and Red Bull&apos;s team principal, Christian Horner. Horner said yesterday: &quot;They share the same cheeky sense of humour. Sebastian has a tremendous grasp of British humour and he likes trying out his cockney slang on Bernie. &quot;It is unusual that two people with this age gap become good friends but Sebastian has a very mature head on his shoulders for a 25-year-old and Bernie&apos;s got a tremendous active mind that belies his years. &quot;Seb rarely wins the backgammon and if there is money involved definitely not. Sebastian has a great interest in the sport as well, and Bernie has seen so much, been involved with so much, I think Seb enjoys talking with him about the old days.&quot; Ecclestone has rarely been as close as this to one of his drivers, though he was friendly with another German-born world champion, the Austrian Jochen Rindt, who became the only driver to win the Formula One title posthumously, in 1970. But Ecclestone is not the only one who believes Vettel will become one of the all-time greats. He has already won more poles (34) than any other driver apart from Schumacher and Ayrton Senna and triumph this year would see him join the five men who have won the championship three times \u2013 Senna, Nelson Piquet, Niki Lauda, Jack Brabham and Stewart. It is the serenity and swiftness of his progress which have impressed. Last year he eschewed the mistakes he made in his maiden championship season of 2010 to dominate the campaign. &quot;I don&apos;t make the same mistakes twice,&quot; he said here on Thursday, which must have sounded rather chilling to his pursuers. Schumacher, who has won the title a record seven times, said this week: &quot;In the long term, I think Sebastian will go on to become Germany&apos;s Mr Formula One.&quot; Vettel, who was fastest in practice, goes into the Indian Grand Prix with a six-point lead over Fernando Alonso, with four races to go. But the force is now with Red Bull. They have made a number of upgrades in recent races \u2013 most importantly the new front wing that arrived in Singapore \u2013 and more are expected here. And that is why Vettel is about to upgrade himself from a double to a treble champion next month."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/oct/26/world-bank-business-rankings-poverty-corruption", "sentences": ["The World Bank has produced its 2013 list of the best places in the world to start and run a business, ranking the UK in 7th place, below the US in 3rd and Singapore, which retained the number one spot."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-26T16:06:00Z", "title": "World Bank business rankings obscure poverty and corruption, critics argue", "tags": ["World Bank", "Business", "World news", "Economics", "Global economy", "Georgia", "Europe", "Zambia", "Global development"], "article": "The World Bank has produced its 2013 list of the best places in the world to start and run a business, ranking the UK in 7th place, below the US in 3rd and Singapore, which retained the number one spot. Germany could only manage 20th place and France secured a lowly berth at number 34 out of 183 countries ranked this week. There is a reasonable expectation that western countries will appear in the top 50 of a list that values a country that can offer speedy property registration and access to electricity. The rankings also reward countries that can boast a legal system which enforces contracts fairly and protects creditors when a company goes bust. Putting in place these basic building blocks should be meat and drink to developed nations, though persuading the local electricity supplier to plug new customers into the grid often seems difficult in all parts of the world. Yet there are many countries in or near the top 50 of the World Bank&apos;s rankings that have proved hugely controversial. Georgia, the former Soviet satellite state, has jumped into 9th place from 112th in 2005 after a decade-long struggle with corruption that the World Bank and anti-corruption agency Transparency International claim is succeeding, but which many experts say still leaves many corrupt practices in place. More broadly, critics argue the World Bank rankings promote a neo-liberal agenda of privatisations, welfare cuts, limited employment rights and low wages to please and entice foreign multinationals. The anti-poverty charity Care International says incomes and living standards remain low across most of the south Caucasus despite consistently high GDP growth. In a recent report on Georgia and Armenia, which has climbed the rankings above France to the number 32 spot, the charity said poverty is &quot;pervasive&quot;. Peter Bakvis of the International Trade Union Confederation, says Georgia was rewarded for embarking on &quot;massive deregulation and the elimination of worker health and safety rules&quot;. Georgia&apos;s GDP grew by 7.1% last year and is projected to grow by 4.5% this year, yet the official unemployment rate remains at 15%. Likewise Kazakhstan, which ranks at 49, has 47% of its population subsisting on low incomes according to a United Nations report and is high on most experts&apos; list of corrupt countries. African trade unions make the same complaint. Some have seen their countries grow by 5% or more each year for a decade and leap up the Doing Business rankings while millions of their citizens suffer extreme poverty and workers cannot find a job that pays a decent wage. At a debate organised by the Bretton Woods project and supported by aid charity Cafod during the World Bank&apos;s annual meeting in Tokyo earlier this month, Augusto L\u00f3pez-Claros, director of global indicators and analysis at the Washington-based agency, was clear his mission is to fight poverty. He maintained that the business rankings showed which nations were stable economies and the ones tht provide a sound platform for wealth creation. Geoffrey Chongo of the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection in Zambia is a long term critic of the rankings. He says most people in Zambia, which is one of the world&apos;s largest copper producers, have remained in poverty despite soaring national income growth and annual rises up the rankings. He argues the central African nation has proved unwilling or unable to generate taxes from mining companies, leaving ministers no option but to tax workers more heavily. Starved of domestic capital, the government was forced recently to borrow $750m (\u00a3465m) from the international markets in the form of a bond to generate much needed funds for investment. L\u00f3pez-Claros argued issuing a bond was a great achievement and revealed a high level of confidence in Zambia. But Chongo said Zambia&apos;s attraction was the 16% effective tax rate on corporations, while workers paid 25% on their incomes. Zambia earned a paltry $50m from mining royalty revenues in 2009 despite the industry generating \u00a35bn in sales. Corporation tax from other areas and PAYE brought the total to $500m, according to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. But at 10%, the tax rate was considered a failure by all but the Banda government, which scrapped a windfall tax that had previously gone some way to making up the tax gap. Similarly, Zambia was ranked 8th in the &quot;getting access to credit indicator&quot; in 2011, &quot;yet small businesses still cite access to credit as their biggest challenge with more than 90% of SMEs saying they lack access to credit with interest rates above 25%,&quot; says Chongo. He believes the Zambian government has been obsessed with getting a top 50 ranking and was prepared to starve SME development in favour of multinationals to get it. He can expect more of the same after a 10 place drop in the 2013 list to 94th as other nations worked harder to meet the criteria. Bin Han, one of China&apos;s senior representatives at the World Bank, says the rankings are fundamentally flawed. &quot;The Chinese conclusion is straightforward: the report has used a wrong methodology, failed to reflect facts in individual countries, and misled readers. The questionable quality of the report has ruined the Bank&apos;s reputation,&quot; he said at the debate. The new boss at the World Bank, Jim Yong\u00a0Kim, has pledged to review the rankings. Maybe he needs to scrap them in favour of individual country reports. It seems not only invidious but also farcical to say that Rwanda boasts a better infrastructure for business than Italy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/26/rbs-suspends-trader-libor", "sentences": ["RBS fired four traders last year \u2013 including Tan Chi Min, a senior trader in Singapore who is now suing the bank for wrongful dismissal \u2013 and earlier this month suspended Jezri Mohideen as head of rates trading for Europe and Asia Pacific.", "It has now been reported that Ken Choy, a Singapore-based foreign exchange trader, has also been suspended as the local authorities step up an investigation into the local interest rate benchmarks."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-26T17:50:24Z", "title": "RBS suspends another trader over Libor", "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Banking", "Business", "Libor", "Lloyds Banking Group", "UK news"], "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended another trader as part of its ongoing investigation into the potential manipulation of Libor.

Nicholas Mockford, 60, was shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife, Mary, nearly two weeks ago but details of the killing have only just emerged. Mockford&apos;s employer, ExxonMobil, on Friday said his death was not linked to his work. Belgian detectives have appealed for witnesses to the shooting. Police said two attackers wearing crash helmets tried to grab Mary Mockford&apos;s handbag, and then slapped her in the face during the attack. They said four shots were then fired at Mockford. One witness told Belgian television he twice tried to resuscitate the victim before an ambulance arrived. &quot;I heard a noise, &apos;tack tack&apos;, I thought that was bizarre and went outside to look,&quot; he told Flemish television channel, VTM. &quot;There was a woman lying on the floor on the pavement on the other side of the road. She was crying &apos;help, help&apos;. There was also a man lying on the street, next to a car. [The] woman shouts out it was a white van.&quot; Initially witnesses believed Mockford had been run over by the van outside the restaurant in northern Brussels. &quot;Suddenly he stopped breathing,&quot; said the witness, who lived next door to the restaurant Da Marcello where the attack took place. &quot;I resuscitated him, he regained consciousness and then he became unconscious again. I resuscitated him a second time and then the ambulance arrived. Only then did neighbours realise the man had been shot.&quot; He said Mockford had what appeared to be bullet wounds to his chest and shoulder and he also saw blood on his head. Police found four bullet cases outside the restaurant. Detectives initially worked on the theory that the killing on 14 October might have been an attempted carjacking, because witnesses saw the couple walking across the street to their 4x4 vehicle before the attack. One Belgian officer was reported as saying the attack was a &quot;very strange case&quot; which had been passed to federal investigators. Exxon Mobil refused to answer questions about the case. It released a statement which said the killing had nothing to do with his work. &quot;We were shocked by the tragic death of Nick Mockford, one of our employees a fortnight ago in Brussels. Mr Mockford was a department manager at our office close to Brussels, but we have no indication the incident was work-related. &quot;Our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues and we are supporting them as best we can at this very difficult time,&quot; the company said. The victim was reported to have been born in Leicestershire but had been living for a number of years in Belgium and Singapore. He is believed to have worked for ExxonMobil since the 1970s and was head of marketing for interim technologies for ExxonMobil Chemicals, Europe, promoting new types of greener fuel. He and his wife, who is Belgian, had been married for 15 years. His three adult children from his first marriage live in Britain, according to reports. The Foreign Office is providing consular assistance to his family. The investigating judge imposed an order on police preventing them from releasing any detail on the case, which police said was not unusual in a serious murder case. As a result, initial news reports were sparse. But on Thursday, authorities switched course and decided to enlist the public&apos;s help, releasing a brief description of the crime."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/26/apple-investment-manager-braeburn-capital", "sentences": ["Apple declined to comment on Braeburn&apos;s activities, but in the year its investment arm was established, an Apple spokesman explained that it would function as a regional treasury office, on a par with existing offices at its Cupertino headquarters, in Singapore and in Cork, Ireland."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-26T20:07:00Z", "title": "Apple's investment manager wrestles with $120bn problem", "tags": ["Hedge funds", "Investing", "Apple", "Computing", "Technology"], "article": "It is one of the world&apos;s largest hedge funds, with $121bn under management, but its name is virtually unknown in financial circles. Braeburn Capital is not operated from the top floor of a Manhattan skyscraper or a plush Mayfair townhouse. It is located in a quiet suburb of Nevada&apos;s capital, Reno, and it belongs to Apple. In a nondescript building opposite an abandoned restaurant, a small number of advisers have been charged with investing the cash pile Apple has amassed thanks to the seemingly insatiable global appetite for its consumer electronics. That pile has grown from $9bn when Braeburn was established in 2006 to more than $120bn (\u00a375bn), according to Apple&apos;s financial results on Thursday. That is a shade less than the $130bn Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in America and probably the world, has under management. Much of Apple&apos;s money is trapped overseas, sheltered from the US taxman, who would demand a 35% cut were the money to be repatriated. But it can be invested at home. Apple&apos;s financial reports show it holds $21bn of US government debt \u2013 a vast sum for a single private investor. Foreign governments like investing in US securities, but Apple owns more than the $19bn held by Malaysia, and just $4bn less than Spain. Apple&apos;s largest investment category is corporate securities. It has $44.5bn in company shares, more than the entire $39bn managed by Man Group, the UK&apos;s largest hedge fund. It is also a big holder of other nations&apos; debt, with $7bn invested in sovereign securities abroad. Little is known about which companies Apple invests in. It occasionally owns stakes large enough to be declared: Apple was a founding investor in British chip designer ARM, but has sold out, and owns 9% of Hertfordshire-based Imagination Technologies, which designs video and audio chips. Braeburn does not file a record with the American stock market regulator, or the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure register; it is not an independent adviser but a division of a private company. It is free to hold any assets \u2013 for all anyone knows they could be short positions on the shares of its major rivals such as Samsung and Google, or the sub-prime mortgages of American homeowners, lumped together and traded on the financial markets. Indeed, it declares ownership of nearly $9bn of mortgage and asset-backed securities, according to filings. The decision to locate Braeburn in Nevada rather than Apple&apos;s home state of California makes sense because Nevada does not collect corporation tax or capital gains tax. California, by contrast, has a corporate tax rate of 8.84%, a rate of contribution to the public coffers that has not been enough to prevent a school funding crisis in a state that houses some of the world&apos;s most valuable companies. Managing its money from Nevada also allows Apple to lower its tax bills in other states. Florida, New Jersey and New Mexico discount taxes when a company&apos;s financial management is in another jurisdiction. In 2006, Apple listed only cash and short term investments in its filings, but Braeburn&apos;s managers are expected to take the long view. Apple now holds nearly $90bn of its money in &quot;long-term marketable securities&quot;. According to analysis by the New York Times, since founding Braeburn, Apple has earned more than $2.5bn in interest and dividend income on its cash reserves and investments around the globe. Apple declined to comment on Braeburn&apos;s activities, but in the year its investment arm was established, an Apple spokesman explained that it would function as a regional treasury office, on a par with existing offices at its Cupertino headquarters, in Singapore and in Cork, Ireland. The Nevada Annual Report, a register of companies located in the state, lists three Braeburn officers: Apple attorney Gene Levoff, Michael Shapiro and Gary Wipfler, who as Apple&apos;s treasurer is the person officially responsible for the management of the technology titan&apos;s billions. Various Braeburn employees have filled in pared down profiles on LinkedIn, the corporate networking site, including Steve Johnson, who claims to be chief investment officer, and Rhys Gray, a chartered financial accountant previously employed by investment management firm Payden &amp; Rygel. Ted Mulvaney describes himself as a portfolio manager at Braeburn, and is also linked to Magrathea Financial Services, a Reno based investment firm named after a Hitch-Hiker&apos;s guide to the Galaxy planet, known as one of the wealthiest in the universe due to its extraordinary trade \u2013 building customised planets to order.

He was a poor boy from Walworth, and worked for 10 long years from the age of 14 in the Company&apos;s headquarters in London, copying letters, reports and dispatches \u2013 a human word-processor. He jumped at the chance to go out to Penang. The next opportunity was to involve himself in the invasion of Java, to take its capital, Batavia, from the Dutch. At the age of 30, he became lieutenant-governor of Java. His reformist measures met with disapproval, and he was recalled \u2013 bringing back to London his vast collection of ethnological objects. He was knighted by the Prince Regent. He was clever, charming and opportunistic. Some colleagues admired and liked him, some did not. In private life he was loyal and affectionate. When his father went to the bad, he supported his mother and four sisters. He married twice, not for advancement but for love. He adored his children, four of whom died in quick succession in Sumatra. He was an idealistic entrepreneur, a romantic imperialist, passionately anti-slavery, and more concerned with transforming the lives of the peasants than making immediate profits for the company. He made no fortune for himself.

It is Red Bull&apos;s winning of the constructors&apos; championship that is their finest accomplishment. Granted, they are not quite there yet, but with a lead of 77 points and four races to go, and with the best motor in the business, it is hardly the bravest piece of crystal ball gazing to predict they will walk off with the title with something of a swagger. It will be their finest hour because some of this season&apos;s rule changes, specifically those relating to the exhaust and the flexi wing, were deliberately made to emasculate the bulls from Milton Keynes who had stampeded all over the previous two campaigns. Now Vettel, too, stands on the brink of his greatest championship. For if he nipped in to pickpocket the 2010 title, and bestrode last year like some motorised Gulliver in Lilliput, this year has posed altogether different challenges. The young German driver is the supreme favourite to win a hat-trick of titles, to become only the third Formula One driver to do so after Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. Still, with a lead over Ferrarri&apos;s Fernando Alonso of only six points there is much to be done. That pressure did not exist two years ago. Then, Vettel went into the final race of the season 15 points behind the Spaniard, who has rarely smiled since, and was seven points behind his team-mate Webber. He won in Abu Dhabi to lead the championship for the first time that year and become the youngest of all champions at the age of 23. There was no such drama in his success last year. With 11 wins, 15 poles and 17 podiums from 19 races, it was an imperious procession to victory. This season he has had to cope with the pressure of expectation, though there is a serenity about him these days which suggests he will carry it off with aplomb. The title could be sewn up in Abu Dhabi next week, although the celebrations are more likely to take place in the penultimate round in Austin, Texas next month. Yet Vettel did not seem acutely aware of any pressure when he put his championships into perspective. &quot;I don&apos;t like to think that 2010 was more satisfying than in 2011 because the championship was closer,&quot; he said. &quot;Last year stands out in many ways while 2010 was special because it was my first championship. If it happens again this year, it will stand out for other reasons because it would be very nice to do it three times in a row.&quot; He added: &quot;The championship is now closing in, and when you are in a situation like I am, then the last races become very interesting. The pressure and mind-set is different from the first few races.&quot; The only surprise in his qualifying performance on Saturday was that he did not dominate as expected, after he had topped the timings in all three practice sessions. Vettel was only slightly faster than Webber, just as he had only narrowly beaten Jenson Button in Q2. &quot;It was a tight session, especially having made a mistake on my first run on Turn Four,&quot; he said. Vettel and Red Bull have timed their run this year like a 1500 metres runner taking the bell. Without taking anything away from the German, the constant upgrades \u2013 and there have been more here \u2013 has restored Red Bull&apos;s old authority. While it has taken them a dozen or so races to get there, they are top bulls once more. The key improvement was probably the new front wing unveiled in Singapore, although the new double DRS system has also been significant. Two Red Bulls, two McLarens and two Ferraris will lead Sunday&apos;s parade. Lewis Hamilton, out-performed by Button for much of the session, pipped his team-mate in the end. He remains confident of a strong race performance despite being beaten by Vettel and Webber. &quot;We&apos;re not quick enough to finish in front of these guys [in qualifying] but our race pace is good and the team has done a great job. I just want to get some good points,&quot; Hamilton said. It was a disappointing qualifying session for Force India in their home fixture. Both drivers failed to make the top 10 shootout, with Nico H\u00fclkenberg finishing 12th and Paul Di Resta 16th."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/28/tech-city-still-falls-short", "sentences": ["Singapore and Hong Kong are vibrant markets in Asia."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-27T23:06:59Z", "title": "Where Tech City still falls short", "tags": ["Technology startups", "Digital Britain", "Technology sector", "Technology", "Internet", "Business"], "article": "Wendy Devolder  Founder and chief executive of Skills\u00a0Matter &quot;Provide tech companies with funding or tax breaks to fund training&quot; &quot;The biggest issue our community faces is the difficulty recruiting highly skilled developers. Tech companies&apos; success often depends on the skills of their development team. This is why both tech startups and large technology-dependent enterprises are desperate to find experienced, highly skilled software professionals. Every day, we are asked by tech startups how and where they can find good people. Our jobs board at Skills Matter is absolutely packed with vacancies advertising &apos;cool&apos; projects and teams, begging people to join them. &quot;The government can help in a number of ways. Provide tech companies with funding or tax breaks to fund training in advanced technology. And relax immigration rules for the highly skilled. In the meantime, we should provide the next generation with actual programming skills (as opposed to MS Office skills) very early on \u2013 by supporting initiatives such as Computing at School and Apps for Good, so that in 10 years&apos; time, we&apos;ll be in a better position.&quot; Joe Cohen Founder and chief executive of\u00a0Seatwave &quot;Make all of London Tech City&quot; &quot;The government focuses on publicising Old Street and the Olympic Park \u2013 but so far the winners are all over\u00a0London. Betfair are in Hammersmith, Spotify are in Soho, Wonga are located in Camden and Skype in Fitzrovia. Whether it&apos;s promoting London or east London [as a tech hub], from a PR point of view, wouldn&apos;t make that much difference. If you look at what&apos;s going on around Old Street, while there are certainly some success stories, you have companies at an earlier stage with a higher probability of failure. &quot;Why wouldn&apos;t you just claim the winners, wherever they are in London? History may prove me wrong when Crossrail is finished and maybe the Olympic Park [will] become a really popular place. But until that happens, I can&apos;t imagine you&apos;ll have many people who&apos;ll move into that space of their own free will, without the government twisting their arms. &quot;Broadband provisioning is also a major issue. It&apos;s amazing to me, because you would just think that market forces would solve this \u2013 but it doesn&apos;t seem to be happening.

And that&apos;s if you&apos;re lucky.&quot; Neil Rimer Partner, Index Ventures &quot;Lionise entrepreneurs&quot; &quot;I&apos;m very impressed with the way the government has positioned London as a hub for entrepreneurship. I think lionising entrepreneurs is a good thing \u2013 having educators and officials who recognise the value and importance of entrepreneurs in society. There are parts of the world where entrepreneurs are looked up to much more than here. I read about an entrepreneur here who said when he tells people he&apos;s an entrepreneur, they\u00a0feel sorry for him, as if he can&apos;t get\u00a0a real job. That shouldn&apos;t be the case. &quot;[Tech] is the next industrial revolution and these people are the pioneers. This is what the country needs. You can&apos;t continue to rely on natural resources, traditional goods and insurance companies for growth and job creation. Schools and universities need to do more to promote entrepreneurship as a lifestyle, a career and an ethic. They need to make sure that all children are given access to great education in maths and science and engineering so we don&apos;t end up with a lopsided employment pool. We invested in a company called Code Academy. Their thesis is that coding is the new English \u2013 if you don&apos;t program you&apos;ll be programmed. The government putting their weight behind that would be great.&quot; Hussein Kanji Angel investor &quot;Make New York the model, not\u00a0 Silicon Valley&quot; &quot;[Attempting to rival Silicon Valley] is boneheaded. The way to think of London is the way you think of financial services markets in offshoot countries. Singapore and Hong Kong are vibrant markets in Asia. However, they are markets that are subservient to the two global markets that really matter in finance \u2013 New York and London. [In tech terms] London has a very good shot at becoming an offshoot market. Really what the government should be focused on is how we work in harmony with Silicon Valley. A lot of that is bridge-building between those two economies and they&apos;ve not done a good job there so far. &quot;The best parallel for success, if you take this thesis, is New York. New York was by and large a nonexistent tech centre, and then a few things happened that made a material difference. One was Google set up an engineering centre. One of the best ways to bridge is exactly what New York did \u2013 get a company that is out on the west coast to open up not a sales office but an engineering centre\u00a0here.\u00a0The\u00a0government needs to spend a lot of\u00a0energy doing this, because without that depth of managerial and engineering talent, you will not get big companies in your\u00a0backyard.&quot;  Stephen Ball General manager of Hitachi Data Systems UK &quot;Develop the next generation of coders&quot; &quot;We all heard the prime minister&apos;s speech, but the reality is I don&apos;t know what Tech City is. I&apos;ve been in this industry for 25 years and as a leader of a big [technology] company in the UK, and while I do accept that our focus isn&apos;t working with internet startups, I would have expected Tech City to have hit my radar on a regular basis. But it&apos;s just not happening. I would have also expected [the government] to come to me to see how I could help incubate some of those skills. &quot;We could help some of these young\u00a0companies with things like mentoring and, possibly, invest in them. But no one&apos;s asked that question of me or any colleagues in other [similar] organisations. Also, I don&apos;t see anything in the school curriculum that is going to help us create the next Google in this country in terms of coding capability. My kids aren&apos;t allowed to take their phones to school [to build apps], and while they do take ICT classes, it&apos;s all based around Windows rather than coding and social media. We&apos;re going to have a 10-year skills deficit here, when it comes to building\u00a0the [tech] superstars of the future, unless we start building coding into the curriculum.&quot; Glenn Shoosmith Founder and chief executive of BookingBug &quot;Do more to boost London tech flotations&quot; &quot;As all of our companies grow and mature, where you look to float for the second stage of growth, including larger-scale later investment, is crucial \u2013 and London is not geared well for that. Traditionally a lot of companies head to\u00a0Silicon Valley for the large, later-stage investment, because that investment is there. Equally, when you want to float you still head to New York. Two things need to be done. The first is happening slowly anyway, which is educating the market itself. Second, the\u00a0rules and regulations around floating are considerably more\u00a0onerous and difficult to go through here. &quot;I&apos;ve seen several companies abandon float plans in London and shift them to the Nasdaq [in New York] because of it. The government is working on that, but more needs to be done. Much more also needs to be done with government procurement. When I spoke at the launch [of Tech City], I talked about trying to build a booking system for sport. It took two years and we&apos;re finally working very closely with Sport England \u2013 and they\u00a0wouldn&apos;t have worked with us until the government said: &apos;You have to work with some startups.&apos; I&apos;ve spoken to a lot of companies who are still quite\u00a0frustrated when it comes to dealing with potential [public-sector] tender processes.&quot; Maria Molland Chief European officer, Fab.com &quot;Change the rules for the enterprise investment scheme&quot; &quot;When I first started talking to Tracy [Doree] and Vivienne [Bearman, co-founders of the design retail site that started life as Llustre], one of the many things I loved was the location of their office. It is located just west of Silicon Roundabout \u2013 an area sprinkled with fashion boutiques, up-and-coming and more established designers, and unique cafes selling vintage clothing and strong espresso to budding tech entrepreneurs. &quot;That inspiring setting is partly because of the government&apos;s effort in encouraging large digital companies such as Google, entrepreneurs and investors to set up shop in Tech City. The government was smart to see that as one of the keys to the success of Silicon Valley, but they should be looking at this as just one initiative among many to make London a global centre of tech. Additional priorities include education programmes that encourage young Brits to pursue careers as entrepreneurs, engineers and designers. Organisations such as the Prince&apos;s Trust are getting this kickstarted, but they could use help. The UK needs a group of angel investors who are eager to invest their time and their millions in helping businesses get off the ground. This could be helped by the government changing the rules for the enterprise investment scheme (EIS).&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/28/sebastian-vettel-f1-indian-grand-prix", "sentences": ["Newey has introduced a succession of important upgrades to the car \u2013 the front wing he brought to Singapore was arguably the most important \u2013 and now we have, essentially, returned to the old order, to where we were last year."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-28T18:09:57Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel wins F1 Indian Grand Prix to extend championship lead", "tags": ["Sebastian Vettel", "Lewis Hamilton", "Red Bull", "Formula One 2012", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton&apos;s recent utterances have occasionally been confused and ambiguous but on Sunday there was a stark simplicity in his message. After Sebastian Vettel had won the Indian Grand Prix, his fourth victory in a row, to extend his lead in the Formula One world championship, Hamilton shook his head slowly and said, simply: &quot;Adrian Newey is a genius.&quot; Even in the opinionated and egocentric world of Formula One Hamilton will struggle to pick a fight on this issue. Newey, Red Bull&apos;s chief technical officer who has won championships with three different teams, remains so far ahead of his rivals that he provokes little jealousy. Only the marginally superior do that. This season rules were brought in specifically to negate his gifts, to clip Red Bull&apos;s wide wings and pull them back among their bewildered rivals. It worked, for a while. At the start of the season the results were a little too random. Some people thought it was wonderful but it was merely a noisier form of bingo or snakes and ladders. Then, in the summer, the sport developed a compelling narrative, with as many as six drivers competing for the championship. But in the past four races Red Bull have been utterly dominant. Newey has introduced a succession of important upgrades to the car \u2013 the front wing he brought to Singapore was arguably the most important \u2013 and now we have, essentially, returned to the old order, to where we were last year. Hamilton and his McLaren team-mate Jenson Button, who were third and fourth on the grid, had the best seats in the house as Vettel and Mark Webber streaked away at the front. Hamilton said afterwards: &quot;I&apos;ve just seen their speed [print-outs] and there&apos;s no way I could compete with that, even if I drove at 200%. I can&apos;t match that. &quot;I can&apos;t even imagine what Adrian and his team are doing. He&apos;s a one-off and he&apos;s structured the car so well. It doesn&apos;t come as a surprise because the Red Bulls have been dominant for the past few years. They seem to have great capacity to improve the car.&quot; Button made the point that since the summer Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari have pulled away from the rest of the field. But, alarmingly, Red Bull have pulled away from the other two. When asked if he considered Red Bull to be unbeatable, he said: &quot;If Ferrari had started on the front row Fernando [Alonso] would have challenged Seb. I think Fernando would have had a chance if he had qualified better.&quot; As it was, Alonso battled brilliantly to get among the Red Bulls and passed his friend Webber with a thrust of speed every bit as impressive as when he swept past the two McLarens on the opening lap. Webber had an issue with Kers but, even if he had not, Alonso would have been difficult to resist. By coming second Alonso fell only another seven points behind Vettel, who now leads the drivers&apos; world championship by 13 points. All the momentum is with the team from Milton Keynes, whose 91-point lead in the constructors&apos; table is decisive. But Red Bull know that a non-finish from Vettel in Abu Dhabi could see Alonso restored to the top of the table. The team principal, Christian Horner, said: &quot;We certainly can&apos;t afford to be complacent because Fernando Alonso keeps turning up and he had a strong race. It was a shame we couldn&apos;t keep Mark ahead of him. It is a personal best for Sebastian to have won four races in succession. It is remarkable seeing as we turned up in Monza with Sebastian having won only one race. &quot;He has hit a purple patch of form at exactly the right time in the championship and for us now it is vital to keep that momentum running. We have got ourselves into a great position in the constructors&apos; championship but the drivers&apos; championship is completely open. With 75 points available from three races, and Seb leading by just 13, it will be crucial that we have perfect weekends.&quot; Alonso looked as if he might have to settle for third place. But when he discovered that Webber was bereft of Kers he pushed once more, even though he had to conserve fuel at the same time. He passed Webber with 10 laps to go and, with sparks flying from the bottom of Vettel&apos;s car in the closing laps, he might even have imagined a greater glory. But that was not to be. When Hamilton was asked who would make the more worthy champion, he said diplomatically: &quot;It&apos;s inappropriate for me to say who is the more deserving.&quot; But then he clearly edged towards Alonso, adding: &quot;I am a fan of Fernando&apos;s \u2013 I was a fan even before I got into Formula One \u2013 and I think this year he has driven so well. More so than anyone else. &quot;Sebastian has stepped up a lot at the end of the year with the improvements on his car. But Fernando is still pushing. Today he just drove phenomenally well and he&apos;s just holding on, still. &quot;For me, in my eyes, he really is a three or four times world champion.&quot; But from here Vettel, left, still only 25, looks capable of surpassing Michael Schumacher&apos;s seven titles."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/29/two-tier-road-taxes-wrong-turn", "sentences": ["Ken Livingstone grasped the nettle with central London&apos;s congestion charge, but brave talk about extending it worldwide has not got far: Stockholm, Milan and pioneering Singapore, which is a tiny island state.", "Smart technology (Singapore&apos;s cars have it) is making such options more do-able."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-29T11:02:09Z", "title": "Two-tier road taxes would be a wrong turn", "tags": ["Transport policy", "Car tax", "Tax", "Motoring", "Money", "Transport", "Politics"], "article": "The Tory press is in a lather over confirmation that Whitehall&apos;s deep thinkers have been contemplating a two-tier reform of vehicle excise duty (VED). It would charge extra to drivers who want to use Britain&apos;s motorway network \u2013 and fine anyone else whose cars are caught on M-roads by what the tabloids call &quot;spy cameras&quot; whenever it suits them. Are the frothing newspapers right? On this occasion I think they are. The problem facing transport officials is the obvious one: a deepening shortage of the green folding material. The tree-grown theory of money, beloved of bankers, voters and politicians for decades, has been fatally undermined. But the answer is surely not this divisive proposal.  Among all the other cash problems, VED \u2013 which generates \u00a36bn a year for the Treasury \u2013 is a wasting asset, increasingly complex and subject to the trend towards low-emission cars that attract less tax (rightly so). But as with other &quot;sin taxes&quot; \u2013 booze and tobacco, for instance \u2013 we are two-faced: we want to consume less, but are vaguely aware the lost taxes would have to be raised elsewhere. That awkward truth underlines the inherent absurdity of today&apos;s report from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), the free-market thinktank founded in 1956 to challenge the Keynsian orthodoxy of the time. Quite right too, orthodoxy should always be challenged, and the IEA was a neglected gadfly for decades. But since the Thatcher/Reagan 80s, free-market nostrums have become the new orthodoxy. I don&apos;t share Andy Beckett&apos;s black-and-white denunciation of Thatcherism in Saturday&apos;s Guardian and urge you not to either. But the IEA&apos;s proposal that our roads should be privatised \u2013 sold off for \u00a3150bn \u2013 should get the raspberry it deserves. Moon it too if you feel strongly. The IEA makes it all sound terrific. Local communities would maintain very local roads, as they do in (large and empty) Sweden; private firms \u2013 uninhibited by state regulation, of course \u2013 would have access to capital to fix those time-wasting bottlenecks and mend those potholes. Competition would help and VED could be abolished, and fuel taxes slashed by up to 75%. Owners (private firms) would decide their own road pricing policies. If it sounds simplistic, it is. The IEA&apos;s executive summary pdf doesn&apos;t mention why road programmes have been slashed in recent years, it just assumes that bigger roads are a social and economic good, whereas anyone who has ever driven on the great highways of Los Angeles as I did last year (are some of them 20 lanes wide now?) knows how self-defeating they can be. It&apos;s not green, it&apos;s not smart and it&apos;s very expensive just to keep building. I didn&apos;t spot the anti-regulation IEA admitting that badly regulated banks that offered credit cards to babies, free homes to their parents and tons of cash to Greek tax dodgers (they&apos;ve just arrested the whistleblower) are the biggest single reason why modest road programmes have stalled lately. It would be nice to think that the Cameroons&apos; &quot;greenest government ever&quot; credentials played a bigger part than they did, but Ian Birrell knocks a large hole in that one elsewhere in today&apos;s Guardian. In any case, the road lobby complains that its taxes are never ringfenced for road improvements, but mostly go to the exchequer. It follows that if the private sector takes over the roads there will be a deficit to be filled by taxes elsewhere. And no, don&apos;t tell me about all the money privatisation will save the taxpayer. I think (and realise you may not) that Britain&apos;s long-neglected rail network \u2013 track, rolling-stock service \u2013 has been generally much improved by private management, but it has cost the taxpayer huge sums. It is not the only public utility to suffer this mixed experience. Personally, I doubt if Whitehall will go much further with the two-tier VED scheme based on motorway use. The road tax has evolved in recent years in directions that embrace the &quot;polluter pays&quot; theory, which is fine by me, though inconsistently applied. I seem to remember being assured that diesel was a cleaner and more fuel-efficient tax, whose merits would be reflected in a lower price. When I fill my car with diesel (which is most of the time but, alas, not when I was in a hurry last month), I notice it now costs more. Yet the road pricing idea that would seem to underpin the two-tier idea must be the way ahead, if properly handled. Ken Livingstone grasped the nettle with central London&apos;s congestion charge, but brave talk about extending it worldwide has not got far: Stockholm, Milan and pioneering Singapore, which is a tiny island state. Boris Johnson abandoned the Livingstone zone&apos;s extension into rich inner suburbs of west London, which \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 would not have been paid by its well-heeled residents. So getting it right, fair but effective, is tricky. It&apos;s a form of co-payment, in which the cost is shared by the taxpayer and the user, like student tuition fees. But you have to watch it because it is open to abuse. On-street parking charges have become a tremendous racket for cash-strapped councils, a major scandal in many parts of the country as the tree-grown theory of money declines. As for speed cameras, when I asked Godfrey Bloom MEP, one of John Prescott&apos;s challengers to become Humberside&apos;s police commissioner, if it was true he opposed such cameras outright, he said no. But Bloom does oppose those located primarily to raised money from unwary motorists. It was hard to disagree with that, so I didn&apos;t. Yet one form of road pricing, reasonably fair and efficient, stares us in the face. Across the channel toll booths that charge per journey start a few miles from Calais and extend south and west, though not far east because German roads are free. The US has extensive road tolling. Canada has a privately owned toll road around Toronto (its rates much higher than in the US, and controversial). Australia has some too. Britain has the M6 relief road north-west of Birmingham. Its tolls on heavy lorries are so high that they stick to the public road, leaving the taxpayer to fund the consequent repairs, and traffic has always been lower than predicted since it opened in 2004. But a nationwide system, uniformly imposed \u2013 not the case in France \u2013 would have the merit of charging the motorway user (we are now doing that to foreign lorry firms, much as they have long done to our transcontinental lorries) without imposing an apartheid tax that will either exclude poorer motorists or impose a regressive extra tax. Smart technology (Singapore&apos;s cars have it) is making such options more do-able. Even in thin and crowded Britain, so much less convenient a shape than hexagonal France, most of us can usually avoid using motorways a lot of the time if we choose not to do so. It&apos;s the trade-off between time and money. We drove the cross-country back roads from London to Cambridge this weekend and it proved a Friday rush-hour nightmare, one that lasted three grim hours. We came back down the M11 and M25. Personally I&apos;d have preferred the train, but Mrs W had good reasons for driving and warned me the Royston route would prove a bad idea. So would two-tier road taxes, which impose a binary choice where most of us prefer multiple choices. There are enough dividing lines in Britain 2012 without adding another."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/oct/29/monash-warwick-alliance-global-education", "sentences": ["To have even a chance to do that we need the best globally aware academics and students, those who feel Beijing, New York or Singapore are as likely to offer an answer \u2013 or the right person to work with \u2013 as the UK or Australia."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-29T14:59:10Z", "title": "Monash-Warwick: what does a global university partnership look like?", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "Partnerships", "Academics", "Research", "Student experience", "Funding", "Higher education", "Research", "Education", "Australia news", "World news"], "article": "Getting to know the intricacies of a new university has its challenges \u2013 doing it for two at the same time, when they are almost exactly antipodian to each other, seems foolhardy.

The role is to lead their cross-border, indeed world-spanning, Monash-Warwick Alliance. It is both an exciting challenge and an enormous opportunity. To paraphrase a memorable and possibly apocryphal George W-ism, &quot;The world is getting more global&quot;, and that is as true for higher education and research as it is for any industry. And yet there has been little or no globalisation in how we organize ourselves; no global entity runs viable universities in multiple countries and no truly transnational offering for students and academics exists. Yes, there are outposts of universities in China, South East Asia and the Middle East. Does this in itself create a truly global university? As we see it, Warwick and Monash are doing much more. We seek to be a globally integrated university alliance; not a loose affiliation of some dozen or more universities, but a tight, yet broad, partnership between two proud universities who will co-develop courses, co-invest in technologies and attract the best researchers who want access to the best facilities \u2013 and the best students too. Both universities are embedded within their home countries but together they now offer a connected experience to students wherever they come from in the world. Those students will be able to do a course made up of components from either institution, experiencing learning from Europe and/or the Asia-Pacific, and become globally aware and culturally adept graduates. We hope also to appeal to researchers of laboratories running simultaneously on either side of the world, to PhD students from both continents, and to support and research funding sources in more than one system. Why and how? The why is simple. Our websites state it clearly: &quot;A key aim of the alliance is to help meet the increasing student, industry and government demand for universities to produce graduates with a global education, and to undertake research that addresses world-relevant and strategically important problems.&quot; We know (and governments understand) that global challenges will not be solved by parochial thinking or small groups using the approaches they have always used. It will require bigger collaborations, transnational partnerships and a degree of inter-disciplinarity that has proved so difficult to foster within single institutions. To have even a chance to do that we need the best globally aware academics and students, those who feel Beijing, New York or Singapore are as likely to offer an answer \u2013 or the right person to work with \u2013 as the UK or Australia. These people know that time-zone and distance barriers merely mean Skype rather than coffee together. Why Warwick and Monash? Both are aggressively ambitious children of the 1960s, the baby boomers of higher education. Both have risen quickly in their home markets and seek a way to keep that rate of growth going and challenge historical elites. That will not happen by incremental growth; it requires disruptive innovative thinking. Industry and philanthropists, government and the populace all expect us to work together. We aim to make the system encourage and support this, rather than block it. We enjoy breaking down barriers. Why not find a way for the two HR systems to work together to find the best employment solution for the 30 planned senior professorial posts? They have already done it for my own post \u2013 and there are more to come. How will the universities provide for governance and academic leadership below the level of the two vice-chancellors and presidents? That is my role, and I wouldn&apos;t have taken it on if I hadn&apos;t seen the commitment of dedicated staff in both universities already taking to Skype, Facetime, instant messaging, Jabber and DropBox as if they were teenagers. Lastly I am asked: how will the alliance get students involved? And how will joint teaching work? These may be the ultimate examples of challenges that turn out to be opportunities. Both student bodies are hungry to create ways to serve their members better and more creatively, and students themselves are already finding solutions such as launching the joint undergraduate research journal, Reinvention. Markers of success are already coming in. Funders are backing the idea with hard cash: \u00a3500,000 from the UK&apos;s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under its Building Global Engagements programme to build connections in the physical sciences; \u00a366,000 from the Australian government to support student mobility; and \u00a3200,000 from the Australian Research Council grant to build collaborations in engineering. And that&apos;s before any of our joint appointments have even started their jobs. There will be an awful lot more \u2013 people, money, news \u2013 in the coming months.

Back then, the heads, who &quot;met&quot; on Twitter and decided to form a pressure group, had held their inaugural meeting at the Guardian&apos;s offices, but had yet to give themselves a name. Though many of its members were already highly active on Twitter, the group itself had not yet been established on the social network. Within a day, it had both a moniker \u2013 Headteachers&apos; Roundtable \u2013 and a Twitter account: @HeadsRoundtable. And the response, says member John Tomsett, head of Huntington school in York, has been &quot;phenomenal&quot;. Within four hours of the Twitter account being set up last Tuesday evening, it had 1,000 followers. By Friday, the number had risen to 2,500, a figure that even prolific education tweeters can take years to build. Although the group \u2013 which has set up a &quot;six-point plan&quot; of proposals centring on accountability, assessment and curriculum \u2013 is being cagey about its possible level of influence on policymakers, the indications are that it has piqued the interest of politicians on both sides of the main party divide. Within hours of our report appearing, Tomsett had been invited to a discussion event next week at which Liz Truss (pictured), the schools and early years minister, will be present. And Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, is to attend a meeting of the roundtable group next month. &quot;We are very encouraged, and hope members of all political parties will meet us,&quot; says Tomsett. Harder tests, fewer teachers Plans for seemingly tougher new maths, English and reasoning tests for trainee teachers from next year made headlines at the end of last week, with the government&apos;s move leading Radio 4&apos;s Today programme on Friday. Much was made of the current high pass rate of existing tests, which the new ones are to replace, with the figure of 98% quoted \u2013 though this includes those trainee teachers who re-take. So the government wants to make the tests harder, taking their difficulty level from roughly the equivalent of a GCSE grade C to grade B. But if the tests are made harder so that the pass rate falls, what will be the impact on the supply of teachers in the future? The government&apos;s official document sounds a rather sketchily outlined warning. Noting that only 60-70% of current postgraduate teacher trainees have grade Bs in English, and in maths, it warns that 35-40% &quot;might not pass tests set at the level of grade B if they were to take them&quot;. Accordingly, given that, presumably, this could cause a drop in teacher numbers, the rise in the difficulty level is going to be &quot;phased in&quot; from 2013, not reaching the B-grade equivalent until 2015. With little detail on how more trainees are to be supported to pass by then, or on the impact on teacher supply if pass rates fall dramatically, we do wonder if this could end messily. The report was commissioned by the Department for Education from a group of heads and educationists. Education Guardian wonders how pleased Michael Gove will be about an annex to it though, by Dr Alison Kitson and Prof Chris Husbands, of London University&apos;s Institute of Education, which analyses how countries that do well in international tests approach this issue. Having looked at arrangements in seven political jurisdictions \u2013 Finland, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Ontario in Canada \u2013 the annex concludes that none has pre-training testing arrangements for teachers that are similar to those either already existing, or being proposed, for England. The report also concludes: &quot;Teacher training is solely led by universities across all the countries included in this report, with the exception of New Zealand, where there are a small number of private providers.&quot; This seems unlikely to have been music to the ears of the education secretary, who has made great play of learning from international &quot;high performers&quot; while also seeking to reduce the influence of universities over teacher education. Up with Downhills! A parent at the former Downhills school, the primary in Haringey, north London, that became a focal point for resistance against being forced into academy status by the education secretary, Michael Gove, is fighting on against its takeover by the Harris chain. Susan Moyse, who has a daughter at the school, lost a claim for judicial review in August against the school re-opening as the renamed Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane. She is now seeking leave to appeal against the verdict, even though two months have passed since the school began life under the Harris Federation. Meanwhile, the school was forced to take down graffiti (pictured) earlier this term reflecting the fact that at least one member of the local community seems not to have accepted its new name."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/30/how-become-whisky-malt-master", "sentences": ["I&apos;ve also travelled overseas to meet clients in markets such as the US, Taiwan, Paris, Singapore and Moscow.&quot; As a malt master, Stewart ensures the quality of single malts produced in individual casks, but because he has also acquired the skills of a master blender he can create new whiskies."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-30T09:39:05Z", "title": "How do I become \u2026 a whisky malt master", "tags": ["Work & careers", "Money", "Whisky", "Food & drink", "Food & drink industry", "Life and style", "Business"], "article": "It&apos;s only 10am when I speak to David Stewart, but after 20 minutes of impassioned chat about whisky I am almost ready to pour myself a wee dram. Stewart is a malt master for William Grant &amp; Sons, owners of Glenfiddich, Grant&apos;s and Balvenie. It&apos;s a prestigious job that sees him using his nose to produce exquisite single malt whiskies and maintain the consistency of the company&apos;s output, as well as blend new creations. He is also one of the public faces of the company, regularly flying overseas to explain how the firm&apos;s whiskies are made with buyers and clients. &quot;I left school in 1962 aged 17 with five O-levels. My parents told me I had to get a job, so I got three interviews: one at a bank, one at an insurance company and one at William Grant,&quot; Stewart says. &quot;I got offered all three but the whisky company sounded more interesting so I joined as a whisky stocks clerk, knowing nothing about whisky or the drinks industry.&quot; Fortuitously, Stewart&apos;s boss was the firm&apos;s master blender. After he had been doing clerical work for two years the master blender started to teach him how to &quot;nose&quot; whisky. This involves easing your nose into a tulip-shaped glass and testing the drink through smell. &quot;He taught me what to look for, what should and shouldn&apos;t be there, the style of our own products, how whisky matures \u2026 Quite quickly I saw that if I could master the nosing aspect I would be one of very few people in the company who could do it. It took me 12 years to master it to the point where I could prepare blends, but it was quite difficult \u2013 I&apos;d never tasted whisky at the age of 19 or 20.&quot; In 1974, when Stewart was 29, his boss left and he was offered the chance to take over on a six-month trial. He has never looked back. His typical day involves a trip to the sample room where he spends at least 90 minutes nosing. He estimates he noses about 30 whisky casks a day, and has nosed more than 400,000 during his 50-year career. &quot;The rest of my time is spent in meetings, sorting emails, desk work, even a bit of PR. We have customers coming into the sample room and I talk to them about whisky. I&apos;ve also travelled overseas to meet clients in markets such as the US, Taiwan, Paris, Singapore and Moscow.&quot; As a malt master, Stewart ensures the quality of single malts produced in individual casks, but because he has also acquired the skills of a master blender he can create new whiskies. He has developed award-winning ranges of single malts and blends, but also introduced the technique of &quot;finishing&quot; single malt in the 1980s. &quot;The Balvenie PortWood, which we launched in 1995, is the one I&apos;m most proud of,&quot; he says. &quot;I took whisky that had been aged for 21 years and put it in casks that had previously held port. It added rich, sweet port wine notes, and raisin and sultana flavours to the whisky.&quot; It has subsequently won more than 50 awards, but it&apos;s not cheap \u2013 &quot;even I have to buy a bottle myself,&quot; Stewart jokes. Malt master and blender jobs do not come up often \u2013 there are only about a dozen malt masters in the country at any one time \u2013 meaning there is no conventional route into the role. Stewart&apos;s own apprentice had a chemistry degree and had been working in the firm&apos;s laboratory for three years before he was handpicked for a blending role. &quot;He then had almost 10 years with me learning the ropes, which is rare in most industries. I think that type of science degree is probably a good way in, but when it comes to nosing you just have to learn over many years.&quot; Apart from having a good nose, Stewart says master blenders need to be creative and patient because you have to wait so long for anything to happen. &quot;You can wait two years to see how something turns out only to find it hasn&apos;t improved the whisky and you have to start all over again with something else.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/oct/30/defence-school-drama-arts-curriculum-ebacc", "sentences": ["The ministry of education in Singapore (which has a new curriculum drama officer) is sending a visiting arts delegation across to look at drama teaching in English schools next July."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-30T16:00:00Z", "title": "In defence of school drama: don't let arts fall off the curriculum", "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Education", "Schools", "Secondary schools", "Primary schools", "Teaching", "English baccalaureate", "Drama and dance"], "article": "The future of drama in schools in England looks disturbingly bleak at the moment. Soon we may see the subject being cut from the curriculum altogether in many schools. There is no sign of any statutory drama curriculum in the offing, no secure entitlement for children to learn about and take part in regular drama lessons as part of a broad and balanced curriculum and no guarantee that they will be taught by specialist, qualified drama teachers. The most recent proof came earlier this month when the Department for Education released a report, The Effects of the English Baccalaureate. One interesting effect, uncovered by the report, is the withdrawal of subjects that do not fit into, to use the DfE&apos;s words, &quot;a core of academic subjects; English, maths, history or geography, the sciences and a language.&quot; Of the teachers interviewed for the quantitative survey: &quot;Just over a quarter (27%) say that some courses have been withdrawn or failed to recruit enough pupils for the 2012/13 academic year due to the EBacc. The proportion of schools saying this has fallen significantly since 2011.&quot; The report goes on to say: &quot;The most commonly withdrawn subjects are drama and performing arts, which had been dropped in nearly a quarter of schools where a subject had been withdrawn (23%), followed by art (17%) and design technology (14%). BTECs have also seen a decline (dropped in 20% schools where subjects have been withdrawn).&quot; Just prior to the last election, Sir Jim Rose&apos;s ill-fated draft primary curriculum was thrown out. He had drama at last clearly placed in &quot;understanding the arts&quot; as one of the four main art subjects (art, music, drama and dance), all of which were considered to be of equal status. The Tories and Lib Dems united, even then, to vote against this well-rounded curriculum that most primary teachers had welcomed. Later came Darren Henley&apos;s report on cultural education. This followed his earlier report on music education which recommended drama and dance should be given equal arts status as curriculum subjects in their own right \u2013 as did the All Our Futures report had also recommended this in 1999. However, Henley&apos;s important recommendation was selectively ignored and none of the initiatives that received Michael Gove&apos;s support following this report, were drama initiatives. Drama&apos;s position in education has been continuously damaged in many veiled ways since the election. When Gove surprisingly announced without consultation or warning, that schools should now be judged in relation to their performance in the English Baccalaureate subjects, I know of secondary schools that marginalised drama \u2013 placing it into after school study slots (competing with sports clubs). In June there was another giant blow for drama in the shape of the minimal draft primary curriculum. National Drama, the leading UK professional association for drama and theatre educators, had expected some involvement in drawing up the programmes of study for English but it seems a decision had already been made to cut drama from English. Even the speaking and listening framework within which drama sat was being silently axed, ignoring the fact that speaking and listening is the bedrock of English. This draft primary English curriculum will not be publicly consulted on now until at least January 2013. Why the long time lapse? Drama teachers through National Drama and other stakeholders (for example the NUT and the Cultural Learning Alliance) have asked for drama to be reinstated but it seems rather like Canute asking an ideological tidal wave to change direction. It is likely that the English Baccalaureate Certificates (EBCs) will be pushed through (not yet even consulted on) and this will pave the way probably for an army of external arts providers (including theatre educators and drama workshop leaders), to start offering arts education deals to schools through Arts Council England&apos;s new regional bridging organisations. Creative Partnerships, Artsmark and the Arts Awards have all been fed into an enormous national database of artists who work in schools. Good artists working in schools is great but not as a replacement for specialist arts teachers. There is a world of difference between drama teachers working in a good partnership with visiting actors, theatre educators and drama workshop leaders and handing drama over to them. Hours before the Olympic ceremony (when many in England were distracted) the news was slipped through, that teachers in academies for some specialist subjects would no longer need QTS. Most artists (including theatre educators) do not have qualified teacher status. This is likely to be the thin end of a huge wedge, as so many schools are being baited or pushed into becoming academies. It opens the door for a large, cheaper, non-QTS drama workforce at a time of great unemployment and funding cuts in the arts world. Non-QTS drama personnel will understandably be ready and waiting in the wings to replace drama teachers, where schools decide they want to provide some form of drama. Can a worthwhile national curriculum drama programme of study be put in place if it relies on external providers to teach it? Can rigorous drama examinations survive in this context or will we have a weaker raft of examinations for the non-EBCs subjects? Will drama in schools become a provision and postcode lottery? It may be that Gove&apos;s understanding of drama in schools does not extend beyond performing school plays and reading Shakespeare. Presumably this would explain why he mistakenly thinks it can be parcelled out or actors brought in. He will not discuss pedagogy in relation to the curriculum and yet drama teachers in schools are a powerful and ever present pedagogical resource for all teachers. Many are skilled at supporting colleagues to teach other subjects through drama and there is much evidence to show the positive impact drama can have on raising standards and improving key competencies, for example the Drama for Learning and Creativity (D4LC) initiative. Ironically, countries that do not have drama teachers with QTS and only have visiting drama pedagogues have looked enviously towards England. The ministry of education in Singapore (which has a new curriculum drama officer) is sending a visiting arts delegation across to look at drama teaching in English schools next July. Let&apos;s hope we still have something to show them. Meanwhile Australia has its first ever national curriculum with drama as an equal status arts subject. New Zealand, Ontario, Ireland, and Northern Ireland all have drama in their curriculums and within the last few weeks Iceland put drama into its national curriculum for the first time. Finland may soon follow suit. Why is drama in the national curriculum of England being destroyed?

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) yesterday asked retailers, manufacturers and charities to sign up to &quot;work towards&quot; ensuring that, by 2015, all palm oil used in food and other products is responsibly produced and does not contribute to deforestation. But the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that while the government deserved praise for putting the palm oil issue on the agenda, many of its members had already made more ambitious commitments. The BRC wants other sectors to commit to nothing less than the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standards for sustainable palm oil. Richard Dodd, head of BRC media and campaigns, said: &quot;Manufacturers have not been prepared to sign up to only using RSPO-certified palm oil by end of 2015. The commitment they have signed up to has been watered down, as it doesn&apos;t have a specific timetable and only a commitment to &apos;work towards&apos; using 100% sustainable palm oil. In order to get the wide range of signatories, the pledge that Defra has settled for is not as good as it should have been, and not as good as the one retailers have already made. &quot;[The RSPO] is the only worthwhile standard and the one retailers have committed to.&quot; BRC director of food and sustainability, Andrew Opie, said: &quot;If the government is serious about achieving comprehensive change in the way palm oil is produced and saving rainforest habitats, it should be pushing other sectors to follow retailers&apos; lead. &quot;Retailers have already pledged to meet the world&apos;s most rigorous standards on 100% certified sustainable palm oil, and said they will do it by the end of 2015, because that&apos;s the way to generate a market for sustainable product and eliminate the rest.&quot; The environment minister, Richard Benyon, said the government would lead the way by ensuring that only environmentally friendly-sourced palm oil would be used in central government food and catering services. &quot;People want to know that the products they are using are not contributing to deforestation and climate change and many UK businesses are already starting to make changes. Producers, manufacturers and charities will continue working together to speed up the move to 100% sustainable palm oil in everyday products,&quot; he said. Palm oil is one of the world&apos;s most rapidly expanding food crops and used extensively in the food industry as frying fats, and as an ingredient in biscuits, margarine, snacks and bakery products. It is also used in the production of biodiesel, in animal feed, soaps and other cleaning products and cosmetics. Its production has been linked to the destruction of rainforest habitats in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, and it is a rising source of greenhouse gas emissions, which come from clearing forests for crop cultivation. According to Eurostat data, the UK imported 397,000 metric tonnes of palm oil and 53,000 metric tonnes of palm kernel oil in 2011. Defra has estimated that only 24% was sourced from sustainably certified plantations. Defra&apos;s statement coincides with the annual conference on the ingredient, held by the RSPO in Singapore. Data released by the RSPO this week showed that UK supermarkets including the Co-operative, Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury&apos;s, and manufacturers like United Biscuits, Warburtons and Burton&apos;s food are already at \u2013 or very close to \u2013 using 100% RSPO-certified palm oil. Waitrose said on Tuesday that it would reach its target of 100% fully sustainable palm oil by the end of this year. The supermarket lists palm oil in its ingredients and claims to be the first retailer to use the RSPO logo on its soap. Riyaz Dhalla, Waitrose senior technologist, said: &quot;This is an important issue for our customers and we&apos;re delighted to be able to help them make an ethical purchasing decision.&quot; The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said many food and drink manufacturers had made substantial progress. The FDF director of sustainability, Andrew Kuyk, said: &quot;Many food and drink manufacturers have in place long-standing commitments to using 100% certified sustainable palm oil and the national statement is an important step towards a wider reassurance for consumers that the products they enjoy contain oil from environmentally friendly sources.&quot; Adam Harrison of WWF International \u2013 another RSPO member \u2013 said that Defra&apos;s move was significant, but given the urgency of the situation relating to the impacts on natural habitats relating to palm oil production, the statement needed to go further. &quot;The impacts of irresponsible and unsustainable palm oil expansion to meet growing demand are completely unacceptable in terms of deforestation, damage to wildlife and climate change. The urgency of the problem needs an equally urgent response. Whilst we welcome the national statement we are concerned that it does not convey clearly enough the need to take action now. Palm oil is a &quot;hidden oil&quot; for consumers. Currently in the EU, palm oil can be labelled as vegetable oil, meaning that consumers cannot easily make an educated purchasing choice. Last year it was announced that changes to food labelling would make it easier for consumers to identify products containing palm oil. Changes to the European Food Information Regulations will mean labels have to identify the specific types of vegetable oils that have been used. Businesses are already starting to implement the change, which will be mandatory on all food products from 13 December 2014."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/china-takes-stake-heathrow", "sentences": ["The deal means Heathrow will be more than 40% controlled by the Chinese, Qatari and Singaporean governments, dwarfing the 34% stake held by Spain&apos;s Ferrovial.", "We now have investors based in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Asia, including sovereign wealth funds from Qatar, China and Singapore.&quot; The news may also be seen as damaging to London mayor Boris Johnson&apos;s ambitions for a new hub airport, possibly in the Thames estuary."], "publicationDate": "2012-10-31T19:45:13Z", "title": "China takes 10% stake in Heathrow", "tags": ["Sovereign wealth funds", "Business", "Air transport", "UK news", "Heathrow", "World news", "China", "Heathrow airport"], "article": "Heathrow is now part-owned by the Chinese state after the country&apos;s sovereign wealth fund acquired a 10% stake in the UK&apos;s largest airport.

He represents a new breed of tycoon, said Chrystia Freeland, the editor of Thomson Reuters Digital and author of Plutocrats: the rise of the new global super-rich and the fall of everyone else. &quot;The caricature is of conspicuous consumption, yachts and jets, but for the super-rich the real status symbol is having a voice, having an impact on public policy, and in that sense Sheldon is characteristic of his class.&quot; He is not shy about declaring his wealth. &quot;You know,&quot; he reportedly bragged to George W Bush, when he was president in 2008, &quot;I am the richest Jew in the world.&quot; If few knew that then, many know now. Adelson has burst onto the international stage by becoming, as one observer noted, &quot;sugar daddy&quot; to zionist and conservative causes. He is a modern Croesus who converts cash into influence. The question, which to critics becomes more urgent with each day of the campaign, is the extent to which he may convert, or try to convert, influence into cash. In a written reply to Guardian questions, Adelson said he wished only that the White House invite him to its annual Hanukah party and save him some potato pancakes. &apos;He doesn&apos;t give up&apos; A Romney victory could yield Adelson billions in tax cuts and make the White House an ally. His businesses are under investigation from the justice department and other agencies over alleged wrongdoing in Asia. There was little in his background to suggest Adelson would become the right&apos;s impresario. Reared in liberal Massachusetts, he worked his way through multiple jobs \u2013 vending machine salesman, court reporter, real estate dealer, toiletries packager \u2013 and scored big with Comdex, a computer trade show he launched in 1979. In 1988 he bought a chunk of the Sands hotel and casino, a fading, one-time rat pack haunt and turned it into Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a glitzy triumph with the Venetian as its flagship. He gambled, correctly, that if he built convention centres conferences would flock to Sin City. Even in a town known to be filled with tough operators, Adelson&apos;s steeliness stood out. He drove aides as hard as he did himself, did not take no for an answer, and did not forgive trespasses. He successfully sued the Daily Mail for libel and in a separate case went after Smith and his publisher, Barricade Books, over a depiction of Adelson in Smith&apos;s book Sharks in the Desert. Threatened with a $15m lawsuit, the publisher entered bankruptcy and agreed to a judgement of libel. Smith also entered bankruptcy. A judge dismissed the suit against him and ordered Adelson to pay some of the author&apos;s costs. &quot;He&apos;s a real sweetheart,&quot; said Smith. &quot;He doesn&apos;t give up.&quot; Ron Reese, a spokesman who who has represented Adelson for a decade, defended his boss. &quot;It is easy to be a critic of someone if you don&apos;t know them, haven&apos;t taken the time to learn about their values, or if you are simply jealous of their accomplishments. It&apos;s a lot like criticising the coaches and players of a football match you didn&apos;t watch or attend. The fact is, Mr Adelson is among the world&apos;s greatest philanthropists and has created tens of thousands of jobs throughout his business career.&quot; What vaulted Adelson into a league Donald Trump can only dream of was Macau, the former Portuguese colony that is part of China and hosts gambling under the &quot;one country, two systems formula&quot;. He outfoxed rival casino moguls to open the territory&apos;s first Las Vegas-style resort, the Sands Macao, in 2004. In reality it is two vast resorts, one of them the world&apos;s biggest. On its first day the crowd reportedly ripped doors off their hinges in a stampede for the gaming tables. Adelson recouped his $265m investment within a year. &quot;In 2004-5 the big question was when Macau would overtake Las Vegas; it was taking about $4bn to Las Vegas&apos;s $6bn. Now Macau is taking nearly $40bn a year - and Las Vegas is still on about $6bn,&quot; said Aaron Fischer, head of consumer and gaming research at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets. Asia \u2013 he expanded into Singapore \u2013 has made him a multi-billionaire. &quot;Other guys have made promises that may be they weren&apos;t able to deliver on. Sheldon stuck to the promises that he made [to officials] even though they have not always been perceived to have the best relationship,&quot; said Fischer. &quot;He doesn&apos;t have a reputation for always saying the right thing. I really think he&apos;s a character. I respect him and I find him to be quite honest and very down to earth. Maybe that&apos;s sometimes been his problem; he&apos;s not very good at diplomacy.&quot; Sergio Terra, editorial executive director of the Portugese-language newspaper Tribuna Macau, said Chinese officials bristled even as they benefited from Adelson&apos;s investment. &quot;He wanted everything and everything first. That&apos;s not the way the Macau government works. And he had to adjust to the Beijing approach. They don&apos;t like pressure.&quot; One veteran observer of the casino industry, who declined to be named, said Adelson charged through barriers. &quot;It&apos;s served him well but he might have knocked down a few too many and used weapons that are going to be subject to review by regulators. I think his quest is to be the world&apos;s richest man \u2013 I don&apos;t think he&apos;s made any secret of that. He&apos;s always referring to his ranking.&quot; Las Vegas Sands faces three lawsuits over its Macau operations: a former executive, Steve Jacobs, claims wrongful dismissal and alleges the company collaborated with triads and sought to blackmail officials. The company is also snagged in a bribery scandal and claims it violated US anti-money laundering laws. Adelson vehemently denies wrongdoing. &quot;We&apos;re going to be found absolutely clean,&quot; he said last year. The company blamed the accusations on disgruntled former employees. Breaking into the Israeli newspaper market Macau is the golden egg, but Israel is Adelson&apos;s enduring passion. The mogul often tells the story how he stepped off the plane for the first time wearing the shoes of his late father, who had been too poor to travel. His commitment has grown since marrying his second wife, Miriam, an Israeli, in 1991. The Adelsons have underwritten think tanks, exchange programmes, DC-based lobby groups and, most controversially, the interests of Netanyahu. Adelson believes Israel&apos;s hawkish prime minister is a necessary bulwark to supposed peace talks and Palestinian statehood, a prospect he abhors. After false starts, Adelson established his tabloid, Israel Hayom, in 2007. It now has a 38% share of the weekday newspaper market, compared to 36% for its main rival Yedioth Ahronoth, 11% for Ma&apos;ariv and 7% for Haaretz. The heavily advertised paper is given away by uniformed distributors on the streets, outside supermarkets and at gas stations. It also has paid home-delivery sales. Its partisanship earned the nicknamed &quot;Bibiton&quot;, a play on the prime minister&apos;s nickname and the Hebrew word for newspaper. Many have blamed it for the catastrophic demise of paid-for newspapers. Maariv faces possible closure. Haaretz is also in crisis, with layoffs and pay cuts looming. Yedioth announced cutbacks earlier this year, including dozens of job losses. The Israeli business website Globes quoted a senior Yedioth executive as saying: &quot;You must know that Israel Hayom is destroying Israeli journalism not only at the professional level, with its embarrassing editorial conduct, but also at the economic level.&quot; Israel Hayom was breaking the market with ads at zero cost, crippling rivals&apos; revenue streams, he said. &quot;Israel Hayom has finished Ma&apos;ariv, and it is now finishing Haaretz. Adelson has simply brought ruin.&quot; The mogul&apos;s friends disagree. &quot;He put his money up for an alternative voice and people liked it. That&apos;s capitalism,&quot; said Sig Rogich, a businessman and media consultant in Las Vegas. Rogich also defended his friend&apos;s plunge into this year&apos;s US presidential and congressional races after years of confining himself to Nevada politics. He has shattered records by spending an estimated $70m backing Republican candidates nationwide. &quot;This is a country built on the principle of freedom of speech,&quot; said Rogich. &quot;When George Soros funded the other side no one complained. Sheldon has been transparent (about his contributions). You have to admire the truthfulness of standing up and telling the world that&apos;s he&apos;s responsible for the message.&quot;     Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, expanded their involvement in US politics out of Nevada and onto a national state in the 2012 presidential campaign. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters    Adelson backed Newt Gingrich in the primaries but rowed in behind Romney. As the money has flowed, and as Paul Ryan and other Republican figures paid homage to their benefactor in Las Vegas, the New York Times, among others, asked what does he expect in return.  Consciously or not, at a private fundraiser Romney echoed Adelson&apos;s views when he appeared to dismiss a two-state solution and said the Palestinians had no interest in peace. The Republican&apos;s proposed tax cuts could swell the mogul&apos;s bank account by about $2bn. In an interview with Politico, Adelson, who runs the only non-unionised resort on the Las Vegas strip, accused Obama&apos;s administration of waging a vendetta. If Romney wins, observers will closely watch the fate of the probes into Adelson&apos;s businesses. Onkar Ghate, a vice-president of the Ayn Rand Institute, which champions free markets, said tycoons had a right to fight back against vindictive governments: &quot;If they spend money purely defensively then I think that&apos;s entirely correct.&quot; But others, including the Economist, fret that Super Pacs backed by the &quot;0.1%&quot; are rigging the system and entrenching inequality. &quot;It is hard to believe that this surge of cash from the richest will have no impact at all.&quot; Freeland, the author of Plutocrats, said Adelson&apos;s activism raised profound issues. &quot;Democracy is supposed to be one person, one vote. But when economic disparity grows and transfers into political disparity, well, you have to ask where it&apos;s going.&quot; A conversation with Sheldon Adelson Guardian: You have made substantial donations to the Romney campaign. Do you expect a return from this investment? How do you respond to critics who say you are buying influence? Sheldon Adelson: I do not expect any type of return, except that if the candidate we are supporting becomes president he maintains this country&apos;s freedom and its free-market capitalist ways, as opposed to his opponent who I believe is following socialist policies \u2013 it may work in other countries, but not here. There is absolutely no expectation of any favoritism whatsoever, though If I&apos;m fortunate enough to be invited to the White House Hanukkah Party I hope someone would save me a couple of potato pancakes. They ran out the last time I was there. Guardian: Some critics also say a Romney victory could yield you billions in tax cuts and possible protection from multiple investigations into your business affairs. How do you respond? SA: I would be entitled to no preferential tax cuts or any other type of preferential treatment whatsoever. Any tax cuts that would apply to me would apply to President Obama, his wealthy donors, and everyone else. By the way, what is wrong with supporting a candidate whose economic views and values are the same as yours? Guardian: It&apos;s been said of you that you are probably the most aggressive, unforgiving individual in the business world today. What do you say to that? SA: Friends I&apos;ve had for as long as 70 years would never match that word with me or my way of life. The word unforgiving and my name don&apos;t belong together \u2013 it is inconsistent with my concept of giving away much more than I make or spend on my family to help repair the world \u2013 through our drug treatment centers which rehabilitate drug addicts, specifically women who turn to prostitution because of drugs; our medical research foundation; the strong support we provide for our military veterans here in the United States and many other causes."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/iskandar-malaysia-green-megacity", "sentences": ["Standing opposite Singapore, across the strait of Johor, is the site of a new project that its architects and developers hope will be the future of urban life in south-east Asia \u2013 a mega-city built along eco-friendly lines, with green energy and an end to the pollution that afflicts so many of Asia&apos;s cities."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-02T10:19:06Z", "title": "Iskandar Malaysia - the green mega-city rising above Singapore", "tags": ["Green building", "Malaysia", "Ecotowns", "Urbanisation", "Energy", "Environment", "Renewable energy", "World news", "Population", "Asia Pacific", "Singapore", "Cities"], "article": "Standing opposite Singapore, across the strait of Johor, is the site of a new project that its architects and developers hope will be the future of urban life in south-east Asia \u2013 a mega-city built along eco-friendly lines, with green energy and an end to the pollution that afflicts so many of Asia&apos;s cities. Occupying an area the size of Luxembourg, the site is expected to have a population of 3 million by 2025, living as an ultra-modern &quot;smart metropolis&quot;. Energy will be provided from renewable sources, transport will be publicly provided, waste will be diverted to other uses, and the city is planned by the Malaysian government as a showcase to be copied on a bigger scale across the region. The world&apos;s urban population overtook the number of rural-dwellers for the first time in 2007, and future population growth in south-east Asia \u2013 at least 9bn people are expected to inhabit this planet by 2050, up from 7bn at present \u2013 is expected to be mainly in cities in the developing world. By far the greatest growth will be in slums, by current estimates. Iskandar Malaysia offers an alternative. The plans are for a city that not only incorporates the latest in environmentally friendly technology, but that is designed for social integration. Green spaces and areas where people can mingle and relax will improve people&apos;s mental wellbeing and encourage social cohesion, it is hoped. Skyscrapers will be mixed with low-rise buildings and small self-contained &quot;neighbourhoods&quot;.

However, the project&apos;s developers will have to overcome significant obstacles. New eco-cities have been planned in the past, from China to the US, but most have floundered. China&apos;s Dongtan was heralded as the world&apos;s first planned eco-city, but plans have been mired in difficulty for years. A UK project for &quot;eco-towns&quot; was widely ridiculed and has been all but abandoned. So far, the Malaysian government has managed to attract support from Pinewood Studios, which will build new facilities in Iskandar, and Legoland which will build its first Asian theme park in the city. Several UK universities \u2013 including Newcastle and Southampton \u2013 are also planning to open up remote campuses. More than $30bn has been promised for the city, of which more than a third will come from outside Malaysia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/nov/02/martin-whitmarsh-title-mclaren-f1", "sentences": ["But then we had a rear suspension issue with Lewis in Korea, and the gearbox failure in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-02T18:58:44Z", "title": "Martin Whitmarsh feels the pain of not winning a title for McLaren | Paul Weaver", "tags": ["McLaren", "Formula One 2012", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Martin Whitmarsh was on a plane between Japan and South Korea when during a conversation with his former driver Martin Brundle, the Sky TV frontman turned round to him and said: &quot;You fired me!&quot; Whitmarsh says: &quot;The funny thing was that Martin was one of five drivers on that flight, and I&apos;d fired the lot of them.&quot; The McLaren team principal tells the story in an attempt to destroy an image of him that most men would covet. For Whitmarsh can be perceived as a decent man, a voice of reason in a world where the sound of screaming is not confined to the finely-tuned V8 engines on the grid. Whitmarsh, in a different age, might have been played by Henry Fonda \u2013 Twelve Angry Teams, perhaps. And yet, for all the decency, he is only the fourth principal of a team who will be 50 next year \u2013 and the other three have won 12 drivers&apos; and eight constructors&apos; world championships between them. Whitmarsh, who took over from Ron Dennis after Lewis Hamilton won the 2008 title, has yet to win a championship and the monkey on his back is beginning to take on the measurements of a gorilla. This has been another year of failure. McLaren may have won five races but, with three events remaining, they are out of both world championships and their one, grim surviving objective is to beat Ferrari to second place in the team contest. In addition, they have lost the services of their fastest driver, Lewis Hamilton, while the continued support of Vodafone, their main sponsor, has been the subject of conjecture. Whitmarsh made an almost Churchillian speech at Silverstone last year, defending his team&apos;s and his own ethos when McLaren had endured a dismal time in the buildup to the British Grand Prix, ending with the words: &quot;I can tell you, we have not turned into chumps overnight.&quot; The cruel might retort: &quot;No, it&apos;s taken much longer than that.&quot; McLaren have not won the constructors&apos; title since 1998, while Hamilton&apos;s success four years ago is their solitary drivers&apos; triumph this century. Little wonder that Whitmarsh, appearing less driven and ruthless than Dennis, is anxious to dismantle the notion that he might be too easygoing for the job. &quot;I don&apos;t feel a need to culture a machismo image in the sport,&quot; he says. &quot;If I&apos;m pissed off with people in the company they certainly know about it. I&apos;m pretty comfortable with how I go about my business.&quot; But Formula One is defined by the vigour with which its competitors challenge its complex rules and regulations, and here McLaren have been less aggressive than Red Bull. Are McLaren still scarred by Spygate, the 2007 espionage controversy which resulted in the team being fined $100m (although they ultimately paid only half of that) and stripped of the constructors&apos; championship points that would have won them the title? More personally, has Whitmarsh felt inhibited, morally, by his chairmanship of the Formula One Teams&apos; Association, and unable to push the boundaries as far as he otherwise would? The normally free-speaking Whitmarsh thinks about this for a moment, moving his tongue inside his mouth like a man eating herring and feeling for bones. &quot;Arguably we have been too conservative and risk-averse in regulation interpretation,&quot; he concedes. &quot;Given our brand and our position, I think we are more risk-averse. &quot;There are things that have happened which, had our engineers come to me and said we&apos;re going to do this, I&apos;d have said forget it. I&apos;d rather campaign for clearer, less ambiguous regulations. &quot;There have been some cases, double-diffusers and other things, that have gone on,&quot; he says. Without mentioning their name, Red Bull is clearly on his mind once more. &quot;It&apos;s the old Benetton effect, isn&apos;t it? Benetton \u2013 and I&apos;m trying to avoid [mentioning] the obvious one today \u2013 Benetton was a brand that enjoyed controversy for their particular consumer. And there are some major brands in this paddock which like a little bit of that, whereas our brands don&apos;t tolerate it. There are teams that appear to have racier interpretations on regulations and resource restrictions.&quot; Red Bull, though, inspired by the fertile mind of Adrian Newey, have been too strong for McLaren, who have been held back by pit-lane maladroitness early in the season and, more recently, reliability issues. As McLaren&apos;s sporting director, Sam Michael admits: &quot;Red Bull have done a better job than us over the course of the season. We started well, then had a bad stage when we had some pit problems, although we&apos;re now quicker there than anyone else. &quot;In Montreal, it turned around for us. But then we had a rear suspension issue with Lewis in Korea, and the gearbox failure in Singapore. And when you have issues like that you&apos;re handing results to other teams. And our tyre understanding maybe wasn&apos;t as good as the others. But this is a team with great strength in depth. There&apos;s a lot of intellectual capacity at McLaren.&quot; Next year, though, will be difficult again. And this time McLaren, unusually, will not be able to call upon a driver considered to be in the top three in the world \u2013 currently seen as Hamilton, Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel. &quot;But,&quot; says Whitmarsh, &quot;we&apos;ve got a very exciting young driver [Sergio P\u00e9rez] and our challenge now is to make him into a world champion, make him into one of the top drivers in the world. I find that a stimulating and interesting challenge.&quot; But, after another disappointing year, will Whitmarsh be there to meet it? &quot;I&apos;ve been involved in this team for 23 years, been around for approaching 100 race wins and I know it&apos;s not easy to win &apos;em. &quot;It&apos;s not for me to question my position. That&apos;s for other people to reflect on. But we can do a better job \u2013 I can do a better job \u2013 that&apos;s for sure. Next year, I want us to be the best race team in the world. And I want to win both world championships.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/03/lewis-hamilton-pole-abu-dhabi-f1", "sentences": ["he dominated all three qualifying sessions to take his 25th pole and prevent Red Bull from locking out the front row for the first time since Singapore in September."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-03T14:48:15Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton takes pole at Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix for McLaren", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Sebastian Vettel", "Fernando Alonso", "Red Bull", "Ferrari", "Formula One 2012", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "When Lewis Hamilton drives as brilliantly as he did here on Saturday the McLaren team are assailed by mixed emotions. This is the man who might convert his victory for pole into victory on Sunday, ending a miserable run of under-achievement for the Woking team. But this is also the driver who will wear their colours just three more times before he moves to Mercedes next year. He will be missed like a persistent ache, however good his replacement Sergio P\u00e9rez is \u2013 and the Mexican has done little of note in recent races. Hamilton likes it here. Actually, he says he likes it almost everywhere, but the Abu Dhabi track, even though it is not one of the greatest, has seen the British driver at his best in its short history. He won here last year and was second the year before. he dominated all three qualifying sessions to take his 25th pole and prevent Red Bull from locking out the front row for the first time since Singapore in September. Mark Webber will join Hamilton on the front row, but the world champion and current leader Sebastian Vettel, the winner here in 2009 and 2010, qualified third and then had to wait, agonisingly, to see if he would be pushed further back after his car came to a halt beneath the Yas hotel following instructions from the engine makers Renault. Hamilton completely outdrove his team-mate Jenson Button, who could finish only sixth. Pastor Maldonado put in a great lap to pinch fourth and Kimi Raikkonen continued his consistent season with fifth. But it was another disappointing qualifying session for Fernando Alonso, Vettel&apos;s only realistic rival for the drivers&apos; championship. He desperately wanted to get to the sharp end of the grid for Sunday but had to content himself with seventh. &quot;I&apos;m very excited, very excited,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;It&apos;s the first time for a long time to be ahead of the Red Bulls, and not to be seeing the tail of them at the start of the race, but I know it&apos;s going to be, as always, very, very tough in the race because they&apos;ve got great race pace. &quot;But we are strong enough to fight them. The team&apos;s done a fantastic job all weekend. The car&apos;s felt beautiful all weekend. I don&apos;t know why the car works so well here. We&apos;ve not really made any improvements since the last race, so I guess it just suits the track. The guys are still massively focused so I hope that tomorrow&apos;s a good day for us.&quot; Vettel, like the entire Red Bull team, looked in sombre mood. The driver had brake problems in the morning practice session and, like everyone else, did not know why he was asked to stop his car at the end of qualifying. &quot;I don&apos;t why I was asked to stop,&quot; he shrugged. &quot;I think probably some problem. It shouldn&apos;t be something major. Obviously, this morning wasn&apos;t ideal, not being able to run. So we didn&apos;t get probably the answers that we were hoping for. Nevertheless, this afternoon we were settling in quite well and the pace was there, but I think McLaren, in particular Lewis, are pretty quick. So they were out of reach today.&quot; Button, whose whole career might be outlined with a succession of brilliant peaks and unexplained troughs, looked mystified by his lack of performance. &quot;All weekend I&apos;ve been happy and the pace has been good. But in qualifying it wasn&apos;t there and I don&apos;t know why. If I knew, I would&apos;ve sorted it out. Obviously, the car is very quick. Lewis is on pole by quite a bit. I&apos;m five or six tenths off. It&apos;s a lot of lap time,&quot; he said. Alonso was also left to reflect on a far from perfect day. The Spaniard trails Vettel by 13 points in the drivers&apos; championship and said of his qualifying session: &quot;I think we were not competitive today, but myself, personally, I&apos;m happy because we extracted the maximum from the car. Unfortunately there were six people faster than us. Normally the pace improves on Sunday so I hope that will be the case.&quot; Webber qualified second, despite losing a considerable amount of track time on Friday because of a Kers issue, and he acknowledged the McLaren&apos;s pace. &quot;Credit to Lewis, he&apos;s obviously got a quick car this weekend and he bumped us off the front row. I think it was a pretty smooth qualifying session for both Seb and I and we did what we could,&quot; he said. &quot;Lewis&apos;s starts lately haven&apos;t been phenomenal so let&apos;s see if he has a good one tomorrow. Generally, it&apos;s down to how the clutch is and things like that; it&apos;s not really down to Lewis.

The sun shines on to an open vista of fields and mountains, glistens off nearby lakes. It&apos;s an ideal day for cycling, walking, picnicking; almost anything other than messing around with computers in the dark. I am standing in the dark, watching people mess around with computers. Scruffy young men take cables out of plastic carrier bags and plug them into the back of television screens. They connect up keyboards, slot in SD cards, bung long leads into USB jacks. Parcel tape is slathered over stray cords to stick them in place. Somehow, I thought that Cern, the closest thing to a Bond lab on the planet, would be more sophisticated than this. Still, it&apos;s not Cern that we&apos;re checking out. We&apos;re here for something far more basic, and even more exciting. Take a closer look. You will notice that near every terminal sits a small green circuit board. Slightly bigger than a credit card, with cables sprouting out of it like twisted limbs, it resembles a rectangular spider. In fact, it&apos;s a computer, busily driving and connecting all the disparate elements around it to create\u2026 well, whatever the geeks want it to. Say hello, ladies and gentle-nerds, to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is a robust, cheap (about \u00a325), low-powered programmable computer. It is a British invention that went on sale for the first time in February this year and has been a science sensation, the computing equivalent of tickets to Glastonbury or the Rolling Stones: everyone wants one, not just hardcore fans. Before it even launched, demand for the Pi outran supply, and the day the first 10,000 became available, the distributing websites all crashed. The first ever BBC online video of the RPi \u2013 a preview of it, before it went on sale \u2013 got more than 800,000 views in a matter of days. Since then, the RPi has shifted almost 500,000 units and is on target to top 1m by Christmas \u2013 topped up by purchasers from South America and China who haven&apos;t been put off by the import costs which turn the RPi from bargain to just cheapish. It&apos;s been used to take photographs of the Earth from near space and snaps of birds in back gardens. And it has united the science community, from primary school teachers to particle physicists, in joyous enthusiasm; mostly because they hope its price, size, software and sturdiness (you can shove it in your pocket without damaging it, supposedly) will make it appeal to kids, and thus lead children into computer programming. So let&apos;s see, shall we? From 9am until 5pm, an unremitting stream of young kids wander into the dim room at Cern, look around for a free monitor, and sit down in front of it. They spot a small cat in the right hand top corner of the screen. Someone \u2013 an adult, another child \u2013 tells them they can make the cat move if they program it to do so. And then the kids do so. Mickal, who&apos;s six, is as charming an advert for the RPi as you will ever meet. &quot;Watch the cat,&quot; he says. &quot;He can dance.&quot; He drags and drops commands across the screen. The cat walks and turns around in circles. Later, he shows me that he can switch some tiny lights on and off using the RPi. &quot;Press N and enter,&quot; he says. &quot;Now N, space and enter.&quot; Nancy, seven, is also enjoying herself. She&apos;s given the cat a friend, a horse who makes odd noises, gallops into walls and bounces back. &quot;We don&apos;t have a computer at school, except sometimes for maths. I don&apos;t play computer at home either. I like drawing. And I like this.&quot; Nearby, Thomas, seven, is having a go too. Is he enjoying himself? &quot;I like it a little bit,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s fun, but sometimes when you get a bit stuck, it gets annoying, and you want to do something else.&quot; He looks a little wistfully at the door, and at the bright sunshine beyond.     Six-year-old Mickal and his father show Miranda Sawyer a few of the Raspberry Pi\u2019s tricks at the Cern programming event. Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Wavre/Rezo.ch    Since the RPi&apos;s launch, it has had almost perfect press, and you would have to be a far more cynical hack than I am to scoff at its ideals. Its developers are six highly qualified Cambridge-based scientists, and its principles are pure of heart. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a charity whose sole aim is to promote the study of computer science in schools; the Raspberry Pi was born from that aim. If the foundation had been a business rather than a charity, the original six could have retired by now. The geek buzz around the RPi \u2013 let&apos;s not forget it&apos;s been around less than a year \u2013 has been phenomenal. Now there are events like the one at Cern held all over the place: Manchester, Machynlleth, Silicon Valley, Singapore. Called Raspberry jams (do you see?), and not officially endorsed by the foundation, they&apos;re essentially just local people getting together and sharing knowledge about the RPi. Here at Cern, on the Swiss-French border, organiser Dr William Bell is concerned with the lack of computer science in local schools (his kids attend a French primary which, at the moment, doesn&apos;t have a working computer for the children to use). Thus his jam involves teachers, kids and parents. Others have been more grown up, with lectures and demonstrations, people standing in front of large screens, making jokes in computer code. The jams are just one of the RPi-inspired offshoots that have sprung up since the launch. The point of the RPi is that, contrary to most of today&apos;s computers, it doesn&apos;t come bundled with everything you require. To make it work, you need a keyboard, a screen, an SD memory card, a vast array of cables\u2026 So RPi packages have become available, enabling you to buy all those accessories in one go. And if you don&apos;t want to program the operating system on to the memory card, there are pre-programmed ones available. If you don&apos;t like the idea of it knocking about without a case, several people have designed those. More interestingly, there are now add-on boards that expand the Pi&apos;s capabilities, to make it easier to use for physical computing and give it functions like driving motors, making lights flash, turning your Lego man into an actual moving robot. These include the Gertboard, designed by a member of the Raspberry Pi Foundation team (called Gert). And Pi-Face, which is similar, though slightly easier to use (no soldering required), and is the baby of Dr Andrew Robinson of Manchester University. Robinson, a friendly, funny man, tells me about the bird box some of his students have designed using an RPi and Pi-Face; the box has an infrared light beam, so the RPi knows when a bird is coming in and out and can activate a camera or send you a message. Robinson also uses his RPi outside work; at the moment he has one at the centre of a theatre show. The RPi syncs interactive projections with lighting and sound, which all respond to the movements of the dancers. What else? Manchester University is running the Great British Raspberry Pi Bake Off, a competition for kids to design an exciting use for the RPi; it&apos;s sending out RPis and Pi-Faces to the developing world, places like Bangalore and Kenya, where the RPi has caused a sensation but has been hard to come by. &quot;I don&apos;t think the Pi is going to change the world,&quot; says Robinson. &quot;But it has opened stuff up, and created an excitement around programming that I&apos;ve never seen before.&quot; The creators of the RPi are of a generation that played with, rather than on, computers. Their first consoles were BBC Micros, Commodore 64s, Spectrum ZXs: beige boxes with limited power that offered limited built-in entertainment. In order to really enjoy yourself, you had to tinker about with what your computer could do: change some of the coding and see what happened. If you could do that, you could bring that programming skill to any other computer. But once computers improved, became more powerful and better to play games on, they became harder to program. The tinkering aspect was lost, and this affected swaths of schoolchildren: they just didn&apos;t come into contact with programming, even though they had more access to computers, better games consoles, lessons in ICT. Eben Upton, a friendly, upbeat man (everyone involved with the RPi is friendly) is a designer of microchips for Broadcom and the main designer of the RPi. In the early- to mid-2000s, he was in charge of undergraduate admissions to computer science at Cambridge. He noticed a massive drop-off in the numbers and, especially, quality of undergraduates between 1996, when he graduated, and 2005. &quot;The students just couldn&apos;t program, and that&apos;s because they hadn&apos;t been in the presence of programmable hardware,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s not so much an education as an environment thing. I was self-taught, so were all of my friends. But in the consumer device world we&apos;re in today, where the majority of devices are tablets and phones and set-top boxes and games consoles\u2026 these are all machines that you can use to consume, but most of them won&apos;t let you produce.&quot; Everyone I speak to about the RPi is insistent that anyone can code, whether or not you&apos;re good at maths. Bell, at Cern, says it&apos;s like messing around with a motorbike. &quot;You spend your time taking it apart, putting it back together. Only by doing that will you understand how the engine works.&quot; Upton defines programming as &quot;breaking problems down into manageable pieces&quot;, and the RPi, when you boot it up, has a couple of programming languages already in place: Scratch, which is the basic one with the cat, and the more sophisticated Python, which, once you&apos;ve mastered it, leads you to pretty much any programming language you want. &quot;The Pi isn&apos;t just a magic box that does stuff,&quot; says Eben. &quot;You can start Python, enter six letters and straight away, you&apos;re in a programming environment.&quot; All of which sounds terrific, and terrifically exciting. Modern kids love computers, so why wouldn&apos;t they love programming? Well\u2026 The most identifiable characteristic of the computing genius is that he (it&apos;s usually a he) is Other. In the new Bond film Skyfall, Ben Wishaw&apos;s Q is as cute as can be, with his specs and wayward fringe, but he is, essentially, the lofty opposite of hero Bond. Q sits in a dark room looking at a screen; Bond runs around hitting people and snogging. This divide isn&apos;t new; it&apos;s in every school you go to. The nerds hang in the computer room during break time and make obscure jokes; the jocks run around hitting things and trying to chat up girls. There are other cliques \u2013 those who cluster in the art room, the alternative music crew \u2013 but it seems to me that, admirable though the foundation&apos;s intentions are, they&apos;ll find it hard to convince many teenagers that programming is for anyone other than geeks. Even if they do get RPis in there early. Eben admits that this is something he and his compadres think about a lot. He (and the rest of the foundation) is aware that, so far, about 80% of RPis have been sold &quot;to geeks like me&quot;.     The Raspberry Pi was designed to be cheap enough that all youngsters might have a chance to learn programming. Photograph: Phil Fisk for the Observer    &quot;We don&apos;t want to end up entrenching all the advantages that are already there,&quot; he says. &quot;There is a fixed-size pie \u2013 sorry, but it&apos;s the best word \u2013 which consists of white, male, middle-class people who are good at maths. Let&apos;s say that pie is divided up into particle physicists, investment bankers and computer scientists, which are all careers that are dominated by white, male, middle-class people who are good at maths. If you&apos;re not careful, then all you&apos;re doing is moving the dividers around that pie of people. What we need to do is expand the pie itself.&quot; In his day job, designing computer chips at Broadcom, Upton insists that he doesn&apos;t use a tremendous amount of maths: &quot;My job is more of a craft.&quot; And he thinks that emphasising the craft element of programming might help with that stubbornly non-expanding pie \u2013 particularly with girls. What the Raspberry Pi Foundation doesn&apos;t want to do is what he calls &quot;painting it pink&quot; \u2013 meaning trying to appeal to girls in a trivial way. There&apos;s another pie-growing aspect, he thinks, within the vast sector of teenage boys who love computer games. &quot;There are loads of boys between 12 and 16 who would love to step up to the next level and actually create their own games. But there&apos;s no obvious route, and I say that as someone who set up a computer games company straight out of university.&quot; Now, he would just tell such lads to go and get an RPi, play around with it for a couple of years and then take their portfolio to a games company. Another tricky thing about the Raspberry Pi is teaching. It has been pretty convincingly proven that the ICT classes of the 1990s did nothing much more than produce students who would make good secretaries; today&apos;s emphasis on online isn&apos;t useful either. (As Eben puts is: &quot;The not particularly helpful skill that students have has changed from being able to use PowerPoint to being able to build a website.&quot;) But how can teachers teach students computer programming if they don&apos;t know how to do it themselves? &quot;It&apos;s ridiculous to ask teachers to teach stuff they don&apos;t feel confident about,&quot; agrees Eben. &quot;We need to make teachers feel comfortable.&quot; Yet, he admits, if teachers are trained to be great programmers, then they&apos;ll just leave teaching and go and earn loads more money. &quot;So we have to find a way to make this stuff deliverable by non-specialists.&quot; To this end, the foundation \u2013 along with many other associations, such as Code Club \u2013 has been encouraging computer engineers to help enthusiastic teachers set up after-school\u00a0clubs. And what about parents? I&apos;m white, female, middle class and studied maths and further maths (not very well) at A-level: I wouldn&apos;t have a clue what to do if my kid came to me with a programming problem. Upton admits that here, too, the RPi isn&apos;t perfect, yet. &quot;At the moment, we can deliver a really satisfying educational experience in a supervised environment, say where an adult or older child who really knows about computing is looking over a young child who doesn&apos;t. The real challenge is delivering to people like you, people who aren&apos;t natural-born computer programmers who can answer every question a kid has without even thinking about it. The Pi has to work in a computer-phobic environment. I think it&apos;s doable. And it&apos;s absolutely key.&quot; The Raspberry Pi isn&apos;t perfect, but that&apos;s a decision made by its creators. As much as it can be, the RPi is open: its software is open, and so is its attitude \u2013 unlike, say the closed, smooth perfection of Apple. The RPi&apos;s creators welcome suggestions, and understand that this is a work in progress that can only be moved along by the contributions of other enthusiasts.&quot; Upton tells me to wait a few months before buying an RPi, because in that time, the foundation will overhaul the software that comes bundled with it, especially Scratch, so that it is faster and more stable. (They&apos;ve already put more RAM into the RPi, increasing it to 512MB; and recently announced that every piece of RPi software is now open source, meaning unhidden and accessible.) Also \u2013 and this seems key to me \u2013 RPi will be bringing out teaching materials. In the end, though, you can lead kids to the RPi, but you can&apos;t make them all code. And that&apos;s fine. Because some will become obsessed. One of the many, many online videos on RPi was made by George, nine, who has a blog called My Journey With Java. He made it in August and it shows him putting leads into his RPi and talking through what each one does. As he puts in the power cable, he breaks off a shiny silver part of the Pi. If George were my child, I&apos;d hand him some Blu-Tak. George just tweets the video to the Pi Foundation and they get back to him and tell him what to do."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/04/sebastian-vettel-abu-dhabi-grand-prix", "sentences": ["It was a reminder of the Singapore Grand Prix, where Hamilton had once again dominated the field only to retire with gearbox failure."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-04T15:46:11Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel fights back in Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to retain lead", "tags": ["Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One 2012", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport", "Kimi Raikkonen"], "article": "Abu Dhabi is best known for its sometimes vulgar opulence and the staggering modernity of its buildings but it was pure history and tradition that blew in on a warm desert breeze here on Sunday evening. A great race, a classic race on this most unpromising of circuits, saw the podium filled with three former world champions and it was the evocative names of Lotus and Ferrari who took the first two places on the dais. And yet, as the sand settled, it was the performance of a newer team, Red Bull, and a younger driver, Sebastian Vettel \u2013 although both team and driver are already tiresomely too familiar for the liking of their harassed rivals \u2013 that provided the major talking points. Vettel was immense. Banished to the back of the field because of a fuel irregularity after qualifying, he had the countenance of a tragedian on Saturday evening (because he is more used to champagne-splattered grins he is less practised in the art of hiding disappointment). But in an admittedly supreme car he cut a swath through the field not once but twice to finish third behind Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso. He had luck too; there can be no doubt about that. The deployment of safety cars suited his purpose well. But that is not the memory that shines through this morning. His car&apos;s relegation to the pit lane had handed his only world championship rival, Alonso, an unexpected lifeline and the Spaniard, trailing by 13 points, had to make the most of it. But in the end the Ferrari driver gained only three points on the young German, who remains the fastest and favourite. With two races remaining he leads by 10 points. Vettel, assisted by some early carnage that saw the Force India cars collide (a dark sin this, in Formula One), was soon up to 14th, even though he was suffering some wing damage after a meeting with Bruno Senna. His car was damaged again, this time more seriously, when he crashed into a marker board as he attempted to avoid the Toro Rosso of Daniel Ricciardo. This required a pit stop that meant he fell to the back once more; it also meant he faced the prospect of surviving the remaining 41 laps on his new set of soft tyres. He charged through the field again and got up to second behind Raikkonen as the cars in front of him made much later pit stops. Ultimately Vettel came in for fresh rubber a second time, which saw him drop to fourth behind Alonso and Jenson Button. But another outing for the safety car \u2013 which had already appeared after the collision between Nico Rosberg and Narain Karthikeyan \u2013 allowed Vettel to tighten up with the three cars in front, who then enjoyed a sprint to the finish. Shortly before the end Vettel swept past Button, depriving the McLaren driver of what would have been his fourth third position in succession at this venue. Red Bull&apos;s team principal, Christian Horner, said: &quot;Seb told me before the race: &apos;I&apos;ll see you on the podium.&apos; He was absolutely convinced going into the race he was going to get a great result. He drove a phenomenal race, one of the best of his life.&quot; Button said of the German: &quot;He was dead lucky. I mean, both safety cars worked for him. But he was still quick. He would have finished fourth, even without the last safety car. So it would still have been a bloody good drive. We&apos;ve seen him come through the field before. He&apos;s quick. I was surprised it took him that long to get past me. It was a good move. But it took him six or seven laps.&quot; Button&apos;s team-mate, Lewis Hamilton, added: &quot;To start from the pit lane and have to go under a tunnel, come up and then be behind people and end up third in the race is probably unheard of. Great job. That guy has definitely got something on his side. I don&apos;t have an answer but the most important thing is that Kimi did an incredible job \u2013 it was worthy of a champion.&quot; Hamilton, who won here last year, had looked set for victory after dominating the weekend. From his 25th pole position he flew out of the blocks, putting behind him not only the rest of the field but the memory of poor starts in recent races. On the second lap Hamilton, who complained about the coldness of his tyres, appeared threatened by Raikkonen. But he soon started to pull away from the rest. By the fourth lap he had got enough heat into those tyres to extend his advantage to 2.3sec and at one stage he led by almost four. He set the fastest lap on the 19th but then, in the 20th, he came to a halt because 0f a problem with his fuel pump. It was a reminder of the Singapore Grand Prix, where Hamilton had once again dominated the field only to retire with gearbox failure. After that Raikkonen took up the baton, dogged by the consistently dogged and increasingly dangerous Alonso, the worst sight in any driver&apos;s rear-view mirror. If the race had lasted for another couple of laps Alonso \u2013 who like the Canadian Royal Mountie always seems to get his man \u2013 might have prevailed. But at the end Abu Dhabi saluted third-placed Vettel, Raikkonen, the eighth winner this season, and the runner-up, Alonso, in that order."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/nov/05/social-enterprise-network-daily", "sentences": ["Social enterprise &apos;a key priority&apos; Singapore Straits Times: Partnerships with the public and private sectors can help social enterprises with mentorships, contacts and resources."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-05T10:27:06Z", "title": "Social enterprise network daily: Monday 5 November", "tags": ["Social enterprises"], "article": "Social enterprise &apos;a key priority&apos; Singapore Straits Times: Partnerships with the public and private sectors can help social enterprises with mentorships, contacts and resources.

The 32-year-old British driver, who finished fourth in Sunday&apos;s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, said: &quot;This car hasn&apos;t suited me as well as McLaren&apos;s last two. Since I&apos;ve been here this has been the worst year. It&apos;s been tricky, even on good weekends. We&apos;ve had a problem pretty much every weekend, lately. We need to stop it. I don&apos;t get it.&quot; Button has been just as frustrated as his departing team-mate Lewis Hamilton as McLaren have failed to match the performances of Red Bull \u2013 or even Ferrari, who now look likely to relegate the British team to third place in the constructors&apos; championship. Red Bull are certain to nail the team title, probably in Texas on Sunday week, while the drivers&apos; crown is a two-way fight between Red Bull&apos;s Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso of Ferrari. Last year Button was the world championship runner-up, with 270 points; in 2010, his first year with the team, he finished fifth with 214 points; this year he is sixth with 153 points \u2013 102 behind Vettel \u2013 and in the unlikely event of him winning the last two races he will finish with only 203 points. Button denied that there were issues with his DRS or Kers systems in Sunday&apos;s race. &quot;The weekend was weird. Friday was good, Saturday morning was good but qualifying and the race wasn&apos;t amazing. It wasn&apos;t horrendous but it wasn&apos;t amazing. We&apos;ve got to try a few new things with the set up. I&apos;m not happy with where it is at the moment. But hopefully next year will be perfect. &quot;Next year is exciting but we&apos;ve still got two races where we want to do well in. We still want to get Ferrari in the constructors, but it&apos;s 22 points [behind] now, which is quite big. We need some good points in the next two.&quot; Button said that McLaren had held more talks with him about next year&apos;s car since Hamilton&apos;s decision to quit the team for Mercedes. &quot;The car is quite unusual in the way that it works,&quot; he added. &quot;It works really well for Lewis, and works really well for me at times. But the consistency isn&apos;t there.&quot; But it only works well for Hamilton when it does not break down. Hamilton has often been outstanding this season but has been frustrated by pit-lane mistakes and, more recently, poor reliability. He dominated the weekend in Abu Dhabi and stormed away from his 25th pole position into a comfortable lead, only to pull out before the halfway stage because of an electrical problem, evoking memories of his gearbox failure in Singapore, when again he was running away with the race. &quot;It&apos;s twice in the last five races,&quot; he said. &quot;And the cars, apart from India, have had problems in all five. In Singapore we had the gearbox failure, at Suzuka a rear rollbar malfunction, before qualifying and in the race, and in Korea a rear rollbar failure. Then we had India, which was fine, and then here. So that&apos;s four hardcore difficult weekends.&quot; Hamilton added: &quot;I&apos;ve been on pole position seven times this year. I have only won three times. In the other ones we&apos;ve had failures and issues with pit stops and so on. If my car was as reliable as Sebastian&apos;s or Fernando&apos;s I would be right up with them now. But the team is strong and they will always bounce back.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/nov/05/kimi-raikkonen-f1-robots", "sentences": ["In Singapore the following year, when Massa and Lewis Hamilton were feuding, Smedley told his driver: &quot;Hold Hamilton as much as we can."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-05T23:00:01Z", "title": "Kimi Raikkonen deals a sportsman's blow against march of the robots | Richard Williams", "tags": ["Formula One", "Kimi Raikkonen", "Formula One 2012", "Motor sport", "Cycling", "Sport"], "article": "Notoriously a man with little to say for himself, Kimi Raikkonen certainly made his words count as he sped to victory in Sunday&apos;s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. When his race engineer came on the radio to inform him of the gap to the pursuing Ferrari of Fernando Alonso, the Finn&apos;s reply was blunt and pointed: &quot;Just leave me alone. I know what I&apos;m doing.&quot; Late in the race the same voice came through his earpiece, telling him to remember to warm up his new set of tyres. &quot;Yes, yes, yes, yes,&quot; he responded. &quot;I&apos;m doing all the tyres. You don&apos;t have to remind me every second.&quot; I loved that. It seemed a wonderfully refreshing corrective to the phenomenon, by no means confined to motor racing, of turning sportsmen and women into robots controlled by technicians sitting on the sidelines. How pitiful it looks when tennis players \u2013 step forward, Maria Sharapova and the young Andy Murray \u2013 glance up at the coaches&apos; box between every point, seeking approval or absolution, or when football managers \u2013 this means you, Rafa Ben\u00edtez and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas \u2013 hop around their technical area, trying to micromanage the positioning and movement of their players. I want competitors to go naked into the arena, and to stand or fall by their own decisions. What Formula One fan has not winced at the sound of Ferrari&apos;s Felipe Massa being given advice by his race engineer, Rob Smedley? There was the famous occasion in 2010 when Smedley delivered a controversial semi-coded instruction: &quot;Fernando [Alonso] is faster than you. Can you confirm that you understood that message?&quot; Soon Massa was pulling over to let his team leader win the German Grand Prix. In Singapore the following year, when Massa and Lewis Hamilton were feuding, Smedley told his driver: &quot;Hold Hamilton as much as we can. Destroy his race as much as we can. Come on, boy!&quot; Should a racing driver need to be told to go faster or fight harder? But then not only does modern F1 give the drivers gimmicks to help with overtaking, it tells them exactly where on the circuit such a manoeuvre is permitted. It is an employee of Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s TV production company, sitting in the mobile broadcasting centre, who monitors the chatter between the teams and their drivers. He identifies what we might like to hear and brings it to the attention of the director, who pastes it into the broadcast. So we are allowed to listen to Driver A fretting about a lack of front-end grip, or Driver B being told to put in a couple of super-quick laps while a rival is stopping for a tyre change. While making inquiries about the protocols surrounding this form of supervised eavesdropping, I made an interesting discovery. Although the teams have no control over the selection of these snippets, they do have one weapon at their disposal: when passing information they are keen to conceal from others, they ensure that an obscenity forms a prominent part of the conversation. Consistent as these intercom exchanges may be with the increasingly scientific nature of the sport, they not only diminish a sense of the drivers&apos; self-reliance but remove a precious element of uncertainty. The same is true of American football, where the quarterback and designated defensive players are allowed to wear helmets containing radio receivers, and to an even greater degree in cycling, where the UCI, in one of its more enlightened initiatives, is trying to do away with radio communication between riders and their team cars. Without their earpieces, Tour de France riders would return to the old-school reliance on blackboards carried by official motorbikes to inform them of the gap between a breakaway and the peloton. Such information is necessarily approximate and not quite up to the minute, meaning that the riders would need to make greater use of their experience and intuition. This is surely a good thing since it would reduce the chance of a day&apos;s racing turning into a game of two-wheeled chess and allow a brave lone break \u2013 one of the sport&apos;s principal attractions \u2013 a better chance of success. Ben Swift, Team Sky&apos;s gifted sprinter, had just finished this year&apos;s Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a when he gave me the pros&apos; standard objections to removing the radio links. First, he said, it would be harder for the riders to get news of hazards up ahead. Second, the necessity for the team cars to spend more time alongside the riders would constitute a danger in itself, not just to the competitors but to the spectators on the roadsides. Good arguments, but not good enough. Cycling, like grand prix racing, existed and thrived for decades without remote communications. Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s unexpected outbursts were striking a blow for the past, on behalf of the future. Alan Pardew blowing too hot and cold As the final whistle went at Anfield on Sunday, Alan Pardew&apos;s instant reaction was to make straight for the referee, Anthony Taylor, with the intention of questioning him about the dismissal of Fabricio Coloccini. Interviewed later that evening, Pardew played it down and expressed sympathy for the plight of officials in the climate created by the Clattenburg affair. The incident and its aftermath took me back to August, and an altercation during Newcastle&apos;s home victory over Tottenham, when Pardew shoved a linesman who had failed to award a throw-in to his team. On that occasion, too, he strove to make amends with a gracious apology which may have served to keep the subsequent touchline ban down to two matches, and joked ruefully about having lectured his players before the match on the importance of following the example of sporting values set by the competitors in the London Olympics, which had finished a week earlier. Pardew&apos;s work at St James&apos; Park has converted a lot of sceptics, as well as winning him an extraordinary eight-year contract. He would be even more widely admired \u2013 and save himself a lot of apologising \u2013 were he to gain control of his emotions before engaging in any future debate with match officials. richard.williams@theguardian.com twitter.com/@rwilliams1947"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/nov/06/hsbc-stay-london-decades-headquarters", "sentences": ["Given the lack of historical ties, adopting Singapore or Australia would make HSBC look like the wandering bank, which cannot be good for the reputation."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-06T09:24:25Z", "title": "HSBC will be UK-based for decades yet | Nils Pratley", "tags": ["HSBC", "Banking", "Business"], "article": "HSBC is staying in the UK \u2013 at least until 2015.

Almost certainly not. Given the lack of historical ties, adopting Singapore or Australia would make HSBC look like the wandering bank, which cannot be good for the reputation. That is how here-today-gone-tomorrow hedge funds behave, not top-tier international banks. No, it&apos;s London for several decades yet. Instead of pretending that there&apos;s a real decision to be made in 2015, Flint would do better to drop these three-yearly reviews into where to locate the HQ. The game of will-they-won&apos;t-they has lost both suspense and the power to frighten politicians."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/06/laos-southeast-asia-emerging-economy", "sentences": ["But things do not always go as smoothly as it might like: in 2011 a high-speed rail link partly funded by the China Development Bank and intended to connect Yunnan to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, via Laos, was shelved indefinitely."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-06T13:59:03Z", "title": "Laos, south-east Asia's new emerging economy", "tags": ["Laos", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Business", "Global development"], "article": "Laos has long been seen as a poor, landlocked, sparsely populated country. But it is at last emerging from its isolation. Once a part of French Indochina, ranking as the poor relation among its neighbours, it is now shaping up as a new contender in south-east Asia, with growth slated to exceed 8% this year, the highest in the region. This week the capital, Vientiane, hosted the Asia-Europe Meeting (Asem), attracting sudden international attention to this small nation of 6.5 million. So what is driving the Lao economy? A one-party socialist republic since the revolution in 1975, it has taken the same course as its two much larger neighbours, China and Vietnam, opening its market to the outside world but under strict government control. At the ninth congress of the Lao People&apos;s Revolutionary party (LPRP) in March 2011, the president, Choummaly Sayasone, spelled out the country&apos;s priorities: sustained growth of 8%, poverty reduction and improved education. These promises accompany the determination for economic reform, including floating publicly owned companies on the stock market. Given its initial handicap, the figures have been fairly encouraging. Per capita GDP in the Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic has risen from $300 in 2001 to $1,200 in 2011. The government aims to achieve average annual income of $1,700 over the next three years. The World Bank now ranks Laos among &quot;low middle-income&quot; countries, and it might achieve &quot;upper middle-income&quot; status by 2020. It is due to join the World Trade Organisation at the end of the year. The reasons behind this turnaround are clear. In addition to the travel trade, Laos has capitalised on its substantial mining, forestry and hydro resources. The Nam Theun 2 dam, built by France&apos;s EDF, may account for as much as 8% of state revenue next year. However, last year another hydroelectric scheme, on the Mekong, had to be shelved due to the hostility of countries downstream, concerned about the environmental impact. On the political front, Laos has been run by the LPRP ever since the Pathet Lao took control in 1975. Power is concentrated in the central committee, itself capped by the 11-member politburo. The government and the prime minister, Thongsing Thammavong, are tasked with implementing the decisions of the party. The main role of parliament, with its 132 deputies, is to rubber-stamp decisions taken upstream, but recently there have been signs of greater freedom of expression and more open criticism, particularly regarding corruption and poor management of public funds. Laos started experimenting with free-market economics in 1986, at the same time as the &quot;renewal&quot; policies decided by its &quot;big brother&quot; in neighbouring Vietnam. The system has evolved along similar lines to China, with no freedom of speech, zero tolerance for dissidents, and growing wealth among the party elite and military. The inherent shortcomings of such a system encourage clientelism and corruption, both of which hold back sustainable, more egalitarian development. The inadequate schools and health service exacerbate skills shortages in a country where more than a quarter of the population is illiterate. Why are China and Vietnam so interested in Laos? It seems that China has been its top foreign investor since 2010. Large areas of state-owned land have been allocated to Chinese firms, which have invested in rubber plantations and other forestry schemes, particularly in the north, now very much under Chinese influence. But with most senior party cadres still being trained in Hanoi, the regime seems anxious to balance its foreign policy to make room for Vietnam too. The Chinese, who have always competed with the Vietnamese, are now trying to use Laos as a forward base and transit route for a major communications link between south-west China and south-east Asia. But things do not always go as smoothly as it might like: in 2011 a high-speed rail link partly funded by the China Development Bank and intended to connect Yunnan to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, via Laos, was shelved indefinitely. \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/nov/06/inside-guardian-weekly-9-november", "sentences": ["Malaysia plans a green megacity across the strait from Singapore, while Laos emerges from its isolation."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-06T14:42:32Z", "title": "Inside the 9 November edition", "tags": [], "article": "America&apos;s presidential election wasn&apos;t the only change of leadership in the works this week.

Right now China&apos;s economic situation isn&apos;t very good. To fix this, the best method for China would be to open up its state-owned enterprises (SOEs), to break them down into private enterprises. If they do this then there will be a positive turn in the economy, and then they might have enough capital for actual political reform. If there&apos;s no reform, the consequences will be severe. Economic, political and social crises will all occur simultaneously and this will throw Chinese society into chaos.  Wen Yunchao, Hong Kong-based blogger known as Bei Feng     Wen Yunchao    The biggest problem isn&apos;t political reform, it&apos;s the economy. China&apos;s economic situation right now is terrible. Just look at southern China \u2013 the economy there is really bad there. They should break the monopolies of SOEs. They should also give the public a space on the internet for opinion polls. People are very unsatisfied with things, and if there are no major changes in the next few years, then public opinion, social protests, and political protests will all move beyond the government&apos;s control.  Li Bo, head of Friends of Nature, an environmental NGO in China     Li Bo    The environmental assessment of development projects should be much more open. The possible existence of risk for any project \u2013 technological and economic, or social and political \u2013 should be fully discussed before the project is implemented. Right now, according to the law, there is a process for environmental impact assessment. But the people who are in charge of executing these are only responsible to their seniors, not to the people under them. So these processes aren&apos;t very open, and their discussions aren&apos;t transparent. Because of this many projects are approved, and then their problems are only discovered afterwards. Like the recent PX incident \u2013 there&apos;s a lot of fear and rage. These things can really tear a society apart. Yan Anthea Zhang, strategic management professor, China Europe International Business School, Shanghai     Yan Anthea Zhang    The Chinese government has been encouraging indigenous innovation within the past five to 10 years \u2013 if we look at the number of patent applications, the number has gone up very quickly. But there are questions about patent quality. In China there are so many R&amp;D projects, but too much funding has been spent on fast, easy innovation projects instead of big, long-term, risky projects with great potential. Based on my research, filing a high number of patents can help a company get R&amp;D funding from the government, even if number of patents has no effect on post-intellectural property office performance. So there&apos;s a significant waste of capital, and the basic ability of Chinese companies might be overestimated.  Bo Zhiyue, senior research fellow, East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore     Bo Zhiyue    I think the first thing would be to do something about corruption in the Chinese Communist party, because it&apos;s so rampant. If they don&apos;t do anything about this, they will lose credibility very quickly. There are huge vested interests behind this corruption, and a lot of government officials and party leaders are a part of these vested interests. So they themselves are liable.If a politburo standing committee member such as Wen Jiabao is allegedly corrupt, then nobody else is immune from this problem. If committee members are also suspected of corruption \u2013 and if they don&apos;t do anything about it \u2013 there&apos;s going to be a deep crisis. Eventually the credibility deficit will become so huge that it could mean the collapse of the CCP as the ruling party. What should be the main priority for Xi Jinping?

This game, says the hype, is going to be one of the all-time great things. Right up there in the top 10, ever. Maybe just behind the multiple orgasm, but somewhere in front of both the fresh bacon sandwich and the feeling of brand new socks. This, insists the hype, is the game the world&apos;s been waiting for: the war game to end all war games. It&apos;s hype that, surely, nothing could ever possibly live up to. Least of all a mere first-person shooting game. Right? For the few remaining uninitiated, Call of Duty: Black Ops II (Xbox 360 / PS3 / Wii U / PC) is the latest instalment of the biggest franchise in town. Its predecessor, Call of Duty: Black Ops, sold more than 23m copies, and the sequel will be looking to eclipse it. For a franchise that began with three games set in the familiar history of the second world war, and made its name with the transition to modern warfare, Black Ops II, which fast-forwards the action to 2025, is a fairly radical departure from what came before. The story centres on the apocalyptic machinations of a messianic Nicaraguan super-terrorist, the mysterious Raul Menendez, and the attempts of troubled special forces badass David Mason \u2013 the son of the previous game&apos;s protagonist \u2013 to track him down, figure out his plan and stop him from unleashing his own personal brand of hell. Which, unfortunately for Mason, and very fortunately for us players, involves having to kill a few hundred people in various locations across the world, and, in flashback missions, across a sizeable chunk of the past 50 years. Plus a lot of other cool stuff besides \u2013 and not all of it violent. The second mission, for example, begins with Mason and his Navy SEAL buddy dropping from a helicopter to a jungle clifftop on a stormy night in Burma, and leaping off the cliffs in bat-like wing-suits to fly, through a series of lush ravines, to a ruined temple with a large mercenary army camped outside. That&apos;s not a cut-scene. That&apos;s how you, the player, begin the mission: flying. From there, the assault on the temple is a showcase of the futuristic setting&apos;s new tricks. Among them invisible enemies using cloaking devices disabled with EMP grenades, dog-like patrolling sentry drones, hackable heat-seeking cannons and the millimetre wave scanner, a rifle sight that shows the outline of enemies on the other side of walls. It&apos;s not just a load of new guns and gadgets either. The storytelling too has taken a bold leap forward. Where previous games were tightly plotted action blockbusters \u2013 cinematic but entirely on rails \u2013 Black Ops II offers the player choices with a real effect on future missions and the outcome of the campaign. If they&apos;d been courting the pretentious gamer demographic, they could have called it Postmodern Warfare. Choice is also at the heart of the multiplayer experience, with the new Pick 10 create-a-class system, which ditches the old primary weapon, secondary weapon, grenades and three perks system in favour of the freedom \u2013 within limits \u2013 to stock up on perks and start with just one gun, or stock up on guns and start with fewer perks. The other major change is the shift to scorestreaks instead of killstreaks, a variation on Modern Warfare 3&apos;s system. Rather than calling in air support after carefully racking up kills, players are encouraged to get stuck in with objectives and work together. Capture enough flags and you could even, in theory, unlock a helicopter without firing a single shot. And of course it&apos;s not just helicopters: the long list of unlockable rewards includes handheld mini-guns, hovering machine gun drones, stealth bombers and the ever-popular pack of angry dogs. The multiplayer maps are the usual mix of bloodbath-friendly bottle-necks and wide open sniper&apos;s playgrounds, with a couple of early stand-outs. Cargo \u2013 a Singapore dockyard complete with moving crates on cranes \u2013 ensures guaranteed non-stop action, while Express \u2013 an LA bullet train station \u2013 has a nasty surprise in store for any player daft enough to loiter on the tracks when the ground starts rumbling. Factor in a bigger-than-ever return for the beloved Zombies survival mode, full, free access to the competitive Elite network, and new levels of customisation, variety and replayability, and Black Ops II may just about be bold and badass enough to live up to that impossible hype.

John McFarlane, the new chairman, set out a radical restructuring plan in July, which includes selling off or winding down 16 underperforming businesses \u2013 almost a third of group&apos;s operations \u2013 and improving the performance of 27 others. McFarlane, a banker who headed Australia and New Zealand Banking Group for a decade, has been running Aviva since shareholders, frustrated by the group&apos;s poor share price performance, ousted chief executive Andrew Moss in May after a row over executive pay. McFarlane said the sale of the US division, which was bought just before the financial crisis erupted in 2006, would be at a &quot;substantial discount&quot; to its book value of \u00a32.4bn, and would happen &quot;reasonably soon&quot;. &quot;We would expect shareholders in general to support it,&quot; he added. The value of the US arm was already written down by \u00a3876m in August. It is expected to sell for little more than $1bn, but the sale would also free up more than \u00a31bn of capital, analysts say. Aviva is said to have received bids from Guggenheim Partners, an American privately owned financial services firm, and US private equity houses Apollo Global Management and Harbinger Capital Partners. McFarlane, who has vowed to only stay in areas &quot;where we can win,&quot; admitted that it had taken longer than expected to get the group restructuring off the ground. But Aviva said the search for a new chief executive was on track, with internal and external candidates being interviewed by Aviva&apos;s non-executive directors this week. The board expects to make an appointment early in the new year, with finance chief Pat Regan seen as a strong candidate. The US life and annuities division is one of the 16 units on the block. Aviva has also pulled out of Sri Lanka and sold down its stake in Dutch insurer Delta Lloyd. It plans to sell another eight businesses next year and take &quot;radical action&quot; in five others, such as taking capital out or winding them down. Its decision to pull out of the large-scale bulk annuity market in the UK earlier in the year is one example. Investec analyst Kevin Ryan expects the eight smaller businesses to be sold for book value. Barrie Cornes, at Panmure Gordon, said: &quot;Aviva remains a work in progress and we can understand nervousness of potential investors, but at the same time we view the valuation as compelling.&quot; Sliding sales highlighted the challenges faced by McFarlane in turning the business around. Sales at Aviva, which sells home and car insurance along with life and savings policies across Europe, dropped 5% to \u00a328.9bn in the first nine months of the year, with UK sales flat at \u00a38bn. Life and pensions sales were down 10% to \u00a318.8bn, with only Singapore and the US showing growth.

Yet in these debates disagreements were hard to find. The 2,268 delegates from across China have convened in the capital to participate in the 18th party congress, a once-in-a-decade leadership transition, which began on Thursday morning. The delegates are a diverse bunch: among them are provincial governors, generals, academics, migrant workers and an Olympic swimming medallist. Ostensibly they are responsible for selecting the country&apos;s new central leadership and screening their superiors&apos; work reports. Yet their true function \u2013 to rubber-stamp top party bosses&apos; decisions \u2013 is a stark illustration of how carefully choreographed the congress truly is and how little has been left to chance. &quot;In theory they&apos;re providing feedback \u2013 if there&apos;s anything wrong with a report they&apos;ll point it out \u2013 but usually that&apos;s not the case,&quot; said Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore. &quot;It&apos;s more of a celebration. They provide praise for the political reports.&quot; The leadership&apos;s reports were drafted and redrafted for months before being revealed at the conference, Bo said. Xi Jinping was chosen as President Hu Jintao&apos;s successor months ago. Brief interviews with delegates showed how unwilling many were to stray from the party line. &quot;We must build a moderately prosperous society according to the principles of scientific development,&quot; said Xiao Yeqing, in words taken almost directly from Hu&apos;s speech on Thursday. Li Jiayang, a delegate from the ministry of agriculture, opined that &quot;it&apos;s important for us to build a wonderful homeland by ensuring that China&apos;s wealth is fairly distributed and its growth is sustainable&quot;. Originally there were 2,270 delegates selected to attend; two died before the congress began. According to Chinese media reports, 5% of delegates are under 35, and the average age is 52. Women comprise 23%, a slight increase from the last party congress in 2007. Ethnic minorities comprise 11%. On Friday delegations held individual public discussions in rooms scattered throughout the hall. At the Tibetan delegation&apos;s discussion, the region&apos;s deputy governor, Lobsang Gyaltsen, blamed &quot;external Tibetan separatist forces and the Dalai clique&quot; for a string of recent self-immolations, according to Reuters apparently timed to coincide with the conference. The far-western Xinjiang autonomous region&apos;s delegation presented a series of turgid speeches about their development strategy. During a brief question and answer session afterwards, when a foreign reporter asked the region&apos;s party secretary, Zhang Chunxian, whether his relationship with the former president Jiang Zemin might affect his chances of promotion, the politician laughed and chided the media for reading tea leaves. Wang Yang, the party chief of Guangdong province, told reporters that government officials may soon be obliged to make full public disclosure of their assets, a sensitive issue after a string of stories in the international media alleging that senior officials&apos; families have amassed enormous wealth. Five delegates are on the Forbes rich list, with the wealthiest, Liang Wengen, chairman of the construction equipment manufacturer Sany Group, worth almost $6bn. According to the Beijing News, there are also 26 migrant worker delegates, marking the first time the 250 million-strong demographic group has been represented at a party congress. Most delegates hew to a conservative aesthetic: dyed black hair, gold-frame glasses, white shirts and red ties for the men; trouser suits for the women. Ethnic minority delegates wear tall hats and long, traditional robes. Delegates from military and police units wear their uniforms. The youngest delegate is swimmer Jiao Liuyang, 22, who won a gold medal at the London Olympics and was chosen to represent the People&apos;s Liberation Army at the congress. &quot;Before I joined the party I thought being a party member was a title, but now I feel like being a party member is more like a responsibility,&quot; she told the Beijing Times. A handful of delegates were chosen for their model worker qualities, to espouse the virtues of perseverance and loyalty. Chinese newspapers have featured interviews with Zhu Lijun, a low-level worker at a boat-riding attraction in a Beijing public park. Zhu frequently worked 16 hour days to &quot;ensure tourists&apos; safety&quot;, according to the Beijing Times. Shi Guangyin, 60, from Sidahao village, Shaanxi province, has been planting trees since 1984 as part of a government initiative to stave off desertification on China&apos;s arid northern frontier, according to the Economic Times. He was the first person to be dubbed a &quot;desert control hero&quot; by the National Forestry Bureau. &quot;The sky in Beijing is getting bluer and bluer,&quot; Shi told the newspaper. &quot;Seeing this blue sky makes the common people&apos;s hearts happy and raises their spirits.&quot; China&apos;s official newswire Xinhua painted a glowing portrait of Ren Xiaoyun, a migrant worker from Hebei province who has worked at a &quot;garbage, excrement and urine removal and transportation centre&quot; in Beijing for 16 years. One underlying theme of the congress \u2013 that the party must maintain its grip on power \u2013 echoed in delegates&apos; statements to the media. &quot;Faith and loyalty to the party is the root through which the party can grow from generation to generation,&quot; said Jiao Ruoyu, a 97-year-old delegate, according to China Daily. &quot;This spirit should be maintained whatever else changes.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/nov/11/global-learning-social-media-tips", "sentences": ["Here&apos;s a link to a school I&apos;ve worked with in Singapore that does MUN."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-11T07:41:00Z", "title": "How can schools take global learning to the next level?", "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Schools", "Education", "Primary schools", "Secondary schools", "Geography and environment studies"], "article": "For the past week, we&apos;ve been exploring global awareness in schools and sharing ideas about how our students can become internationally minded and develop as true global citizens. It&apos;s become clear over this week just how vital these skills are if our students are going to thrive as adults - and in an increasingly interconnected world there&apos;s really no excuse for students and schools to live in a bubble. As part of this series we ran a live chat so teaching professionals could come together and share best practice, new thinking and ideas. Thanks to everyone who took part. The live chat uncovered so many fantastic ideas and tips that we have pulled out the best for you here: Joe Dale, independent consultant and former languages teacher International perspectives can really make learners reflect on their own as well as others&apos; contexts particularly when schools collaborate on a more personal level. Through eTwinning and social media I have seen at first hand how fantastic friendships can blossom. Use Flickr to promote intercultural understanding by finding authentic photos taken by people on the ground and using them to create engaging lesson content. I suggest teachers search for Creative Commons licensed images which in many cases they can use freely in and out of the classroom. Showing students tweets from local residents concerning a lesson topic can bring the learning to life and promote interesting discussion. Using the SAP Twitter template for PowerPoint allows teachers to search and display live tweets. Nick Falk&apos;s and George Glass&apos; various eTwinning projects are a perfect example of how much can be achieved with a small amount of technology in challenging contexts. Schoolovision orchestrated by Michael Purves from Yester Primary School in Scotland is one of the most inspiring international projects I&apos;ve seen in recent years. Now in its fourth year, the Eurovision style competition for primary schools around Europe is taken very seriously by its participants some of whom hire professional recording studies to create their entries. Steven Mark, director of the International Primary Curriculum To my mind helping kids to get a deepening sense of &apos;others&apos; is absolutely at the heart of what good international, global learning should be about. There&apos;s a really good phrase that George Walker, the former head of international baccalaureate, came up with to describe international learning that is often seen in schools. He called it the three Fs - food, flags and festivals. Now there&apos;s nothing wrong at all with learning about food, flags, festivals, fashion or any other F you want to ad. Learning about those are a great starting point but if we&apos;re serious about helping kids and ourselves to develop an international and global mindset, then it needs to go beyond that. Good international learning is all about experiencing, learning about and from, engaging with, and learning to be at ease and comfortable with &apos;others&apos;. And my goodness does the world need a generation of young people who have those qualities. It&apos;s all about going deeper. One of my earliest encounters of &apos;deep&apos; international learning was when I moved to Netherlands in the 1990s. I initially worked in a secondary school and I remember going in one day and seeing the students all dressed up in suits and ties. I found out they were taking part in a Model United Nations. I blown away but not only how seriously the students took it but the eloquence and depth to their arguments. Definitely worth exploring for secondary students but I&apos;ve also seen it done in primary to. Here&apos;s a link to a school I&apos;ve worked with in Singapore that does MUN. It drives me nuts seeing international learning as &quot;shoe-boxes to Africa&quot;. Beyond that, we need to start from the earliest age possible to help young children begin that journey to being internationally minded and to feel compassionate, connected and curious about others. Jessie Kirk, UK volunteer programme manager at Development in Action (DiA) Social media has played an important part on global awareness and citizenship. Young people are constantly influenced by social media - just look at the Kony 2012 campaign that targeted people via Facebook. We have also found that using youth-peer educators to deliver citizenship workshops has been particularly effective. When youth peer educators can share their experiences and stories of engaging with other cultures/traditions/social contexts, it&apos;s a really good way of opening up the conversation. Also, that face to face contact can be more powerful than connecting people via social media. It can also be really useful to link up with various global dates. For example International Women&apos;s Day, Fair Trade Fortnight. Here&apos;s a calendar which I find really useful with themed teaching resources alongside. Blogging is another useful tool for older students.There are a number of really great blog sites set up especially for young people - check out www.developmentinaction.org and www.youthnet.org. Jo Sale is head of sixth form and international baccalaureate coordinator at Impington International Sixth Form I think the more our world becomes interconnected through technology, the more we have an obligation to ensure we all have an awareness that we share the world with an incredible, diverse range of people, who, in the words of the IB mission statement &quot;can also be right&quot;. Global awareness must target old ingrained prejudices and aim to remove them. On social networking - my students are staying in contact with their Ethiopian partner school via Facebook - but there are lots of practical limitations. Work to blow apart prejudices. At Impington some of our IB courses are constructed around the premise of tackling prejudices. Topics such as refugees, asylum seekers and the language of prejudice are explicitly designed to challenge students to confront their preconceived ideas. We often find that in classrooms which contain students from all over the world, this can be an occasionally explosive but often very effective means of simply talking about the prejudices we all have, usually without realising. Kateojk, participant in the live chat Working in a very small school I think it is really important to make sure pupils are aware of the wider world. Being globally aware is crucial. It is too easy for schools to think that global awareness is teaching children about a country very different to our own but sometimes it needs to be about looking at what is similar as well. From a teacher&apos;s point of view being globally aware means being able to work with teachers from anywhere in the world. I am amazed by how much I have learnt from the network of teachers I now have from the international work I have done. When I began eTwinning I thought I was OK at IT but I was wrong. Through some of the professional development courses provided by eTwinning I have been able to learn about web 2.0 and an amazing range of websites that can be used in the classroom or used as a teacher to present things in a more interesting way. I have also recognised the importance of teaching children from a very young age the importance of internet safety and their digital footprint. This has also been important for teachers in my school to recognise. The social network will not be going away so we need to both learn to use it and learn to use it safely. I have also learnt about different teaching strategies and how literacy difficulties are identified in different countries. It has led to me considering different methods of teaching and why some countries may perform better in reading and writing. Alison Leonard is a doctoral research student at the Development Education Research Centre at London&apos;s Institute of Education. She is also a geography teacher at Westminster School, London and senior lecturer at Canterbury Christ Church University It is particularly important that opportunities are created to work together as equals, whether we are talking about students in schools, or their teachers. The new British Council&apos;s Connecting Classrooms programme, which offers eLearning for teachers has developed online courses to avoid a 3Fs version of global learning/citizenship/global dimension in the curriculum. This link may be of interest to teachers who would like to develop their own depth of understanding before they bring the global awareness into their teaching. John McLaverty, Oxfam&apos;s campaigns team leader and youth and schools coordinator in London and the south east, before he joined Oxfam in 2008 he taught humanities in London secondary schools One thing I frequently find myself asking is &quot;what is the intended outcome of international linking or eTwinning?&quot; For some it can become an end in itself while I&apos;d prefer to see it as a vehicle for delivering some other agreed outcome. For example Oxfam collaborated on some incredibly powerful work where young people from schools in the UK and Bangladesh used a schools partnership to work on a project bringing the impacts of climate change in Bangladesh to the attention on UK decision makers. The International Citizens Service is beginning to have a significant impact. I tend to be a little sceptical about gap year volunteering but some good organisations are signed up as providers and young people returning from placements have highly positive feedback. Yet large numbers of sixth formers aren&apos;t yet aware of the opportunity. Working younger students best begins with exploring issues like justice and fairness within the child&apos;s own surroundings and environment, and then moving out towards the global as the child grows older. I also remember reading that young children will tend to identify difference over similarity as part of their cognitive processes. Sp ejrm presenting different cultures and environments, it&apos;s important to look for similarity. The common experience of going to school and the importance of school in childrens lives, for example, can be explored in the Send My Friend campaign which is very popular with primary schools. Oxfam&apos;s Guide to Global Citizenship attempts to outline a progressive series of outcomes for children as they progress through the key stages. Lisibo, live chat participant  Using technology in partnerships can be tricky when one side has it and the other doesn&apos;t but it&apos;s not insurmountable. For example, in the Comenius Region project I took part in, we had Skype but the partner school couldn&apos;t make it work. However, when I visited Els Pins with colleagues, we Skyped back from my laptop to school and the pupils were able to speak and see one another. It was great to see the confidence on both sides grow as children who started the call reluctant to speak wanted to get involved after five or ten minutes and were queuing up to get closer to the webcam! The experience at Whitehouse Common Primary was that our international links had an effect on everyone from nursery to year 6, among staff, parents and the wider community. Specifically, the younger learners found that they wanted to talk about their heritages more readily than before, wanted to share their home language and recognised that differences were interesting and worth exploring. They were fascinated by photos of our partner school as well as the pupils. Here are a couple of posts about our project - Bar\u00e7a! bar\u00e7a! Baaaar\u00e7a! and Challenging perceptions and stereotypes. iPads add a new dimension to using technology in eTwinning thanks to the fact it&apos;s a single device that can do the work that used to be one by several pieces of technology.

By 2015 the explosion in jobs in Hong Kong will have pushed the Square Mile into third place on a league table of international financial centres, says the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR). The CEBR also had more immediate bad news for London&apos;s bankers, suggesting combined City bonus pools are likely to slip to \u00a34.4bn this year, down from \u00a36.75bn for 2011 and \u00a311.56bn in 2008. Such will be the rise in finance job numbers in the far east that London is expected to only narrowly employ more financial workers than Singapore, the region&apos;s number two financial centre, in three years&apos; time, the CEBR predicts. Its chief executive Douglas McWilliams painted a dire picture of the consequences for the wider UK economy, insisting that &quot;the biggest loser from this is the taxman&quot;. He said: &quot;Taking into account the loss of income from a much smaller City, from lower corporation tax, stamp duty and other city based taxes, I estimate that government revenues from the City in the current financial year are likely to be about \u00a340bn compared with the \u00a370bn which it received in 2007/08 at the peak of the cycle.&quot; The government faces a difficult balancing act as it seeks to defend London&apos;s place as a leading financial centre, and major tax revenue contributor, while at the same time navigating a passage to a more balanced economy. In March George Osborne vowed in his budget speech that a raft of transformative pro-business tax breaks would create a country that would be &quot;carried aloft by the march of the makers&quot;. Under the logic of that transformation, Britain&apos;s current account will gain credit because it will manufacture more things that are consumed abroad, rather than relying on expenditure by indebted UK households for economic growth. But such a manufacturing driven change has proved more difficult to conjure in the face of sustained, subdued global growth \u2013 particularly for Britain&apos;s main export partners the US and Europe. The latest predictions from the CEBR follow its forecasts last week that City job numbers will fall to 237,036 next year, their lowest level since 1993. The number of people employed in the financial sector in London, excluding most accountants and lawyers, has sunk below 250,000 this year, 11% down from last year. At its peak the City employed more than 350,000 people before the financial crisis struck."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/water-transfers-shortage", "sentences": ["Singapore, which has few water resources of its own, has long relied on Malaysia for its water; it currently draws nearly 40% of supply from its neighbour and pays very little for the privilege.", "Yet while Singapore benefits from access to cheap Malaysian water, its dependency is also a weakness that Malaysia exploits for political leverage.", "To escape Malaysia&apos;s influence, Singapore has committed to weaning itself off foreign water, opening wastewater and desalination plants to ensure domestic supply.", "Singapore isn&apos;t alone: even as some companies and countries employ water transfers to mitigate against shortages, others focus on conserving water within their own districts."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-12T11:00:00Z", "title": "No rain? Share your neighbour's water", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business"], "article": "Last April, its reserves depleted by Britain&apos;s worst drought in nearly 40 years, Anglian Water was hoping for rain. Summer lay ahead, and, beyond that, the threat of an unprecedented third dry winter in a row. If that were to happen, it would put a real strain on Anglian&apos;s ability to meet the needs of its customers. The company \u2013 which services 27,000km\u00b2 in southeast England \u2013 had banned the use of hosepipes, but with no rain in sight, cutting usage wasn&apos;t going to bridge the shortfall. There was no way around it: Anglian would need more water to ride out a drought stretching into 2013. To Anglian&apos;s west lies Severn Trent Water, whose district had not been nearly so afflicted. The two companies began negotiations on the transfer of water from one region to another. Their proposal would have seen navigation canals and the River Trent used to transfer enough water from Birmingham, in Severn Trent&apos;s area, to the Humber Bank, in Anglian&apos;s, to supply 100,000 homes. Heavy rains arrived before the scheme was enacted, and now, says Mike Cook, Anglian&apos;s Head of Water Resources, the company&apos;s reserves are recharged. But while it won&apos;t have to buy water from its neighbours this year, the negotiations have prepared Anglian for dry spells in years to come. &quot;The transfer that we developed could be used in the future, if necessary,&quot; says Cook. &quot;It&apos;s important that we be ready for the next drought.&quot; Small-scale water transfers have been occurring for decades in the UK. But as population growth intensifies demand for water and climate change threatens to disrupt supply, companies are starting to think beyond local, ad hoc transactions. Last spring&apos;s drought left England&apos;s water purveyors contemplating more frequent and formal trading arrangements to ensure their districts never dry up. A nationwide trading network may arrive next year as the UK Government has mandated that water companies submit a long-term plan for managing the country&apos;s resources by March 2013. While measures for reducing consumption, such as repairing leaky infrastructure, will factor into the plan, water swaps may well be central. &quot;The idea is to identify surplus within the system,&quot; says Luke DeVial, head of environment and resources at Wessex Water. &quot;Then all companies can enter detailed negotiations and consider trading options.&quot; A global water phenomenon England isn&apos;t alone in pursuing transfers as a path to water security. California has conveyed water from the Sierra Nevada Mountains to Los Angeles via aqueduct since 1913. Libya&apos;s Great Manmade River, the world&apos;s largest underground network of pipes and ducts, moves 6.5 million cubic meters per day from an ancient aquifer beneath the Sahara Desert \u2013 enough water that one of the world&apos;s driest countries aspires to export crops. And even Libya&apos;s system is dwarfed by China&apos;s ongoing South-North water diversionproject, channels that would transfer 23 trillion litres a year from the Yangtze and Han Rivers to Beijing and Tianjin. These hubristic undertakings, however, have traditionally led to steep environmental costs. China&apos;s project has relocated hundreds of thousands of people, and the Han River may eventually be bled dry by canals. Diversions to cities in the southwestern US have reduced the Colorado River at its delta to a swampy trickle. Water transfers in Australia&apos;s Snowy Mountains have choked rivers with silt, spreading invasive species and destroying fish populations. Despite this dismaying record, England&apos;s water companies believe they can promote ecological health rather than wreak havoc by using transfers to comply with the Restoring sustainable abstraction programme, an Environment Agency initiative to reserve water for aquatic environments. Wessex Water, for example, agreed to reduce abstraction by seven megalitres from the Chitterne Brook, an unusual chalk stream that hosts juvenile trout. The company plans to compensate for the lost abstraction by linking places in its water-abundant south, like Dorchester and Shaftesbury, to Salisbury and other points further upstream by 2018. Climate change, which portends severe summertime drought and variable rainfall, also motivates companies to pursue transfers. In 2010 United Utilities completed its West East End Link, a 55km-long pipeline that connects Manchester and the Lakes District so that water can move between regions when one goes dry: &quot;The pipeline&apos;s true test will come as climate change kicks in,&quot; says Richard Blackwell, United&apos;s supply and demand manager. &quot;The link will be playing an important role in 100 years.&quot; Moving water between regions, however, is not without difficulty. Even plans that use existing canals require new infrastructure \u2013 pumping stations to lift water over locks, new treatment facilities to process increased volume \u2013 which could impede cost-effectiveness. Companies may be able to defray these energy expenses by diverting their water through hydropower installations. According to Roger Falconer, Professor of Water Management at Cardiff University, England should look beyond its own borders to alleviate scarcity. Citing a 2010 report by engineer John Lawson, Falconer advocates flowing water from the River Severn to the Thames and enlarging Wales&apos; Craig Goch Reservoir in order to import water via the River Wye. Says Falconer: &quot;In principle, we could enact this plan right now, using existing rivers and canals.&quot; Beware the profiteering water-sellers And while some Welsh environmental groups object to the export of their water, other people see it as a path to prosperity. John Jones, a former executive at Welsh Water, told the BBC last April that Wales&apos; best use of their abundant H\u00b2O might be to treat it like oil \u2013 and sell it, at a tidy profit, to their English neighbours. If the UK needs a guide to the promise and peril of international agreements, it should look to Southeast Asia. Singapore, which has few water resources of its own, has long relied on Malaysia for its water; it currently draws nearly 40% of supply from its neighbour and pays very little for the privilege. Yet while Singapore benefits from access to cheap Malaysian water, its dependency is also a weakness that Malaysia exploits for political leverage. To escape Malaysia&apos;s influence, Singapore has committed to weaning itself off foreign water, opening wastewater and desalination plants to ensure domestic supply. Singapore isn&apos;t alone: even as some companies and countries employ water transfers to mitigate against shortages, others focus on conserving water within their own districts. Methods to capture stormwater, such as aquifer storage and recovery, are gaining primacy across the world, and greywater recycling will soon be standard practice in dry regions. And that&apos;s just the supply side. England&apos;s water companies are adamant that demand-side measures will be integral pieces in the country&apos;s forthcoming water plan. Yet in a world increasingly dominated by climate change, they still see transfers as vital insurance, a means of staying flexible and resilient when rains vanish. &quot;We can push and push on the demand side to reduce leakage and consumption&quot;, says Anglian&apos;s Cook. &quot;But climate change will make it harder to recharge groundwater, and we&apos;re going to need to pursue some bigger interconnections.&quot; Ben Goldfarb is a master&apos;s student at Yale University and the editor of Sage Magazine.

He understands the solitary nature of elite sport better than most professional athletes, and describes its impact with layered elegance, but even Thorpe was jolted by the isolation he felt as he prepared to swim competitively again in Singapore last November. After four years in retirement, his five Olympic gold medals and famous old Thorpedo racing persona meant nothing as he climbed on the blocks. &quot;I&apos;ve never felt more alone than in that moment,&quot; Thorpe says simply. &quot;The water is normally my space \u2013 because I get quite territorial. But I realised that, despite all my training, I was about to put myself back out there as a competitor. I was surrounded by people but I still had this intense loneliness. Sport can sometimes isolate you and I&apos;ve come to realise through all the travelling and all the hotel rooms that there is this recurring Lost In Translation moment.&quot; It&apos;s typical of Thorpe, and an example of why he is so interesting to interview, that he should refer to Sofia Coppola&apos;s film amid his explanation of a difficult sporting comeback. In Lost in Translation, Bill Murray plays the part of a fading actor who suddenly confronts his acute loneliness and alienation in a Tokyo hotel. Thorpe, however, has ended up in far darker and more frightening places. The 30-year-old&apos;s attempt to swim for Australia at this summer&apos;s London Olympics ended in disappointment. Yet set against his depression, which he has revealed for the first time in his stark but powerful new book, Thorpe&apos;s return assumes fresh meaning. &quot;In terms of making the Olympics it was a complete failure,&quot; Thorpe concedes, as he reflects on his non-selection, &quot;but I&apos;ve rediscovered what I loved about my sport when I walked away from it, loathing it. I find such beauty in the repetition of training \u2013 in its rhythms and rituals. I had lost that. But, even if I prefer training to racing, part of me wants performance. It&apos;s less about winning than turning in a performance that matches my preparation.&quot; Such purity ensured that Thorpe resumed training as soon as his stint as a BBC commentator at London 2012 ended in August. He plans to swim at next year&apos;s world championships in Barcelona and at Glasgow&apos;s 2014 Commonwealth Games \u2013 while possibly continuing two years beyond that at one last Olympic Games in Rio. Following the return of a former great sportsman is always poignant but, with Thorpe, there is a sense that swimming also provides a refuge from depression. &quot;There are some mornings when, if I didn&apos;t have the routine of training, I would struggle to get out of bed. But, when you get to training, all of a sudden things seem a little better. Of course racing can bring about increased pressure. But when I&apos;m racing I usually manage my depression and anxiety really well. The pulse of anxiety is appropriate then. It&apos;s just more troubling on ordinary days.&quot; Thorpe thinks carefully before he answers most questions. And his pause is especially considered when asked to describe his worst days of depression. He eventually offers a telling account which uncovers the extent to which depression can be physically, as well as well as psychologically, debilitating. &quot;It&apos;s like a weight is pressing down on you. There are days when you just can&apos;t get out of bed. You cannot face the world. You tell yourself simple things like: &apos;Just get to the kitchen and get a glass of water.&apos; But not being able to do something so basic is frightening. &quot;There were lots of times where I just could not bear to leave the house. You actually scour the cupboards for food. You become quite resourceful with what&apos;s left. And if there&apos;s nothing in the cupboards you just don&apos;t eat. Sometimes this feeling lasts just days. Other times it can be weeks. But you learn to identify the triggers. You can start to minimise the length of your depression. &quot;I realise now when I start to withdraw from doing things with my friends that I need to force myself. My doctors say [Thorpe emits a dry laugh]: &apos;Fake it till you make it.&apos; So even if I don&apos;t feel like going out with my friends I know I need to. It&apos;s tough but, once you&apos;ve forced yourself, it doesn&apos;t seem so bad and you can minimise the low.&quot; Courage is needed to address such problems and Thorpe, who is an intensely private man, makes it seem as if &quot;the cancer of attention&quot; had contributed to his depression. So how was he finally able to voice a secret he had harboured so long? &quot;It helped knowing doctors don&apos;t talk. It&apos;s also realising you need help. I still don&apos;t understand it entirely but being able to share it has helped because part of being depressed is being completely irrational. It&apos;s important to apply some rational thought. &quot;I think depression is genetic and I probably would&apos;ve dealt with it whether I was famous or not. But people sometimes don&apos;t think you have a right to feel like this because you&apos;ve been famous or successful. It just doesn&apos;t work like that. You can be a really great athlete and have all the attributes of mental toughness but, in real life, it doesn&apos;t work. I was really tough when I raced but I couldn&apos;t hold the rest of my life together.&quot; Thorpe had been a world champion at 15, and won three gold medals at his home Olympics in Sydney in 2000. Yet a year later, and only 19, his illness had become so &quot;crushing&quot; Thorpe needed clandestine psychiatric help. He still could not bring himself to tell his friends or family and the unbearable weight continued to bear down on him. He finally contemplated suicide. &quot;It made me understand I needed to see someone more frequently and to get medication that worked. I feel I&apos;m on to the other side of it now. I&apos;ve got a handle on it but I would never say I&apos;m in control of it because I know how quickly it can change. But I&apos;m in a place where, for the first time, I&apos;m comfortable talking about depression.&quot; Does Thorpe believe that discussing his illness will diminish its hold on him? &quot;I&apos;m not sure. I assume it&apos;s better I&apos;m not bottling it up. But it also means I&apos;ve exposed myself.&quot; It&apos;s hard to shake the assumption that Thorpe&apos;s demons have been deepened by media hounding and speculation about his sexuality. In one telling anecdote he writes of how the mother of Grant Hackett, another famous Australian swimmer, spoke of her sadness when she saw how he walked with his head lowered in public. Thorpe, in contrast, felt a burst of empathy with Hackett. &quot;You feel you have to hide yourself,&quot; Thorpe says. &quot;I don&apos;t want people to feel sorry for me but that&apos;s what fame is. Sometimes it&apos;s incredibly difficult to deal with and sometimes it&apos;s great. It&apos;s just not simple.&quot; Thorpe was friends with Heath Ledger, the gifted Australian actor, and his partner, the actress Michelle Williams. A few years after his success in Brokeback Mountain, Ledger died after an accidental overdose. Just like Thorpe, he had struggled with depression and an intrusive Australian media. &quot;We had some interesting discussions around fame,&quot; Thorpe says. &quot;What fame is and how we felt about it. But the last time I saw Heath we spoke of the summer we&apos;d all just had as &apos;the happy summer&apos;. It seemed as if everything was great for all of us. But things changed very quickly for him.&quot; Was Ledger aware of the pressure Thorpe also faced? &quot;Of course,&quot; Thorpe chides gently. &quot;He liked sport and he was from Australia, so come on!&quot; Innuendos about Thorpe&apos;s sexuality began when he was a boy \u2013 and he remembers first being asked if he was gay in an interview when he was only 15. Thorpe insists in his book that, &quot;for the record, I am not gay and all my sexual experiences have been straight&quot;. He argues that his interests in fashion and art and &quot;beautiful things&quot; have led to mistaken assumptions about him. His sexuality really doesn&apos;t matter but he then makes a sad aside: &quot;The truth is I&apos;ve spent most of my adult life trying to avoid relationships \u2026 if people get too close to me I often end up pushing them away.&quot; But Thorpe provides a cautionary suggestion which can be applied to his private life. &quot;The world is a lovely shade of grey and there needs to be more balance in the way lives are described. I know people need certain results to stay in their job so things get exaggerated in the media. It often seems as if there is not much else besides success and misery. I think what happens is that people in my position don&apos;t give out all the information because there is not enough trust. They don&apos;t want it to be sensationalised. &quot;I look at athletes and I see what they have to offer but they never reveal it in public. I see textbook media answers where I am just frightened by how boring it is. But they&apos;re scared to show themselves. We need to get back some trust between the media and athletes.&quot; Australia&apos;s media can be hysterical in its treatment of sporting failure. Thorpe raises an eyebrow when I read to him some reports from the London Olympics which described James Magnussen&apos;s silver in the 100m freestyle as &quot;the biggest Australian flop since Crocodile Dundee 3&quot; and the failure of him and his team-mates to win a medal in the relay as &quot;the biggest defeat since Gallipoli&quot;. Thorpe shrugs: &quot;We should not be talking about sport in this way. But he had talked his prospects up a lot and when you do that you have to deliver. If he had won we would&apos;ve accepted that this is the way he talks \u2013 like an American track-and-field sprinter. But because he didn&apos;t swim very well he invited that upon himself. Of course it&apos;s still exaggerated because we&apos;re talking about sport and not war.&quot; Thorpe is different to most sportsmen and yet, for all his refined interests and sometimes fragile personality, he retains a hard competitive edge. &quot;A driven part of me loves elite performance and I may be able to capture that again. I want to swim as well as I used to and if I do that it would mean winning medals again. If I get to a point in training where I don&apos;t think that&apos;s achievable I&apos;ll have to rethink everything. In 2016, at the Rio Olympics, I&apos;ll be 33. It&apos;s completely feasible I could swim there. But I&apos;m taking it step by step. We have trials for the 2013 world championships in April. That&apos;s my next big goal. &quot;Before the London trials I did times in training I&apos;d never done but I need consistency. So that&apos;s why big blocks of training are important. I just want to get back in the pool and train hard and that eagerness makes me realise how much I want it. It&apos;s helping me as a person and who knows where I&apos;ll end up as a swimmer. I&apos;m excited to find out \u2013 and that&apos;s not something I could have said a few years ago.&quot; Ian Thorpe&apos;s autobiography, This Is Me (Simon &amp; Schuster), is available from the Guardian Bookshop, priced at \u00a316 (RRP \u00a320)."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/12/premier-league-tv-rights-5-bn", "sentences": ["Deals have already been concluded in the US and South America, South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, China, Singapore and Scandinavia."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-12T18:59:35Z", "title": "Premier League TV rights set to top \u00a35bn for first time", "tags": ["Premier League", "Sport TV", "Football", "Sport", "Sports rights", "Media", "Sky plc", "Premier League 2012-13"], "article": "Premier League clubs are in line for a huge hike in television income from next season, with revenue from domestic and global TV rights deals on course to top \u00a35bn by the time the final overseas contracts are tied up next month.

Premier League clubs will be updated on the latest deals to be signed at a meeting this week, when they will also discuss proposals to try to introduce a domestic version of Uefa&apos;s Financial Fair Play policy or other cost-control measures such as a restriction on wage growth. The hike in income will be cheered by clubs trying to balance their budgets to comply with Uefa&apos;s Financial Fair Play rules and looking to exploit their commercial potential around the world, but will also increase fears that it will simply be passed on to players in the form of increased wages. The existing TV deals, which run to the end of this season, themselves marked a huge increase in overseas income from \u00a3650m for the previous three years to around \u00a31.4bn for 2010 to 2013. In total the current deals are worth around \u00a33.5bn, meaning that the Premier League clubs are on course to collectively achieve an uplift of more than \u00a3500m a year. Overseas income is shared out on an equal basis between all 20 clubs, while income from domestic rights is allocated according to a sliding scale based on league position and the number of appearances on TV. Just as the exponential rise in domestic income has been driven by competition between Sky and various challengers over the past 20 years, so the same process is starting to play out across the world. In the US, NBC outbid the incumbents Fox and ESPN and will pay around $250m (\u00a3157m) over three seasons, triple the existing contract, and show more matches on its national network. Manchester United&apos;s vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, recently said that the US represented the number one growth target for the club, because a number of factors had coalesced to make it ready to take off. In Brazil, rights have been stripped out for the first time from a pan-continental deal and sold to Fox and ESPN for $50m, more than four times what the rights were believed to be worth as part of the previous South American deal. In China, in contrast, the focus has been on expanding reach rather than maximising revenue. A six-year contract was last week signed with the agency SuperSports Media to sub-licence matches to regional and IPTV broadcasters across the country. It goes beyond a traditional rights deal and also includes a joint marketing agreement to promote clubs in the country. Deals have already been concluded in the US and South America, South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, China, Singapore and Scandinavia. Deals for Asia and Australasia and the Middle East and north Africa are expected to be wrapped up within the next fortnight. Increases in income from the middle east, in particular, are expected to be driven by competition between al-Jazeera and its rivals. The rest of Europe, excluding Scandinavia, is expected to be concluded by Christmas. It had been speculated in the wake of the partial victory of a Portsmouth landlady in the European courts that the rights could be sold as a single pan-European deal to avoid the prospect of rival broadcasters undercutting one another. But instead the Premier League will continue to sell its rights on a territory by territory basis and limit the number of 3pm kick-offs on offer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/nov/13/coproduction-public-services", "sentences": ["The prime minister of Singapore has made it clear in the last six months that the future of Singapore public services will rely on a co-production model."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-13T09:21:35Z", "title": "International focus: public service co-production around the world", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Local government network blog", "Local government", "Public services policy", "Local government"], "article": "&quot;They keep going to the wrong place to get what they need. Why don&apos;t they just do as they are supposed to? They need educating to use our services better.&quot; How many times have you made, or heard your local government colleagues make, these kinds of comments? It&apos;s time for us stand back and ask, why is our service not meeting the needs of our customers, and how can they educate us to get it right? Many public services providers and policy makers are already doing this, with councils starting to roll out personal budgets in services such as social care and and community budgets for local projects. Across the world, local policy makers are turning to co-production of services with users and residents. They see it as a way to be more efficient and more effective, improving the customer experience and utility derived from using public services. Experiments in formal co-production have already started from Denmark to Malaysia, and here in the UK. The prime minister of Singapore has made it clear in the last six months that the future of Singapore public services will rely on a co-production model. Government departments and local services are now been shaped to involve the citizen in service design and delivery. Back in the UK, Sheffield was the first major city in 2009 to have a system of &quot;community justice panels&quot;, where members of the community come together and work out a system of local justice that is seen to repay both the community and the help to support rehabilitation of the wrongdoer. In the US, by using smart technology, highway repairs and maintenance has been improved and targeted to where road users can pinpoint problems. Boston&apos;s local commuters said it would be better to be able to deliver &quot;real time&quot; data to highways officials, rather than have to have to phone in and ask for an inspection of a bad road. Now drivers can have attached a monitor to their car and after experiencing a bad dip or bump in the road an automatic report is sent to the highways officials. The severity of the dip is ranked to target the next day&apos;s road repairs. This cuts down on inspection, cost and shows a co-production of road maintenance. In Holland, the matter of life and death has become a co-production topic. Most people know where the nearest cash point to their home is located \u2013 but what about the nearest defibrilator for heart attack victims? Dutch citizens can use a smart phone to photograph and record, using GPS data, the location of a defibrilator. This information is then uploaded onto an app for each town. In an emergency, you can find the nearest machine and use it until paramedics arrive. The challenge for local government in the UK is to ask how we move the principles of direct payments and personal budgets into other services so citizens and consumers of that service feel motivated to plan, produce and provide services with us. Not just co-consultation, but real co-production of public services.

Photograph: Graeme Robertson    Every time a London Tory calls for new laws to restrict strikes on the Tube, I wonder why London Tories don&apos;t behave like Tories. ASLEF&apos;s decision to ballot members on strike action in a dispute with London Underground over Boxing Day pay has prompted the London Assembly&apos;s Richard Tracey to issue a demand for new anti-strike laws that has become as seasonal as Boxing Day withdrawals of labour themselves - both have occurred for the past two years.  But although Tube strikes are a maddening drag, the harm they do to London&apos;s economy is tiny compared with a problem London&apos;s Tories seem far less keen to solve - the huge cost to business and quality of life of road traffic congestion. The merest murmur that the capital would be improved by having more road pricing rather than less has the blue side of City Hall growling in defence of the freedoms of motorists, unconcerned or unaware that free market logic argues the opposite approach.  One of the deeper ironies of mayoral politics is that Ken Livingstone was far more receptive to such thinking than Boris Johnson has been. When introducing London&apos;s congestion charge &quot;Red Ken&quot; named, with a certain glee, Chicago School guru Milton Friedman as his inspiration.  These days, prominent London Tories cite Harvard professor Edward Glaeser as a guiding Big Brain. The mayor has even pinched a line from Glaeser&apos;s book Triumph of the City about Gandhi, villages and the future and used it in speeches. Yet the professor has long favoured market forces regulating the problem of over-use of the scarce resource that is road space.  In 2006 he called for the introduction of congestion charging in New York:  There are only two ways to make real headway against congestion in Manhattan: build more streets or get fewer people to drive. Knocking down high-rises to expand Third Avenue seems pretty stupid, so to fix congestion we have to reduce the amount of driving. There is plenty of scope for improving public transportation, but the most reliable means of reducing traffic is to charge people for the social costs of their driving. When anyone drives in a crowded street, they create an externality: one person&apos;s driving slows down everybody else.  The best way to handle this externality is to charge drivers a congestion charge that reflects the social costs of the congestion they create. New York should follow London and charge drivers for driving in the city during peak hours.  It never happened and, as Glaeser acknowledges these days, the politics of changing this have got harder. Even so he still maintains that:  The sensible approach is to follow the lead of London and Singapore and charge drivers for the costs of traffic congestion.  Less traffic congestion means less cost to London business from having people sitting in traffic jams. It can boost a city&apos;s income too. Cautious estimates suggest London could gain a billion a year from an extended, more sophisticated charging system.  On Sunday Johnson&apos;s highly-respected transport adviser Isabel Dedring, defending the latest fares hikes and the suddenly-doubled price of hiring a &quot;Boris bike,&quot; gamely explained to the London section of the Sunday Politics that all such decisions have to be taken with a view to the need to deliver promised investment.  Fair enough. So wouldn&apos;t an extra billion a year would come in handy in these straitened times, not least in mitigating the \u00a355m a year Transport for London no longer receives thanks to Johnson halving Livingstone&apos;s charging area? Yet Livingstone himself ruled out restoring the WEZ during the election campaign. Only the Greens spoke up for it. Unless and until the issue returns to the agenda, London transport policy is likely to remain a snarl-up zone."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/14/oldest-player-england-the-knowledge", "sentences": ["Over in Singapore, the naturalised striker Aleksandar Duric is still representing his country at the age of 42 \u2013 he played 90 minutes in a friendly against India last month which Singapore won 2-0."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-14T08:30:05Z", "title": "Who is the oldest player to have been capped by England? | The Knowledge", "tags": ["England", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "&quot;After Leon Osman&apos;s call-up I was wondering who is the oldest player to receive an England (excluding goalkeepers)?&quot; asks Tom Curtis. At 31 Osman may yet have a long and illustrious England career ahead of him, Tom, since England&apos;s oldest ever player was the 42-and-a-bit-year-old Stanley Matthews, when he played against Denmark in May 1957. It was his last game for the international side after 23 years and 54 caps and he is still England&apos;s oldest goalscorer thanks to his strike against Northern Ireland in October 1956, at 41 years and 248 days. A few years earlier, in the summer of 1954, Matthews went into the record books as the oldest outfield player to represent England at the World Cup finals, though Tom Finney is England&apos;s oldest scorer in the tournament having found the USSR net at 36 years and 64 days in 1958. The records are not quite so daunting in the European Championships, with Stuart Pearce the oldest player to represent England at 34 in that game against Germany in 1996. Southampton&apos;s Dave Watson became the nation&apos;s oldest Euros scorer against Bulgaria in November 1979, when he had not long turned 33. For the record Osman is nowhere near England&apos;s oldest outfield debutant, with Leslie Compton making his first England appearance at 38, when England beat Wales in November 1950. The oldest debutant ever was Alec Morten, as we explained in a previous Knowledge that we&apos;re too lazy even to copy and paste. Don&apos;t be fooled into thinking those days are gone, though. In September 2010 David Weir played for Scotland against Lithuania at 40 (pipping Jim Leighton&apos;s record by 38 days) and in November that year Jari Litmanen became Finland&apos;s oldest goalscorer at 39, with a penalty against San Marino (they all count). Over in Singapore, the naturalised striker Aleksandar Duric is still representing his country at the age of 42 \u2013 he played 90 minutes in a friendly against India last month which Singapore won 2-0. NOT SO MELLOW YELLOW &quot;In two recent games in the Eredivisie (SC Heerenveen v NAC and Heracles Almelo v ADO Den Haag, for those of you taking notes) eight yellow cards were given in a single game without any player being sent off (either by a second yellow or a straight red),&quot; wrote Willem van Schaik last week. &quot;That made me wonder about the following question: what is the highest number of yellow cards in a game without any player receiving a red card?&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know about the highest number,&quot; says Christina Fieger, modestly, &quot;but I can top Willem&apos;s eight cards. Last weekend, on 9 November, Mainz beat N\u00fcrnberg 2-1 in the German Bundesliga. Ten players received a yellow card (including one on the bench!), but nobody had to leave the field early.&quot; Indeed, according to our very own Bundesliga correspondent Raf Honigstein, N\u00fcrnberg midfielder Hanno Balitsch was actually in the process of being subbed when he was booked for dissent, so perhaps he left the field too late. There seems to be a tipping point at which a game with several yellows inevitably involves a red, which is probably why in September 2010, Fulham 2-1 Wolves (eight other yellows) ended with Christophe Berra being sent off. A couple of weeks earlier, though, Wolves had played Newcastle in a game that ended 1-1 and with 12 names in referee Stuart Attwell&apos;s book. James Perch, Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton, Andy Carroll and Shola Ameobi were cautioned for Newcastle, while Wolves had Jelle van Damme, Karl Henry, Matt Jarvis, Kevin Doyle, Ronald Zubar, Ade Guedioura and Berra booked. &quot;I don&apos;t see us as some dirty, over-physical team,&quot; said Mick McCarthy, earnestly. That is the record as far as we have been able to find, though in 1999 Everton found themselves in hot water with the FA having notched up more than 100 cards in the season, which is probably worth a mention. The worst offenders were Marco Materazzi and Olivier Dacourt, who were both booked during Leicester&apos;s 2-0 win over Everton in August 1998, a game that saw nine players cautioned in total. Everton were also involved when Arsenal went through a particularly dirty phase in the 1996-97 season. Four players on each side were booked when the two met at Goodison Park in March 1997, though the Gunners improved on that the following month, when a 1-1 home draw with Blackburn involved nine bookings. We also recall a game between Manchester United and Chelsea in 2008, in which seven United players were booked (landing them a \u00a325,000 fine). &quot;I did not think there was one bad tackle in it,&quot; said Sir Alex Ferguson, though he might have made an exception for the foul by Mikel on Cristiano Ronaldo, which took the tally to eight yellow cards in total. A TALE OF FIVE CITIES &quot;Former Serbian midfielder Vladimir Jugovic played for, among other clubs, Red Star Belgrade, Sampdoria, Juventus, Lazio and Inter,&quot; so says Bogdan Kotarlic. &quot;It enabled him to participate in no fewer than five derby matches where the teams from the same city were involved (Red Star-Partizan, Sampdoria-Genoa, Juventus-Torino, Lazio-Roma and Inter-Milan). Has any other football player taken part in more derby matches than Jugovic?&quot; The popular pub quiz answer is that German hair model Christian Ziege also played five derbies, appearing for Liverpool against Everton, Milan against Inter, Bayern Munich against TSV 1860, Tottenham against Arsenal and Middlesbrough against Newcastle and Sunderland. We have also read somewhere that Ray Wilkins played in five back when he was still referring to himself as a fine young man: west London, Manchester, Milan, Glasgow and finally Edinburgh, after coming off the bench for Hibs a few days before moving to Millwall. But two players have gone one better: Richard Gough has six derbies to his name, including Dundee, north London, Glasgow, Forest v Derby, the Merseyside set-to and San Jose Clash versus LA Galaxy (even if that last one involves a 300-mile trip). &quot;It&apos;s like watching Big Brother,&quot; Gough said of the Old Firm matches in March 2011. &quot;The product is not great at the minute but you know there is going to be an accident happening.&quot; The other is Paul Stewart, who notched up appearances in matches between Spurs and Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton, Crystal Palace and Millwall, Wolves and West Brom, Sunderland and Newcastle and then Stoke v Port Vale. Contrary to popular opinion, he never played for Manchester City against Manchester United. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;What is the shortest time a player has been on the pitch and still been named man of the match?&quot; wondered Graeme Kennedy in 2008. Unlike the names of goalscorers, substitutes or even players earning yellow and red cards, official men of the match are difficult to record, mainly because there is often nothing official about the decision-makers in this most subjective of accolades. Corporate sponsors, television audiences and Jimmy Greaves have all been given the task of picking one man from the 22 or more who take to the field. &quot;The once venerable man-of-the-match award gets passed around the multi-platform, sponsor-appeasing world of post-millennia footy like a pyramid of Ferrero Rocher at an ambassador&apos;s reception,&quot; wrote Simon Hawkins in a blog on the subject in February. That said, Dan Worth reckons the perennial Knowledge favourite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be in with a shout, specifically for his 12-minute, four-goal cameo against Nottingham Forest in February 1999, when the deadly Norwegian replaced Roy Keane in the 78th minute and turned United&apos;s comfortable 4-1 advantage into an 8-1 rout. Solskjaer never dislodged Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole to earn a regular starting berth that season but was characteristically merciless against Forest, tapping in Gary Neville&apos;s cross after two minutes on the pitch and rounding things off on the whistle with an emphatic finish after a Paul Scholes scuff. In April 2001 Simon Morgan&apos;s final appearance \u2013 of more than 350 \u2013 for Fulham earned him the man-of-the-match award, despite being on the pitch for only 13 minutes. With the then First Division title secured, and leading 2-0 at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, Jean Tigana gave the much-loved and long-serving captain a token run-out as he gingerly returned from a 15-month injury lay-off. &quot;His every touch was cheered,&quot; writes James Sheedy, &quot;while all other players touching the ball (for either team) were booed. Obviously he was named man of the match.&quot; For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive CAN YOU HELP? &quot;The mighty Crystal Palace gave their competitors a head start this term, losing their first three fixtures to hold up the entire table,&quot; writes John McDougall.\u00a0&quot;Last week&apos;s 5-0 win over Ipswich took them to their rightful place atop the table, 12 [unbeaten] games later.\u00a0I guess there have been speedier rises from last to first; who holds this record?

Yet just as Barack Obama&apos;s re-election led American pundits to ask who will run in 2016, China watchers are now mulling over who might become China&apos;s top leaders when new president Xi Jinping and premier Li Keqiang retire in 2022. For many analysts, this is more than idle guesswork: understanding the party&apos;s up-and-coming stars means understanding its priorities. They say hopes for political reform, already dulled by the announcement of an overwhelmingly conservative standing committee, are unlikely to be revived by the new generation of leaders. Many of them have been groomed into positions of power by former president Hu Jintao, a cautious bureaucrat who has long rewarded adherence to the status quo. &quot;Conventional wisdom is the idea that this is the generation that will have more foreign exposure, or a bit more experience abroad, and this will make them more cosmopolitain or outward looking,&quot; said Rana Mitter, a professor of Chinese politics at Oxford University. &quot;I&apos;m not very sure that this is what&apos;s going on here.&quot; Topping a long list of 2022 hopefuls is Hu Chunhua, party secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region \u2013 a security maven who is often called Little Hu for his close relationship with the former president. Experts also mention Hunan province party secretary Zhou Qiang and Jilin province party secretary Sun Zhengcai, a former agricultural minister, as notable rising stars. Hu and Sun, both 49, were on Thursday named to China&apos;s new 25-member politburo, the country&apos;s top decision-making body. Zhou, 52, who once worked in the ministry of justice, could become the country&apos;s next top judge, according to the South China Morning Post. Hu, Sun and Zhou belong to the &quot;sixth generation&quot; of Communist leaders since Mao established the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949. They came of age during Mao&apos;s tumultuous Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 \u2013 giving them deep appreciation for political stability \u2013 and launched their careers just as China was opening up to the outside world. The current president Xi Jinping and premier Li Keqiang belong to the fifth generation of leaders; Hu Jintao and former premier Wen Jiabao belong to the fourth. Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore, said that today&apos;s party elites may be more cautious in grooming their successors. Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang leapfrogged to the politburo standing committee five years ago without first sitting on the 25-member politburo, he said. &quot;I think these people will have to be placed in provincial leadership positions for another four or five years before they move to the central leadership,&quot; said Bo. &quot;They need to gain additional local experience.&quot; Willy Lam, a Chinese politics expert at the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation, wrote that incentive systems laid out by Hu Jintao make it unlikely that the sixth generation would enact real political change. Third-generation leaders such as Deng Xiaoping strived to strike a balance between professional competence and communist zeal, he wrote in a 2010 report called Changing of the Guard. Yet Hu has unwaveringly given priority to &quot;morality,&apos;&apos; party-speak for devotion, above other qualities. &quot;Fifth- and sixth-generation cadres have yet to display originality of thinking and capability for breakthroughs in governance,&quot; Lam wrote. He has a lot in common with Zhou, a Hunan native with an undergraduate degree in law. Both are former student leaders from humble, agrarian families; both attained plum government posts at uncommonly young ages. Sun is a slight anomaly \u2014 he read a doctoral degree in agriculture, according to a report in the China Leadership Monitor, and spent a year as an exchange student in the United Kingdom. Analysts say that it may not be possible to truly gauge sixth generation leaders&apos; potential to join the standing committee for years. &quot;Some of them will make it but they&apos;ll have to toe the new line and show their faithfulness to Xi Jinping and the new leadership,&quot; said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. Their jobs won&apos;t be easy. China still grapples with endemic issues of corruption, inequity and environmental degradation. Lam wrote: &quot;The onus is now on Hu Chunhua, Zhou and other sixth-generation ... luminaries to prove to their colleagues \u2013 and 1.3 billion Chinese \u2013 that they have what it takes to, in patriarch Deng&apos;s memorable words, &apos;prop up the sky&apos; at times of monumental challenges.&quot; "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/17/india-england-first-test", "sentences": ["&quot;Nurse, more pills!&quot;  70th over: England 171-8 (Prior 41, Broad 21) &quot;It&apos;s absolutely bucketing it down here in Singapore,&quot; says Nicholas Stone."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-17T11:00:00Z", "title": "India v England \u2013 as it happened | Andy Bull and Rob Smyth", "tags": ["England in India 2012-13", "England cricket team", "India cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": " Good morning everyone.

Have you had any contact from anyone in cricket regarding him since the excellent article you wrote the other week? Any updates? If it hasn&apos;t, then this would still be an opportunity for you to re-post a link to it.&quot; Too kind, Tom. There&apos;s not much I can tell you just yet, but it&apos;s true that I am in the thick of a fairly frank exchange of emails with the ECB over English cricket&apos;s missing mystery spinner. It would be fair to say we have opposing views on the matter. I&apos;ll put an update in The Spin when I have something new to say, so keep an eye out there.  &quot;Reasons to be cheerful?&quot; chirrups Liam Drew as the umpires walk out to the middle. &quot;The return of KP, no?&quot; Well, Liam, I&apos;d be a little happier if we&apos;d been able to wait a little longer before we got to see him at the crease.  19th over: England 41-3 (Cook 23 Pietersen 6) So, England resume with a slender deficit of 480, and , you&apos;ll never believe this, but MS Dhoni has decided to open the attack with a spinner. Pragyan Ojha to be precise. His first ball turns past the bat, past the stumps, past the &apos;keeper, and runs away for a bye. A single puts KP on strike again, he almost manages to run himself out when he charges down the pitch, squirts an edge off his pads to silly point, and has to turn and dive back to beat the return throw. &quot;Feel like death?&quot; asks Dave Adams. Actually, Dave, death doesn&apos;t cover it. At least the dead can sleep. &quot;I sure do. My two year old just woke up in time for the start of play, so now we&apos;re both up, we may as well continue his nascent cricket education. Two lessons today - England&apos;s inability to bat on the sub-continent and the concept of the follow-on. This is probably also where we re-learn for the hundredth time that the few extra runs you might get from compromising your bowling attack are almost always worth less than a couple more wickets would have been. Might not tell my son that bit, as I don&apos;t want to turn him into a cynic. Genetics may have done that already though.&quot;  20th over: England 41-3 (Cook 23 Pietersen 6) And at the other end, it is Ravi Ashwin. He&apos;s bowling around the wicket to Cook, looking to turn the ball from the rough outside off-stump. It&apos;s a maiden. I enjoyed that last email from Dave Adams about educating his two-year-old in the ways of being an England fan. You can&apos;t start too young, Dave. I hope you held a radio up to your wife&apos;s belly when she was expecting so that young Adams could get accustomed to the dulcet tones and common sensical life approach of Geoffrey Boycott from the get-go.  21st over: England 49-3 (Cook 24 Pietersen 7) Pietersen is all at sea here. He should have been stumped down the leg side off the first ball, but Dhoni missed his chance. The ball runs away for four leg byes. And then he was very nearly lbw to the next delivery. The Indian broadcaster has just put up a caption on the screen asking viewers to vote now to say whether or not they think this match is going to make it to a fourth day. &quot;Reasons to be cheerful?&quot; asks Phil Withall. &quot;Paul Collingwood&apos;s soothing tones on the commentary. And the chance that, if K.P continues to sprint down the wicket in search of a shot, I&apos;ll hear him say &quot;hadaway an shite&quot; or some such Geordie gem.&quot; Hadaway is sh!te, he&apos;s right.  22nd over: England 49-3 (Cook 24 Pietersen 7) Ashwin races through another maiden over. &quot;Being from Somerset, my initial reason to be cheerful was the call up of Nick Compton...&quot; says Liam Drew. &quot;9 from 53 was definitely more the 2010/11 vintage. Fingers crossed for the second innings. Be nice if that were after India bat again, wouldn&apos;t it?&quot; I&apos;m a Somerset fan myself, Liam. And the funny thing is that you and I both know Nick Compton isn&apos;t even the best opening batsmen at the club, nevermind in the country.  23rd over: England 53-3 (Cook 24 Pietersen 11) Pietersen finally middles one, flicking four through mid-wicket. It&apos;s only a fleeting victory though, because the very next delivery squirts off the outside edge and loops up towards slip. Pietersen&apos;s surviving, but he seems to be dodging a bullet every other ball right now.  24th over: England 53-3 (Cook 24 Pietersen 11) I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen two bowlers race through their overs at such a rapid rate as these two are right now. &quot;Re KP looking edgy this morning: Am I right in seeing that he has a leg stump guard and will soon edge one to the slips off Ojha with his current mind set?&quot; I reckon you might well be, Rachit Gupta. &quot;I am bloody confused whether he will make a daddy 100 or go cheaply this morning. Please use either email as per situation.&quot; I&apos;ll just ask people to delete as appropriate. And seeing as you asked so nicely, yes, i will give a plug to what you describe as &quot;the mighty West Bergholt Cricket Club&quot;.  25th over: England 57-3 (Cook 24 Pietersen 15) Pietersen plays one with the spin, for once, almost as though that snick to slips in the last over reminded him that he doesn&apos;t need to try and shovel everything through the leg side. He plays outside then line of the last ball of the over, and is hit in front of off stump. India appeal, but umpire Hill shakes his head. Dhoni isn&apos;t happy about it, and strolls up to the umpire to grumble at him about the decision. &quot;They do have a system for things like this Mahi, you know,&quot; Hill may or may not have said. &quot;It is called the DRS.&quot;  26th over: England 57-3 (Cook 24 Pietersen 15) Ashwin bowls his overs so quickly, I&apos;ve hardly time to start typing before it is time to move on. This was yet another maiden. His current spell is 8-5-6-2. Preposterous. A little caption flashes up and tells us that 29% of the viewers in India think this match will be over today. They&apos;ve obviously got a lot of faith in England&apos;s ability to knock the deficit off sometime soon after lunch.  27th over: England 62-3 (Cook 28 Pietersen 15) Cook cuts four away square off Ojha. &quot;Reasons to be cheerful?&quot; asks Rory Martin. &quot;Have you tried a very small measure of decent Scotch?&quot; Sure, because alcohol is a notoriously good cure for depression.  28th over: England 67-3 (Cook 33 Pietersen 15) Ashwin finally serves up a bad ball, a rank full toss from over the wicket. Cook&apos;s eyes open wide, and he wallops it for four through mid-wicket. For all Pietersen&apos;s travails at the other end, Cook is playing wonderfully well. The captaincy suits him.  29th over: England 69-3 (Cook 34 Pietersen 16) KP edges the ball past slip for a single. And then Cook is damn-near at short leg caught off the next ball. Or at least so India&apos;s appeal would have you think. In fact the ball came straight off the pad, and never made contact with the bat.  30th over: England 69-3 (Cook 34 Pietersen 16) The first bowling change of the day brings Zaheer Khan into the attack, and he bowls a maiden to Cook. Umesh Yadav must wonder what he&apos;s supposed to do with himself. Three days into the match and he hasn&apos;t had a bat or a bowl.  31st over: England 69-3 (Cook 34 Pietersen 16) Pietersen is equal to the first four balls of Ojha&apos;s over, but is beaten all ends up by the fifth, which rips past his outside edge and draws forth cries from the close fielders as it does so.  32nd over: England 69-3 (Cook 34 Pietersen 16) After eating the first half of my cheese sandwich, I&apos;ve one less reason to be cheerful. If you&apos;re wondering why I&apos;m feeling especially hacked off today, by the way - and it is a little disconcerting that judging by the lack of emails on the topic my especially bleak tone doesn&apos;t seem to be so very different from my regular one - I had my phone nicked yesterday evening, by a bloke in a hoodie on a bike. I went to the police station to report and - I promise you - the cop asked me if I had a mobile number so he could contact me. Anyway, easy come, easy go. It&apos;s more the prospect of the mountain of paperwork I&apos;m facing from the insurance company that is getting me down.  WICKET! Pietersen 17 b Ojha (England 69-4) He tried, he really did, but for all his effort Pietersen has looked uncomfortable against Ojha all morning long. And now, at last, he succumbs to him, beaten by a ball that drifted in, and then span back past the bat into the stumps. The dismissal came hard on the heels of an lbw shout.  WICKET! Bell 0 c Tendulkar b Ojha (England 69-5) l cannot not believe this. I mean really, really, that may be the single most idiotic, pathetic, embarrassing, humiliating, disgraceful, desultory, excruciatingly awful dismissal I have seen from an English batsman in five years of writing over-by-over cricket coverage. Really, that&apos;s not a joke, or an exaggeration. It is a good thing Ian Bell is about to fly home to be there for the birth of his child, because if he wasn&apos;t - barring a hundred in the second innings - I would really suggest that he should have been dropped from the team on the strength of that shot alone. Mercy me. To recap: Ian Bell walked out to the middle, in the most jaunty, cocksure fashion, marked his guard, took a step down the wicket and chipped a catch straight - and I mean straight - to mid-off. It was, truly, the shot of a moron. He&apos;s gone for a golden duck.  England: Up The Creek - Without a Clue (Cook 34 Patel 0) Cook survives the hattrick ball, just, but only because the edge he sent to slip was too low for the fielder to catch. Then he&apos;s within a whisker of being out lbw. The pressure on umpire Hill as he contemplates whether or not to give him out is enormous, with 15,000 people roaring for him raise his finger. He doesn&apos;t, and Cook bats on.  Go back to bed. Just pull up the duvet and go back to bed.  35th over: England 70-5 (Cook 34, Patel 1) &quot;I really wouldn&apos;t like to be Ian Bell right now,&quot; says Phil Withall. &quot;And I really, really wouldn&apos;t want to be Ian Bell when Cook gets back into the dressing room. Maybe someone should have told him it was a test match and not the last over of a T20 match. He&apos;s ruined my Saturday.&quot; The only shred of an excuse I can think of for him is that you can see what he was trying to do - be positive, break the shackles, refuse to allow the bowler to dictate to him - all that jazz. But it was just so poor: witless, gutless, brainless. When Strauss first became captain, and England were routed in Kingston, he dropped Bell simply to make a point. Cook must be tempted to do the very same thing, if only Bell wasn&apos;t about to fly home anyway.  36th over: England 75-5 (Cook 38, Patel 2) For all that I&apos;m hammering Bell here, I&apos;ve just realised that I&apos;m drinking my coffee out of a mug that says &apos;Yummy Mummy&apos; on the side in big pink letters. Oh dignity, why hast thou forsaken me?  37th over: England 75-5 (Cook 38, Patel 2) &quot;Never in the field of cricket conflict,&quot; writes Adam Hirst, &quot;have so many over-rated one batsman by so much for so few.&quot; It wasn&apos;t the fact that he got out first ball. It was the manner of it, the fact that he couldn&apos;t even begin to find a way to try and cope with this situation. Pietersen, for instance, played awfully today, and looked all over the place, but at least he tried to find a way to stay in. He didn&apos;t just walk in, whack one to mid-off, and walk off again. None of the English batsmen are going to find this easy - the pitch is turning, the bowling is good, and their techniques can&apos;t cut it - but at least the others are trying. &quot;Hard to disagree with you re: Bell&apos;s dismissal. There are times when a statement-of-intent shot is appropriate,&quot; says Dave Adams. &quot;Fair to say 69/4 chasing 500 is not one of them. Gooch&apos;s face is priceless though.&quot;  38th over: England 75-5 (Cook 38, Patel 2) Ashwin is back on, and he has raced through a maiden over to Patel.  39th over: England 78-5 (Cook 39, Patel 4) &quot;Including this match, Ian Bell now averages 27.75 in 32 innings over his 18 tests in India/Sri Lanka/Pakistan/UAE,&quot; says Amirali Abdullah. &quot;This is a fairly non-trivial statistical sample now - should Bell be dropped because he can&apos;t play competent spin well? Remember, Johnny Bairstow scored 149 runs in his last test match, but the conventional wisdom is that he was dropped because he isn&apos;t as secure against the tweakers of the ball.&quot; He&apos;s about to jump before he is pushed. Unless he scores runs in the second innings, I&apos;d be pretty surprised if we see him again in this series given that both Morgan and Bairstow made runs in the warm-up matches.  WICKET! Cook 41 c Sehwag b Ashwin (England 80-6) Look, just shut your eyes, and set your alarm clock for January 2013. Cook, who has played better than any of his teammates, is caught at slip, beaten by an off break that dipped, spun, snicked off the edge and flew to Sehwag.  41st over: England 81-6 (Patel 4 Prior 1 Hope 0) I think Graham Gooch just got a text telling him that his dog has been shot. how else to explain his ashen pallor?  42nd over: England 85-6 (Patel 4 Prior 1) &quot;If it&apos;s any consolation at all, I had so many such moments last summer as the Indians played one hapless and desperate shot after another against an English attack that was simply relentless. They showed no desire to be there at all. I think we&apos;ve all got to get used to the idea that our players aren&apos;t as great as they look at home - but by the same token, they aren&apos;t so bad as they look abroad.&quot; That&apos;s a kind and generous email, Sankaran Krishna, but where&apos;s the fun in being reasonable? For those of you wondering what&apos;s happening in the middle, by the way, every over is bringing at least one or two raucous lbw shouts or edges that fly past a fielder. Patel is plumb lbw here, but survives through nothing other than the generosity of umpire Dar.  43rd over: England 85-6 (Patel 4 Prior 1) Ian Bell is going to be a broken man after that dismissal. I&apos;ll be surprised if he even makes it out of bed to get back to the ground for the second innings. He&apos;s going to need years of therapy to recover from this. &quot;Even I&apos;m bored and tired now,&quot; says my sports desk mucker Barry Glendenning, harking back to his long-standing dispute with another old colleague about Bell&apos;s merits as a batsman. &quot;Bell etc. booth. Wisden ed. etc. yawn.&quot;  44th over: England 86-6 (Patel 4 Prior 1) Yuvraj is going to get a little bowl now, which seems a strange sort of move from Dhoni. It&apos;s worth remembering at this point that Umesh Yadav, batting at No11, still hasn&apos;t had a bowl.  45th over: England 86-6 (Patel 5 Prior 1) Ashwin is back on, from the other end. &quot;Reason to be cheerful?&quot; asks Dom Wright When back at No. 1 some time next decade it&apos;ll be all the sweeter for lows such as this.&quot; Dominic, an optimist, said Ambrose Bierce, is &quot;a proponent of the doctrine that black is white.&quot; Oh my goodness. Iron Bottom has just said &quot;Of all the shots, Ian Bell&apos;s is probably the one I can most live with.&quot; It is such a preposterous thing to say, that Nick Knight - Nick Knight! The blandest, most inoffensive man in cricket - immediately shoots him down in flames. And to be fair to Iron Bottom, he then changes his mind and explains that basically Bell&apos;s shot is what he would have done in that situation, simply because he would have been so hacked off at the state of play before he came in.  46th over: England 86-6 (Patel 6 Prior 2) Yuvraj continues, with another cheap over.  47th over: England 95-6 (Patel 8 Prior 7) Prior survives an lbw appeal after padding up, possibly because it hit him just a little too high on the pad. And then he&apos;s dropped by deep mid-wicket, after slapping a full toss straight to Zaheer Khan. It would have been an ugly dismissal, if Zaheer hadn&apos;t fumbled the chance.  48th over: England 97-6 (Patel 10 Prior 7) Here, at last, is Umesh Yadav. They do do things differently in India, don&apos;t they? Here, it is the quick bowler who is getting a token over or two before lunch. Patel clips two runs away to square leg.  WICKET! Patel 10 lbw Yadav (England 97-7) Samit looks sick as a parrot, and I can&apos;t say I blame him. That&apos;s a shoddy sort of decision from umpire Dar. He&apos;s been given out to a delivery that looked to be going down the leg side. He had been playing well, too, or at least finding a way to stay at the crease. Once he&apos;s picked up his jaw, he strolls sulkily off.  49th over: England 105-7 (Prior 15, Bresnan 0) Prior sweeps four away square, and brings up the 100. Later in the over he hits another boundary, this time out to cover. He seems to be taking this all in his stride.  50th over: England 105-7 (Prior 15, Bresnan 0) Yadav almost yorks Bresnan with a rather brilliant little reverse-swinging yorker.  51st over: England 106-7 (Prior 16, Bresnan 0) Otherwise unpleasant things that are still preferable to being an England cricket fan right now, No1 in an ongoing series: &quot;My wife, being sensitive to the pitiful aura that has engulfed me this afternoon, has just arranged the delivery of 2 cubic metres of shredded tree bark. I can now go into the garden and spread this over the the garden beds. This will take my mind of the cricket and take me up to wine o&apos;clock. A course of events I would strongly recommend to all readers at a loose end.&quot;  52nd over: England 110-7 (Prior 20, Bresnan 0) Prior cuts four past point, and then swings and misses at another wide one from Yadav in an attempt to repeat the shot. And that, ladies and gents, is lunch.  So, how are those reasons to be cheerful working out for you? Keep them coming, those of you that still have any. Alternatively, I&apos;ll also welcome more suggestions for otherwise awful activities that are still, at the moment, preferable to sitting through this shambles. Like spreading tree bark.  LUNCH  A quick public service announcement: Use the manual refresh button if you find you&apos;re missing descriptions of the wickets. It&apos;s not us, it&apos;s the tools.  &quot;For a senior player,&quot; says Athers of Ian Bell&apos;s dismissal, &quot;that was disgraceful. After that he can take as much paternity leave as he wants.&quot; Nick Knight agrees. &quot;This is indefensible. I cannot find any way of defending this. This is his first ball of the Test match, he&apos;s walked out and thought &apos;I&apos;m Ian Bell and I&apos;m going to hit you back over your head.&apos; No, no you&apos;re not.&quot;  Really, at the risk of sounding curmudgeonly, I think Flower and Cook need to give this team a kick in the arse right now. Just as Flower and Strauss did in Kingston when the team were bowled out for 51 by the West Indies. Some of the senior players - and I am talking about Stuart Broad, Ian Bell, and, to a much lesser extent, Jon Trott - need the stick, not the carrot here. They need to know that if they&apos;re going to fall so far below the standard expected, then their places aren&apos;t safe anymore. Especially when there are young alternatives available in the squad.  If you wonder why I am singling out Broad from the bowlers, here are some stats from the marvelous Andy Zaltzman, who has a Smyth-like ability for digging out gems on Statsguru: &quot;The combined analysis for Broad&apos;s last six opening spells in Tests is: 0-107 off 36 overs. His previous eight opening spells before that returned 8-118 off 41. In Engand&apos;s last six bowling innings, Broad has taken one wicket in the first 50 overs.&quot;  In all my excitement, I realise I haven&apos;t taken a moment to stress this: India have been wonderful in almost every way. They are halfway through a perfect Test match performance.  Meanwhile, in Mirpur, Bangladesh need another 189 from 57 overs to beat the West Indies in the first Test, but they only have six wickets left to do it with.  Back to the slaughter board for England. Here come the batsmen.  53rd over: England 110-7 (Prior 20, Bresnan 0) So, Ojha starts after lunch, and his very first ball beats Bresnan&apos;s bat and hits him in front of leg stump. &quot;Ow&apos;zat?&quot; asks Dhoni, with an air that suggests &apos;I don&apos;t really mind either way, because if he&apos;s not out now he will be soon enough.&apos;&quot;  54th over: England 110-7 (Prior 20, Bresnan 0) Yadav, who looks much the fastest bowler in the match, will continue. I like this email from Luke Richardson. It is cruel, but there a grain of truth in it: &quot;Just catching up on the OBO and reading about Bell&apos;s dismissal reinforces my heavily researched view that he&apos;s just a bit stupid and, if anything, a product of his media training. He&apos;s always so keen to present the right view of himself that he basically out thinks himself. There are many more ways to bat positively in this situation than to strut out like Steve Waugh and then walk down the wicket and limply poke one 30 yards. When the run out snafu happened at Trent Bridge I seem to recall Bell being asked to comment and making no sense whatsoever. It was left to Rahul Dravid (first language: not English - again, heavily researched) to very articulately disarm the situation. Would it make more sense for him to throw all the Positive Mental Attitude out of the window, and just go out and bat?&quot; Deary me, you should have been there to see the tangle Bell got himself into in his first press conference after Steve Davies came out a couple of years ago.  55th over: England 115-7 (Prior 20, Bresnan 5) There are four men close in on the off-side for Bresnan, but he manages to thump the ball past them all for four. &quot;I can&apos;t believe the negativity sallying forth from the interwebs at me,&quot; insists Grant Cartledge. &quot;Can&apos;t you see the tactics here? We have them exactly where we want them! Cook realised the only way to win this game having lost the toss is to not bat last on this track. So he clearly decided to set such a woefully low first innings score to ensure the follow on gets enforced, we then get a quick-fire 600 in the second innings and skittle them out for around a 100 on the last day. Job done. Oh, wait a mo, someone&apos;s just come in - yes nurse, I&apos;ll have my medications now please.&quot;  56th over: England 120-7 (Prior 24, Bresnan 6) Just another 206 needed to avoid the follow on now. Yadav floats up a slower ball, and Prior whacks it to cover. Later in the over, though, he plays a lovely crisp cover drive for four. &quot;Reasons to be cheerful?&quot; asks Dan Stagg. &quot;We can now all joyously retrieve our &apos;Is it cowardly&apos; T-shirts from the murky depths of whatever cupboard they were slung when it became just too hypocritical to wear them whilst beating the Aussies home and away and marching inexorably to number one. Unlike our batsman, we English cricket fans are now firmly back in our comfort zone.&quot;  57th over: England 120-7 (Prior 24, Bresnan 6) Bresnan, looking more confident against Ojha than any English batsman other than Cook, plays out a maiden with a minimum of fuss.  58th over: England 121-7 (Prior 25, Bresnan 6) A single off Yadav&apos;s latest over. Looks to have the makings of a good bowler, this chap. &quot;If it makes you feel any better it&apos;s been raining all day here in Santa Barbara,&quot; says Tim Jones, as though here in England we have constant sunshine. &quot;Plus I went for a shingles vaccination this morning, and then we backed out of the parking space smack into the car backing out of the one opposite. Nobody hurt though. Back on Merseyside the other driver would have emerged saying (a) he had been stationary and (b) his neck hurt. But this is California so after some mutual good will we were on our way.&quot;  59th over: England 126-7 (Prior 26, Bresnan 10) Ashwin replaces Dhoni, and utterly foxes Bresnan with a carrom ball, flicked out of the fingers and breaking away from the bat. It flew low to Sehwag, who dropped the catch. India&apos;s fielding has been typically poor - the one blemish on their performance so far. What a luxury of resources the Indian captain seems to have at his disposal, in comparison to the paucity of options Cook had to pick from. This is an excellent email from Simon Babar, who, I can only presume, is writing from Celesteville: &quot;Taking a step back, test cricket is back after a gap of a few months (not just here, but in Aus and Bangladesh too). Also focusing on this game, the shellacking we are taking should mean The Management look at some of the &quot;certainties&quot; that they seem to have adopted - Bell, Broad, balance. And it does give Cook a chance to put a stamp on his team and impose some authority (like Strauss/flower 2009). On the Bell point and the discussions in over 54 - I think it is telling that Bell has never been considered for a position of authority in this team - never talked about as captain, vice-captain or even chief ball polisher. And he has been in the team solidly barring injury since 2005(?) except for that brief spell in 2009.&quot;      Is it cowardly to pray for rain?    60th over: England 126-7 (Prior 27, Bresnan 10) In times like this, what can we do but turn to Gary Naylor? &quot;I&apos;m actually wearing the &quot;Cowardly&quot; T-shirt now. And the answer is no.&quot;  61st over: England 132-7 (Prior 27, Bresnan 15) Bresnan ambles onwards, unflustered. He takes four from this over.  62nd over: England 136-7 (Prior 31, Bresnan 15) Zak&apos;s back in the attack. Prior edges his first ball towards slip, but the ball falls well short. Later in the over he drives four past point. Of course, it feels as though he&apos;s showing his colleagues up here, but you have to remember he&apos;s has the luxury of playing a fast bowler, rather than being confronted by a spinner at both ends, for most of the time he has been in the middle. Mike Thorley, you&apos;ve done more for my morale with this one email than any other single thing that&apos;s happened in the last 12 hours: &quot;I share your pain regarding coppers and reporting nicked mobile phones. Wandering down the main street of a what, with hindsight, was a use-your-hands-free north Parisian suburb, a burly young chap tapped me on the left shoulder and snatched the phone from my right hand. Bold as brass he looked me in eye and walked at a leisurely pace into a towerblock a couple of hundred metres down the road. My natural inner coward let him stroll off as I strolled to the local police station. Once I&apos;d finished the report the young police officer commented that the theft was quite unusual. &quot;Mobile snatched in street unusual, surely not&quot;, muttered I , incredulously, only to be greeted with a withering &quot;Well it&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve had it reported by a man, it usually happens to women and children round here.&quot; Felt much better for that.&quot;  63rd over: England 138-7 (Prior 32, Bresnan 16) &quot;Ian Bell is one of only two cricketers (the other was Geraint Jones) who&apos;ve annoyed me so much over the years that I&apos;ve learnt their middle name to shout at the telly,&quot; says Ed Battison. &quot;Obviously makes no difference to them but it makes me feel better to shout Ian RONALD Bell when he&apos;s done something stupid again.&quot;  64th over: England 140-7 (Prior 33, Bresnan 17) Bresnan is very nearly bowled by a ball that ricocheted off his bat onto his pads and, almost, into the stumps. In his panic he shapes to hoof it into row z, before realising, a little sheepishly, that he doesn&apos;t really need to because the ball has dropped stone dead on the pitch.  65th over: England 143-7 (Prior 34, Bresnan 19) At the risk of turning this OBO into a victim&apos;s support group, will the rest of you indulge me while I reply to Alex Marsh? &quot;You didn&apos;t have your phone nicked on Caledonian Road by any chance? Last year I had the very same thing happen to me (hoodie, bike, snatch) when walking hope from the pub completely not drunk at all. Did you follow it up with the attempt to catch them? I did. Pointless AND humiliating.&quot; Yes, it was on Caledonian Road. Yes it was a kid in a hoodie on a bike. And yes, I did make a very brief effort to chase him, but ultimately settled for demeaning myself further still by shouting foul abuse at his back as he disappeared down the road, immediately abandoning all my left wing principles, deciding to start buying the Daily mail, and resolving to vote for someone far to the right of the Tory party at the next election.  66th over: England 143-7 (Prior 34, Bresnan 19) A maiden by Khan. In Mirpur, Bangladesh appear to have pretty much given up the chase and are trying to save the draw instead. England fans aren&apos;t really in a position to comment on the rights and wrongs of that policy.  67th over: England 144-7 (Prior 34, Bresnan 19) Ojha replaces Ashwin. And, well, you can guess what is coming...  WICKET! Bresnan 19 c Kohli b Ojha (England 144-8) Bresnan comes half-forward, and gets a thick edge that flies to gully. He lasted 60 balls, which is ten more than Anderson, Trott, Bell, and Pietersen managed between them.  67th over: England 150-8 (Prior 34, Broad 6) Broad knows what he wants to do, and wallops his first ball through mid-wicket for four.  68th over: England 152-8 (Prior 36, Broad 6) Yup.  69th over: England 166-8 (Prior 37, Broad 20) Four more for Broad to start the over, and then, to end it, a mighty six down the ground. It was the carrom ball, but it could just as well have been a doosra, a teesra, an arm ball or anything else you&apos;d care to name, because Broad was going to clobber it regardless. That&apos;s 14 from the over. &quot;Trying to stay positive, all we need is for Broad and Prior to put together a partnership like Broad and Trott at Lord&apos;s and we&apos;ll be right back in the game,&quot; cries Ed Battison. &quot;Nurse, more pills!&quot;  70th over: England 171-8 (Prior 41, Broad 21) &quot;It&apos;s absolutely bucketing it down here in Singapore,&quot; says Nicholas Stone. &quot;A real electrical storm. I&apos;m dancing around right now in a forlorn attempt to shepherd some of it towards India.&quot; Just as Yadav is quicker than any of the English seamers, Zaheer is finding more movement than any of them too. England, I&apos;m afraid, are being out-performed by India&apos;s fast bowlers too. He swings one back in to Broad, who slices the ball just past his stumps.  71st over: England 177-8 (Prior 47, Broad 21) A close lbw shout from Ashwin, against Prior. But it&apos;s not close enough. He&apos;s England&apos;s top-scorer now. Later in the over he tries a reverse sweep, and the ball pops up in the air to a close fielder. Again, India appeal. And again, it&apos;s not out.  72nd over: England 177-8 (Prior 47, Broad 21) Zaheer beats the outside of Broad&apos;s bat with a little away-swinger. Later in the over he brings one back the other way, and hits him on he pads in front of leg. &quot;Gardening done, wine in hand&quot; says Phil Withall, who I can only presume is in a different time zone to me. &quot;Your point about the Indian quicks outperforming their English counterparts makes me wonder if there is a psychological hurdle in their minds. The fact that spin is the most effective form in India has probably instilled a subconscious negativity - &apos;Its all about spin, I&apos;ll struggle out here&apos;. Might well play a factor.&quot; Possibly, Phil, possibly. Or perhaps they&apos;re just a bunch of chumps.  73rd over: England 179-8 (Prior 48, Broad 22) &quot;Reasons to be cheerful?&quot; asks Phil Russell. &quot;Say what you like about the Caledonian Road but i got a great deal on a mobile phone there from a bloke outside a pub last night. Only wanted 20 quid for it. Top stuff.&quot;  74th over: England 179-8 (Prior 48, Broad 25) Four leg byes as Zaheer&apos;s line drifts too far over. Broad then punches the next delivery down the ground for three.  WICKET! Broad 25 lbw Zaheer (England 187-9) It&apos;s almost over now, for the first innings at least. Broad is given out lbw by Dar, though it wasn&apos;t a stone dead decision.  74th over: England 189-8 (Prior 48, Swann 0) Swann is almost out to the very first ball, as he, like Broad, is baffled by Zaheer&apos;s reverse swing. Umpire Dar reckons it was going down the leg-side. It seems almost heretical to say this, but he seems to be making a few ropey decisions in this match, which isn&apos;t like him at all. This one looked a lot more out than the one before it.  WICKET! Prior 48 b Ojha (England 191) This farce is over.  England are 330 runs behind, and a world away from even beginning to be able to compete. India batted for just under two days. England have been bowled out in just over two sessions.  Rob Smyth will be here in ten minutes or so, so please send your emails to him now, at rob.smyth@guardian.co.uk. I am going to lie down in a dark room.  TEA              Preamble We knew England would probably lose. We knew they might lose heavily. But did the manner of it have to be so bloody predictable? It&apos;s almost offensively cliched.  That last wicket from Ojha was the 100th by a spinner in Tests against England in 2012. Those wickets have come at an average of 23.57. In 2011, slow bowlers took just 19 English wickets in Tests at an average of 82.73. You&apos;ll be pleased to know that England are cruising towards the record for wickets taken by spinners against them in a calendar year: 109 in 1993. They might even beat it in this innings.  A poem from Simon McMahon &quot;Apologies to Baldrick. &apos;The England batsmen&apos;  WICKET WICKET WICKET WICKETWICKET WICKET WICKETWICKET WICKET WICKET WICKETWICKET WICKET WICKET&quot;   1st over: England 0-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 0, Compton 0) Umesh Yadav, who wasn&apos;t used until the 48th over in the first innings, has graduated to the new ball, and he starts with a maiden. It won&apos;t be easy for Cook to clear his head of extraneous thoughts and concentrate solely on batting. He pushes forward a little tentatively to the fifth ball and is beaten. &quot;Back in the day, I always thought the second innings was like the second life in Super Mario,&quot; says Abhishek Rayasam. &quot;I always figured going through the same level all over again would be so much easier \u2013 and always hit the first turtle that came along again. Hope it works out better for England for the sake of the game.&quot; My money&apos;s on the turtle.  2nd over: England 0-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 0, Compton 0) India have a completely different new-ball pair. In the first innings it was Ashwin and Zaheer; this time it&apos;s Yadav and Ojha. Compton survives a huge LBW shout second ball. It looked out live, but replays suggested it was a fine decision from Aleem Dar. The ball didn&apos;t straighten quite enough and would probably have gone down leg. There may also have been an inside edge. Another maiden, uncomfortably survived buy Compton.  &quot;A JAR OF FREE HOMEMADE CHUTNEY sourced from Brighton&apos;s cutest new coffee shop, Lark on Lowther, to cheer up depressed UK-based OBO readers who donate \u00a310 or more to my sponsored bike ride across Rajasthan in aid of the children&apos;s cancer charity CLIC Sargent,&quot; writes my colleague Steph Fincham. &quot;(Please leave your address on my JustGiving page.)&quot;  3rd over: England 2-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 2, Compton 0) MS Dhoni was pointing a finger pretty aggressively at Aleem Dar at the end of Ojha&apos;s over. That didn&apos;t look good at all. Dhoni is one of the most charismatic, interesting men in cricket but he was out of order there. It was also a bit pointless, given the match situation. On Sky, David Lloyd \u2013 a big advocate of having yellow and red cards for player behaviour \u2013\u00a0says he would have given Dhoni a yellow.  4th over: England 2-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 2, Compton 0) Compton defends fairly comfortably in that Ojha over. The problem is that he seems to have very few scoring shots: 57 of his 65 deliveries in this match have been dot balls.  5th over: England 4-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 3, Compton 1) Compton gets off the mark, working Yadav to leg for a single. &quot;How about X-Factor style open auditions before the next Test?&quot; says Thom Pierce. &quot;At least it would make losing more interesting and with a public vote we would feel more invested in the team.&quot; And after this week&apos;s public vote, I can exclusively reveal that the bottom two are ... Ian Bell and Ian Bell.  6th over: England 8-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 5, Compton 3) Ashwin replaces Ojha. His run-up is fascinating: he almost looks like a left-arm spinner with the way he attacks the stumps. Three from the over. Cook looks comfortable, Compton less so. What a hideous situation in which to make your Test debut.  7th over: England 10-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 6, Compton 4) The new ball is doing nothing for Yadav. I&apos;m not sure why Dhoni isn&apos;t bowling spin from both ends. I suppose it&apos;s all for his amusement, a cat toying with a dying mouse because it wants to, and because it can.  8th over: England 16-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 6, Compton 10) Compton is stretching as far forward as possible to smother the spin of Ashwin, who switches around the wicket as a consequence. The first ball from that angle is too straight and tucked round the corner for a couple, and then Compton gets a reverse sweep away for four. I wonder how many people have scored their first Test-match boundary with a reverse sweep. &quot;Everyone&apos;s focusing in how rapidly England have gone from invincible to a shambles \u2013 but how have India turned it around from the shambles of their England tour?&quot; says Mark Hooper. &quot;It can&apos;t just be conditions, there seems to be a totally different attitude.&quot; I think it is mainly conditions. They were hammered 4-0 in Australia as well, and if these two sides played in England you&apos;d expect England to hammer them again.  9th over: England 23-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 12, Compton 11) Cook skips down the track to hustle the returning Ojha over midwicket for four. That&apos;s a fine shot indeed. England will be cautiously pleased with their start to this innings. &quot;I really wish Paul Collingwood still played for England,&quot; says Simon McMahon. He would love this challenge. He&apos;d have made 38 not out from 149 balls in the first innings.  10th over: England 24-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 12, Compton 11) It&apos;s spin from both ends now, for the first time in the innings. A quiet over from Ashwin. &quot;Morning Rob,&quot; says Jon France. &quot;A wave of 90s nostalgia swept over me this morning on waking to the news that after being 22 not out over night, Cook isstill there, 12 not out.&quot;  11th over: England 25-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 12, Compton 11) Nothing whatsoever is happening. This is often the way in India, of course, and then one wicket brings ten.  12th over: England 33-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 22, Compton 11) A bad ball from Ashwin is cut for four with the minimum of fuss by Cook, who then drives sweetly through extra cover for four more. In the context of what has happened at the other end, he has batted beautifully in this game. Okay, here&apos;s a question: in view of Ian Bell&apos;s gift to comedy earlier in the day, what would you nominate for The Joy of Six: awful cricket shots. (With YouTube links if possible.) I&apos;ll start with this old favourite from Beefy, who was still on nought, against Australia in 1989.  13th over: England 34-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 22, Compton 12) Virender Sehwag comes on to bowl his part-time offspin and so nearly strikes with his fourth ball. Cook felt a little lazily outside off stump and edged the ball a fraction short of Kohli at slip.  14th over: England 35-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 22, Compton 13) Ojha has switched to the GMDC End, where he took all his first-innings wickets. Compton, who looks relatively comfortable now, works a single to leg. &quot;This shocker from Brad Haddin in Australia&apos;s capitulation at the hands of South Africa last year almost makes Bell look sensible,&quot; says Lewis Owen-Beckwith.  15th over: England 35-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 22, Compton 13) Ashwin has also switched, to the Adani Pavilion End, where he took all his first-innings wickets. In short, we&apos;re all doomed. England look fairly secure actually, but you know what&apos;s coming. We all know what&apos;s coming, and it&apos;s not happiness. &quot;Please find attached a link to the single most idiotic, pathetic, embarrassing, humiliating, disgraceful, desultory, excruciatinglyawful dismissal I have seen from an English batsman,&quot; says Eric Stephenson. &quot;Bell has got previous.&quot; This not dissimilar dismissal, suggested by Chris Evans, is a gem too.  16th over: England 39-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 26, Compton 13) Too short from Ojha, and again Cook flashes a cut stroke to the boundary. England are probably having their best period of the match. No, this is not saying much.  17th over: England 46-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 27, Compton 19) Compton, attempting to drive Ashwin, squirts an edge all along the ground for four. Then Ojha injures his right elbow while making a sliding stop at midwicket. He&apos;s on his back, clearly in pain, and is going to leave the field. It&apos;s hard to know just how serious it might be, although I doubt we&apos;ll see him bowl again today. It would be an obvious blow to India if he is unable to bowl again in the match. England might yet avoid an innings defeat.  18th over: England 47-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 27, Compton 21) The third-change bowler Zaheer Khan replaces the injured Ojha and Compton easily plays out the over. England are winning this session. England are winning. England have won. &quot;Awful cricket shots,&quot; says Prahalad Bhat. &quot;May I suggest, as a group entry, every single Shahid Afridi dismissal, ever?&quot;  19th over: England 53-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 32, Compton 21) Ojha is back on the field. That&apos;s a surprise, although he&apos;s still holding his elbow like its a wounded kitten. Cook clips Ashwin round the corner for four to bring up England&apos;s first fifty partnership of the match. He and Compton have played really well.  Drinks break Crikey, what a find this is: David Hookes&apos;s famous 34-ball century in 1982-83. Listen the sound his bat makes!  20th over: England 56-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 33, Compton 23) Ojha is back into the attack, replacing Zaheer Khan. Compton works a couple through square leg. England&apos;s progress is almost too serene. It makes you suspicious, like a horror film whose first 20 minutes involves teenagers cheerily celebrating life and then suddenly one of them walks round a corner and onto a pickaxe.  21st over: England 56-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 33, Compton 23) &quot;To save his reputation to some degree, what Ian Bell must do is, firstly, make a double century at least, secondly, take the score a long way into the positive to set a decent target and, thirdly, take at least seven catches at Insanely Stupid Short Leg to knock the stuffing out of the Indians (off Pietersen&apos;s bowling),&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;Incidentally, I&apos;m wearing the Is is cowardly \u2026 T-shirt but only because it&apos;s been relegated to nightwear and I haven&apos;t got round to getting dressed yet.&quot;  22nd over: England 56-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 33, Compton 23) Compton is dropped at gully! He pushed a long way forward at Ojha, with the ball taking the edge of his defensive stroke. Kohli dived smartly to his left but just couldn&apos;t get his left hand under the ball as it died on him. It was an excellent effort.  23rd over: England 60-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 37, Compton 23) Ashwin drops short to Cook. You know what happens next. That&apos;s Cook&apos;s sixth boundary of the innings, and at least half of them have been cut strokes. &quot;I don&apos;t know what everyone&apos;s complaining about,&quot; says Peter Harmer. &quot;I&apos;m feeling quite nostalgic; this reminds me of the cricket I watched as a nipper. England giving up a huge first innings score then a top-notch collapse. Just need some Opal Fruits and John Crawley out there and I&apos;d be tearing up.&quot;  24th over: England 65-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 41, Compton 24) Cook blasts a sweep for four off Ojha \u2013 and then survives a massive LBW shout when he misses another sweep. That looked plumb, with Ojha bowling around the wicket and getting the ball to straighten sharply. Aleem Dar has, by his astonishingly high standards, had a bit of a shocker today. That would surely have been given out with DRS.  25th over: England 65-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 41, Compton 24) The pressure is building almost imperceptibly. There are 49 minutes remaining today. &quot;Your cricketing horror movie analogy leads me to believe that Ian Bell is the slightly dim sports jock who foolishly thinks his bravado will keep him safe,&quot; says Phil Withall. &quot;Tried to get slasher in there after his shot today but failed.&quot;  26th over: England 66-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 42, Compton 24) There are a lot of England batting debutants in the last 30 years who would have thrown this in second time round. We still have no real idea whether Nick Compton will make it at Test level, but we can say he has shown really impressive temperament in this innings. &quot;Following from my Japanese girlfriend&apos;s house in Osaka,&quot; says Daniel Cullen, who&apos;s already three up on me. &quot;She&apos;s carefully laying out the hotpot ingredients and I&apos;m quaffing Asahi in front of the &apos;Clive James on TV&apos; fare on the box. I&apos;ve got as much chance of explaining to her what&apos;s happening in India as England have of getting out of this I imagine...&quot;  27th over: England 68-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 43, Compton 25) India are looking right down the barrel here.  28th over: England 70-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 44, Compton 26) Compton gives Ojha the charge but can only scrunch the ball along the floor to mid-off. I&apos;m not sure what else to say. England are pottering along pretty easily. &quot;Given your difficulties with using photos,&quot; says Jen Oram. &quot;I have had my pal Mr Bateman illustrate Bell&apos;s innings for you: link one and link two. He seems to have slightly misunderstood the mode of dismissal, but apart from that all the elements are there.&quot; Apart from Andy Bull&apos;s nervous breakdown when it happened.  29th over: England 75-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 49, Compton 26) Cook sweeps a low full toss from Ashwin to four. A single to midwicket moves him to within one of England&apos;s first half-century in the match. &quot;Could it be that England&apos;s apparent first innings ineptitude was but a cunning ploy to get India batting last?&quot; says Louis Leblique. &quot;We&apos;ve got them right where we want them.&quot;  30th over: England 81-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 54, Compton 27) Cook rocks back to pull Ojha witheringly for four and reach a very impressive half-century from 94 balls. It can&apos;t be easy to compartmentalise when your team are being thrashed in your first match as captain, but Cook has been able to do so.  &quot;Following this from a wedding in Queenscliff, Victoria, Oz,&quot; says Brian Clifford. &quot;All of the speeches lasted longer than Ian Bell.&quot; Brian will be here all week. (Unlike Ian Bell, etc and so forth.)  31st over: England 86-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 58, Compton 28) Yadav has come on for Ashwin, who hasn&apos;t bowled particularly well and has figures of 12-3-44-0. Cook edges all along the ground for four and is then beaten, feeling tentatively outside off stump. Man I&apos;m tired. Can someone get me a Berocca sandwich? &quot;Sorry to butt in,&quot; says Mark Steward. &quot;Please tell Daniel Cullen we have a team over here in Kyoto/Shiga and he&apos;s welcome to watch cricket with us. Although Asahi, nabe and a girlfriend who prepares both sound like passable alternatives.&quot;  32nd over: England 92-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 59, Compton 29) &quot;Dear Rob,&quot; says Mike Payton. &quot;I have nothing to say except this.&quot;  33rd over: England 93-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 61, Compton 29) Eighteen minutes remain today.  34th over: England 101-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 69, Compton 31) With very little happening, MS Dhoni turns to Sachin Tendulkar. Cook helps himself to consecutive boundaries from terrible deliveries; the second of those brings up the hundred partnership. Cook has been outstanding. &quot;If the follow-on isn&apos;t enforced in this situation, it never is,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Yet I wonder if Dhoni wouldn&apos;t have been better advised to have his batsmen run up and down the pitch and set England 550 in five sessions? If England can get through to tea tomorrow three down and level, the game&apos;s complexion will begin to change.&quot;  35th over: England 105-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 70, Compton 32)If I fall asleep on the job, I apologise.  36th over: England 109-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 74, Compton 33) The Tendulkar experiement eds after one over, with Ashwin returning to the attack. He should sneak in two overs before the close. Cook hits a punishing drive through extra cover for his 13th four.  37th over: England 110-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 74, Compton 33) One more over and then we&apos;re done. &quot;Beefy talking big about how to play spin, not having a night watchman etc, but can&apos;t imagine he had a great record on the subcontinent?&quot; says James Robinson. &quot;Anyone know?&quot; On the contrary, his Test record in Asia was extremely good.  38th over: England 111-0 (need 330 to avoid an innings defeat; Cook 74, Compton 34) Compton survives Ashwin&apos;s final over to complete an excellent session for England. They are still in trouble\u00a0\u2013 219 runs behind \u2013 but they have a small chance of a draw thanks to a fine, disciplined partnership from Cook and Compton. I&apos;m off to see what else The Man has in store for me; see you tomorrow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/17/rory-mcilroy-dubai-world-championship", "sentences": ["&quot;I have won in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and now China at a WGC, so it would be good to add Dubai to that list."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-17T19:59:01Z", "title": "Rory McIlroy aims to cap stunning 2012 at Dubai World Championship", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "European Tour", "Ian Poulter", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "All that remains is for Rory McIlroy to cement the spectacular personal success of 2012 and even that may be unnecessary. McIlroy will remember this year as one in which he claimed a second major, confirmed his position as the world&apos;s finest golfer and played his part in the most stunning Ryder Cup win in living memory. The 23-year-old has also achieved the rare honour of winning golf&apos;s money list in both Europe and the United States. And when you throw in an imminent Nike deal, McIlroy has another $250m (\u00a3157.5m) reasons to be cheerful. The European Tour may be disappointed by the fact this week&apos;s Dubai World Championship will not begin with McIlroy&apos;s order of merit position under threat. Not so long ago Peter Hanson and Justin Rose held legitimate aspirations of toppling McIlroy in Europe. The Race to Dubai finale&apos;s organisers can at least take heart from a typically strong field, with McIlroy, Ian Poulter, Graeme McDowell, Rose, Lee Westwood, Luke Donald and Sergio Garc\u00eda all turning out in the Emirate state. Completing a full European Ryder Cup team complement; Hanson, Paul Lawrie, Francesco Molinari, Nicolas Colsaerts and Martin Kaymer are also in the 60-man event. &quot;I&apos;ve come close a couple of times in the Race to Dubai,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I was second in 2009 and second last year, so to finally be able to win the Race to Dubai is big. For me it&apos;s very special. It was one of my goals at the start of the year and to be able to achieve it, not even having to play well the last couple of events, is nice.&quot; Rather than rest on his laurels, the Northern Irishman is already planning next year&apos;s progress. &quot;We are always trying to get better,&quot; he said. &quot;That doesn&apos;t necessarily mean you have to overhaul your game or try and change your swing in any way. But just make improvements on different aspects of the game, whether that be your bunker play or your chipping from semi-rough or your ability to hit the shot left to right or right to left. &quot;There&apos;s always different aspects of the game that you can improve, and I&apos;m going to try to keep doing that obviously, and I feel I&apos;ve gradually progressed and gradually improved every year that I&apos;ve been a pro. That&apos;s definitely something that I still want to do in 2013.&quot; Like McIlroy Poulter is focused on a strong end to the season having won the WGC HSBC Champions event in China at the beginning of this month. &quot;I don&apos;t know what it is about this time of the year, I seem to perform very well at the end of the year,&quot; the Englishman said. &quot;I have won in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and now China at a WGC, so it would be good to add Dubai to that list. &quot;It [the Earth] is a golf course that I like very much and have played very well on in the past, so it will be nice to go there in very good form and see if I can pick up that trophy. &quot;I always come into this time of the year very focused and I always try to take a little break in September/October before playing these big events and it seems to refresh me a little bit and really focus me on the end of the season.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/17/kimi-raikkonen-f1-us-grand-prix", "sentences": ["But the rumours about a return started to build a momentum around the time of last year&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-17T21:09:27Z", "title": "Throwback Kimi Raikkonen inhales atmosphere of F1's bygone era", "tags": ["Formula One", "Motor sport", "Kimi Raikkonen", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "Paul Weaver Austin It was Nico Rosberg who did the outing. We had been talking about his father, Keke, who lifted the 1982 Formula One word championship in 1982, despite winning only one race. Rosberg junior, recalling the Flying Finn&apos;s win in Dallas in 1984, said: &quot;It was 40 degrees and while the other drivers wore refrigerated suits, Dad was bare-chested in the sun, smoking a cigarette.&quot; Old fashioned expressions were exchanged but no one smoked in the paddock these days. Surely there had not been a smoker in the sport since Jan Magnussen in the late 1990s. &quot;No, you&apos;re wrong,&quot; said Rosberg. &quot;There&apos;s one driver who lights one cigarette after another. I&apos;m not naming names.&quot; But who could this be? This is F1 2012 and today&apos;s drivers look like toothpicks in overalls. They have never been this fit. We spend as much time talking to Jenson Button about his triathlons as we do discussing his racing. Surely no one in F1 actually smokes? And then someone mentioned the name of Kimi Raikkonen, the party animal, and everyone started sniggering. &quot;Yes, that&apos;s it, it must be Kimi!&quot; This, of course, may have been an awful slander. Raikkonen may not smoke at all. But, somehow, the notion fitted. Because the Finn is the throwback driver in the paddock. In the last race, in Abu Dhabi, his race engineer came on the radio to tell him about Fernando Alonso, who was chasing him down in his Ferrari. The Finn, the world champion of 2007, did not take kindly to that. &quot;Just leave me alone,&quot; he said, impatiently. &quot;I know what I&apos;m doing.&quot; Later in the afternoon the same engineer, this time a little more nervously, decided to make another communication, this time telling him to remember to warm up his new set of tyres. &quot;Yes, yes, yes, yes,&quot; came the irritated response. &quot;I&apos;m doing all the tyres. You don&apos;t have to remind me every second.&quot; After the race, when the 33-year-old Raikkonen had won a grand prix for the 19th time, Button reflected on his old rival. &quot;I don&apos;t speak to him very often because I don&apos;t normally get an answer. He&apos;s a man of few words. But I flew back from Korea to Japan with him recently and I had a couple of beers with him and he opened up. He&apos;s a good guy.&quot; But why is he so quiet? Maybe he was shy, Button was asked. &quot;I think he&apos;s insecure,&quot; he said. &quot;But he really deserved to win. He&apos;s been so close all year and I&apos;ve been saying all year that Lotus are going to win a race. I just didn&apos;t say it at Abu Dhabi. Kimi is a true racer. He came back for the racing, which is great. He doesn&apos;t enjoy anything else in the sport, it seems, apart from the party afterwards if he wins. So I&apos;m happy for him. He hasn&apos;t been in that position for a while.&quot; Raikkonen, unlike Michael Schumacher, is the world champion who proved it was possible to come back. He left F1 at the end of the 2009 season, though he had a contract with Ferrari for 2010. He is one of the few people in the paddock who knows what it is like to drive in America. Last year he tried his hand at Nascar. In April 2011 he signed a deal with the Toyota team Kyle Busch Motorsports to drive a less than full schedule in the Camping World Truck Series. It was, it must be said, less than a complete success. On his debut, at Charlotte Motor Speedway, he qualified 31st out of a field of 37. He was never to make a strong impression in the sport. He also appeared lost to F1. There was talk about a lack of motivation \u2013 even when he was one of the leading lights in the paddock there were worries about his long-term commitment to the sport. But the rumours about a return started to build a momentum around the time of last year&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix. Williams, it was said, would sign him for the following year. But he went to Lotus. And though everyone was talking about his quick team-mate Romain Grosjean at the start of the season (they are still talking about him, but more about his crashes than his triumphs) it has been Raikkonen who has produced an impressively consistent season. And if does smoke, everyone will turn a blind eye. When you are as good as he is you can get away with almost anything. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has underlined the importance of the American market to Formula One after the sport&apos;s returns to the United States. &quot;To be a true world championship you&apos;ve got to have a race in America,&quot; he said. &quot;And for the first time ever we&apos;ve got a circuit that&apos;s specifically made to bring out the best and showcase Formula One cars. &quot;In some ways it&apos;s surprising for us to see how much interest there is in the US, how much knowledge there is about Formula One, how the city has come alive with Formula One coming into Texas. So this is a crucial race for Red Bull.

There was a famous ad for the classic film Easy Rider, which went: &quot;A man who went looking for America and couldn&apos;t find it anywhere.&quot; Formula One has been looking for a permanent home in America for more than half a century, but without success. Watkins Glen appeared to provide the answer, staging the US Grand Prix for 19 years before the circuit was betrayed by a lack of investment. Sunday represented a triumph for both the sport and the nation. America knows how to put on a show and on their first track specifically built for the purposes of F1 came a magnificent triumph, a fine race played out before a near sell-out crowd with a strong Mexican flavour. They loved the cambers and corners, the undulations and the brilliance of the driving, even if some Americans may not have recognised the fact that sections of the circuit were based on parts of Silverstone, Hockenheim and Istanbul, with other evocative suggestions too. In his famous play, The Melting Pot, Israel Zangwill wrote: &quot;America is God&apos;s Crucible, the great melting pot where all the races of Europe are melting and reforming\u2026.&quot; He probably wasn&apos;t writing about Formula One races, though he could have been. But the biggest triumph of all belonged to Lewis Hamilton, his fourth of the season, his first since Italy in September and the 21st of his thrilling career. Considering reliability issues cost him victory in Singapore and Abu Dhabi, and pitlane cock-ups early in the season deprived him of further countless points, this was a win that was absolutely deserved. In S\u00e3o Paulo next weekend it should be a three-way contest between him, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso, the three best drivers in the world. Alas, that is not to be, but at least Hamilton is in the mood to end the season on a high and remind his employers of what they will be missing next year. While Red Bull won the constructors&apos; championship for the third year running here, a truly remarkable achievement for such a young team, Vettel and Alonso will contest the drivers&apos; title in Brazil next Sunday, where rain may add to an already unpredictable race. Vettel, his lead extended by three points to 13 after coming second on Sunday, to Alonso&apos;s third, only has to finish in the top four to nail his hat-trick of crowns. While Vettel&apos;s 100th Grand Prix did not end as he might have wished, this was an excellent day for McLaren, with Jenson Button working his way from 12th to fifth with a committed and sometimes vivid drive, carving his way through the field with his long-lasting, harder tyres. Vettel, from pole, made his customary fast breakaway but there was early frustration for Hamilton who, starting on the dirty side of the track, quickly lost his second place to Mark Webber. But by lap four the Brit had got some heat into his tyres and started to produce some of the breathtaking form that had seen him get to within 0.1 seconds of Vettel in qualifying. He was particularly fast in sector one and regained his second place by passing Webber before closing in on the reigning champion. He soon cut the time between himself and the German to just 2.1 seconds, and started to view DRS country. &quot;This is excellent, Lewis,&quot; he was told over the team radio. On lap 17 something excellent happened to Alonso, too: Webber dropped out of the race with a Kers issue. This promoted the Spaniard to third and Kimi Raikkonen, who drove with something of his storming Abu Dhabi form, up to fourth, though he was then slowed by a poor stop. Hamilton fell back behind Vettel by over three seconds and it was no surprise when he came in at the end of lap 20 for fresh rubber. It was a fast change too, just 2.4 seconds. Alonso then pitted and it was a tardy stop, with a problem with the right rear wheel. Alonso also had another problem, with Button placing the Spaniard under pressure to keep his place. At the sharp end, meanwhile, Hamilton once again narrowed the gap between himself and Vettel and finally, on the 42nd lap, he made a DRS-assisted pass to take the lead on the long straight. Vettel took the inside line, only to see Hamilton take the long way round, shooting through on the outside before braking late to secure his advantage. The crowd loved that. So did Hamilton as he jumped up and down so vigorously that his Pirelli stetson almost fell off. You could feel the immensity of his relief."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/18/lewis-hamilton-us-f1-grand-prix", "sentences": ["Hamilton, who was robbed of victory in Singapore and Abu Dhabi because of technical issues, stroked his McLaren car in the last three laps in the hope he would not be struck by more gremlins."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-18T22:26:51Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton gains 'huge satisfaction' from US F1 Grand Prix win", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Formula One 2012", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "US sports", "Sport", "Sebastian Vettel", "Fernando Alonso", "Red Bull", "McLaren"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton explained on Sunday night how he coaxed his car home to win the first United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of Americas and keep alive the Formula One world title pursuit until the final race in S\u00e3o Paulo next week.

Hamilton, who was robbed of victory in Singapore and Abu Dhabi because of technical issues, stroked his McLaren car in the last three laps in the hope he would not be struck by more gremlins. &quot;I rubbed the car and said &apos;Come on baby, we can make it&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s been a great weekend and a great feeling to have won the first race here, as I won the last one in America five years ago.&quot; Red Bull won the constructors&apos; championship on Sunday but Vettel&apos;s hopes for a third drivers&apos; title will have to wait until Brazil next Sunday, when he will go into the final race of the season with a 13-point lead. Hamilton added: &quot;I&apos;m not fighting for the world championship \u2013 I&apos;m just having fun. It gives me a huge amount of satisfaction to be able to beat Red Bull and Sebastian. They were incredibly strong but we were able to do it. &quot;First-time winner! I&apos;m so happy. The fans were amazing. It was such a warm welcome and one of the best, if not the best, race of the year \u2013 especially for me and the team. It&apos;s been a long time since we had a win.&quot; Graciously accepting runner-up spot as well as looking ahead to next week&apos;s season finale, Vettel said: &quot;It was clear that Lewis Hamilton was the man we were racing today. But the car is working well and good enough to fight for the win. We&apos;ve been quick in Brazil the last couple of years, and I have extended my lead in the championship, so we are in a good position.&quot; There was controversy before the race when Ferrari decided to break the seal on Felipe Massa&apos;s gearbox. This gave him a five-place grid penalty, promoting team-mate Alonso to seventh place and, more importantly, to the cleaner side of the track. This, and Mark Webber&apos;s retirement, helped Alonso to another points-salvaging podium finish.

Radical and often ill-advised changes in lifestyle have become the calling cards of the midlife crisis, but if it is more than a myth, then humans may not be the only animals to experience it.  Now an international team of scientists claims to have found evidence for a slump in wellbeing among middle-aged chimpanzees and orangutans. The lull in happiness in the middle years, they say, is the great ape equivalent of the midlife crisis. The study, which was published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has raised eyebrows among some scientists, but according to the authors, the findings suggest that the midlife crisis may have its roots in the biology humans share with our closest evolutionary cousins. &quot;There&apos;s a common understanding that there&apos;s a dip in wellbeing in middle age, and that&apos;s been found in many datasets across human cultures,&quot; Alex Weiss, a psychologist at Edinburgh University, told the Guardian. &quot;We took a step back and asked whether it&apos;s possible that instead of the midlife crisis being human-specific, and driven only by social factors, it reflects some evolved tendency for middle-aged individuals to have lower wellbeing,&quot; he said. The team from the US, Japan, Germany and the UK asked zookeepers, carers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals. The forms included questions about each ape&apos;s mood, the enjoyment they gained from socialising, and their success at achieving certain goals. The final question asked how carers would feel about being the ape for a week. They scored their answers from one to seven. More than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups. The first two groups were chimpanzees, with the third made up of orangutans from Sumatra or Borneo. The animals came from zoos, sanctuaries and research centres in the US, Australia, Japan, Canada and Singapore. When the researchers analysed the questionnaires, they found that wellbeing in the apes fell in middle age and climbed again as the animals moved into old age. In captivity, great apes often live to 50 or more. The nadir in the animals&apos; wellbeing occurred, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans. &quot;In all three groups we find evidence that wellbeing is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that roughly corresponds to midlife in humans,&quot; Weiss said. &quot;On average, wellbeing scores are lowest when animals are around 30 years old.&quot; The team explains that the temporary fall in ape wellbeing may result from more depressed apes dying younger, or through age-related changes in the brain that are mirrored in humans. Weiss conceded that, unlike men, great apes are not known to pursue radical and often disastrous lifestyle changes in middle age. Robin Dunbar, professor of evolutionary psychology at Oxford University, was dubious about the findings. &quot;What can produce a sense of wellbeing or contentedness that varies across the lifespan like this? It&apos;s hard to see anything in an ape&apos;s life that would have that sort of pattern, that they would cogitate about. They&apos;re not particularly good at seeing far ahead into the future, that&apos;s one of the big differences between them and us.&quot; Alexandra Freund, professor of psychology at the University of Zurich, was also sceptical. She said the concept of a midlife crisis was shaky even in humans. &quot;In my reading of the literature, there is no evidence for the midlife crisis. If there&apos;s any indication of decline in emotional or subjective wellbeing it is very small and in many studies, it&apos;s not there at all.&quot; But Weiss believes the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience. &quot;If we want to find the answer as to what&apos;s going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/hamas-leaves-israel-no-choice", "sentences": ["The restrictions were only implemented two years after Israel left Gaza, when it was clear that instead of building a &quot;Singapore of the Middle East&quot;, Hamas was interested in importing stockpiles of weapons from places like Iran."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-19T20:15:00Z", "title": "Hamas leaves Israel no choice | Danny Ayalon", "tags": ["Israel", "Hamas", "Gaza", "Palestinian territories", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Arab and Middle East unrest"], "article": "Hamas&apos;s charter includes the aspiration that &quot;The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews (killing the Jews)&quot;. While many concentrate on its death-cult worship, its bloodthirsty killing of adversaries, or its contempt for women, Christians and homosexuals, it is this aspiration for genocide that is at the root of Hamas activities. This is the primary reason why Hamas, the governing regime in Gaza, will never recognise or accept a peace accord with Israel in any form. Since Israel left Gaza in 2005, thousands of rockets have rained down on Israeli cities and towns in deliberate contravention not just of international law, but all humanity and morality. While some might suggest the so-called blockade is the cause of the attacks, it is actually a consequence. The restrictions were only implemented two years after Israel left Gaza, when it was clear that instead of building a &quot;Singapore of the Middle East&quot;, Hamas was interested in importing stockpiles of weapons from places like Iran. Instead of building a future for its people, Hamas built an open-air prison for the million and a half inhabitants who fell into its grasp. However, Gaza was never enough for an organisation whose raison d&apos;etre is the annihilation of Israel, and whose charter begins with the ominous warning that &quot;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it&quot;. Every rocket from Gaza is a double war crime. First, the rockets are aimed at civilians; second, they are fired from built-up civilian areas, often close to schools, mosques and hospitals. And about 10% of Hamas rockets fired from Gaza don&apos;t reach Israel, exploding in Gaza. Mohammed Sadallah \u2013 a four-year-old killed on Saturday, his body displayed in a press conference with Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas&apos;s leader \u2013 was, according to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, most likely killed by an errant Hamas rocket. Hamas leaders frequently declare that their people actively seek death. Fathi Hamad, a senior member of Hamas, stated in 2008 that &quot;for the Palestinian people, death became an industry, at which women and children excel. Accordingly we created a human shield of women, children and elderly. We seek death as you [Israelis] desire life.&quot; Hamas seeks conflagration and war. Death and destruction is seen as a win-win calculation, as any Israeli death is considered a glorious achievement and every Palestinian death that of a &quot;holy martyr&quot;, providing badly needed propaganda locally and internationally. Seemingly there are not enough deaths for them, so Hamas&apos;s military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, has been busy sending out pictures of massacres in Syria, claiming they were taken in Gaza. Israel has been left with little choice but to root out this nest of hate and destruction. No nation on earth would allow a third of its population to live in constant fear of incessant fire emanating from a neighbouring territory. Our government exercised restraint. We gave the international community time to act. However, there was a deafening silence, demonstrating to Israelis that we had to take action to protect our citizens. Those who refused to condemn the attacks on Israeli citizens have no right to condemn Israel&apos;s response to establish peace and quiet for its citizens. This is the basic obligation of any sovereign nation, and we will continue taking any action necessary to achieve this aim. In the face of this undeniable truth, the usual accusation is that Israel is responding with &quot;disproportionate force&quot; or carrying out &quot;collective punishment&quot;. I urge all who make this accusation to consider that Israel has successfully targeted in excess of 1,300 weapons caches, rocket launchers and other elements of Hamas&apos;s terrorist infrastructure. Yet despite this, the number of Palestinian casualties remains around one for every 13 strikes, the majority killed being active members of Hamas and combatants. Israel will not allow its citizens&apos; lives to be endangered. The international community must call on the Palestinian leadership in the Gaza Strip to take the same approach with its own people. \u2022 Comments for this article will be opened on Tuesday morning"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/nov/19/london-2012-olympic-stadium", "sentences": ["Lord Coe, meanwhile, was understandably fixated on ensuring the athletics legacy he promised in Singapore was delivered and so could live with building an 80,000 seat semi-permanent stadium that left all options open."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-19T22:02:00Z", "title": "London 2012's golden memories at risk of turning into stadium shamble | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Olympic Stadium", "West Ham United", "Boris Johnson", "Sport", "Sport politics", "Olympic Games"], "article": "It already seems a long time ago. At one point during Danny Boyle&apos;s madcap, moving Olympics opening ceremony in July the band struck up a few bars of I&apos;m Forever Blowing Bubbles as giant soapy spheres wafted across the delirious crowd. As a process last week labelled by one of those intimately involved as the &quot;Stratford farce&quot; reaches yet another crunch point, it could be almost four years before Bubbles is heard at the Olympic Stadium again \u2013 if at all. Three days after West Ham United submitted their &quot;best and final&quot; offer to become the stadium&apos;s main tenants, the Guardian understands that the 17-strong London Legacy Development Corporation board remains split over the two remaining options on the table. One would see the LLDC spend around \u00a3190m converting the \u00a3429m stadium \u2013 currently a shell with no permanent facilities \u2013 into a venue suitable for both athletics and winter sports, with a new cantilevered roof, hospitality boxes and retractable seats that would slide over an athletics track that was preserved after a bitterly fought campaign. Project managers have estimated it would take until 2015 at the earliest, and quite possibly 2016, to open it again. The other, favoured by some board members, would see just \u00a338m spent on swiftly turning the stadium into a permanent, &quot;multi-use&quot; home for athletics, concerts and other sports and \u2013 after six years of prevarication, legal challenges, ill feeling and political wrangling \u2013 finally consign the idea of a top-flight football team moving to E20 to history. Rather than boarding the stadium up for another four years and letting the golden memories fade, they argue it is best to appoint an experienced stadium operator such as AEG or LiveNation and let them get on with it \u2013 even if it requires a modest ongoing public subsidy. Under that plan, the stadium that proved itself so spectacularly during the summer could be open by spring 2014. London&apos;s mayor, Boris Johnson, is clear where he stands: &quot;Londoners have to be a little bit patient and recognise this thing was not built to be the kind of omni-permanent, world-class stadium capable of hosting Premiership football that it should be. There is a clear choice for us all. Do we want to rush ahead for a reopening? Or do we want to deliver the adaptations that will deliver a world-class facility?&quot; For many &quot;omni-permanent&quot; is not the phrase that springs to mind when the stadium issue is raised but omni-shambles. The inability of successive governments, City Hall administrations and officials to square the stadium circle has always made it among the most troubling of London 2012&apos;s legacy promises. Back in 2007 the option of continuing negotiations with Premier League football clubs in a bid to secure a tenant for after the Games was closed off. With the twin spectres of the Picketts Lock fiasco and the cost and construction overruns at Wembley fresh in the mind, and desperate to ensure that the budget did not spiral further, Tessa Jowell, the then culture secretary, and others on the Olympic board were keen to get on with construction. Lord Coe, meanwhile, was understandably fixated on ensuring the athletics legacy he promised in Singapore was delivered and so could live with building an 80,000 seat semi-permanent stadium that left all options open. &quot;Today with hindsight would you have done a Manchester City solution? Maybe, but that would have cost quite a lot more. At that time our focus was on keeping within budget and keeping the costs down,&quot; former ODA chairman John Armitt has admitted. Jowell argues West Ham&apos;s interest was never serious and did not add up for the taxpayer. But Richard Caborn, the former sports minister who was the only dissenting voice against closing down the option of a dual-use stadium when the decision was made at a meeting of the Olympic board in February 2007, remains convinced they were in too much of a hurry to do so. &quot;The Olympics were a fantastic success, but this is the one area where we got it fundamentally wrong. I put the argument for a multi-sport stadium that would be like the Stade de France, but 10 to 15 years on and I was shouted down. We should have learned lessons from every previous Olympics, including Sydney, and of our own success with the Commonwealth Games stadium in Manchester,&quot; he said. &quot;It could have been an example of how you maintain the legacy in a cost effective stadium, using hi-tech materials and our engineering expertise.&quot; When the coalition government came into power, the sports minister Hugh Robertson and Johnson were convinced that only top-flight football could maintain the future of the stadium without public subsidy. Baroness Ford, chair of the LLDC&apos;s predecessor, the Olympic Park Legacy Company, was also committed to trying to find a solution that did not involve going back to the 25,000-capacity &quot;base case&quot; \u2013 a vaguely depressing, windswept athletics track with no roof. The next attempt to find a workable solution involved a tender for a long-term lease that dissolved into a bitter, fractious battle between Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham. The former proposed ripping out the track and replacing it with a football-only facility while the east London club pledged to keep it and teamed up with UK Athletics and Newham Council. West Ham were duly awarded the stadium, with the decision to keep the track justified to some extent by London&apos;s victory in the race to host the 2017 world athletics championships. But a crucial mistake in failing to anticipate the possibility of a challenge under European state aid rules - which some involved now insist they flagged up earlier in the process to no avail - left the scheme mired in &quot;legal paralysis&quot;. A new plan, to retain public ownership of the stadium but offer rental agreements to anchor tenants, was drawn up and has also been subject to interminable delay. As it was decided to plump for the full bells-and-whistles conversion if top-flight football were to be hosted at the stadium, the question became how to plug the funding gap. West Ham were reluctant to offer more than \u00a310m upfront, plus an RPI linked \u00a32.5m a year in rent, arguing that as tenants they could not be expected to fund the conversion alone. They argued they were also in effect contributing an extra \u00a36m a year through the uplift the LLDC would receive to any naming rights and catering contracts. The club argued they would have to give up many of their revenue streams and clear their debt before moving because they would no longer have anything on which to secure it. West Ham believe they are being unfairly characterised as being handed a public asset for nothing when they are riding to its rescue. They argue that they will place the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on the world stage and bring greater footfall and focus. And given that they will now be only one of a number of tenants and occupy the stadium for perhaps just 25 days a year, they will still have a job to do in selling the move to their supporters even if they get the go ahead. LLDC and City Hall insiders raised eyebrows at those figures. As well as selling the idea of largely funding a \u00a3190m conversion from the public purse, it would also have to pay at least \u00a32.5m a year in operational costs to cope with the crowds for Premier League football. There was also some frustration at West Ham&apos;s negotiating tactics and a culture clash between public sector procurement processes and the economics of Premier League football, plus the inscrutability of the club&apos;s owners as to their future plans. Some on the LLDC board were left wondering whether it was all worth it. The lack of clarity and competing agendas that have clouded the process to date have left Johnson, now chair of the LLDC board, and Dennis Hone, the ODA chief executive who has taken on the same role at the LLDC, with an unenviable task. The majority, led by Johnson, continue to believe that a future involving West Ham, athletics, concerts and other one-off events including cricket and rugby is the best solution. They will have to convince the remaining waverers that West Ham&apos;s final offer, believed to be a &quot;significant&quot; improvement on the \u00a310m originally tendered, is sufficient testament of the seriousness of the east London club&apos;s intentions. Yet another factor is the involvement of Newham Council and its mayor Sir Robin Wales, a West Ham season ticket holder who sees the stadium as a driver of regeneration. As part of West Ham&apos;s original collapsed bid it promised a \u00a340m loan towards the then \u00a395m conversion costs. That offer remains on the table but it is understood that the loan could be extended to around \u00a370m to help plug the funding gap. In return the council would expect an increased return and further community access. The reason the conversion costs have soared is because LLDC is determined to make the stadium&apos;s future as flexible as possible, along the lines of the 365-day-a-year model favoured by US operators. In-depth talks were held with US sports owners and stadium operators around the recent NFL tie at Wembley. That requires a complex solution removing the existing 25,000-seat section (originally designed as the only permanent feature) to install retractable seats and constructing a new cantilevered roof over the top of the upper tier (originally designed to be removed after the Games) before installing permanent facilities and corporate hospitality. The other bids \u2013 from Leyton Orient, a football business school and an ambitious but unlikely plan to bring formula one to the Olympic Park \u2013 will not detain them for long. The school can happen regardless, Orient depends on the decision taken on West Ham in any case and the F1 scheme is likely to stall on the starting grid. &quot;The cost of doing the stadium up in the way the country would expect after the Olympics, the cost of producing a world class stadium is considerable. It was not designed for football. A decision was taken a long time ago not to do it that way,&quot; argues Johnson, distancing himself from the sins of his predecessors. But it is precisely the fact that the broad consensus and bold thinking that characterised the rest of the Olympic project has failed to apply to perhaps its most iconic landmark that has landed him in this predicament in the first place. Whichever way they jump, and the West Ham option must remain favourite given Johnson&apos;s enthusiasm, they will face a tough job to sell their decision to a public bemused by the Byzantine history and cost of the project. Meanwhile the mothballed stadium is already starting to look a little unloved on its Stratford island. The &quot;pixels&quot; that lit up the ceremonies have gone, the big screens have come down, the controversial wrap has been removed, the cauldron dismantled and its &quot;petals&quot; returned to Olympic teams around the world. If they can hit their latest deadline of reaching a decision before the end of the year after discussing their next move at a board meeting on 5 December, Hone and Johnson will then have an equally hard job on their hands: ensuring the ongoing farrago does not burst the popular image of the Olympics as a bubble of golden success."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/20/students-raw-deal-britain-protesting", "sentences": ["This showed that spending by UK businesses on research and development had actually fallen as a proportion of GDP between 1995 and 2008, during which time it had been overtaken by Australia, Belgium, China, Denmark, Iceland, Singapore, and the EU27 average."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-20T10:20:01Z", "title": "Students get a raw deal in Britain \u2013 no wonder they're protesting | Howard Hotson", "tags": ["Tuition fees", "Higher education", "University funding", "Education", "Students", "Protest", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "Two years ago, the threat of radically escalating tuition fees prompted student demonstrations on a scale not seen for decades. This term, that threat has become a reality, and on Wednesday students will take to the streets again. Is their protest justified? Much depends on one&apos;s view of the document that touched off the protests of 2010: the Browne review. The Independent Review of Higher Education Funding and Student Finance, to use its official title, was instructed by government to &quot;examine the balance of contributions to higher education funding by taxpayers, students, graduates and employers&quot;. A quick review of some basic statistics shows how well it fulfilled this official remit. Assessing the contribution of taxpayers to higher education in the UK was not difficult. The obvious point of departure was Table B2.4 of the OECD&apos;s annual compilation of educational statistics, Education at a Glance for 2010. There, any competent investigator could have found that, proportionate to its economy, the UK was spending less public money on higher education than any other western European country aside from Italy, less than Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Mexico or Brazil, and less than half as much as Denmark, Finland, Canada, and Sweden. All told, UK public higher education spending was 30% below the OECD average and 40% below the EU19 average, ranking 27th out of the 35 countries for which statistics were provided. Yet this paltry level of higher education spending bought UK taxpayers one of the best university systems in the world. Cross-referencing to the Times Higher World University Rankings would have suggested that UK taxpayers enjoyed nearly twice as many top-200 universities for every unit of public HE expenditure as their nearest rival (the Netherlands) and four times as many as the US. All told, funding arrangements pre-Browne arguably offered UK taxpayers the sweetest deal in the world. To examine industry&apos;s contribution to the UK knowledge economy in 2010, the committee should have turned to Table 24 of the OECD&apos;s Main Science and Technology Indicators. This showed that spending by UK businesses on research and development had actually fallen as a proportion of GDP between 1995 and 2008, during which time it had been overtaken by Australia, Belgium, China, Denmark, Iceland, Singapore, and the EU27 average. Overall, the UK was ranked 18th worldwide by this measure, at less than half the level of Finland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, and Switzerland. Industry was not pulling its weight. What about students and graduates? Googling &quot;higher education&quot; and &quot;affordability&quot; would have taken the committee to a widely cited Canadian study of 2005 which meticulously calculated the affordability of the world&apos;s leading university systems by adding together the costs to the student before and after graduation, deducting all forms of financial aid and correcting for average ability to pay. Its conclusion? Of the 16 countries studied, the UK scored 14th, below the US and above only New Zealand and Japan. By international standards, British students and graduates were suffering. Why are these statistics so unfamiliar? Because none of them is found in the Browne review. Either Lord Browne&apos;s committee remained ignorant of these basic data, or they suppressed them from their report, since they were difficult to reconcile with their two key recommendations: to cut public spending still further, and to raise English tuition fees to the highest average level of any public university system in the world. One way or another, they failed to fulfil their basic obligation to &quot;examine the balance of contributions to higher education&quot; on the most rudimentary empirical basis. By what standard is this new funding formula &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;balanced&quot;? One answer is provided by the &quot;comprehensive assessment of the lives and wellbeing of children and adolescents in economically advanced nations&quot; published by Unicef in 2007. This study draws together 40 separate measures of the lives and rights of children and adolescents in 21 wealthy countries. It then groups the results &quot;under six different headings or dimensions: material wellbeing, health and safety, education, peer and family relationships, behaviours and risks and young people&apos;s own subjective sense of wellbeing.&quot; On the resulting international report card on young people&apos;s wellbeing, the UK scores dead last. The British government, it appears, has devised a new &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;balanced&quot; university funding regime culturally suited to the UK&apos;s status as the least child-friendly country in the developed world. Is it any wonder students are taking to the streets? The NUS is not demanding an end to fees. It merely wants &quot;a properly funded tertiary education system&quot;. That we no longer have one is due, in large measure, to the fact that the Browne review failed to &quot;examine the balance of contributions to higher education&quot; thoroughly, competently, candidly and on the basis of the best available empirical evidence. \u2022 Howard Hotson is writing in a personal capacity"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/nov/20/social-enterprise-network-daily", "sentences": ["DBS Bank offers free service to social enterprises Shanghai Daily: DBS Bank China, a subsidiary of Singapore-based DBS Bank, launched free banking services today for social enterprises."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-20T11:50:54Z", "title": "Social enterprise network daily: Tuesday 20 November", "tags": ["Social enterprises"], "article": "UniCredit Tiriac Bank grants EUR 35,000 for social enterprises Business Review: The UniCredit Foundation and UniCredit Tiriac Bank, in partnership with the NESst Foundation Romania, will provide EUR 35,000 in financing for the winning projects of the your choice, your project competition, which sustains the development of local social entrepreneurs.

The execution \u2013 carried out days before the fourth anniversary of the attacks \u2013 was the first in India since 2004 and only the third in the past 17 years. The Indian minister for home affairs, Sushil Kumar Shinde, announced the execution, saying the president, Pranab Mukherjee, had turned down Kasab&apos;s appeal for clemency. &quot;It was decided then that on 21 November at 7.30 in the morning he would be hanged. That procedure has been completed today,&quot; Shinde told reporters on Wednesday morning. Kasab, 24, was the only survivor of the group of gunmen who killed more than 160 people over three days in a string of attacks targeting luxury hotels, a railway station, tourist cafes and a Jewish centre. A photograph of Kasab walking through Mumbai&apos;s main railway station with an AK-47 assault rifle and a rucksack crammed with ammunition became an enduring image of the attack. Sachin Kalbag, editor of Mumbai&apos;s popular MidDay newspaper, said news of the execution had brought &quot;considerable relief across the city and joy in some pockets where the most murders were committed. &quot;Any happiness is not over the execution but because there is now some kind of closure for the families of those who died that day,&quot; he said. Leaders of Lashkar-e-Taiba \u2013 the extremist group blamed by India for the attacks \u2013 said Kasab &quot;was a hero and will inspire other fighters to follow his path&quot;. The Pakistan Taliban said they were shocked by the hanging. &quot;There is no doubt that it&apos;s very shocking news and a big loss that a Muslim has been hanged on Indian soil,&quot; a spokesman told Reuters. Others in Pakistan said the execution of Kasab would make it harder to prosecute those who co-ordinated the attack by mobile phone from a house in Karachi, the southern Pakistani port city. &quot;If we are to go after the network we have to have living evidence, but now we only have what is in the files,&quot; said Khalid Munir, a retired army colonel. &quot;[Kasab] may have only been an operator, a foot soldier for those guiding him, but he could have given more information, given evidence in the Pakistani courts. The Bombay case ends here,&quot; he said. Pakistan&apos;s interior minister, Rehman Malik, has in the past said the country has been unable to take action against Hafiz Saeed, the cleric accused of heading Lashkar-e-Taiba, because evidence provided by India is &quot;vague and insufficient&quot;. Delhi has denied the claim. Talat Masood, a former general, said the more important problem was a lack of political will in Pakistan. &quot;If they were really determined they could punish these people, but the problem is the weakness of the state,&quot; he said. &quot;They think that at the moment they can&apos;t afford an angry reaction from the militants.&quot; Pakistan has denied that its security agencies are in any way connected to the attack and says it is prosecuting seven suspected militants for their role. Testimony to American and Indian investigators from David Headley, a Pakistani-American involved in the plot, implicated junior officials within the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan&apos;s main military security agency. There was no evidence that senior officials had knowledge of the plot, or at least its full extent, Headley indicated. Human rights groups criticised the execution. &quot;The hanging of Ajmal Kasab marks a concerning end to [India&apos;s] moratorium on capital punishment. Instead of resorting to the use of execution to address heinous crime, India should join the rising ranks of nations that have taken the decision to remove the death penalty from their legal frameworks,&quot; said Meenakshi Ganguly, the south Asia director of the campaign group Human Rights Watch. On Tuesday a United Nations committee adopted a draft resolution calling for a moratorium on capital punishment. India was among 36 countries \u2013 including Pakistan, the US, Singapore, Egypt, Japan, China and Sri Lanka \u2013 who opposed the resolution, citing the right of each sovereign nation to decide its own legal system. Few analysts thought the killing of Kasab would interfere with political efforts in Delhi and Islamabad to improve relations between the two countries. On Tuesday the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, ratified a long-planned relaxation of visa requirements for Indians travelling in Pakistan. Indian analysts, however, say a repeat attack like that of 2008 could bring about a war between the two countries and criticise precautions taken to prevent such an attack. The absence of sectarian violence after the attack has been seen as a testament to the strength of India&apos;s secular democracy. Dr Zafarul-Islam Khan, who runs the Delhi-based English-language Milli Gazette newspaper, said Indian Muslims had no &quot;concern&quot; for Kasab. &quot;Any terrorist should be hanged. He should have been executed long ago,&quot; Khan told the Guardian. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 November 2012 because the original described the Milli Gazette as an Urdu-language newspaper."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/21/singapore-least-emotional-country-poll", "sentences": ["Never mind its temperate 28C weather, low unemployment rate and high per-capita GDP \u2013 Singapore is the most emotionless society in the world, according to a new Gallup poll, beating the traditionally po-faced Georgia, Lithuania and Russia in a survey of more than 150 nations.", "Asking respondents questions such as &quot;Did you feel well-rested yesterday?&quot;, &quot;Were you treated with respect all day yesterday?&quot; and &quot;Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?&quot;, the survey found that Singaporeans were the least likely to reveal experiencing any emotions at all.", "Just 36% of Singaporeans reported feeling positive or negative emotions on a daily basis, while 60% of Filipinos recorded regularly feeling both \u2013 the highest response rate of any country worldwide.", "&quot;If you measure Singapore by the traditional indicators, they look like one of the best-run countries in the world,&quot; Gallup&apos;s Jon Clifton was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg report on the survey.", "&quot;But if you look at everything that makes life worth living, they&apos;re not doing so well.&quot; The poll&apos;s findings \u2013 released on Wednesday \u2013 soon went viral on the internet, where they became the butt of many jokes, not least among Singaporeans themselves.", "&quot;Singapore ranked most emotionless country in the world \u2013 not sure how to feel about that,&quot; ran a number of Singapore-based tweets.", "&quot;I use many emoticons to express how satisfied I am.&quot; Singapore&apos;s 5.2 million residents work \u2013 at 46.6 hours a week \u2013 the longest hours in the world, according to the ILO.", "While many Singaporeans seem to agree that the nation does indeed work excessively long hours, its population is not necessarily &quot;emotionless&quot;, said the Singaporean native Adrianna Tan."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-21T18:50:19Z", "title": "Singapore is world's least emotional country, poll finds", "tags": ["Singapore", "Philippines", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Never mind its temperate 28C weather, low unemployment rate and high per-capita GDP \u2013 Singapore is the most emotionless society in the world, according to a new Gallup poll, beating the traditionally po-faced Georgia, Lithuania and Russia in a survey of more than 150 nations.

Switzerland, in alliance with the tax havens of Luxembourg, Austria and Britain, is leading the charge to derail it. The battle now under way hinges on a powerful transparency principle called automatic information exchange. According to this, governments routinely tell each other about the cross-border assets and income of one another&apos;s citizens so they can tax them appropriately. This is the gold standard of transparency and the basis for a multilateral European scheme, the European Savings Tax Directive, which includes 42 European and other countries. This multilateral scheme is riddled with loopholes, but it is already up and running. Amendments to plug those loopholes are being prepared. A second pillar of the emerging architecture is run by the OECD, a club of rich countries that contains several tax havens (including Britain, which partly controls a number of major tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Jersey). The OECD scheme runs on a ridiculously weak transparency principle: information exchange on request. Here, you cannot make blanket information requests to a tax haven: you must ask, on a case-by-case basis. That means you effectively have to know the information you are looking for \u2013 before you ask for it. Precious little information flows through these narrow pipes. The OECD also runs a black, white and\u00a0grey list system of tax havens. To get a sense of how useful this list is, note that in April 2009, when G20 leaders declared that &quot;the era of banking secrecy is over&quot; and asked the OECD to lead the charge, the blacklist was empty within just five days. The G20 asked the OECD to drain a swamp \u2013 and it has been handing out drinking straws. The project helps at the margins, but is not a patch on the European scheme. The United States is creating a third pillar under its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which requires financial institutions to tell the authorities about foreign accounts held by American taxpayers. Like the European system, it runs on the principle of automatic information exchange and, although originally set up unilaterally, the US is now pushing for reciprocal arrangements with other countries. Over\u00a0time, one would expect rising co-operation and cross-linkages between the trailblazing US and European schemes, and with others. In August last year, Switzerland threw a huge spanner into the works. It signed bilateral tax deals \u2013 &quot;Rubik agreements&quot; \u2013 with Germany and Britain, based on a very different principle: wealthy people with Swiss accounts can preserve their secrecy and, instead, merely pay a one-off, withholding tax on assets, and a bit of future income. &quot;Trust us,&quot; say Swiss bankers \u2013 who have centuries of form helping the world&apos;s wealthy get around the rules of civilised society. The British tax authorities promised it would yield a tantalising bounty: a one-off \u00a34-\u00a37bn for cash-parched, austerity Britain. But the deals are riddled with catastrophic loopholes, some so egregious as to amount to signs planted in the text saying: &quot;Evade me here&quot;. You can skip around them with discretionary trusts, foundations, insurance wrappers, offshore companies and more \u2013 or just shift your wealth to Singapore. A forensic analysis by the Tax Justice Network last year revealed that Britain&apos;s Rubik would not raise even a tenth of the promised sum. The analysis was sent to HMRC, to the Swiss tax authorities, to Swiss bankers and to several tax advisers. None could refute it. HMRC&apos;s response? It has kept its head down. The Rubik project is a Swiss swindle \u2013 and a humiliation for this government. If successful it would, in the words of Professor Itai Grinberg of Georgetown University, &quot;stifle the emergence of multilateral automatic information exchange&quot;. The Swiss Bankers&apos; Association, which designed Rubik, has\u00a0explicitly admitted that its original purpose was &quot;to prevent&quot; automatic information exchange: in other words, to kill the European Savings Tax Directive. In particular, crucial and powerful amendments to plug the directive&apos;s loopholes are now held up because Luxembourg says it won&apos;t accept them if Germany and Britain (and now the tax haven of Austria, which has signed its own Rubik deal) get special bilateral treatment from Switzerland. This obstructionism was the plan all along. EU tax commissioner Algirdas Semeta recently slammed Luxembourg&apos;s and Austria&apos;s involvement in this political chess game. &quot;I cannot understand,&quot; he\u00a0said, &quot;that anyone would make even more difficult the consolidation efforts by Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain and many other member states by\u00a0holding up this issue.&quot; Thankfully, Germany&apos;s Bundesrat is widely expected to throw its Rubik deal\u00a0out in a vote on Friday. The deal, forcefully supported by finance minister\u00a0Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble for reasons best known to himself, has\u00a0been attacked by German opposition politicians. A top Green party\u00a0official called it &quot;a slap in the face for all honest\u00a0taxpayers&quot;; and the head of the centre-left Social Democratic party, has accused Swiss banks of engaging in\u00a0&quot;organised crime&quot;. If Germany rejects\u00a0the deal, as seems likely, Austria\u00a0will be easily dealt with, leaving Britain alone as the last big obstacle to progress in the greatest transparency project the world has seen. Chancellor George Osborne in his budget speech in April described tax evasion and avoidance as &quot;morally repugnant&quot;. But his tax deal with Switzerland, as a fiscally useless spoiler, is a tax evader&apos;s dream. This government must repudiate it\u00a0immediately. If it doesn&apos;t, Labour must commit to abolishing it \u2013 or hang\u00a0its own head in shame."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/23/london-2012-olympics-best-ever", "sentences": ["For example, by the time Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London 2012 bid committee, spoke at the host city election in Singapore in 2005, the London organisers already had a firm and highly detailed vision of what they wanted to deliver in 2012 and beyond."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-23T15:00:03Z", "title": "Was London 2012 the best Olympics ever? | Jacques Rogge", "tags": ["International Olympic Committee", "Sport", "Locog", "Olympic Games 2012", "Olympic legacy", "UK news", "Rio 2016", "Olympic Games"], "article": "The final Olympic Games of my 12-year term as president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were received with great fanfare this summer in London. Evidence of their success continues to reach me almost daily, as people ask were they the best Games in history? As much as it would please me simply to answer in the affirmative, I know such a response would be premature. My reply is always the same: let history be the judge. I say this not to take anything away from the thousands of people responsible for delivering London 2012, but to draw attention to the considerable importance the IOC places on legacy \u2013 what an Olympic host city leaves behind long after the 16 days of sporting competition are over. The Olympic Games are the largest sporting event in the world, and for most host cities they are the biggest and most complex project they will ever undertake. Their organisation affects the entire city and its population and often requires the co-operation and cohesive involvement of city leaders, regional and national authorities, Games organisers, local communities, commercial partners and all the members of the Olympic movement. The IOC actively encourages each city that bids for the Games to consider from the outset how it could make use of the event to bring positive, long-lasting benefits to its area and citizens. This sort of planning typically begins a decade beforehand. For example, by the time Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London 2012 bid committee, spoke at the host city election in Singapore in 2005, the London organisers already had a firm and highly detailed vision of what they wanted to deliver in 2012 and beyond. It included: the regeneration of a massive industrial wasteland in east London, providing the local community with world-class sporting venues to train and compete in; new parks and residential areas; better transport connections and infrastructure; employment and business opportunities; sustainable construction; an increase in volunteerism; and the creation of the next generation of sporting champions by inspiring young people everywhere to become more involved in physical activity. The organisation of the London Games cost around \u00a32bn, much of which was covered by the IOC and private funds. But local authorities earmarked a further \u00a39.3bn to leverage the Games as a catalyst for rapid city development and improvements, both tangible and intangible, that would otherwise have taken decades to achieve. London 2012 has already delivered on many of its promises and, by continuing to pursue others, we are optimistic that the people of London will benefit long into the future. The foundations for London&apos;s achievements were firmly built on the knowledge and expertise of previous Olympic organisers. Massive urban regeneration projects undertaken by Barcelona in 1992 and Sydney in 2000, environmental and sustainability standards set by the Lillehammer in 1994 and Vancouver in 2010, and programmes to encourage volunteerism and youth participation by the Beijing 2008 organisers are just a few of the success stories that London used as a springboard. As the link between past, present, and future host cities, the IOC assists Games organisers through a comprehensive transfer of knowledge . The organisers of forthcoming Games in Russia (Sochi, 2014), Brazil (Rio, 2016), and South Korea (PyeongChang, 2018) are already benefiting from the programme, which includes a debriefing on what worked well at previous Olympic Games and what could be improved. This week, it was London&apos;s turn to pass the torch to Rio de Janeiro. The debriefing focused on all aspects of Games operations. It was by no means meant to provide a cookie-cutter template for future hosts. Rather, it is intended to provide valuable lessons that host cities can adopt and adapt to fit their own unique circumstances. We encourage future Games organisers to innovate and expand on what they learn and ultimately improve upon the best practices of their predecessors. London managed to do exactly that in preparing for and delivering the Games of the XXX Olympiad. It may still be too soon to call them the greatest Games ever, but ask the same question again in 20 years and you might just get a &quot;yes&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/23/tin-mining-indonesia-bangka", "sentences": ["A long, boot-shaped belt of the metal stretches from Burma all the way down through Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, with Bangka and its sister island Belitung comprising its toe."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-23T22:59:00Z", "title": "Death metal: tin mining in Indonesia", "tags": ["Mining", "Environment", "Mobile phones", "Friends of the Earth", "Indonesia", "Apple", "Samsung", "Business"], "article": "Suge doesn&apos;t have a mobile phone, so he uses a\u00a0friend&apos;s to tell us the news: he doesn&apos;t want any visitors and he won&apos;t talk. His boss has told him not to say anything. They&apos;re neighbours and the mine&apos;s just up the road and he needs this job \u2013 the job he hopes to go back to when he gets better, inshallah \u2013 because mining is good money. Everything is OK. Just please don&apos;t come. We leave at dawn. In the black morning sky the two-lane highway cuts west across the island towards Suge&apos;s village, a cluster of wooden and cinderblock houses near mangroves so deep the palm trees look like drowned bonsais. There are mosques with orange gates and lime roofs, clapboard shacks selling sweets to schoolchildren, and then, every so often, vast expanses of seeming desert. At the bottom of the sandy dunes sit wide turquoise craters, looked over by gritty hills where haphazard tents made from tarpaulins and thatch serve as shelters for the men descending into the hollowed-out pools with pickaxes and buckets. Fifteen metres deep, they scavenge for tin, cutting into the sand with their hands and feet, just like Suge used to do, until one day in August his pit collapsed, burying him alive and snapping his left shin in half. His cries of &quot;Longsor! Longsor!&quot; \u2013 Landslide! \u2013 were drowned by the mud that killed the three friends who had been working beside him. The tin that 44-year-old Suge has mined over the past 12 years on Bangka island \u2013 a granite outcrop just east of Sumatra in Indonesia \u2013 has been in heavy demand for the past few centuries. Bangka is a key point in its global trade. A long, boot-shaped belt of the metal stretches from Burma all the way down through Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, with Bangka and its sister island Belitung comprising its toe. When the Dutch colonised Indonesia in the early 19th century, one of their first tasks was to carve out vast mines on the island where locals and Chinese coolies worked side by side digging for dark specks of cassiterite \u2013 the main mineral in tin ore \u2013 to be used in alloys, conductors and tin plating. Today that same tin is mined for use primarily as solder in consumer electronics, according to tin industry group ITRI, holding together the circuit boards, transistors and resistors in items such as smartphones and tablets and mobiles. Around seven grams of tin goes into every mobile phone. There is a chain here: Bangka and Belitung produce 90% of Indonesia&apos;s tin, and Indonesia is the world&apos;s second-largest exporter of the metal. A\u00a0recent Businessweek investigation into tin mining in Bangka found that Indonesia&apos;s national tin corporation, PT Timah, supplies companies such as Samsung directly, as well as solder makers Chernan and Shenmao, which in turn supply Foxconn (which manufactures many Apple products). Chernan has also supplied Samsung, Sony and LG. So it is highly likely that the smartphone or tablet you use has Bangkanese tin in it, perhaps mined by Suge or one of the many tens of thousands of men like him, most of whom earn around \u00a35 a day in a local industry that fetches roughly \u00a342m of revenue for Indonesia every year. It is still early morning when we knock on Suge&apos;s peeling front door, the village chief in tow to help him feel comfortable talking about his accident. Inside, Suge is propped up on a mattress on the floor watching soap operas, an overflowing spittoon at his side. Dangling from the rafters is the rope that keeps his leg elevated at night; today it whirls around his head like a noose not quite reaching its target. Suge&apos;s father tells us that his son&apos;s accident was unavoidable. &quot;The act of Allah,&quot; he splutters, &quot;a\u00a0big warning from God for him to change his life!&quot; Suge is crying, spitting tears into the spittoon, moved by his father&apos;s accusation that he never prayed enough before the accident. He begins describing the crumbling wall of mud that enveloped him, the image of his young daughter propelling him to fight to the surface and take his first breath of air. &quot;Look, mining has changed our community,&quot; he says, trembling. &quot;People are wealthier now. They can send their kids to school.&quot; But he knows that change is afoot. Two of his neighbours recently died while mining, bringing the unofficial death toll this year to 78, and the number of police crackdowns on informal miners has increased significantly in the past month. &quot;We are on the cusp of a revolution here,&quot; Suge says quietly. &quot;My accident was a small sacrifice to give happiness to people in the world, to give them phones and electronics.&quot; He begins likening himself to Napoleon Bonaparte, &quot;the leader of the revolution&quot;, until his father cuts in suddenly: &quot;It&apos;s silly. We are the ones producing the tin but we don&apos;t use it. We don&apos;t have handphones.&quot;     Suge describes being buried alive when a mine collapsed as, \u2018a\u00a0small sacrifice to give\u00a0happiness to people\u00a0in\u00a0the world, to\u00a0give them phones and electronics\u2019.  Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Friends Of The Earth    Official police figures show that mining accidents such as Suge&apos;s have quadrupled in the past two years, with the number of deaths increasing from 21 in 2010 to 44 in 2011. But activists say the number of dead actually averages around 100-150 every year, with many cases going unreported. Suge is lucky that his employer \u2013 a\u00a0private mine operator that supplies tin to Timah \u2013 is paying him regular compensation and has offered to give him his job back once his leg heals. But compensation is a rare privilege in an industry in which most miners fend for themselves, says Ratno Budi of the Bangka-Belitung branch of Indonesian environment group Walhi. Suge calls the opportunity a &quot;second life&quot; and expects to begin mining again next year. The word &quot;dilemma&quot; is the one most locals use to describe the situation in Bangka. Tin mining is a lucrative but destructive trade that has scarred the island&apos;s landscape, bulldozed its farms and forests, killed off its fish stocks and coral reefs, and dented tourism to its pretty palm-lined beaches. The damage is best seen from the air, as pockets of lush forest huddle amid huge swaths of barren orange earth. Where not dominated by mines, this is pockmarked with graves, many holding the bodies of miners who have died over the centuries digging for tin. Encircling the island are the dredgers and the suction ships and the thousands of illegal pontoons sucking up ore from the seabed like mechanised mosquitoes. At 8.30am on a cloudy morning at Rebo beach, Alik, a lanky 35-year-old with shoulder-length hair and a wispy goatee, is looking out at the storm on the horizon with a beer in his hand. As the manager of 20 pontoons \u2013 makeshift rafts assembled from wood, thatch, plastic barrels and suction hoses \u2013 he is nervous. Soon there will be a\u00a0meeting with the local government about turning Rebo beach into a tourism destination, essentially putting an end to the illegal mining his 80 men work at every day. &quot;There&apos;s no other work here besides mining,&quot; Alik says solemnly, pointing with his beer can out to sea. &quot;Last year there were three suction ships just off the shore there. They sucked out almost all the tin, and so this year we have 75% less than last year.&quot; He sighs. &quot;It&apos;s enough to get by but finding tin ore is like gambling. If you&apos;re lucky you&apos;ll find a lot and get rich for the day. If you&apos;re not, you earn just enough for a little food.&quot; The beach is beautiful \u2013 arcing white sands intersecting in turquoise waters \u2013 but it is hard to imagine it as a tourist destination any time soon. The village is a smattering of fishing shacks frequented by stray dogs and chickens; the sand is littered with sweet wrappers, water bottles, flip-flops and polystyrene food containers; the sea is cloudy from the dredging. Once the lifeblood of this beach, fishing is no longer an option, villagers claim. They say that large-scale seabed mining practised by private companies as well as Timah have damaged Rebo&apos;s fish stocks so severely that local fishermen have banded together in protest. Their leader is Tjong Ling Siaw, a 40-year-old third-generation fisherman. For the past decade he has mounted one-man protests against seabed mining, and earlier this year he marched with members of his 600-strong association from the governor&apos;s office to parliament and Timah&apos;s sprawling headquarters in Bangka&apos;s capital, Pangkal Pinang. &quot;We&apos;re calling for an end to all offshore mining \u2013 small-scale and large-scale \u2013 in the area,&quot; he says. &quot;The water is cloudy now. There used to be fish and shrimp just three miles from shore. Now we have to go eight miles out and, for the big fish, 17 miles.&quot; He shakes his head and swats away a fly. &quot;The government has spent a lot of money on local programmes teaching fishermen how to catch fish and giving us free engines. If they give us training on how to fish, then why don&apos;t they stop the mining?&quot; A short walk down the beach, a group of seabed miners are milling in front of their pontoons. Near them, a villager with bandy legs and a bulbous neck tumour is digging into the sand with half a white plastic plate and pouring it into a large bucket. When the bucket is full, he carries it over to a little pit of seawater and drags over what looks like a large wooden sled to start washing and separating the cassiterite from the grains of sand. &quot;If they stop the mining, I really don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll do,&quot; says Dulaksan, 54. &quot;I&apos;m getting old. I don&apos;t have enough energy to start fishing again.&quot; Without mining, people will become thieves, he says. Will he, too? &quot;If there&apos;s no food to eat, sure. If the police catch me, at least I&apos;ll get a\u00a0free meal and a place to sleep.&quot; The seabed miners are also worried. &quot;This is the only work we know how to do,&quot; says Mansur, 35, squatting in his yellow galoshes. &quot;The tin is like a\u00a0pulse \u2013 you have to follow it.&quot; He digs a hole in the sand to demonstrate how he and three co-workers operate. With just a mask and plastic tube connected to a compressor to supply them with air, they dive into the water, hoover up the sand with the suction hose, create a ditch to stand in, then turn the hose towards the newly created sea walls. &quot;There&apos;s a line of white rocks and soil that you look for \u2013 the kong \u2013 and that&apos;s what you suck up.&quot; Such practices are extremely dangerous. Umar, a childlike 30-year-old from Rebo with a maniacal laugh, was diving for tin in exactly the same manner when his four metre-deep underwater ditch collapsed around him, knocking away his mask and air tube. When he came to four days later, he discovered that doctors had spent hours pumping mud out of his lungs while he was still in a coma. Villagers at Rebo say accidents like Umar&apos;s were far more frequent in the past \u2013 sometimes causing as many as three deaths a month \u2013 but now many men stay on board, using long wooden pipes with hoses run off a generator to suck up the tin.     Edi, a sea tin miner, uses a bamboo raft to dredge for tin ore in Bangka, Indonesia. Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Friends Of The Earth    Whether they&apos;re diving or digging for tin, informal miners sell their day&apos;s findings on to middlemen, who also collect ore from miners working in official mines. The middlemen then mix the bags together to sell to smelters and companies such as Timah, or &quot;whoever&apos;s offering the higher price&quot;, says Fitriyadi, 39, a middleman who operates from his home in south Bangka. &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t ask where the tin comes from \u2013 all I know is that if there&apos;s a lot, they probably weren&apos;t controlled by the police.&quot; After leading an investigation into tin mining in Bangka earlier this year, Friends of the Earth is now pushing the biggest smartphone companies, Samsung and Apple, to agree and implement a plan that will put an end to the human and environmental problems it causes. The demands are part of FoE&apos;s Make It Better campaign, calling for Europe-wide legislation that would require companies to report on their products&apos; full human and social impacts \u2013 from accidents and pollution to how much water, land and raw materials they use. &quot;Samsung and Apple have the power to help improve the situation [in Bangka],&quot; says campaigner Julian Kirby. &quot;Millions of us love our smartphones; this new mandatory company reporting would set us on track to also being able to love the way they&apos;re made.&quot; In an emailed statement to the Guardian, Samsung said that it had recently &quot;been trying to investigate sources of minerals in our supply chain&quot; and added: &quot;We will monitor the Bangka island situation to determine if an investigation into whether tin in our supply chain is being sourced from the region is required.&quot; At Apple, a spokesman said that the company&apos;s &quot;commitment to social responsibility extends to the source of raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products. We require that our suppliers only use materials that have been procured through a conflict-free process and from sources that adhere to our standards of human rights and environmental protection.&quot; He did not clarify whether Apple sourced its tin from Bangka, pointing instead to a 2012 supplier responsibility report identifying (but not naming) 179 tin suppliers and 58 tin smelters. LG, meanwhile, told the Guardian that it &quot;takes the Friends of the Earth investigation seriously and believes that this issue requires action at an industry-wide level&quot;. A Sony spokesperson said its 2005 code of conduct &quot;expects&quot; suppliers to agree and adhere to &quot;respect for human rights, environmental conservation and health and safety&quot;, and pointed to an online report on responsible sourcing, which says: &quot;Sony supports and contributes to industry initiatives such as the traceability project for tin launched in 2010 by ITRI\u2026 to validate that the metals used in its products are not contributing to conflict and come from sustainable sources.&quot; To say that mining is everywhere on Bangka seems an exaggeration until one studies the numbers. Government officials estimate that roughly 20% of Bangka-Belitung&apos;s 1.3m islanders are miners, with a further 40% involved in related industries \u2013 working in the smelters, for example, or trading as middlemen, or selling generators. There are mines in backyards, mines in the forest, mines on the side of the road, mines out at sea. Unofficial miners scrape for tin next to official bulldozers at a 5,000-hectare mine operated by Timah. The vast government compound in Pangkal Pinang is built on a reclaimed mine, and even here men with pickaxes can be seen digging when officials aren&apos;t looking. At the provincial tourism office in the government compound, framed photos of beaches hang next to those of mines, the bright blue sky reflected in their stagnant pools. The irony is not lost on director Yan Megawandi. &quot;For tourism, mining is a big problem.&quot; He sighs. &quot;Tin mining has been exploited here for more than 200 years, so changing people&apos;s mindsets is really a challenge for us.&quot; He unfolds a map of the island and lays it out on his desk. &quot;The eastern beaches of Bangka are the best on this island. But they&apos;re also very rich in potential tin. When there&apos;s mining in front of [Bangka&apos;s best hotels], it&apos;s noisy and the water becomes dirty. Tourists complain to the hotel, and the hotel complains to me.&quot; He clasps his hands together to explain the difficulty of his position. &quot;We have no power to stop the mining here. I can only suggest to mining officials or the local police or journalists that we stop the mining.&quot; An hour north of Megawandi&apos;s office, down winding lanes lined with trees that obscure the mining pits just a few metres either side, lies Parai\u00a0Beach Resort &amp; Spa, a four-star resort with cabins perched under palm trees, a long sandy beach and views out to a glittering sea. Despite a location on one of Bangka&apos;s most popular beaches, occupancy here is down 90% \u2013 all because of the seabed mining last year, according to manager Edy Mulyana. &quot;The government said there would only be one\u00a0or two ships, and that they&apos;d be far from shore, but actually there were 20, 30, 40 ships \u2013 so\u00a0many I\u00a0couldn&apos;t count,&quot; he says. &quot;The ships were loud, the smell was bad and the water was cloudy and dirty. No one wants to vacation if they can&apos;t swim.&quot; Some 35 companies are involved in mining in Bangka-Belitung, and mining and related industries account for roughly 60% of the province&apos;s revenue, says Bangka-Belitung&apos;s head of mining and energy, Aldan Djalil. Tourism now brings in a mere fraction of what mining earns \u2013 just \u00a3810,000 compared with mining&apos;s \u00a342m, according to 2011 figures \u2013 but I ask Djalil whether tourism could trump mining in the future. He takes out a laser pointer and aims it at a triptych of badly hung wall maps in his office. &quot;This is good view, here good view,&quot; he says in English, his red laser dancing across the pink splodges of official mining zones. &quot;But so much potential for tin!&quot; he laughs gleefully. He adjusts his tracksuit bottoms around his pot belly and then says with gravity: &quot;Before there were hotels, there was tin.&quot; Government officials such as Djalil, as well as industry officials, are aware that tin ore on Bangka will soon run out. This explains Timah&apos;s current strategy, &quot;Go offshore, go deeper&quot;, as well as the newest addition to its offshore fleet: a massive bucketwheel dredger with a long, chainsaw-like arm that can churn up tin ore from 70 metres below the seabed, nearly twice as deep as the current dredgers manage. The extent and severity of the mining both on- and offshore have resulted in massive changes to the geology of Bangka and to its food chain. While there have been some environmental successes \u2013 in Belitung last month, 10,000 protesters called successfully for a revocation of seabed-mining permits \u2013 more than half of Bangka&apos;s coral reefs are now in critical condition, according to Walhi. On land, the pits&apos; stagnant pools of water become breeding grounds for dengue fever and malaria. Tin mining typically requires land to be bulldozed, then hosed down and dug up, meaning that the fertile topsoil so essential for agriculture and plantations is lost, and acidic soil brought to the surface instead. Aware of the problems, the government is now looking at solutions. A draft law to be signed by parliament in December would refocus the provincial budget away from mining and on to agriculture, fishing and tourism, funding rubber and pepper plantations and boosting infrastructure, according to Didit Srigusjaya, a local MP who sits on the parliamentary regulations commission. There&apos;s also a new edict from the central forestry ministry whereby communities will be able to bulldoze up to a\u00a0fifth of the forest in their locality for agriculture or plantation use. While this may bring some people back to farming, however, cutting down more trees is not a beneficial long-term strategy, according to Walhi&apos;s Budi, who claims that 77% of Bangka&apos;s forests are already in critical condition. Under current legislation, all former mining pits are required to be turned into reclamation projects like farms and plantations, but a drive around the island shows that most are either left abandoned or are still being exploited by groups of informal miners, many of whom sleep and eat on site under makeshift tents. Sometimes a newly planted banana tree can be seen sticking up out of the thick mud, its yellowed leaves withering in the sun. Timah, which operates 510,000 hectares of on- and offshore mining concessions, says that its new policy is to focus on the environment. Where once the company hired subcontractors who could mine where they chose, under new regulations the location and duration of their activities must be controlled directly by the corporation. &quot;The new programme is designed to save the environment,&quot; says spokesman Agung Nugroho, explaining that the changes will allow Timah to better control the damage wrought by mining. But it seems that this new policy may in fact be a\u00a0smokescreen to increase profits. Nugroho admits that Timah is losing money to informal miners and companies that collect tin ore from its mines but sell it on to others. &quot;We have the biggest mining area, but we are not producing the most tin,&quot; he complains. &quot;Our deposit is being stolen.&quot; It is this complaint \u2013 rather than calls for better safety controls \u2013 that has seemingly forced the police to clamp down on the island&apos;s informal miners. Under the leadership of Bangka-Belitung&apos;s new police chief, Budi Untung, police have made the same number of arrests in the past five weeks as they did in the previous nine months. &quot;We want to change the community mindset so that mining isn&apos;t the only focus of income \u2013 there&apos;s agriculture, plantations, other jobs to do here,&quot; says Untung, 54, from an office so huge it encompasses four sofas, various planters and orchids, and a flatscreen TV. Disused mines will be patrolled and turned into reclamation sites, Untung says, with the miners who disobey arrested and possibly sent to jail. &quot;People&apos;s mindsets about tin will change because of the price one day. Coal today is very cheap and tin one day will have a low price, too.&quot; In the six days I am on Bangka, I see just one police raid. The generator the informal miners use to both wet the sand and suck it up out of the mine has sputtered to a stop as the officers warn them not of the risks they are running, but of the damage they could do to the highway 100 metres away. &quot;The road could collapse,&quot; the officer says. &quot;This is a warning, otherwise we will confiscate your equipment.&quot; Timah says that it offers health and safety training to its employees and subcontractors (Suge confirms that he underwent such training with his employer) and that its mines must be dug in terraces to diminish the possibility of a landslide. But many mines on Bangka are dug straight down, and no one \u2013 from the police chief to Walhi to government officials \u2013 has ever heard of a mine owner being prosecuted for dangerous practices. When asked who is responsible when a death or injury like Suge&apos;s takes place in a mine run by a subcontractor supplying tin to Timah, Nugroho says, &quot;If they work for us, then all the health and safety is checked by us. People can make mistakes and when we investigate, it can be settled by us and that company.&quot; Does that mean prosecution, or an economic settlement? &quot;It is settled,&quot; he repeats without clarifying, but says it is in accordance with government law. Death and injury are part and parcel of this job, Suge says. &quot;Every job has its risks.&quot; His wife looks forlornly away. &quot;Everyone&apos;s husband works in the mines,&quot; she says when asked if she&apos;s worried about her own. &quot;I just feel lucky he survived the accident.&quot; Suge expects it to take a full year for the bones of his leg to heal. He needs a new pair of crutches \u2013 his old-fashioned wooden ones are an uncomfortable way to get around \u2013 so when he calls to thank us for the small sum of money we gave him to purchase new ones, I&apos;m not surprised. &quot;Hey! Thanks for the donation,&quot; he cries. &quot;But I\u00a0used the money to buy something else \u2013 a\u00a0mobile phone!&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/24/jenson-button-f1-lewis-hamilton", "sentences": ["Mercedes have not won a single point since Hamilton signed for the team after the Singapore Grand Prix at the end of September."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-24T22:00:07Z", "title": "Jenson Button eyes second F1 world title after seeing off Lewis Hamilton", "tags": ["Jenson Button", "Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Mercedes GP", "Formula One 2012", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport"], "article": "Jenson Button believes he will benefit from Lewis Hamilton&apos;s move to Mercedes, saying it will give him the best chance to win another Formula One world championship. &quot;Definitely. I am sure Checo [Sergio P\u00e9rez, Hamilton&apos;s replacement at McLaren] is going to score a lot of points, but when you compare it to Lewis and myself, when you look at our three years together, we have been taking points off each other,&quot; Button said. &quot;Over the three years, Lewis has 10 points more than me. It&apos;s been pretty close and we have had similar failures as well. &quot;With Checo coming in it&apos;s different, because he doesn&apos;t have the experience of Lewis. And he&apos;s coming to a team that&apos;s unknown to him. Lewis, even though he was younger than me, was very experienced with this team. &quot;So it&apos;s different for Checo. I knew Lewis was going to be there from the word go, and every single race he&apos;s been there. He&apos;s been there fighting. He&apos;s been very strong. Especially in qualifying. It&apos;s more difficult for someone who is younger and inexperienced in that team. I&apos;m looking forward to working with Checo. I still think he&apos;s going to be very quick and he will win races.&quot; Button&apos;s solitary world championship was won in 2009 driving for Brawn, which became Mercedes. When he joined McLaren the following year most people predicted that Hamilton would blow him away. But last year Button outscored his team-mate and came second in the world championship. If next season McLaren can add consistency of performance to their undoubted pace, Button could even emerge as a multiple world champion. If that happens, while Hamilton fails to add to his 2008 title at Mercedes, it could lead to a fundamental reassessment of both drivers. Mercedes have not won a single point since Hamilton signed for the team after the Singapore Grand Prix at the end of September. Looking at Hamilton&apos;s decision, Button said: &quot;It&apos;s a big risk. There is no getting away from the fact it is a big risk. Whether it is a balanced judgment or not. What happens in the future with that team, I don&apos;t know. In McLaren, pretty much every year, they have won grands prix. There is every possibility it will be the same next year too.&quot; Although Button is five years older than Hamilton, the younger man has always been viewed as the senior driver \u2013 if not, officially, by the team then by everyone else. Hamilton has not only been at McLaren 15 years but is generally considered, along with Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel, to be one of the three best drivers in the world. &quot;I am happy here and think there is a lot more to achieve with this team and in the position I am in next year, it really excites me. That&apos;s one of the reasons I want to be at McLaren,&quot; Button said. On Saturday Button lapped fastest in the final practice of the season in Brazil. His time of 1min 13.188sec was comfortably the fastest of the weekend until that point and suggested McLaren could make life very difficult for the title contenders, Vettel of Red Bull and Ferrari&apos;s Alonso."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/nov/26/aberdeen-asset-management-success-funds", "sentences": ["Aberdeen&apos;s success in Asia has largely been driven by fund manager and board member Hugh Young, who went off to live in Singapore 20 years ago."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-26T17:39:02Z", "title": "Aberdeen's fund success is a nice problem to have", "tags": ["Aberdeen Asset Management", "Business", "Financial sector", "Stock markets"], "article": "Here&apos;s a statement you don&apos;t see often in fund managers&apos; results: &quot;We continue to work to moderate the scale of inflows.&quot; That&apos;s Aberdeen Asset Management talking about its GEM, or global emerging markets, business.

The strike, the first in the tightly regulated Asian financial centre in more than 25 years, was motivated partly by the fact that Chinese drivers are paid less than their Singaporean and Malaysian peers. The Chinese are paid S$1,075 Singapore dollars (\u00a3549) a month compared with S$1,400 for a Malaysian driver. For the first two days of this week, buses ran late and crowded in a city that prides itself on efficiency, leading to complaints from customers. On Monday, 171 drivers failed to turn up and 88 did not report for work on Tuesday. Most returned on Wednesday after officials from the Chinese embassy spoke to them late on Tuesday. Drivers had also face pressure from the acting manpower minister, Tan Chuan Jin, who warned them they had &quot;crossed the line&quot;. Riot police were stationed near their hostel.

The island of 5.2 million people relies on hundreds of thousands of immigrants from countries such as China, Indonesia and Bangladesh, particularly in the construction, hospitality and transport sectors. The influx has strained public services and sparked a backlash, with accusations that foreign workers are stealing jobs, pushing up housing costs and crowding public transport. Such sentiments were blamed for Singapore&apos;s ruling People&apos;s Action party receiving its lowest share of the vote \u2013 60% \u2013 since 1965 in elections last May. Singapore, which had its last major industrial action in 1986, by shipyard workers, has no minimum wage and prohibits workers in public transport and other essential services from going on strike without giving notice of 14 days. SMRT, which said the strike affected about 5% of its bus services, claimed the difference in pay between the Chinese and Malaysian bus drivers was due to the Malaysians being permanent employees. The strikers also complained that SMRT switched them to a six-day week with slightly higher pay from a five-day week that had allowed them to earn more by doing overtime."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/nov/28/london-property-foreign-investors-housing", "sentences": ["You have to wonder if buyers from countries like Singapore (comprising 15% of buyers according to Jones Lang LaSalle) and from Switzerland and Australia are aware of the irony that British citizens would face tight restrictions on buying homes in those countries."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-28T14:00:01Z", "title": "The private sector cannot be the only answer to London's housing problems", "tags": ["Housing Network", "Housing network blog", "Finance", "London", "Development", "Social housing", "Communities", "Housing", "Society", "Property", "Money"], "article": "London&apos;s housing market is already strained by the needs of its residents. Too many are priced out of a secure, affordable home, whether they want to buy or rent. More supply is always given as the answer, but can we ever meet the demands placed on London, including those of foreign buyers? The Smith Institute estimated that 60% of homes in central London were bought by overseas investors in the first half of 2011. Figures from Jones Lang LaSalle suggested that only 19% of central London developments during an unspecified time period were bought by British people. This extends beyond the so-called prime postcodes, where stereotypes of Russian oligarchs come to mind. According to Jones Lang LaSalle, many of those buyers were snapping up one- and two-bed homes in new developments across London, often without even looking at the property, propping up the market where first-time buyers are priced out. You have to wonder if buyers from countries like Singapore (comprising 15% of buyers according to Jones Lang LaSalle) and from Switzerland and Australia are aware of the irony that British citizens would face tight restrictions on buying homes in those countries. The foreign buyers snapping up new properties at least help developers secure the finance to get the homes built. Major regeneration projects would probably be stuck if it weren&apos;t for buy-to-let landlords and foreign investors. But what does it say about the state of our dysfunctional housing market that we depend upon investors at global property fairs to get regeneration projects built? It obviously isn&apos;t working out very well for ordinary Londoners on modest incomes who end up renting the expensive homes on insecure tenancy agreements. Foreign buyers are one part of a bigger picture of under-occupation in London. The 2011 census revealed that there are an astonishing 229,803 second homes in London, many of which will be owned by British residents. Put very crudely, that is seven times the mayor&apos;s annual housebuilding target. I recently published a report in which I argue that private market supply cannot be the only answer to London&apos;s housing problems. One key reason is that I think it highly unlikely that private developers will satisfy the demands of residents looking for a genuinely affordable home: parents investing in a flat while their children study at university; second home owners; third home owners; wealthy under-occupiers; buy-to-let investors hungry for price rises; and foreign buyers looking for a safe haven for their money. London&apos;s housing market serves the demands of the wealthy, rather than the needs of the majority. The mayor and the government ignore calls for non-market interventions, like councils taking the place of investors to build lots of houses. The mayor&apos;s housing strategy is locked in an unhealthy dependency on these wealthy buyers to keep the supply show on the road, but without much hope that prices will actually fall as a result. The evidence I have put together in my report, put alongside the work by the Smith Institute and the Institute for Public Policy Research on foreign buyers, add up to a compelling case for the mayor to look at this issue. He wouldn&apos;t be alone. Camden council looked at increasing council tax on empty second homes, but found themselves isolated. The mayor should have lent his support. There should be a 200% council tax rate on second homes left empty for more than six months. The government has already introduced a higher rate of stamp duty land tax on properties worth more than \u00a32m for &quot;non-natural persons&quot; (corporate vehicles), which was a start, even if its impact was limited. We also have longstanding, though controversial, local occupancy restrictions in national parks, secured through section 106 agreements. The mayor should be looking seriously at these and other ideas, and asking whether his housing strategy can really meet the needs of London&apos;s residents while it remains a global hub of property speculation.

In the past, the British arms giant BAE was the most notorious user of offshore secrecy. The Guardian in 2003 revealed the firm had set up a pair of covert BVI entities. The undeclared subsidiaries were used to distribute hundreds of millions of pounds in secret payments to get overseas arms contracts. Today the investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and the Guardian uncovers the identities of other offshore operators. Louthean Nelson owns the Gamma Group, a controversial computer surveillance firm employing ex-military personnel. It sells bugging technology to Middle East and south-east Asian governments. Nelson owns a BVI offshore arm, Gamma Group International Ltd. Gamma&apos;s spyware, which can be used against dissidents, has turned up in the hands of Egyptian and Bahraini state security police, although Nelson&apos;s representative claims this happened inadvertently. He initially denied to us that Nelson was linked to Gamma, and denied that Nelson owned the anonymous BVI affiliate. Martin Muench, who has a 15% share in the company&apos;s German subsidiary, said he was the group&apos;s sole press spokesman, and told us: &quot;Louthean Nelson is not associated with any company by the name of Gamma Group International Ltd. If by chance you are referring to any other Gamma company, then the explanation is the same for each and every one of them.&quot; After he was confronted with evidence obtained by the Guardian/ICIJ investigation, Muench changed his position. He told us: &quot;You are absolutely right, apparently there is a Gamma Group International Ltd. So in effect I was wrong \u2013 sorry. However I did not say that Louthean Nelson was not associated with any Gamma company, only the one that I thought did not exist.&quot; Nelson set up his BVI offshoot in 2007, using an agency, BizCorp Management Pte, located in Singapore. His spokesman claimed the BVI company was not involved in sales of Gamma&apos;s Finfisher spyware. But he refused to disclose the entity&apos;s purpose. Earlier this year, computer researchers in California told the New York Times they had discovered Finfisher being run from servers in Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Mongolia and a government ministry in Turkmenistan. The spying software was previously proved to have infected the computers of political activists in Bahrain, which Nelson visited in June 2006. The Finfisher programme is marketed as a technique for so-called &quot;IT intrusion&quot;. The code disguises itself as a software update or an email attachment, which the target victim is unaware will transmit back all his or her transactions and keystrokes. Gamma calls itself &quot;a government contractor to state intelligence and law enforcement agencies for \u2026 high-quality surveillance vans&quot; and telephone tapping of all kinds. Activists&apos; investigations into Finfisher began in March 2011, after protesters who broke into Egypt&apos;s state security headquarters discovered documents showing the bugging system was being marketed to the then president Hosni Mubarak&apos;s regime, at a price of $353,000. Muench said demonstration copies of the software must have been stolen. He refused to identify Gamma&apos;s customers. Nelson&apos;s father, Bill Nelson, is described as the CEO of the UK Gamma, which sells a range of covert surveillance equipment from a modern industrial estate outside Andover, Hampshire, near the family home in the village of Winterbourne Earls, Wiltshire. In September, the German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, called for an EU-wide ban on the export of such surveillance software to totalitarian states. &quot;These regimes should not get the technical instruments to spy on their own citizens,&quot; he said. The UK has now agreed that future Finfisher exports from Andover to questionable regimes will need government permission. Other types of anonymous offshore user we have identified in this area include a south London private detective, Gerry Moore, who operated Swiss bank accounts. He did not respond to invitations to comment. Another private intelligence agency, Ciex, was used as a postbox by the financier Julian Askin to set up a covert entity registered in the Cook Islands, called Pastech. He too did not respond to invitations to comment. An ex-CIA officer and a South African mercenary soldier, John Walbridge and Mauritz Le Roux, used London agents to set up a series of BVI-registered companies in 2005, after obtaining bodyguarding contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Le Roux told us one of his reasons was to accommodate &quot;local partnerships&quot; in foreign countries. Walbridge did not respond. A former BAE software engineer from Hull, John Cunningham, says he set up his own offshore BVI company in the hope of selling helicopter drones for purely civilian use. Now based in Thailand, he previously designed military avionics for Britain&apos;s Hawk and Typhoon war planes. He told us: &quot;That account was set up by my &apos;friend&apos; in Indonesia who does aerial mapping with small UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles]. He was going to pay me a commission through that account \u2026 However, this was my first attempt to work in Asia and as I have found, money tends to be not forthcoming. I have never used that account.&quot; The military and intelligence register Gerry Moore Company: GM Property Developments, LHM Property Holdings Story: south London private detective sets up BVI companies with Swiss bank accounts Details: Moore founded &quot;Thames Investigation Services&quot;, later &quot;Thames Associates&quot;, in Blackheath, south London. He opened a Swiss bank account with UBS Basel in 1998. In 2007, he sought to open another account with Credit Suisse, Zurich, for his newly registered BVI entity GM Property Developments. He sought to register a second offshore company, LHM Property Holdings, using his wife Linda&apos;s initials. Intermediary: Netincorp. BVI (Damien Fong) Comment: No response.

His Miami-based private military company OSSI Inc teamed up with the South African ex-soldier and Executive Outcomes mercenary Mauritz le Roux to win contracts in Kabul in 2005. Walbridge set up his two BVI entities with his wife, Cassandra, via a London agency in June and August 2005, and Le Roux incorporated five parallel BVI companies. Intermediary: Alpha Offshore, London Comment: Le Roux told us some of his offshore entities were kept available &quot;in case we need to start up operations in a country where we would need to have local partnerships&quot;. His joint venture with OSSI was based offshore in Dubai, he said, but used BVI entities &quot;to operate within a legal framework under British law, rather than the legal framework of the UAE&quot;. Walbridge did not respond to invitations to comment. Julian Askin Company: Pastech Story: exiled businessman used a private intelligence agency to set up covert offshore entity in the Cook Islands Details: Askin was a British football pools entrepreneur. He alleged Afrikaner conspiracies against him in South Africa, when his Tollgate transport group there collapsed. The apartheid regime failed to have him extradited, alleging fraud. He hired the Ciex agency to report on ABSA, the South African bank which foreclosed on him. Ciex was founded by the ex-MI6 senior officer Michael Oatley along with ex-MI6 officer Hamilton Macmillan. In May 2000, they were used to help set up Pastech for their client in the obscure Pacific offshore location of Rarotonga, in the Cook Islands, with anonymous nominee directors and shareholders. Askin now lives in Semer, Suffolk. Intermediary: Ciex, Buckingham Gate, London Comment: he did not respond to invitations to comment. Louthean Nelson Company: Gamma Group International Story: Gamma sells Finfisher around the world, spying software which infects a target&apos;s computer. Details: Nelson set up a UK company in 2007 on an Andover industrial estate to make and sell Finfisher \u2013 a so-called Trojan which can remotely spy on a victim&apos;s computer by pretending to be a routine software update. He set up a parallel, more covert company with a similar name, registered in the BVI, via an agency in Singapore, using his father&apos;s address at Winterbourne Earls, near Andover. He also sells to the Middle East via premises in Beirut. He ran into controversy last year when secret police in Egypt and Bahrain were alleged to have obtained Finfisher, which he denies knowingly supplying to them. Intermediary: Bizcorp Management Pte Ltd, Singapore Comment: his spokesman declines to say what was the purpose of the group&apos;s BVI entity. John Cunningham Company: Aurilla International Story: military avionics software engineer from Hull with separate UK company launches civilian venture in Indonesia Details: Cunningham set up a BVI entity in 2007. His small UK company, On-Target Software Solutions Ltd, has worked on &quot;black boxes&quot; for BAE Hawk and Typhoon war planes, and does foreign consultancy. He also has interests in Thailand in a drone helicopter control system. Intermediary: Allen &amp; Bryans tax consultants, Singapore Comment: Cunningham says the offshore account was never activated. &quot;I actually make systems for civilian small UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles).

On Monday 27 November, Ong addressed an audience of international senior civil servants and public managers in Singapore on the topic of public services reform. The full video of his lecture is available here. Ong was appointed head of the Singapore civil service in September 2010, moving to the post from his position as permanent secretary in the finance ministry. The Singapore public service has built a reputation for professionalism and efficiency and, more importantly, of integrity. It is widely regarded as one of the most efficient bureaucracies in the world, with a high standard of discipline and accountability. In an interview with Singapore in-house civil service magazine Challenge in 2011, Ong said that the operating environment for the Singapore public service is becoming more complex, with volatility the norm and citizens&apos; expectations growing rapidly. In common with other administrations around the world, the Singapore public service has to deal with issues that are not single, but require public servants to work across different agencies. Such issues might include Singapore&apos;s relationship with superpowers such as China, or planning for land use in a way that balances economic development with environmental issues. Ong has devoted his career to public service, having worked in six Singapore ministries since graduating in economics; his departments include home affairs and defence. But Ong has said that, even at this stage of his career, he is still learning. He views technology as a key enabler of inter-government information sharing, but his key focus remains on the 120,000 people employed by the Singapore public service and developing their sense of pride and professionalism in the job they do for Singapore&apos;s citizens. \u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian public leaders network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

More than 800 people died and more than 3 million were affected in what was, for insurers, the most costly fresh water flood in history. More recently, an extreme storm in Beijing took 79 lives. And then hurricane Sandy showed us that even the most advanced cities cannot always protect themselves from the elements. According to reinsurance company Swiss Re, flooding affects 500 million people a year and the financial losses have risen from less than $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) to $15bn (\u00a39.4bn) per year in less than four decades. I&apos;ve previously written that sustainable cities&apos; principal goal is their long term economic competitiveness. Livability, good environmental stewardship and efficiency can help attract talent and investment. That talent and investment may not be deterred by vulnerable cities but it can be repelled by cities that fail to make themselves resilient. China may be especially exposed. A recent OECD report showed that six of the cities with the highest potential asset risk are Chinese, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin and Hong Kong. Their combined population is 68.5 million, more than the total population of the UK. However, in Shanghai, where I moved earlier this year, investment in infrastructure and sustainable initiatives is impressive. Shanghai is making great progress in providing a more livable and attractive urban environment but its growth is putting its resources under strain and testing its infrastructure&apos;s ability to handle extreme weather. The scale of China&apos;s potential investment in urban resilience means that the rest of the world will be able to learn from their experience. That said, mature economies have led the way until now. London built its very effective flood barrier in the 1970s. Despite recent events, New York has a resilience strategy based on its nine-step adaptation assessment process to minimise the impact of climate change. Rotterdam has set itself the ambition to achieve 100% resilience by 2025. We also see good practice in Singapore, Copenhagen and elsewhere. But we do also see that legacy cities, in particular, often struggle to achieve best practice. And one challenge they face is how to combine resilience with social, environmental and economic sustainability \u2013 or as the Chinese would put it, harmonious urbanisation. I would argue that there are four key approaches cities should consider as a part of their efforts to combine resilience, sustainability and livability: \u2022 City governments should assume leadership to fully realise the value of resource efficiency, advanced technologies and solutions. That will result in an integrated master plan, which involves co-operation from various departments and agencies within government. The Rotterdam climate proof strategy, for example, comes under the direct responsibility of the mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. \u2022 Technological advancement. Take Boston, which responded to the recurrent problem of snow-buried fire hydrants delaying fire fighters in emergencies. The city developed an adopt a hydrant phone app that allows people to take photos of their community fire hydrants, name them and maintain them voluntarily.The app has gone viral. \u2022 Cities should align partnerships with various stakeholders to explore effective collaboration models. We have worked with the Amsterdam Innovation Motor and the city&apos;s utility provider, Alliander, to build a co-operation model to accommodate potential carbon reduction solutions proposed by both the private and public sectors. That partnership resulted in more than a dozen pilot projects deployed in two years. In Japan, Accenture and six other companies partnered with the Yokohama city government to build a collaborative intelligent city, which last year won the first Barcelona Smart City Award. There are now 31 corporate partners involved. \u2022 Cities should take a value-driven approach to infrastructure development and technology deployment. Technology is not an end in itself. The citizen&apos;s user experience must be at the heart of thinking. That&apos;s why it&apos;s important to invite creative app developers in to exploit public sector assets and data to create user friendly apps and services. I tend to look at many things through a Chinese lens these days. Here we expect 300 million people to move to cities in the next 15 years alone. In some ways, these cities have a relatively blank slate to get resilience right. The sheer challenge of coping with explosive growth gives the Chinese a unique approach to urban sustainability. But the more complex efforts of long standing mature market cities can teach Chinese cities lessons in improvisation, navigating constraints and accommodating the sensitivities of multiple interest groups. Both Beijing and New York have suffered similar natural disasters in the last few months. We are likely to make most progress by learning from each other.

The degree to which public servants are held in high esteem, she says, depends on their own high integrity, and commitment to transparency and accountability. They must also be responsive and citizen orientated, whether they work in direct service delivery or policymaking. More than ever, she says, success is also determined by how frugal public servants are with public money. Uschi Schreiber, global government and public sector leader for Ernst &amp; Young, shares her views on the importance of diversity in the global public sector. Not only will need to build more diverse public services but they will also need to build diversity into the core of leadership. People of different ages, genders, and cultural backgrounds will bring a diversity of thinking, she says, that will help governments deal with some of the most complex issues humans have ever faced, such as climate change, finances and food security. It&apos;s outdated to think only in terms of domestic issues when so much is interconnected and building that in to the civil service and public sectors is very new indeed. \u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian public leaders network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

This was evident back in September when she announced that Yahoo! employees had to kick their BlackBerry to the curb and opt for an iPhone 5, Lumia 920 or Galaxy S3 instead.

How technology is changing the movie theatre business &gt;&gt; IHS iSuppli  Along with the shift in film format, the increasing use of digital cinema equipment has resulted in plunging demand for 35mm prints. At its peak, film distribution used approximately 13bn feet of film a year -- equivalent to a trip to the moon and back five times. That amount began to decline sharply in 2010, and the industry this year will use closer to 4 or 5bn feet for distribution purposes.  Also contributing to declining demand for 35mm prints is the rising cost of silver, a key material for film processing. The price of silver has climbed from a stable $5 an ounce for almost two decades to around $25 an ounce in 2012, even hitting a high of $50 at one point.

It might be surprising to note that Samsung spends considerably more than Apple and Microsoft. But it also spends more than Coca Cola, a company whose primary cost of sales is advertising.   Though the post doesn&apos;t mention this, Samsung probably spent somewhere north of $1bn on its Olympics sponsorship this year. Even so, when you look at its &quot;marketing expenses&quot;, they total more than $8bn in each of the previous two years - and perhaps $11bn this year.

The mindset that has permitted atrocities to be inflicted on humans is the same mindset that allows the abuse of animals to occur. Just as my ancestors were beaten and exploited, so are the zebras, lions, tigers, camels and other animals used in circuses. Just as my ancestors had families, feelings and emotions, so do animals. In fact, when I strip away the material stuff around me, I see that I, too, am an animal. We are family. Treated as if they were equipment, animals who are forced to travel and perform in circuses are routinely deprived of proper care and become sick, listless and depressed. Many develop neurotic behaviour from the stress and abuse and die far short of their expected lifespan. They spend the vast majority of their lives crammed into transport cages or boxcars and are hauled around from one venue to the next. UK laws require that animals be given a good quality of life. But the rigours of transport, cruel training techniques and other stresses of circus life make that impossible. Many of my ancestors were imprisoned without cause and spent their lives deprived of everything that was important and meaningful to them: the freedom of choice, independence and autonomy. This is exactly what life is like for animals used in circuses. They have no choice when it comes to their living conditions or what creatures they live and interact with, and they are punished when they don&apos;t toe the line. They have no control over any aspect of their own destiny. Animals don&apos;t &quot;get used to&quot; servitude. They know they aren&apos;t where they are supposed to be. Animals who perform stunts that they would never do in their rightful homes do so out of fear, not because they want to. Last year, people around the world were justifiably outraged when video footage of Anne, the last elephant used in a UK circus, was circulated showing a handler as he kicked, beat and stabbed her with a pitchfork \u2013 even though she was chained. Anne was finally allowed to retire in the wake of a public outcry. But unless a ban on the use of animals in circuses is imposed, there&apos;s nothing to stop a British circus from acquiring another elephant and putting him or her through a life of torment. Elephants have adapted to near-constant movement in the wild, and they walk vast distances every day in order to maintain their health and wellbeing. In circuses, the only &quot;exercise&quot; elephants get is when they perform silly tricks. They need the company and companionship of other elephants in order to thrive. They are members of an intelligent and multifaceted species who, like us, experience a wide range of emotions. Ninety-four per cent of people who responded to the last government&apos;s circus consultation support the ban on wild animals in circuses, knowing that it is not acceptable to subject animals to cruel treatment for our entertainment. Greece recently announced a ban on all animal circuses, and a legal challenge to overturn the Austrian government&apos;s ban on wild animals in circuses failed. Bolivia, Finland, India, Singapore and Sweden have all implemented bans on or prohibited animal acts. Around the world, people are speaking out against the shameful cruelty of confining animals to cramped cages, hauling them around in lorries and forcing them to perform unnatural, demeaning and sometimes painful acts. But in the UK, once at the forefront of animal protection, the government is still ignoring the will of both the public and MPs by wasting time talking about a system of &quot;licensing&quot; or &quot;regulating&quot; wild-animal acts. It&apos;s not enough. For the first time since I was a little child, I went to a circus myself earlier this year. The reason I went was because it said clearly that it does not use animals. I had an absolutely great time admiring what human beings can do when they stop exploiting others and use their own free will and creativity. I spoke to many of the performers after the show, and they told me that they would not work with animals. It was inspiring, and I told them that they are great examples of what is possible. Existing UK regulations have already failed animals in circuses miserably. Anne, for example, spent almost six decades with the Bobby Roberts Super Circus. The welfare problems and abuse that animals in circuses experience are inherent, and it is clear that we can&apos;t allow circuses to regulate themselves. Only a complete ban will ensure that animals in circuses are spared further suffering. It has been 200 years since parliament banned the slave trade. It&apos;s about time for that enlightened attitude to be extended to animal slaves exploited in circuses."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/30/burma-building-boom", "sentences": ["&quot;Myanmar has now become a distinct choice for international investors \u2026 We want this building to be a long-lasting landmark that will remain close to the hearts of the beautiful people of [the country],&quot; the Singapore-based developers told local reporters this month, using the name given to the country by the military authorities in 1989."], "publicationDate": "2012-11-30T15:48:43Z", "title": "Burma's building boom threatens its architectural heritage", "tags": ["Architecture", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Art and design", "Myanmar"], "article": "On the corner of 35th and Merchant Street, in the heart of Rangoon&apos;s city centre, San San Win is preparing lunch for the workers in the surrounding offices, shops and ministries. Her noodle stall is sheltered from the rain by the vast portico of a government bank, built in the 1930s by the British when Burma was part of the empire. Close by, labourers scale the girders of what will be a massive commercial centre. Opposite is an empty plot, soon to be filled by a 25-storey tower block. Win, who has lived with her family in a tiny apartment 50 metres from her stall all her life, is happy with the changes. &quot;More people means more noodles sold,&quot; she said. Others are less sanguine. Decades of isolation from the international community, economic mismanagement and inertia have left Rangoon the only major city in the region with such buildings, constructed by its former colonial overlords in styles ranging from straight neoclassical to art deco, intact. Many people fear the economic boom sparked by rapid political reform over the past two years could spell disaster for this rich heritage. In nearby Malaysia or neighbouring China and Thailand, many older buildings have been demolished to make way for modern malls, offices or hotels. &quot;These are very lovely and very beautiful buildings. Whether built by the British or the Burmese, these are part of our history. They belong to us all and we need to save them all,&quot; said Sun Oo, a Burmese architect who works from a studio in a mildewed block built in the 1930s as dormitory accommodation for Indian labourers. Oo and other architects have documented many of the highest-profile buildings likely to be razed or redeveloped, in a bid to preserve at least their memory. These include the spectacular Secretariat, from where colonial officials once administered a far-flung province of the Raj, and the old Rowe Company store, once the favourite shop of colonial memsahibs. &quot;In Hong Kong, the younger generation now have no idea of how their ancestors lived. We too will be lost, like a man without a face,&quot; Oo said. Recently, the architects received support from an unexpected quarter when lawyers demonstrated against development plans for the spectacular high-court building. That they could protest at all is an indication of the extraordinary change in this country, even if hundreds of political prisoners are still held in appalling conditions and the military remains extremely powerful. Those changes now mean that investors across the region \u2013 and beyond \u2013 are eyeing Burma hungrily. Land prices have soared. The cost of living in Rangoon is now higher than in Paris, according to the Mercer cost of living index, and only slightly cheaper than New York. The planning process is impenetrable, public consultation nonexistent, corruption endemic and profits astronomical. Not far from where Win has her noodle stand, a $100m (\u00a366m), 38-storey office tower is planned. &quot;Myanmar has now become a distinct choice for international investors \u2026 We want this building to be a long-lasting landmark that will remain close to the hearts of the beautiful people of [the country],&quot; the Singapore-based developers told local reporters this month, using the name given to the country by the military authorities in 1989. Another huge project will tower over the famous Inya lake, where the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has her home, spoiling the view from the gardens of the stucco colonial-era village where the Nobel prize laureate has spent much of the past 20 years under house arrest. In the rush of excitement over Burma&apos;s ongoing political reforms \u2013 President Barack Obama flew in this month to become the first serving US president to visit \u2013 little attention has been paid to the more mundane problems. Economic growth, for example, is likely to send millions of migrants to the cities. Rangoon&apos;s population, currently around 5\u00a0million, is likely to soar. &quot;Currently, there are tight restrictions which limit small businesses like workshops, shops or IT outlets. This is keeping people in the villages. Once they are lifted, many, many villagers will head to the city. There&apos;s nothing to keep them in the countryside,&quot; said Phone Win, director of Mingalar Myanmar, an NGO working in communities around Rangoon. Burma&apos;s commercial capital is ill-equipped to absorb the influx. Power is already scarce and since restrictions on buying cars were lifted this year traffic congestion has become a serious problem. All infrastructure \u2013 from sewers to the city&apos;s circular railway \u2013 is in a state of almost total disrepair. Oo, the architect, believes reconciling preservation with development is possible. Restored buildings will bring in tourists as well as provide a more pleasant environment for locals, he argues. Rangoon&apos;s top municipal officials understand the problem. &quot;We are at the watershed of this city&apos;s history,&quot; Rangoon&apos;s mayor, Myint Swe, told a conference this summer. &quot;We want to see Yangon [Rangoon] as a 21st-century city but also want to preserve the best of our heritage. I have no illusions about the challenges we face, but we will learn from the mistakes of other Asia cities.&quot; But there is little public awareness of the value of decrepit villas and ministries. After years of making do with crumbling old structures, physically as well as politically, there is a desire for a clean break with the past.

Oddly enough, I was born in Malaya, in Penang, in 1961 [his father was serving as an army physician]. It&apos;s autobiographical: Peter was a member of the Combined Services Entertainment Unit in Singapore with Kenneth Williams and Stanley Baxter, and it&apos;s based on that.

I&apos;ve done musicals before: Candide, Spamalot. But I didn&apos;t sing much. Here, I&apos;ve got four numbers, which is a bit scary. Do you still get nervous? Oh yes. But it&apos;s a funny sort of nerves. Nerves used to be exciting; now it&apos;s just anxiety. Actors always say: oh, this is the time I&apos;ll get found out. But it is a genuine thing, a feeling of: oh, here we go again. It&apos;s directed by Michael Grandage, the first time you&apos;ve worked together. Is working with a new director like tuning into a new language? I suppose it is. With directors I&apos;ve worked with a lot \u2013 with Sam [Mendes] or Nick [Hytner] \u2013 I have a shorthand, and the danger with that is that you&apos;re in an exclusion zone, and it&apos;s unproductive for the rest of the company. Michael is incredibly practical, maybe because he was an actor himself. It&apos;s quite intriguing. It&apos;s all: do you really want to be carrying those shoes, or that cup, or whatever? Only later does he go into the psychological. Do the critics still matter? Will you mind what they say? I do think they matter, and we&apos;re lucky in this country to have a range of critics, unlike New York where basically there&apos;s only one; we have three or four who are top class. A bad review sticks with you but a good one is dangerous too. Sometimes you start playing the review. When I was Thersites in Troilus &amp; Cressida at the RSC \u2013 a famous production now, with a cast that made you gasp \u2013 I had this silent scream at the end. The reviewer interpreted it as a scream of triumph or agony, or whatever, and after that I wasn&apos;t living, as we say, in the moment; I was playing the review. I used to read them religiously. Now I like to know what&apos;s said but I don&apos;t read them myself. Of course you&apos;re bound to find out anyway. You can read it in people&apos;s faces, and Dad is always bound to ring up and say: &quot;That one in the Telegraph wasn&apos;t very good.&quot; [Laughs.] In most companies there&apos;s a strict rule that you don&apos;t talk about them. How do you cope with a long run, doing a play night after night? It takes quite a time to get stale, and sometimes you never do. Timon [of Athens, at the National Theatre earlier this year] didn&apos;t because it was such fucking hard work. But I&apos;ve something I do when I&apos;m getting stale. It sounds pathetically simple but it does work. You stop worrying about your own performance and you really listen to the other person, and it becomes interesting again. When did you decide you wanted to be an actor? It crept up on me. I read English [at Cambridge], and when I got this very unexpected degree [a first], I thought I should do a PhD. It was about the cult of death in Victorian literature. I&apos;d completely fallen in love with Tennyson&apos;s In Memoriam. But then I gave that up \u2013 I thought it would be a bit lonely \u2013 and I went to the Guildhall as a singer, because I&apos;d been a choral scholar at Cambridge. But in my heart of hearts I didn&apos;t want to be a singer so I wrote to the head of drama and asked if they&apos;d consider me. At school, Shakespeare was my great love. I didn&apos;t come from a family of Shakespeareans; that was my discovery, and I knew in the depths of my soul that I wanted to do Shakespeare. Of course this was in the days when you could get two grants. Will people continue to go to drama school, given how much debt they&apos;ll now incur? I&apos;m sure they will. But that isn&apos;t a very good answer, is it? I get letters from students wanting money all the time. We all do: ask any actor. It&apos;s heartbreaking. What about the theatre? Is it dying or thriving? The theatre has supposedly been dying since the 16th century. God knows what they said when there was all that dross on in the 19th century. I&apos;m bullish. The National is astonishing, the sheer volume of interesting work that comes out of it. The golden idea has been the Travelex season, the \u00a312 ticket. That&apos;s the answer. It&apos;s so simple. The National plays at 90%, and has done for the past 10 years, and that&apos;s one reason why. Every theatre should aspire to do something similar if it can. But the cuts are savage and it&apos;s a shame because the theatre is something we&apos;re fearfully good at. Non-theatre people think actors are all vain and temperamental. Is this unfair? A group of actors isn&apos;t any different to, say, a group of doctors. I know some incredibly calm actors and I know some shy ones too. I hope I&apos;m not temperamental but I do think I&apos;m thin-skinned. Most actors are. I don&apos;t have a great body image, it must be said. In my own mind, when I was rehearsing my Carmen Miranda dance just now I was sexiness personified. But then I caught a glimpse of myself doing it and... well, I wasn&apos;t, quite. What will you do next? I don&apos;t know, and you&apos;re pressing on rather a delicate point. [Laughs] In 30 years I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been so close to unemployment. I phoned my agent and said: in March I&apos;m out of work. I&apos;m hoping to do King Lear in 2014, directed by Sam [Mendes] at the National. He said to me about six years ago: &quot;We&apos;d better do it before it&apos;s too late.&quot; I said: &quot;I&apos;m 45.&quot; He said: &quot;Well, Schofield did it in his 40s, and so did Gielgud.&quot; I said: &quot;Yes, Sam. But that was Schofield and Gielgud, for God&apos;s sake.&quot; But the idea did rather stick\u2026 So I hope it will happen."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/02/delta-singapore-airlines-virgin-atlantic", "sentences": ["Delta, the biggest US airline, is understood to have offered to buy Singapore Airlines&apos; 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic which could, in turn, lead to a bid to take a majority stake away from Branson.", "Sources close to the negotiations confirmed weekend reports that Delta has approached Singapore over its stake, but cautioned that there is no certainty that it would bid for control of Virgin Atlantic, which Branson \u2013 who owns a 51% stake \u2013 launched in 1984.", "Delta&apos;s move comes as Singapore aims to draw attention away from the crowded European market and concentrate on the rapidly expanding budget airline industry in south east Asia and Australia.", "The other two alliances are Star (28 airlines, including Singapore, Air Canada and South African Airways) and OneWorld, which covers British Airways, American Airlines and 10 others.", "Singapore Airlines bought its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic in 1999 for \u00a3600m, but in October it bought a 10% stake in Branson&apos;s Virgin Australia carrier for $108.5m (\u00a371m).", "Scott, Singapore&apos;s low-cost airline, now accounts for one in four of all Asia Pacific flights and follows cuts by the airline to its long-haul flights between the Far East and North America.", "A spokesman for Singapore Airlines said: &quot;We review our investments regularly, but no decision has been made about a divestment of our shareholding in Virgin Atlantic.&quot; Virgin Atlantic said: &quot;We are always talking to many airlines on a number of different matters but we never comment on the details of these discussions&quot; Delta Airlines declined to comment.", "The company received a boost to its coffers from Branson when he sold Virgin Records in 1992 for \u00a3510m, but by 1999, with rival airlines forming worldwide alliances, Branson sold a 49% stake to Singapore Airlines for \u00a3600m."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-02T19:09:43Z", "title": "Delta bids for Singapore Airlines' 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic", "tags": ["Richard Branson", "Business", "Virgin Atlantic", "Airline industry"], "article": "Sir Richard Branson could sell his controlling stake in Virgin Atlantic after rival Delta Airlines made a bid for nearly half the business.

Branson has made no secret of his desire that Virgin should join one of the three big airline alliances to keep Virgin Atlantic competitive.

Singapore Airlines bought its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic in 1999 for \u00a3600m, but in October it bought a 10% stake in Branson&apos;s Virgin Australia carrier for $108.5m (\u00a371m). The deal signalled the company&apos;s intent to focus on the Far East, giving it the company&apos;s first direct stake in Australia&apos;s aviation market, where Virgin is the second biggest airline after Qantas. Scott, Singapore&apos;s low-cost airline, now accounts for one in four of all Asia Pacific flights and follows cuts by the airline to its long-haul flights between the Far East and North America. Branson has been considering Virgin&apos;s future for several years and nearly signed a deal with Air France-KLM in February 2011, having appointed Deutsche Bank to look into possible offers. He was particularly concerned by a ruling by US authorities that allowed British Airways and American Airlines to run their transatlantic businesses jointly. In 2011 he said: &quot;We realised for the long-term stability of Virgin Atlantic we needed to look at an alliance partner, and whether it is purely an alliance or more than an alliance we&apos;re completely undecided. Most of the people we talked to are keen to have Virgin as part of their alliance. My preference would be to keep control of the airline.&quot; With the BA-AA deal passed, any link-up with Delta is unlikely to face many regulatory hurdles. A spokesman for Singapore Airlines said: &quot;We review our investments regularly, but no decision has been made about a divestment of our shareholding in Virgin Atlantic.&quot; Virgin Atlantic said: &quot;We are always talking to many airlines on a number of different matters but we never comment on the details of these discussions&quot; Delta Airlines declined to comment. Branson&apos;s sky plans  Sir Richard Branson formed Virgin Atlantic with US lawyer Randolph Fields more than 28 years ago, launching their maiden flight from Gatwick to Newark on 22 June 1984. Billed as a budget airline, it aimed to compete on the lucrative transatlantic market, still dominated by British Airways. The pair fell out within months, causing Branson to turn to the City for more funds. Fields left, reducing his stake to 25%. He was eventually bought out by his former partner. The company received a boost to its coffers from Branson when he sold Virgin Records in 1992 for \u00a3510m, but by 1999, with rival airlines forming worldwide alliances, Branson sold a 49% stake to Singapore Airlines for \u00a3600m. Today Virgin has 44 planes. It flew 5.3 million passengers in 2011. It has six Airbus A380 aircraft on order."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2012/dec/03/social-enterprise-network-daily", "sentences": ["DBS-TISS tap entrepreneurs to meet social objective Business Standard: A joint initiative of Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Sciences (Tiss) and Singapore&apos;s DBS Bank is helping to build social enterprises across Asia."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-03T11:11:08Z", "title": "Social enterprise network daily: Monday 3 December", "tags": ["Social enterprises"], "article": "Food Co-ops Win in International Year of Cooperatives Short Film Festival  Co-operative news: National Cooperative Grocers Association (NCGA) is one of the seven winners of the 2012 International Year of Cooperatives Film Festival.

Although education ministers want our pupils to have the opportunities already available to those in other countries, the official draft proposals seem to ignore the evidence from mathematically high performing countries, such as Finland, Japan and Singapore. In these countries, as for a number of others, pupils are expected to master clearly set fundamentals, teachers&apos; own mathematical standards tend to be high and a variety of teaching methods encourage high motivation. So, a mastery curriculum is the norm, with key topics specified year-by-year or for two-year periods with the great majority of learners expected to master these topics and concepts. The &apos;fundamentals&apos; such as number bonds and multiplication tables are stressed and problem solving plays a central role in learners&apos; mathematical development, while motivational activities help to develop inquiring minds. Throughout the primary phase, mathematical concepts underpin the curriculum with an emphasis on logic and rigour, through classification and enumeration tasks and problem. Moreover, teachers have a strong foundation in mathematics and fully understand the bigger mathematical picture, what is important and how the topics develop well beyond the primary phase of education. The upshot is that at the end of the primary phase the attainment gap is far less significant than in England. Of course, cherry picking educational strategies from other countries does not necessarily work in England. But such curriculum strategies can and do provide a solid foundation in mathematics in the primary phase. If we understand why they do, we can use this opportunity to revise our curriculum to provide a mathematical, rather than just a numeracy based foundation. That&apos;s the message from Primary Problems: A First Curriculum for Mathematics, published this week by Politeia, which proposes an alternative curriculum to the Department for Education. While there&apos;s much to welcome in the DFE&apos;s proposals, including the encouragement to use topics and activities to motivate pupils, some things need to come earlier and others later. There&apos;s a strong case for earlier mastery of multiplication tables up to 10x10, the introduction of probability concepts and algebra, including algebraic notation and concepts. That would involve a focus on the correct use of the equality and inequality signs in the early years to solving simple equations and inequalities later on. Moving to a more mathematical curriculum will be a challenge for many of our teachers. Certain steps would be helpful. In particular we need higher mathematical entry qualification for future teachers along with practical support such as detailed advice, access to exemplar material from high-performing countries and training through lesson study. For better qualified teachers, we need not just a higher grade GCSE but a dedicated AS level in Foundations of Mathematics for intending teachers, to provide the basis of continuing professional development for all mathematics teachers. Together with detailed guidance on pedagogical issues, access to exemplar material from successful countries and pedagogical training through research lessons, teachers will be helped to go beyond one way of teaching mathematics, take risks and innovate. More responsibility and time are also needed for the leading maths teachers to work with teachers in their schools, both on subject knowledge and pedagogical issues. Along with higher standards for maths teachers we must extend the pool of available talent to schools. In particular, a national volunteering scheme for mathematics should be developed, for people with a mathematical background to help in schools, either with catch-up sessions for lower attaining pupils or with enrichment activities for all pupils. The volunteers and the schools would need training so maximum benefit was gained. This is one-off chance to make real changes to mathematics so that we become a nation at ease with mathematics, where young people (and their teachers) both enjoy their mathematics and have the confidence to use and apply it in their future lives. David Burghes is professor of mathematics teaching at the University of Plymouth. His Primary Problems: A First Curriculum for Mathematics is published by the think tank, Politeia, this week.

The Duchess of Cambridge had unveiled a slightly shorter haircut a few days earlier, but it was during a trip, fittingly, to Cambridge last Wednesday that she was first enticed into comment. She wasn&apos;t sure about it, she told a member of the public who complimented her on the new style. &quot;Duchess of Cambridge: I&apos;m not sure about new hair&quot; read the Daily Telegraph headline. And yet it seems that beneath the long fringe so reminiscent, according to those royal watchers, of the style favoured by her husband&apos;s late mother, the broad smile concealed a genuine secret. A little distance away in the crowd, Prince William responded to being handed a babygro by a member of the crowd with a teasing: &quot;I&apos;ll keep that!&quot; Speculation about the future occupancy of Kate Middleton&apos;s uterus began almost as soon as she first emerged as a serious girlfriend of the young prince. Since the pair married in April 2011 it had reached an intensity not seen since Charles and Diana&apos;s wedding. Diana at least did the decent thing by becoming pregnant within weeks of being married; it was not until many years later that she would speak about being so unhappy during that pregnancy that she had flung herself down the stairs at Sandringham. By definition, however, it is the lot of a royal consort to provide a nation with a next-in-line, and, depressing as it may be, neither William nor Catherine can claim to have been unprepared for what was to come. For the former Ms Middleton that has meant 20 months in which every morsel to cross her lips, every polite response offered to impertinent questions about her fertility and sex life has been scrutinised by the tabloid press at home and overseas for signs of an imminent heir. Wished good luck in starting a family when on her first royal tour to Canada, she responded: &quot;Yes, I hope to.&quot; Royal precedence, observers noted, meant she&apos;d be knocked up within the year. A polite refusal during a trip to Copenhagen of some proffered peanut paste \u2013 designed as emergency food for famine victims \u2013 was clearly a sign that something was up. &quot;The duchess does not have a nut allergy, nor is it like her to appear rude,&quot; an &quot;onlooker&quot; helpfully told the Sun. &quot;The only explanation is that she is pregnant and has been told \u2013 like many expectant mothers \u2013 to avoid nuts.&quot; In November 2011 the duchess &quot;fuelled rumours that she may be pregnant&quot; by &quot;repeatedly touching her stomach&quot;. Moving to a bigger apartment in Kensington Palace last year was a clear sign children were imminent. Her 30th birthday in January led to barely concealed mutterings that she had better get on with it. Meanwhile, those who cared filled time with wringing their hands. &quot;Is Kate too thin to get pregnant?&quot; asked the People. Doctors were pressed to offer their opinions. Columnists offered advice on how best to eat to &quot;prepare for an heir&quot;. Others, denied an official announcement, simply did the job themselves. A company that makes commemorative dolls started making pregnant versions of its bestselling &quot;Princess Kate&quot; dolls a year ago in response, it said, to demand. In the US, People magazine published a cover story declaring the start of &quot;Princess Bumpwatch 2012&quot;. A US supermarket tabloid has declared the duchess pregnant at least four times in the past 18 months: &quot;Pregnant Kate collapses&quot;, &quot;Pregnant Bride! \u2026 If it&apos;s a girl they&apos;ll name her Diana&quot;, &quot;Kate 95lbs and having a baby!&quot;. If it has put a strain on the royal couple, they have borne it gamely enough in public. Asked by a schoolgirl in Singapore in September how many children he would like, the prince replied, we were told, that &quot;he was thinking about having two&quot;. Learning that her &quot;favourite bodyguard&quot; was pregnant, Kate was said to have joked: &quot;You beat me to it.&quot; Certainly the speculation must have seemed negligible compared to being photographed by a long-lens paparazzo while sunbathing in a private garden. Happily, the US magazine Star was able to offer the royal couple some comfort. &quot;Scandal turns to joy: it&apos;s twins!&quot;; &quot;Pregnant Kate gets thrilling news amid nude-photo uproar&quot;. The article was accompanied by what appeared to be a digitally doctored photograph to make the duchess&apos;s belly appear rounder.

Of course he was an imperialist \u2013 no two ways about that \u2013 and imperialists aren&apos;t much loved in progressive circles these days. But if you have to have them \u2013 and colonial expansion of one kind or another has been the rule rather than the exception in world history right back to the Cro-Magnons \u2013 Raffles seems a decent sort. This is one of the reasons why he was considered such a failure, by and large, by other imperialists before his Singapore coup (1819). The East India Company, whose servant he was, wanted him only to squeeze profits out of the stations of which he was put in charge. (It was a capitalist company, after all.) But all of them ended up in debt. Raffles wanted to do good for their inhabitants, and couldn&apos;t see how that could be done without investment. He insisted that this would pay dividends eventually \u2013 happy populations would produce more \u2013 but the company&apos;s shareholders didn&apos;t do &quot;long term&quot;. So he was sacked from his posts in Java and Sumatra, and criticised for exceeding his orders \u2013 for example by abolishing slavery there off his own bat. When he retired through ill health, and lost almost everything in a shipwreck on his way home, he received no compensation and no pension, and was required to pay back some of his salary. Most canny 19th-century imperialists did better for themselves than that. (But then most of them \u2013 every one of Raffles&apos;s colleagues, according to Victoria Glendinning \u2013 were Scots.) Raffles was a poor Londoner \u2013 though he was born at sea \u2013 with almost no formal education, who at 14 got a job as a clerk in East India House, and then went on, and up, from there. He succeeded mainly through his own charm and ability, although he had some influential connections, which he had had to cultivate \u2013 and luck. He was distinctly &quot;pushy&quot;. That caused jealousy and resentment among his competitors for jobs, especially when it pushed him higher than his social origins seemed to merit. &quot;Though a clever man,&quot; wrote one of his detractors, he &quot;was neither born nor bred a gentleman, and we all know that the nicer feelings and habits of a gentleman are not to be acquired.&quot; When the Prince Regent knighted him in 1817, some of his colleagues referred to him as &quot;Sir Knight&quot;. It wasn&apos;t meant kindly. (He, on the other hand, thought he should have been made a baronet.) There&apos;s an interesting general point to be made here: many of the leading lights of the British empire in the 19th century are not easily categorised as upper or middle or lower class, but came from the interstices between the classes: men and women uncomfortable with the social positions they were in. This often gave them more independent views than those who were more conventionally one thing or the other. Raffles&apos;s views were certainly in this category. As well as being anti-slavery (not so rare then), he also opposed cock-fighting, gambling and the death penalty \u2013 except for murders &quot;by Amok&quot; (in the course of riot). That might seem to place him among evangelical Christians at that time; but in fact he was hardly at all religious, and was set against missionary proselytism. &quot;I am a good deal more inclined than you are,&quot; he wrote to his vicar cousin Thomas, &quot;to let people go to heaven in their own way.&quot; He was for free trade, but against large-scale capitalist exploitation in agriculture: &quot;When I see every man cultivating his own field, I cannot but think him happier far than when he is cultivating the field of another.&quot; His main virtue, and the reason for any success he had in the East Indies, was his interest and genuine empathy for other cultures than his own. He learned the local languages, for example, and got along on terms of perfect equality with the people. It was this, together with an omnivorous curiosity, that lay behind his great collection of Javanese natural specimens and cultural artefacts, which \u2013 minus those lost in the shipwreck \u2013 can now be found in the British Museum. He brought them back, he said, to prove to the people of England &quot;that the Javanese are not savages&quot;. (He also brought back some instruments of torture used by Java&apos;s former \u2013 and later \u2013 colonial masters, to show that the Dutch were.) One of his reasons for picking on Singapore Island for the East India Company&apos;s great new entrep\u00f4t between India and China was that it had once, 600 years before, been the great &quot;Lion City&quot; of the original \u2013 pre-Muslim - Malayan civilisation. When he took it over (by treaty) it had declined to just a few fishing villages; so he was hardly expropriating a going concern. Within three years it had 10,000 inhabitants. Today it has 5 million. Glendinning&apos;s biography is unusual in including almost as much about Raffles&apos;s relatives and friends as about him. This is as it should be, as they were crucial to his career as well as to his happiness; especially his two wives, the vivacious Olivia, who died in 1814, and then the strong and resourceful Sophia, who bore him his children, and fanned his reputation, and her own, after Raffles&apos;s death. (Her Memoir of him hardly mentions Olivia.) He loved them dearly, and they him, accompanying him everywhere, over mountains and through bug-infested jungles in terrible humidity, even when Sophia was heavily pregnant. (One of their babies, like Raffles himself, was born on a ship.) They also loved their children. One of the reasons for the deaths of four of them at a young age in Sumatra was that Raffles and Sophia couldn&apos;t bear the idea of shipping them off to England, as was the usual practice, for the sake of their health. Sophia proved to have a stronger constitution than her husband, who died of a kind of seizure in 1826. He was small and slight, prone to over-exertion, both mentally and physically, and often laid low by fevers and headaches, the latter of which may have been due to a huge &quot;arteriovenous malformation&quot; found during an autopsy on his skull. That may also account for the flaming rows he had latterly with his erstwhile friend Colonel William Farquhar (another Scot), who claimed he should have given equal credit for the foundation of Singapore. Raffles had a black side. But it&apos;s his statues that grace Westminster Abbey and Boat Quay in Singapore; and his name that adorns the famous hotel. And he who has attracted most of the biographies; including this relatively straightforward \u2013 there&apos;s not much analysis here \u2013 but marvellously readable, personally illuminating and highly entertaining new one. They don&apos;t make them like Raffles any more. \u2022 Bernard Porter&apos;s The Lion&apos;s Share: A History of British Imperialism is published by Pearson."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/dec/06/lse-electric-city-urban-society-mapping-graphics-london", "sentences": ["Singapore&apos;s population has risen steadily, and TransMilenio, its public transport system, has seen passenger numbers double since its 2001 launch.", "London&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita are higher than the world average, but lower than those of comparable developed cities New York and Portland, as well as Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-06T12:18:00Z", "title": "Electric City 2012: graphic highlights from LSE's conference on the urban age", "tags": ["Cities and development", "Urbanisation", "London", "New York", "Technology sector", "Planning policy", "Cycling holidays", "London School of Economics and Political Science", "Environment", "Energy", "Pollution", "Technology startups", "Cities"], "article": "Electric City, the 2012 edition of LSE Cities&apos; conference series, takes place today and tomorrow at the London School of Economics and Deutsche Bank&apos;s Alfred Herrhausen Society.

The conference publication includes a wealth of detailed graphics covering topics including transport, energy consumption, pollution and urban planning, as well as a visualisation-rich case study on London. Below is a selection of the maps and charts on show, along with a summary of some of the most interesting patterns that emerge: Proximity to public transport     Proximity to rapid transit stations in selected cities, broken down by residential and commercial property. Click for larger image    Hong Kong&apos;s residents are the best-connected, with over 40% living within a 500m radius of a rapid transit station. The city also scores highest for commuting, with over half its places of work less than half a kilometre from a station. Stockholm scores second highest in both categories, while New York and London are third for residents and commuters respectively. Los Angeles scores lowest for each category, with less than 5% of its residents living within 500m of a station. How people travel     Methods of transport in selected cities. London has the highest proportion of trips made by car. Click for larger image    Of the six cities shown, London has the highest proportion of trips made by car, at 39.8%. Public transport accounts for 34% of journeys, while walking (23.7%), cycling (2%) and motorcycle trips (0.8%) make up the remainder. New York scores highest for public transport, with almost three in every five commuter trips made by taxi, bus, rail or metro. Hong Kong fares best for walking, with 44.7% of journeys made on foot. Copenhagen leads the way for cycling, with one in five trips powered by pedals. How cities change     Changes in measures including population, emissions and transport, shown for selected major cities across different continents and states of economic development. Click for larger image    Portland&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita have halved since 1993.Copenhagen&apos;s energy consumption per capita has fallen by around 20% since 1993, with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita dropping at a slightly faster rate. Singapore&apos;s population has risen steadily, and TransMilenio, its public transport system, has seen passenger numbers double since its 2001 launch. Despite its growing population, traffic incident fatalities have more than halved since the late 1990s. Cycling in Hong Kong has been booming in the last 20 years, and is one of the factors that have contributed to its falling CO2 emissions per capita.     Changes in measures including population, emissions and transport, shown for selected major cities across different continents and states of economic development. Click for larger image    Around the year 2000 London&apos;s technology sector really took off, and employment in the digital economy has increased by almost 50% since 1997. Taking inner East London as a standalone region, high tech employment has nearly doubled in 15 years. Mumbai&apos;s rapid population growth is symptomatic of nationwide trends, and has come at an environmental cost, with CO2 emissions per capita for India as a whole increasing at a faster rate than the port city&apos;s population. Peak electricity demand in Mumbai has also rocketed upwards, increasing by over 75% in ten years. Berlin&apos;s population has remained relatively constant since 1993, but a decreasing reliance on non-renewable energy across Germany as a whole has improved its environmental credentials. The capital&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita have dropped by over 30% in 18 years. Vehicle ownership in Sao Paulo is booming, but traffic speeds during evening rush hour have fallen since 1993, suggesting its road network is struggling to cope with congestion. Unpacking London: energy &amp; pollution     Data on energy and pollution in London, mapped and analysed over time. Click for larger image    Three quarters of London&apos;s energy consumption is fueled directly by oil and gas, with the vast majority of the remainder generated by fossil-fuel-powered electricity. Just 2.1% comes either direct from waste and renewables or from renewably-generated electricity. London&apos;s CO2 emissions per capita are higher than the world average, but lower than those of comparable developed cities New York and Portland, as well as Singapore. Landfill is gradually being phased out as a method of solid waste management, but still accounted for roughly one third of the total in 2011/12. Incineration and recycling/composting also make up around a third each. London&apos;s air contains more than 2.5 times as much NO2 than the EU standard - still slightly less than Paris - but is well below the EU&apos;s recommended ceiling for particulate matter. PM10 counts in Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam are all higher than that of London. NO2 levels closely follow London&apos;s road network, with Heathrow Airport and the M4 standing out as particularly high. Unpacking London: transport, tech and planning     Data on transport, planning and the digital economy in London, mapped and analysed over time. Click for larger image    Since 1993 car travel has decreased faster in London than across the UK as a whole, and average annual distance traveled per person in 2011 was roughly half of that for the country overall. Bus, tube and overground travel continues to grow, with distance traveled on public transport approaching the same level as car miles. Cycling has taken off in London, with the number of cyclists in the capital trebling since 1985, and overtaking that of both New York and Stockholm. Berlin remains ahead of London on this nominal measure, and at 13% has one of the highest proportions of cycle trips a share of all journeys. London&apos;s office space is well served by public transport links: almost 1m cubic metres was built between 2004 and 2011 within 500m of a station, with no new office construction more than 2km from a public transport hub. The City of London has seen more new office space than any other part of the capital, while the bulk of retail and leisure floorspace has gone to the Olympic Park and surrounding area. Shoreditch has the highest density of IT jobs in the city, followed by Holborn and parts of the City of London. Despite its strong performance in the digital economy, London has slower broadband speeds (both download and upload) than European neighbours including Berlin, Paris and Copenhagen, as well as Tokyo and Seoul, whose speeds are several times faster.

If you want to boast about your own city&apos;s benefits, decry our choices or make your own alternative nominations, then get involved in the comments section below. 1. Hong Kong  Hong Kong tops virtually any healthy cities index. It has one of the highest population densities of any city in the world combined with one of the wealthiest: gross national income per capita is $45,090 (\u00a328,115). With every square foot of real estate at a premium, people tend to stay out of the home to socialise; local restaurants become neighbourhood living rooms. According to LSE Cities, nearly 45% of all trips in Hong Kong are made on foot. All of which lends itself to a very healthy lifestyle. Its life expectancy, at 82.5, is one of the world&apos;s highest; its infant mortality rate, one of the lowest. It also has a high number of registered doctors \u2013 12,818 to be precise, at the end of 2011, which is a ratio of 1:554 of the population. Given the city&apos;s density, that probably means most people live in the same building as one. 2. Tokyo  Tokyo remains the world&apos;s biggest city with a greater metropolitan population of some 35 million and \u2013 as with Hong Kong \u2013 one of the wealthiest, producing a GDP of $1,479bn (\u00a3922.3bn). Having arguably the world&apos;s best public transport systems leads to healthier lifestyles and (relatively) lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE). According to the London School of Economics professor Ricky Burdett: &quot;The average commute in Tokyo takes one hour, whereas Sao Paulo and Mexico City, which are smaller populations but enormous cities, have average commuting times of four hours.&quot; Japan&apos;s life expectancy remains the highest in the world \u2013 85.9 years for women and 79.4 years for men \u2013 perhaps helped in part by the fact that the number of murders in Tokyo is very low by global urban standards: 7.7 per million people in 2010. 3. Copenhagen  Western Europe&apos;s major cities all fair well in health and wellbeing listings, consistently outperforming any city in North or South America. However, Scandinavia remains the health and wellbeing capital of Europe. Denmark topped Gallup&apos;s Global Wellbeing Index, and Copenhagen is the jewel in its crown. One of the reasons behind its success is that it has achieved something very few cities of more than a million inhabitants have: it has replaced a driving culture with a cycling and walking culture. According to a study by the University of the West of England, pedestrian activity accounts for 80% of all traffic in Copenhagen city centre. Car use for commuting in Copenhagen fell from 42% in 1996 to only 26% in 2004; in contrast, commuting by bicycle accounts for 36% of all work trips. This means that you can take a lungful of air in central Copenhagen without fear: per capita carbon emissions from transport have declined by 9% between 1991 and 2011. 4. Stockholm  Sweden came fourth in Gallup&apos;s Global Wellbeing Index, and Stockholm joint sixth in Mercer&apos;s 2011 global city rankings for personal safety. An increasingly wealthy city, its Gross Value Added per capita has grown by 41% from 1993 to 2010. It is also green \u2013 the world&apos;s first national urban park is Stockholm&apos;s Royal National City Park, which remains an urban lung stretching for six miles within the city. Per capita GGE decreased by a whopping 31% from 1993 to 2010. And Stockholm also scores highly for mental stimulus, with one of the highest concentrations of museums in the world \u2013 there are more than 100. 5. Sydney  Large Asian cities such as Osaka and Singapore could feel rightly aggrieved for not appearing on this list, while this Australian metropolis does \u2013 Sydney&apos;s sprawling suburbs and car-based culture hardly seem the epitome of the healthy city. However Sydney tops the LSE&apos;s Metropolitan Wellbeing index for its quality of education \u2013 a major wellbeing factor \u2013 whilst also coming in the top 10 for health and the top 20 for wealth. It is also the embodiment of a healthy outdoor culture that many cities want to be (see San Francisco and New York) but few actually manage, with a high level of sports clubs and facilities (many the legacy of the Sydney Olympics), parks and beaches, not to mention good weather virtually all year round. Far from resting on its sandy laurels, Sydney is still working at it \u2013 20,000 new street trees are to be planted to increase urban canopy by 50% by 2030, an investment in bicycle infrastructure has seen bike trips triple in peak periods and a retro-fitting programme of City buildings has seen GGE reduce by 18%, with a plan to hit 70% over the next 20 years.

The move into short-haul and domestic destinations, made possible as a result of taking over key Heathrow takeoff and landing slots from British Airways that the flag carrier was forced to relinquish to assuage competition concerns as a result of its merger with bmi, comes as Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson is set to give up control of the airline he founded in 1984. He is in talks with US group Delta Air Lines and Air France-KLM after Delta approached Singapore Airlines, which owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, with a view to buying its shareholding, As part of the deal the European carrier would also buy part of Branson&apos;s 51% stake. The new ownership structure could be unveiled this week. Virgin is expected to operate nine daily services to Scotland, starting in the spring, but its ambitions to enter the short-haul and domestic market could stop there. Three other prized takeoff and landing slots that were up for grabs after BA&apos;s \u00a3186m acquisition of struggling bmi from Lufthansa are to be returned to International Airlines Group \u2013 the parent company of BA and its own merger partner Iberia. IAG&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh, said he was &quot;surprised&quot; that Virgin had not taken the full complement of slots, but added that he could not see the airline making any money from the domestic business. Virgin will operate six round-trip flights daily from London to Edinburgh and three daily round-trips to Aberdeen starting in April 2013, with fares from \u00a399 return. The planes will be branded with Virgin&apos;s red livery, and passengers served food by crew in Virgin uniform, but the 174-seat Airbus 320s will be leased from Aer Lingus and operated by the Irish airline&apos;s employees. Virgin said its domestic services, plus three daily round trips also starting from Manchester to the London hub in the spring, will create more than 150 new jobs in the UK. &quot;Throughout our history, Virgin Atlantic has successfully fought British Airways all over the world and has offered passengers a compelling alternative through our renowned product and service,&quot; said its chief executive, Steve Ridgway. &quot;We will look to replicate that in our short-haul flying and challenge the current BA monopoly on these routes which is causing serious consumer harm. &quot;This is a robust business model that will protect competition to and from Heathrow for the long-term.&quot; But Walsh warned: &quot;From a business point of view I can&apos;t see any logic. I think it&apos;s going to be a drain. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to generate any profits for them.&quot; But, he added, &quot;they need to do something to reinvigorate themselves&quot;. Commenting on speculation that Delta may purchase Singapore&apos;s stake in Virgin, Walsh suggested the deal could ultimately see the end of the Virgin Atlantic brand. Although Delta cannot own more than 49% owing to foreign ownership rules, Walsh said it could take effective control through a partnership with Air France-KLM . &quot;They&apos;d be buying the slot portfolio at Heathrow. But I can&apos;t see Delta operating the Virgin brand \u2013 Delta believe they are the number one airline in the world.&quot; Virgin has abandoned the other three Heathrow slots as under the competition authorities&apos; directive they had to be used for either Scotland or certain other named destinations. One possibility was Moscow, a destination Virgin has long wished to serve, but Branson&apos;s airline was thwarted by a decision by the Civil Aviation Authority to give the flying rights \u2013 limited by a bilateral agreement with Russia \u2013 to BA and EasyJet. BA could still be obliged to give up the slots from 2014 should another airline decide it wants to offer competing services to Scotland or fly to one of Nice, Riyadh or Cairo, the other possible destinations for the remedy slots. IAG boss condemns government&apos;s economic policy Walsh has lashed out again at the government&apos;s economic policy, saying George Osborne&apos;s austerity plans would not lead to growth and accusing the government of deterring foreign investment. Commenting on the autumn statement and wider austerity, he said: &quot;You can&apos;t downsize a business to long-term profitability. You have got to create an environment where you can pursue growth. &quot;I can&apos;t disagree with reducing the cost base, but I don&apos;t see an agenda for growth, and some of the measures that have been taken are making us less competitive.&quot; Walsh said Britain was overly focused on US and European export markets, while &quot;the world is changing&quot;. He said air passenger duty and a restrictive visa regime were damaging the UK and making it less attractive to investment. &quot;It requires brave decisions on the part of government and I don&apos;t see this is as a brave government."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/dec/10/performance-related-pay-teachers-targets", "sentences": ["Oddly enough this hot-housing is exactly what currently happens in Singapore where January to April is pure &apos;past-papers&apos; and revision.", "Mr Gove also seems fascinated by Singaporean education.", "Oddly enough, that&apos;s what they believe in Singapore too."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-10T15:47:00Z", "title": "Performance-related pay will mean yet more emphasis on results", "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Education", "Schools", "Teaching", "Professional development"], "article": "Phew! Regional pay was all a bad dream and all is well with teachers&apos; salaries. Well, no, not really. Now before someone yells that teachers were always going to kick-off about performance-related pay; ask why? Two main reasons, really. Firstly, knowing Michael Gove all too well, this is going to be payment by results, not prowess. Aren&apos;t they the same thing, I hear you ask? Not at all, I say. There are many things taught and learned that do not lend themselves to being measured by an end-of-term exam but this move has the potential to trigger a stampede to the exam grade line, which will ultimately lead to a narrower curriculum and masses of revision to pass tests. Next we&apos;ll have &apos;hot-housing&apos; to get a pay rise. Anything not related to an exam will become of little value or importance. Mr Gove will like this because he is fixated with end of term exams. Oddly enough this hot-housing is exactly what currently happens in Singapore where January to April is pure &apos;past-papers&apos; and revision. Mr Gove also seems fascinated by Singaporean education. Didn&apos;t we realise long ago that a narrow curriculum, based purely on passing exams, is an archaic notion? Over the past few years we have seen, particularly in primary schools, a real decline in focus on the foundation subjects as the pressure to get SATS results increases. Children are no longer developing skills and knowledge in art, design technology at the rates they were before league tables. Children are not all the same and some will excel in these areas and become our future designers or engineers. Will the day come when primary schools have a 75% curriculum of numeracy and literacy? It is far from impossible if pay relies on it. Will a teacher pay anything but lip-service to other subjects when a much needed pay increase (due to years of pay freezes, pension increases and so forth) is needed? In an ideal world, yes, of course. In a world where mortgages need to be paid and rising costs are squeezing household budgets? Perhaps not. Bear in mind teachers start on a salary of around \u00a321,588. After recent pension increases and so forth, that figure loses roughly a third. Many young teachers are also paying back student loans. This means that some young teachers already lose up to 50% of their wage. Will the prospect of this attract top graduates, especially if they believe they have a possibility of staying on that salary if they don&apos;t hot-house their students? In any event, is that really why someone wants to teach? Many potentially high performing teachers will be lost. Which brings me to point two: who decides what is good performance? The answer is the headteacher or line manager (answering to the headteacher) of course. Is it any wonder that the NAHT welcomed this, even if a little dubiously? What a glorious uplift of power. The appraiser can set the teacher&apos;s targets without agreement, decide on the quality of teaching through observation and withhold a pay rise if the targets are not met. And what will the department heads&apos; targets be? No doubt based on the results obtained by junior staff. The head will expect results and the junior staff will be pressured into getting them: not for the student&apos;s all-round education, but for money. In this scenario the head either directly or indirectly fully controls not only the career path and daily workload of the teacher, but also holds financial power too. Is it ever sensible to put this amount of power in the hands of one person, particularly in a situation where budgets are being squeezed and Ofsted is hovering at the door? And what about headteachers&apos; pay rises? Actually they don&apos;t have increments; they have a salary fixed within a range that can rise on factors other than performance such as pupil numbers. They&apos;ve reached the pinnacle and won&apos;t rely on results to get a rise. I am convinced that the incentive will be to give increasingly more difficult targets and rely on sheer financial pressures to make teacher&apos;s hot-house their students to pass exams. Because Mr Gove believes exams are all and everything. Oddly enough, that&apos;s what they believe in Singapore too. Joe Waddle is a primary school teacher in Wallsend.

I don&apos;t have a million pounds \u2013 so a knee in the groin, maybe \u2013 I&apos;m sure that would be just as painful for him as me.&quot; There has been increasing speculation that Branson may soon be taking a back seat in running the Virgin airline after moves from Delta, the US giant, to buy Singapore Airlines&apos; 49% stake. Branson confirmed in October that he was considering joining an airline alliance. Walsh claimed that the commercial logic for Delta would be in taking effective control through an alliance and ending the Virgin brand. Branson responded by writing on his blog: &quot;This is wishful thinking and totally misguided. Will BA never learn? Let&apos;s see how much they believe this. Let them put their money where their mouth is. &quot;The last time BA had to make a settlement to me for damages (in part for spreading not dissimilar false rumours) I split the money amongst our staff. Rather than suing them on this occasion, I will pay \u00a31m to their staff if Virgin Atlantic disappears within, say, five years. If not, BA pays our staff \u00a31m.&quot; Walsh, speaking in the South Korean capital Seoul, where British Airways is launching a new route, said: &quot;If he wants to say he will be owning it in five years&apos; time in its current form, then that would be an interesting bet to accept. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve said lots of things about Branson and he hasn&apos;t sued me.&quot; Walsh went on to compare the Virgin boss unfavourably to Ryanair&apos;s Michael O&apos;Leary: &quot;I don&apos;t see that the guy has anything that stands out in terms of what he&apos;s achieved in the industry, unlike others. &quot;O&apos;Leary has been a true pioneer and changed the industry. He&apos;s a very abrasive individual but he manages customer expectation like no one else in the world. Everyone has a clear idea before they book a Ryanair flight and I don&apos;t think they disappoint. &quot;But on financial performance, he&apos;s achieved things no one else has and he should be recognised for that. He&apos;s demonstrated that you can be profitable in this industry even in a downturn and even in a recession.&quot; Walsh meanwhile announced that the first of British Airways&apos; new and quieter Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes would come into service at Heathrow in May next year, along with more Airbus 380s in July.

The picture comes from a trio of vast studies by the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which compared dozens of countries based on assessments carried out at various times on samples of hundreds of thousands of students. The IEA&apos;s methods aim to gauge absolute achievement against set standards, allowing countries to see whether their schools are performing better or worse overall compared with those of others. The so-called Pirls assessment \u2013 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study \u2013 which gauged the language skills of 325,000 students aged about 10, ranked England 11th out of 45 nations, notably better than the 15th from 40 seen in the previous study in 2006. The other two measures fall under the IEA&apos;s Trends in International Maths and Science Study, or Timms, which has a pair of assessments, for students aged about 10 and those around 14, bringing in more than 600,000 children in all. In maths, both age groups in English schools held steady in terms of absolute scores against the last sample, in 2007, although their league places moved slightly. The younger pupils came ninth out of 50 nations and territories against seven from 36 before, with the 14-year-olds 10th out of 42 compared with seventh from 45 in 2007. The news on the science front was less good, with both English age groups losing years of gradual gains to revert back to the scores seen in the first such study in 1995. The 10-year-olds are now rated 15th from 50 entrants, as against seventh out of 36, with the older pupils going from fifth to ninth in a group which reduced from 45 to 42. The three reports, covering almost 1,400 pages in all, carry a wealth of detailed information aimed primarily at education professionals, although other facts stand out, for example that England is ranked 39th out of 45 countries for gender equality in reading, with girls greatly outperforming boys. Such is the studies&apos; size and complexity, much like that of equivalent but separate global education league tables drawn up by the OECD, any government can seize on the data to confirm its policies are correct. The junior education minister, Elizabeth Truss, a right-leaning Tory MP who believes the UK should more closely mirror the hard-edged economic and educational policies of Singapore, Korea and Hong Kong \u2013 all of which cluster near the top of the IEA&apos;s tables \u2013 said a lack of progress in maths and a drop in science was &quot;a real concern&quot; and connected to the end of compulsory tests for all 11-year-olds. In a speech at the London base of Microsoft, Truss said England was now following the lead of &quot;the world&apos;s most successful education states&quot;. She said: &quot;That is why we are driving forward the academy programme and giving schools the freedom to make their own choices. That is why we are bringing in new rigorous exams that will be on a par with the best in the world and reforming the curriculum to focus on core arithmetic, algebra and geometry like high-performing jurisdictions.&quot; The paradox is that while Truss and her boss, the education secretary, Michael Gove, seek a move towards an Asian-style system of crammed facts and rigorous exams, educators in those countries are wrestling with the paradox that their pupils too often emerge competent but narrow and uncreative in their thinking. Earlier this year Singapore&apos;s education minister proposed a long-term move towards a less restrictive system. It is also a good bet that Truss and her colleagues will fail to highlight the position in the IEA tables of Sweden, the government&apos;s model for its ambitious free schools programme. While Sweden saw a marginal improvement in science, its maths scores have flatlined and it is one of only four countries whose reading standards have declined over the past decade."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/dec/11/uk-expat-experiences-comprehensive-guide", "sentences": ["I realise we didn&apos;t give everyone a space to offer advice (apologies Miamijim in north Finland, but I don&apos;t think your adopted home was anywhere near the top 10), but some of you weighed in with useful tips for other places \u2013 dukesup gave good arguments for and against relocating to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-11T09:10:33Z", "title": "UK expat experiences \u2013 a round up", "tags": ["Moving overseas", "Expat finance", "Money"], "article": "Where do UK expats live?

Giving the inaugural lecture of the new Global Public Leaders series, Ong explains how, through creating more than 1,600 &quot;convenient, technology-enabled services,&quot; public bodies in Sinagpore have been able to both increase their efficiency and to satisfy the public&apos;s &quot;growing hunger for participation in governance&quot;. Technology allows participation at a low cost, and co-production of policy between the civil service and the community allows the public to feel some &quot;ownership&quot; over policy. Citizens are able to register their children for school using the internet and report road faults via their mobile phones. Even the prison service provides self-service kiosks where prisoners can carry out simple administrative tasks unassisted - a move that has contributed to Singapore having one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world. In delivering responsive public services, the key word for Ong is empathy, which he defines as, &quot;keeping the perspective of the citizen in mind, from the first mile of design to the last mile of implementation.&quot; He also urges leaders not to ignore the needs of those who don&apos;t fall neatly into the perimeters set by policy. It was this customer-focused attitude which led the Singapore&apos;s Inland Revenue authority to scrap mandatory tax returns for citizens in 2007. Now, half of Singaporeans have their details transferred directly to the taxoffice by their employer; a move which has also reduced the workload in the peak period. The alternative to this was to develop an e-filing system, but as Ong says, &quot;no need for service is the best form of service&quot;. Ong also advocates greater co-operation between public agencies. To help customers navigate the civil service bureaucracy, this year Singapore has introduced a &quot;first responder&quot; system, wherewhoever takes the initial contact is responsible for ensuring the citizen is put in contact with the right person. This was preceded by a &quot;no wrong door&quot; policy from 2004, which was often confusing for citizens due to the number of different staff that could potentially be involved. In such a change-focused environment, Ong believes that the role of strong leaders is vital. They must be far-sighted, adaptive to change and able to pull together a successful and highly capable team. This approach, &quot;requires a constant unease about the status quo&quot;, he says, &quot;and this is not comfortable&quot;. \u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian public leaders network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

Branson has insisted the much-anticipated deal with Delta does not sound a death knell for the Virgin Atlantic brand \u2013 despite speculation to the contrary from Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA parent IAG, in recent days. Publicity around the tie-up between Delta and Virgin came close to descending into farce as Branson and Walsh taunted each other over the likely consequences for the airline established by the Virgin entrepreneur 28 years ago. Walsh disparagingly suggested that Delta would not tolerate Branson&apos;s brand for long, suggesting the US airline was really largely focused on securing Virgin&apos;s Heathrow airport slots. Branson hit back, provocatively proposing a \u00a31m bet that the Virgin brand would remain in existence for at least five years. Later, Branson claimed on his blog that the goading exchanges had got even more puerile. &quot;Glad to see Willie Walsh&apos;s rather childish response to my bet proposal,&quot; he posted. &quot;Rather than the losing company giving the winner&apos;s staff \u00a31m, he wants the loser to receive a knee in the groin.&quot; On more serious matters, Branson said: &quot;For almost three decades Virgin Atlantic has been punching above its weight. We fought hard to stop BA and American Airlines getting together but they created a complete giant across the Atlantic. &quot;Now we are partnering with Delta we can give them a real run for their money which is, I suspect, why BA&apos;s chief executive has behaved the way he has over the last couple of days.&quot; While the two businesses will co-operate closely in many areas, generating significant \u2013 but undisclosed \u2013 savings, the Delta and Virgin liveries will remain distinct, leading to some suggestions the deal could lead to consumer confusion. Customers at New York&apos;s John F Kennedy airport will be able to use either the Delta or the Virgin lounge which are alongside one another, while Delta&apos;s operations at Heathrow are expected to move alongside those of Virgin&apos;s at terminal three in years to come. The collaborative operation will bring together Virgin&apos;s six round-trip flights a day from Heathrow to JFK with a further three operated by Delta. While both sides acknowledged deal negotiations had been hard fought, Delta&apos;s chief executive, Richard Anderson, sought to smooth over suggestions of any remaining tensions or cultural clashes with Branson&apos;s airline. &quot;To be associated with a great business leader and a great business brand like this is truly humbling for us at Delta,&quot; he insisted, adding that Delta and Virgin cultures would &quot;mesh well together&quot;. Branson earlier this week insisted he would remain in control of Virgin, and on Tuesday reiterated the point. &quot;Ignore the press speculation \u2013 I&apos;m not going anywhere,&quot; he said. Delta and Virgin emphasised that the collaboration would improve rather than damage consumer choice. Virgin&apos;s chief executive, Steve Ridgway, said the alliance &quot;will be combating their [BA&apos;s] dominance of 60% of the north Atlantic [flight market]&quot;. Branson said the deal was necessary to create a partnership that would &quot;give the rest of the industry a true run for their money&quot;. The Virgin founder said he had asked Anderson if there was any truth to Walsh&apos;s claims that Delta intended to kill off the Virgin brand. &quot;He replied: &apos;No! This makes my blood boil. The whole purpose is to join our brands together.&apos;&quot; Started in 1984 with a single flight from Gatwick to Newark in New Jersey, Virgin now flies to 34 destinations and carries about 6 million passengers a year. Delta serves more than 160 million customers a year and offers services to more than 300 destinations in 58 countries."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/dec/11/english-schools-slip-science-rankings", "sentences": ["The government will be alarmed at English pupils being outstripped not just by students in the traditional east Asian educational powerhouses of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, but also those in emerging economies such as Russia and \u2013 for the younger pupils only \u2013 the Czech Republic and Hungary."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-11T19:25:19Z", "title": "Decade of science progress in English schools reversed, global study finds", "tags": ["Secondary schools", "Schools", "Education", "Science", "Science", "English and creative writing", "Languages", "School tables", "Education policy", "Politics"], "article": "More than a decade of improvements in science education in English schools have been eroded over the past four years, according to a vast study of attainment in dozens of countries around the world. While English pupils have slipped down the four-yearly global rankings for science knowledge put together by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), they have improved in reading and held their position in maths, the new trio of studies showed. The results were immediately seized upon by the government as justification for its breakneck programme of changes to schools, notably the expansion of academies. Labour, meanwhile, claimed credit for creating what it called some of the best schools in Europe, while teaching unions cautioned against reading too much of anything into yet another set of complex educational league tables. Most scrutiny will be focused on the science element of the IEA&apos;s Trends in International Maths and Science Study (Timss), covering more than 600,000 students who were tested in groups at the ages of 10 and 14. Both sets of English pupils tested in 2011 lost places in the rankings against the previous results. In 2007, the 10-year-olds ranked seventh out of 36 countries; now they are 15th out of 50. Their older peers slid to ninth of 42 nations from fifth in 45. What will be more concerning is that the absolute rating for attainment for both age groups \u2013 an IEA-designed coefficient from one to 1,000, with 500 as the average \u2013 saw increases from 2003 and 2007 reversed, with both scores returning to more or less the same level as in the first study, in 1995. The government will be alarmed at English pupils being outstripped not just by students in the traditional east Asian educational powerhouses of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, but also those in emerging economies such as Russia and \u2013 for the younger pupils only \u2013 the Czech Republic and Hungary. In a speech at the London base of Microsoft, the junior education minister, Elizabeth Truss, said the science scores represented &quot;not just a relative decline, but an absolute fall in performance&quot;. This had happened, she said, following the abolition by the last Labour government of the externally marked standard assessment tests (SATs) in science for primary pupils, but she said there were no plans to bring this back.Truss noted the relative lack of science teaching for the secondary pupils, with English 14-year-olds spending 102 hours per year on the discipline, below the 158-hour average and less than Iranian or Palestinian pupils. That said, the study shows little direct link between teaching hours and attainment, with Macedonian 14-year-olds coming near the bottom of the achievement table despite a 334 hours per year of tuition. The IEA&apos;s studies, much like similar intermittent league tables compiled by the OECD, generally contain so much data as to support a series of different, even contradictory, arguments. As well as the science rankings, the IEA released new tables for reading and maths, both of which provided better news for English schools. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls), which gauges the language skills of 325,000 students aged about 10, ranked England 11th out of 45 nations, notably better than the 15th from 40 seen in the previous study, in 2006. In maths, both age groups in English schools held steady in terms of absolute scores against the last sample, although their league places moved slightly. The younger pupils came ninth out of 50 nations and territories against seven from 36 before, with the 14-year-olds 10th out of 42 compared with seventh from 45 in 2007. Truss is among a group of right-leaning Tory MPs who argue the UK should more closely mirror the hard-edged economic and educational policies of some east Asian countries, even while those nations debate whether their fact-heavy, exam-based systems can stifle creativity. Truss failed to mention the government&apos;s model for its ambitious free schools programme. While Sweden saw a marginal improvement in science, its maths scores have flatlined and it is one of only four countries whose reading standards have declined over the past decade, something pointed out by Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary. He said Labour&apos;s schools policies should take credit for English schools being &quot;some of the best in Europe&quot;. This was, curiously, one area where the two major parties agreed. A spokesman for education secretary, Michael Gove, said: &quot;Labour deserves the praise for the small improvement in reading and the blame for the stagnation in maths and the decline in science. The tests say nothing, good or bad, about what we have done.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 14 December 2012. The original said that in 2007, England ranked 15th out of 50 countries in primary school science tests and now was seventh from 36.

What does he hope to gain by predicting that the Virgin Atlantic name will disappear as a result of Delta&apos;s purchase of a 49% stake from Singapore Airlines? He has reinforced the stereotype that big bad BA is driven mad by the mere existence of little &apos;ol Virgin. Branson will love that \u2013 indeed, as ever, he is milking it. As it happens, it&apos;s odds-on that wee Willie loses his silly wager. The deal between Virgin and Delta, encompassing a joint venture on north Atlantic routes, was accompanied by a firm commitment from both sides that the Virgin Atlantic name will retained. Nothing is for ever, of course, but five years \u2013 the duration of the bet \u2013 doesn&apos;t seem a stretch. After all, Branson is keeping his 51% stake, and you can be 100% confident that the name will be retained as long as that shareholding structure survives. And, even if KLM or some other EU-based airline eventually buys part of Branson&apos;s holding, the bearded one may insist that his brand lives on. The terms of the Delta deal look reasonable from Virgin&apos;s point of view. Nobody is under any illusion about why this partnership is happening: BA, which already has a joint venture with American Airlines, has half the take-off slots at Heathrow after its purchase of BMI British Midland; Virgin, with only 3% of the slots, feels squeezed. Delta doesn&apos;t bring many additional Heathrow slots but it is the biggest US airline and may be able to deliver some of the promised &quot;significant corporate traffic flows&quot; as loyalty programmes are merged and flight schedules co-ordinated. That&apos;s assuming regulators give their approval \u2013 but they should. The deal represents a change of tack for Virgin Atlantic but after losing \u00a380m last year it had to do something. It&apos;s not a game-changer, but one can understand why Walsh is annoyed by the threat of greater competition. But, come on, he really ought to have bigger matters to obsess about \u2013 such as loss-making Iberia, where staff facing job cuts may not be uplifted to hear about their boss&apos;s instinct for putting the boot in."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/dec/12/2011-census-good-bad-news", "sentences": ["They educated all their children \u2013 even the girls \u2013 and their offspring live in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Perth and of course London."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-12T11:55:55Z", "title": "2011 Census: good news, bad news or both? | Michael White", "tags": ["Census", "Immigration and asylum", "Race issues", "UK news", "World news", "Politics"], "article": "How did you react to the revelations which emerged from the 2011 census for England and Wales? Did you measure it against your own life, daily experiences and immediate family? Did you recognise a country which is less white, less Christian, less married than a decade ago \u2013 to the alarm of some cultural conservatives and the delight of the multicultural crowd? I think it&apos;s fair to say the above trends have been gathering pace for most of the decades since the second world war and that what is different is the scale of the momentum in the past decade, chiefly \u2013 but far from exclusively \u2013 driven by the huge influx of arrivals from new EU member states which the Labour government allowed after 2004. As with most things in life there&apos;s an upside and a downside to all that and which side we take is coloured by our own experience. Get a Polish plumber to fix the drain or a Polish nanny to mind the kids more cheaply and better than those the census calls &quot;white Britons&quot; and it must seem a useful addition to life&apos;s rich and increasingly diverse patterns \u2013 as the Guardian&apos;s Johnny Freedland suggests here. Lose those two jobs to a foreigner and then find the local primary school or hard-pressed GP&apos;s surgery overcrowded by the same foreigner&apos;s family and it&apos;s not such fun. Whether or not the pros will outweigh the cons in the years to come it&apos;s too early to say. Just look how 17th-century Protestant migration patterns from Scotland to Ulster have echoed noisily down the centuries, while Protestant refugees from France to England at the same time have proved entirely benign. Thanks to immigration Britain&apos;s demographic trends are healthier than in many neighbouring countries \u2013 ageing populations can be a serious problem for society \u2013 but the economic benefits seem to be mixed. There are too many other variables, not least the need to restore growth, to permit a confident prediction. Some immigrants are stinking rich, others stinking poor. Alarm over census data has been routine since they were started in 1801. Note that Scotland goes its own way \u2013 virtually unremarked in insular Fleet Street where the Times reports that the population of &quot;Britain&quot; is now 56.1 million. Whoops! Today&apos;s Northern Ireland&apos;s data, always sensitive on religious/ethnic grounds of its own, is here. In any case, a lot of other things affecting the makeup of the population are happening without a single Polish plumber or Indian-born IT specialist in sight. I think I read that there are now more people with degrees than with no qualifications. That squares with my own experience and observation \u2013 though it won&apos;t be so on many a council estate. None of my parents&apos; generation went to university in our family, nor did most of my dozen cousins and two \u2013 my sisters \u2013 of my three siblings (though they both trained as teachers which would count nowadays). We each had three children \u2013 six of each \u2013 so there are 12 nephews/nieces/cousins in play, all but one of whom are graduates and in work. What is striking to me, surprising too, is that they range in age from 27 to 42 but still have only six children between them. Wow! That&apos;s a drop on our generation. What happened? Everything from later marriage/partnership to what may be a reluctance to commit. &quot;In the old days you just had to get on with it. Young people today have a bewildering range of choices,&quot; says a wise old child psychiatrist of my acquaintance. In the wider family we&apos;ve got same-sex partnerships and two mixed-race marriages. My Canadian niece is married to a man whose mum is Parisian French and whose father is a Sikh. My two grandchildren are half Chinese with a dash of Burmese, though it should be added that my wife is a Kiwi of English, Irish and Channel Island stock, while my contribution is mostly Cornish. Tricky, isn&apos;t it? My wife has paid taxes and held citizenship here (before she met me) for almost 50 years \u2013 but she still sounds a bit foreign. My Salford-born daughter-in-law&apos;s grandmother who died in Sarawak last week at 98 crossed the South China Sea at 18 to marry a man she barely knew. It worked out fine. They educated all their children \u2013 even the girls \u2013 and their offspring live in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Perth and of course London. Big cities suit migrants and it&apos;s always worth reminding cosmopolitan city dwellers that the Guardian&apos;s beautiful maps still show vast swaths of the country which are over 90% white Briton \u2013 Cornwall is 98% so \u2013 where foreign-looking faces are rare. But even cities vary. A Frenchman of Vietnamese stock I know was shocked to be racially abused in monochrome Newcastle upon Tyne the other day. Yet in Essex, where they joked a generation ago that &quot;even the newsagents are white&quot;, Priti Patel is now Tory MP for Witham. Things change \u2013 but they also remain the same. Patel articulates Essex values. The census confirms that fewer now call themselves Christian, but they are still 59% against the Muslim 4.8%. Though less than half of those over 16 (an odd cut-off point that?), the married (46.6%) are still the largest block, and not all single adult households hope to remain that way and probably won&apos;t. Renters outnumber mortgage holders (a serious reflection on price and shortage) but homeowners who have paid it off should not be overlooked either. And so it goes on. As usual the Daily Mail&apos;s editorial page is alarmed by the march of diversity and the metropolitan editorial team at the Guardian is encouraged. I&apos;m not sure either view captures the appropriately mixed message from the data. In the Mail melancholy writer Douglas Murray argues that the scale of immigration in the noughties has been too fast to absorb, though the success of the London Olympics points to a brighter message. But is the Guardian editorial right to conclude that &quot;it is very bad news for the Conservatives&quot; for the same reason that the decline of &quot;angry white men&quot; as a demographic block is proving fatal to the US Republicans? I&apos;m not so sure. The British Tories have not painted themselves into such a foolish corner as the Republicans. Our culture wars are not so shrill despite this week&apos;s furore over gay marriage. The newcomers are often cultural conservatives who are comfy (I recently heard a clever bishop say) living in a monarchy. Cameron&apos;s marriage manoeuvre will please some, offend others. Even the Mail shrewdly carries an upbeat article on a successful mixed-race marriage. So it is surely as premature to assume the newcomers will be anti-Tory as it is for the Mail&apos;s Murray to trail \u2013 again \u2013 the preposterous conspiracy theory that Labour let in the Polish and Catholic millions, those Indian Hindus and Pakistani Muslims, because they hoped to create a majority Labour-voting coalition. People aren&apos;t static in their views. Their circumstances change and so do they \u2013 that&apos;s why they migrated in the first place, as my wife still occasionally reminds me. After all, the census confirms that &quot;white Britons&quot; are now a minority in the capital (though whites and Britons are not), a city famously Labour-leaning. Yet who has it twice elected as its mayor? Why, a Tory, blond and beefy Boris Johnson, a self-parodic chameleon of an Englishman. Yet dig a little deeper and you are reminded that Boris epitomises the diversity of the 2011 census. He is a bit English, German, Turkish, a bit Muslim, Christian and Jewish. Where does that blond mop spring from? From Goths who settled in Anatolia in the 5th century AD, says his biographer, Andrew Gimson. New-York-born Boris calls himself &quot;a one-man melting pot&quot; and he is right. It is part of the rascal&apos;s appeal. Not every immigrant is so clever, well-educated or entertaining, but us locals can be pretty dull too. So let us suppress those doubts and make the best of who we have now become: we may be that much-photographed Sikh Guardsman in a turban, but we&apos;re also Boris, though probably less flamboyant, blond or Tory. It could be worse."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/dec/13/un-momentous-resolution-universal-healthcare", "sentences": ["As the UN delegate from Singapore, Lee Boon Beng, said: &quot;The path to achieving universal health coverage is complex and there is no universal formula."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-13T13:26:57Z", "title": "UN adopts 'momentous' resolution on universal healthcare", "tags": ["Global development", "Health", "Society", "United Nations", "World news"], "article": "The UN&apos;s adoption of a resolution on affordable universal healthcare (pdf) was momentous, according to its advocates. The resolution, adopted by consensus in the general assembly on Wednesday, urged member states to develop health systems that avoid significant direct payments at the point of delivery and to have a mechanism for pooling risks to avoid catastrophic healthcare spending and impoverishment. There was unusually wide support for the resolution. It came from the global north and south, including the US, the UK, South Africa and Thailand. By gaining support from every corner of the globe, the resolution recognised enthusiasm for universal healthcare from diverse countries and economies, said the Rockefeller Foundation, which has funded research on universal health systems. According to the foundation, 150 million people worldwide face high healthcare costs, which push around 25m households into poverty each year. More than 3 billion people have to pay for healthcare themselves, forcing many \u2013 particularly women and children \u2013 to choose between healthcare and education. Ceri Averill, Oxfam&apos;s health policy adviser, said significant momentum around the vote had been building for the past two years, partly through the efforts of the World Health Organisation&apos;s director, Margaret Chan, and showed real public commitment to universal healthcare. &quot;We can hold member states to account because of the resolution,&quot; she said. For Averill and Jeanette Vega, managing director of Rockefeller, endorsement of the resolution means universal healthcare will now be on the agenda of the UN high-level panel \u2013 co-chaired by the UK prime minister, David Cameron, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia \u2013 discussing the post-2015 development goals. &quot;There have been lots of discussions of what health goals should be, for example on non-communicable diseases. This resolution gives weight to health systems as a whole and questions of equity. It ensures that universal healthcare stays on the agenda as one of the post-MDG goals,&quot; said Averill. Supporting universal healthcare is one thing, funding it is another. As the UN delegate from Singapore, Lee Boon Beng, said: &quot;The path to achieving universal health coverage is complex and there is no universal formula. Instead, member states should adopt different solutions to their unique circumstances.&quot; Here the debate revolves on the use of highly contentious user fees, insurance or general taxation. For Averill the problem with user fees and insurance is that the poorest people will not be able to afford them. Citing Ghana, she said no matter how low the insurance premiums are set, these will be out of reach of the poorest people and contribute very little in terms of funding. Many Ghanaians work in the informal sector, for example as street vendors, which makes it difficult to collect premiums. Thailand is held up as a pioneer in developing universal health coverage. The south-east Asian country introduced free universal healthcare at the point of delivery in 2002 and has shown the concept is not out of reach of middle-income countries. Around 99% of the Thai population is covered through a comprehensive healthcare package. It ranges from health prevention and primary care, to hospitalisation due to traffic accidents, to more expensive services such as radiotherapy and access to antiretroviral therapy treatment for people with HIV. Indonesia, the Philippines and China have rolled out insurance-based health coverage that includes almost their entire populations. Poorer countries, however, will have to rely on external help to extend affordable healthcare. Zambia on Thursday said it has been steadily increasing spending on healthcare, which is treated as a fundamental human right, but will have to rely on foreign help. &quot;External financing equally remains an important factor in Zambia&apos;s resource mobilisation,&quot; said the country&apos;s delegate, Dr Mwaba Kasese-Bota."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/dec/13/life-expectancy-world-rise", "sentences": ["Women in four countries however \u2013 Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Spain \u2013 have a healthy life expectancy greater than 70 years."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-13T17:00:00Z", "title": "Life expectancy around world shows dramatic rise, study finds", "tags": ["Health", "World news", "Society"], "article": "Life expectancy around the world has risen dramatically, by 11 years for men and 12 years for women over the last four decades, but we are paying the price in more mental and physical health problems, according to the biggest-ever study of the global burden of disease. A massive international research project, which took five years and involved 500 people, has produced the most comprehensive and ambitious database of the world&apos;s health ever attempted. It shows dramatic changes since 1970, with the rapid decline in deaths from infectious diseases and malnutrition and the vastly improved survival of small children. Most deaths in the world are now from heart disease and stroke, which killed an estimated 12\u00b79 million people in 2010, a quarter of the global total. High blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for death today \u2013 responsible for 9.4 million deaths and 7% of disability \u2013 followed by smoking, which caused 6.3 million deaths. Alcohol comes third, responsible for five million deaths worldwide, but a massive issue in eastern Europe, where it causes almost a quarter of all disease, and a serious problem also in Latin America. Physical inactivity and diet \u2013 particularly those with high levels of sodium or salt and low levels of fruit consumption \u2013 were responsible for 12.5 million deaths. With lengthening lives, however, the biggest issue for humanity may well be disability. Although we live longer, we do not necessarily enjoy more years of health. In the two decades to 2010, men&apos;s life expectancy increased by 4.7 years and women&apos;s by 5.1 years \u2013 but the extra years of good health were only 3.9 years and 4 years respectively, which suggests that illness and disability are taking a greater toll of our lives than they were 20 years ago. The biggest problems are mental illness, including anxiety, musculoskeletal pain and sight and hearing loss. Women in four countries however \u2013 Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Spain \u2013 have a healthy life expectancy greater than 70 years. In no country do men enjoy the same length of healthy life and only in Afghanistan, Jordan and Mali do they live longer in good health than women. Japanese women also have the longest life expectancy, living on average almost to 86, while the longest lived men are in Iceland, with life expectancy of 80 years. The findings that people are living longer but with worse health could trigger a rethink not only in our expectations but also the way all health systems work. &quot;We&apos;re finding that very few people are walking around with perfect health and that, as people age, they accumulate health conditions,&quot; said Dr Christopher Murray, director of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation of the University of Washington, which led the work published by the Lancet medical journal and launched at the Royal Society in London. &quot;At an individual level, this means we should re-calibrate what life will be like for us in our 70s and 80s.

The news will be a fresh embarrassment for the Swiss bank after Kweku Adoboli, a former employee, was jailed for fraudulent trading last month. The potential scale of the fine emerged during a week in which the Serious Fraud Office made its first arrests in the Libor scandal and two British banks \u2013 Standard Chartered and HSBC \u2013 paid out a total of more than \u00a31.6bn to settle damaging allegations of money laundering and sanctions busting from the US authorities. A former trader from UBS was among three men arrested on Tuesday by City of London police and the SFO in the Libor investigation, which was sparked by Barclays&apos; \u00a3290m fine in June.

UBS refused to comment on the scale and timing of any fine other than to repeat that it was &quot;co-operating with the regulators&quot; around the globe on the investigation into the manipulation of a set of key interest rate benchmarks that are used to set prices on contracts worth $300tn (\u00a3186tn) a year. The Swiss bank \u2013 already reeling from a \u00a330m fine from the City regulator last month over the failures of internal controls that let Adoboli incur losses of \u00a31.5bn \u2013 has had immunity from some regulators for co-operating with the Libor investigation. While the revelations accompanying the \u00a3290m Barclays fine led to the departure of chairman Marcus Agius, chief executive Bob Diamond and newly promoted chief operating officer Jerry del Missier, the UBS management will hope to escape the same fate as they were installed last year in the wake of the Adoboli rogue trading incident. The City is expecting a strategy update from the new Barclays management \u2013 led by Antony Jenkins who was promoted internally \u2013 in February but speculation is mounting that 2,000 roles will go inside the 23,000-strong investment bank which is likely to pull out of some areas of tax planning and food price speculation. On Friday Jenkins is expected to keep fighting a potential \u00a3290m fine for allegations it attempted to rig electricity prices in California. The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has set a deadline \u2013 already extended \u2013 for Barclays to respond to its allegations that the bank&apos;s traders claimed they &quot;totally fuckked&quot; (sic) with markets."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/dec/14/exporting-advisers-ukti-small-businesses", "sentences": ["What about IP queries in Singapore?"], "publicationDate": "2012-12-14T10:11:00Z", "title": "UKTI: how we can help small businesses looking to export", "tags": ["Exporting to new markets", "Guardian Small Business Network"], "article": "At UK Trade &amp; Investment, most of our customer-facing international trade advisers (ITAs) have a commercial background. In previous lives, many managed export sales or were managing directors, so they know the pitfalls and challenges \u2013 as well as the opportunities \u2013 of exporting. But ITAs are not employed by clients and receive no remuneration from them. Their time and experience is given free of charge to small businesses looking for help with exporting. This is vital, because with distance comes objectivity. They don&apos;t have the emotional involvement that employees with a vested interest sometimes do, and which can stand in the way of common sense and reason. This third party status also enables them to challenge their clients with a certain level of frankness. &quot;Why is your primary focus the USA rather than France?&quot;; &quot;How closely have you thought about your pricing strategy in the Middle East?&quot;; &quot;Why is your product better than that of your competitor?&quot; Apart from providing professional advice, ITAs will also recommend, where appropriate, suitable UKTI services, both free and chargeable, that will help companies better understand specific opportunities abroad. Exporting for the first time Exporting can feel like a minefield. An intrinsic part of helping a company decide on their strategy is working out how they will overcome the real and perceived barriers to entering an unfamiliar market. When businesses speak about the things that put them off exporting, the list always includes differences in language and culture, the risk of not getting paid, and foreign regulation and legislation. Internally, issues include who will do the extra work and how to afford the investment of time. ITAs can help their clients manage this new workload in a variety of ways, including signposting appropriate courses, seminars and peer-to-peer networking specifically designed to address these concerns. Assistance can also be brought in via colleagues in the embassies, consulates and high commissions. Want to know about tax issues in Australia? Your adviser can introduce you to the person in the know in Sydney. What about IP queries in Singapore? Yes, we have someone on the ground who can help you with that. The sheer amount of information and help available to companies at times verges on the unhelpful. For the average SME, if such a thing exists, time is in short supply \u2013 and they need impartial advice to help them process this mass of information. So ITAs have become great sifters. They keep abreast of what is happening in the wider world of export and can bring their client&apos;s attention to what is important and strategically useful, weeding out the unhelpful, irrelevant and inappropriate. Derbyshire-based firm Wheathills experienced a downturn in the antiques market at the start of the recession and realised that they would need to investigate new overseas markets for their luxury marquetry memory boxes. They contacted UKTI three years ago for guidance as to which countries would offer the greatest potential. Working closely with their ITA, they explored several markets, discounted some, and the European and US markets were chosen as primary ones for the product. A year and a half later, exports now make up 30% of the company&apos;s turnover, a figure that&apos;s increasing year on year. Our advisers are people people, a friendly face or sympathetic ear on the phone. They will put every last ounce of effort will into helping a client succeed. If, at the outset, an ITA is dubious about a firm&apos;s export potential, they will not hesitate to let them know. No one wins if a client fails \u2013 and the government will be quick to pull the plug if they feel they are funding an ineffective machine. Find out more about international trade advisers here. UKTI, in partnership with hibu, has also recently launched a free online service called Open to Export. Companies looking to enter new markets can post questions and get assistance through the service in real-time, including from ITAs in the UK and commercial officers based in embassies and high commissions overseas. The new service also offers market-based information on issues including legislation, company registration, finance, market research, product development and transport and logistics. There is also information on upcoming events, seminars, trade missions and business opportunities.

On Sumatra there is an extinct volcano. On that extinct volcano, there is a small lake, Lake Toba. In the middle of Lake Toba, there is a tiny island. This tiny island in a volcanic lake is, however, the same size as Singapore. David Bellamy, the famous British environmentalist, has said that tiny Singapore has more tree species than the continental 48 states of the US. Amitav Ghosh, a famous Indian novelist, echoed this observation: &quot;What is remarkable about Singapore is, despite all the buildings and developments, it remains so green.&quot; This is not a result of accident or good fortune. It is the result of a comprehensive matrix of environmental policies that reinforce each other, providing a model of environmental management that is worth studying in detail. The world also needs to study it urgently. In 2008, for the first time in human history, more people lived in cities than in rural areas. Urbanisation is accelerating.\u00a0By 2050, it is estimated that nearly 70% of the world will be urban residents.\u00a0Of the 25 most densely populated cities in the world, 17 are in Asia, and by 2025, 21 of the world&apos;s 37 megacities will be in Asia. Sadly, few of these cities are managing their environments well. The lessons from Singapore are clearly relevant to Asian megacities. Ghosh says: &quot;A lot of people I interviewed [in 1997] told me, 30 years ago, Singapore was just like Calcutta or Karachi. The transformation of this city in such a short time is a truly stunning thing.&quot; Just look at the water dimension. Projections from the 2030 Water Resources Group suggest that the global gap between water demand and supply could be as large as 40% by 2030. While the world is running out water, Singapore \u2013 which is one of the most densely populated countries in the world \u2013 is moving towards water self-sufficiency. Good public policies \u2013 including those that preserve water catchment areas, and develop advanced desalination plants as well as plants that utilise modern membrane technology \u2013 have led to this success story. This is why the Singapore Public Utilities Board (PUB) won the Stockholm Industry Water Award in 2007.\u00a0 Private sector dynamism meets public needs Significantly, many of these projects are provided through public-private partnerships between the PUB and private Singaporean companies, such as Keppel Engineering and SingSpring. The dynamism and innovation of the private sector has been harnessed to help meet public needs. Singapore&apos;s success in environmental management is also influencing its neighbors in Southeast Asia. Kuala Lumpur also began a greening program after watching Singapore&apos;s success. The late distinguished former Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, once told me privately that Jakarta&apos;s urban planners used to despair about improving their city. However, after studying how Singapore went from third world to first world in one lifetime, they began to believe that they too could succeed. And there are other remarkable Southeast Asian success stories. Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world, and has experienced the worst genocide of recent times. Yet its capital city, Phnom Penh, has a water authority that expanded the city&apos;s water output by 600% in just 10 years. It also manages its water supply better than most British water authorities. Given Singapore&apos;s environmental track record, it is appropriate that it plays host to two global, and increasingly influential, conferences that bring together major stakeholders from the public, private and non-profit sectors: the biennial Singapore International Water Week and World Cities Summit. These two conferences signify the international community&apos;s recognition that Singapore&apos;s successes in managing the scarcity of space and resources will help many other cities which will experience similar challenges in coming decades, if they are not already experiencing them now. Eco-city for the future Singapore is also sharing its experience directly with other cities. The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city, due for completion in 2020, is one such example. Together, the Singapore and Chinese governments are trying to build a sustainable city for the future, which will serve as a laboratory for the green technologies and public policies that we will need in the 21st\u00a0century and beyond. Already, more than 600 companies have moved to the Tianjin Eco-city and 4,000 homes have been purchased. Singapore has also discovered that good environmental policies are good for business. As a result, Singapore is rapidly becoming a hub for the development and manufacturing of sustainable energy sources. Large international firms that specialise in renewable energy \u2013 such as Denmark&apos;s Vestas Wind Systems and Norway&apos;s Renewable Energy Corporation (REC) \u2013 have set up shop here. The Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) is home to 160 leading researchers from across the globe, thanks in large part to a S$130m (\u00a366.1m) government grant, and it collaborates directly with multinational solar companies such as Trina Solar and REC in research and development, as well as personnel training. These industries are becoming increasingly important to Singapore&apos;s economy: by 2015, the cleantech sector is expected to contribute S$3.4bn (\u00a31.7bn) to Singapore&apos;s GDP and employ 18,000 people. In a world that is devoid of good news on the environmental front, Singapore&apos;s success provides a lot of hope to many. There is one critical statistic that explains the metaphysical significance of Singapore&apos;s success. If the world&apos;s seven billion people were to live in a single city as densely populated as Singapore, the entire world would only need an area the combined size of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana to live in.

Talk has drifted from the lack of Ribena on the rider to the need to find a precision allen key. It&apos;s heady stuff. If you could draw a comic strip on the very real thrill of being in a band playing live, versus the very real tedium of being in a band knobbing about on tour, this is the archetypal &quot;before&quot; frame. Hello, Holland. &quot;I love touring. I&apos;m at my happiest when I&apos;m on tour,&quot; insists singer/multi-instrumentalist Ahmed Gallab. &quot;It suits me. I&apos;ve never really lived in one place for longer than four or five years, I like being on the move. I come from a pretty nomadic family, I guess.&quot; Dressed in the classic post-Strokes uniform of grey hoodie, battered leather jacket and white tennis shoes (or rather, plimsolls), Ahmed pulls daft poses on the photo shoot with the rest of the band: guitarist Mikey Freedom Heart, bass player Ish Montgomery and drummer Jason Trammell. Ahmed is keen to stress that he wants the four of them to be viewed as a unit. But at this point, Sinkane is really Ahmed&apos;s project: it&apos;s his music, his drive. Ahmed&apos;s peripatetic lifestyle (more on which later) seems to be replicated in the actual sound of Mars, Sinkane&apos;s debut album. Its eight tracks are anchored neither by genre nor place. Instead, George Clinton-like plush funk melds with psych-rock, Sudanese haqibah drum beats mosey along under abstract jazz riffs; it&apos;s what, in theory, you might expect would be the ultimate result of music made in the global village. (Were that not, in reality, already taken by the internationally adored Guetta effect blaring out from clubs from Soweto to Singapore.) Ahmed has spent the last seven years working on Sinkane. During this time he also cultivated solid indie credentials, first playing drums for Caribou and Of Montreal, then as a keyboardist for Yeasayer. &quot;The worst thing anyone ever said to me was that I wasn&apos;t good enough or my music wasn&apos;t worth it, even after I put everything into it,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s not easy to hear, even if you appreciate it later.&quot; Ahmed is far from glib or blas\u00e9 about his experiences so far. It&apos;s weirdly refreshing, and he reels off the dates he has memorised: 9 November 2007: the day he handed Caribou his demo; 10 May 2008: ATP Camber Sands and the weekend he met Yeasayer; 6 May 2012: the first time the band played together live as Sinkane. It&apos;s a long way from growing up, feeling slightly alien, in the predominantly Mormon state of Utah. Ahmed was born in London but spent the first five years of his life living in Sudan with his parents and two younger sisters. His father, Abdullahi Gallab \u2013 a journalist and, later on, politician \u2013 was exiled from the country following an Islamist-led military coup of the state in 1989. The family were forced to swiftly relocate; an old friend reached out and the Gallabs moved to Utah. &quot;I was the only black kid and only Muslim in my school in Provo, it was a homogenous Mormon culture. But I was the skateboarder who listened to punk, was into hardcore, the DIY scene.&quot; By the time Ahmed was in college in Ohio, where he studied strategic communications and Arabic, he began to feel even more of an outsider. &quot;I learned a lot from [the DIY and hardcore] community but it was never really home. I got chastised by fellow African Americans. [I was labelled] an Oreo cookie; it was, &apos;Oh you&apos;re black but you listen to white music?&apos; I was considered weird, people didn&apos;t get me.&quot; Understating the experience, he simply adds, &quot;It was trying&quot;. Both of his parents are college professors in the States, specialising in Middle Eastern politics and sociology, respectively. &quot;My dad had to move to a whole new country and set up again in his 40s,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine what that life is like. It&apos;s only now, for the first time in my life, my parents are finally comfortable.&quot; Like most exiles, the Gallabs retained a fierce, romanticised pride for their Sudanese heritage and, with the exception of his dad, would summer for three months in Sudan every year when Ahmed was growing up. &apos;I don&apos;t agree necessarily with a band being political. The point of music is to create a visceral energy&apos;     Sinkane onstage in Brooklyn.  Photograph: Mike Lawrie/Getty Images    Oddly, despite the familial links, politics is the only subject that provokes an uneasy tension. One moment, Ahmed is discussing &quot;the cacophony of new music&quot; (and ergo whether &quot;it leads to the rise of mediocrity&quot;). Jason eulogises the beauty of analogue recordings, Ish nods along. The next moment, poor Mikey shuffles awkwardly as somehow, Obama has come up in the backstage conflab and Jason and I are waffling on about the multiple failures (and merits) of his presidency. Jason, by his own admission, is an open book. He&apos;s engaging and honest, where Mikey and Ahmed are entertaining but more guarded. Ish, you get the impression, is naturally zen. &quot;I think it&apos;s important to know, to read, to be aware and be a citizen, but it&apos;s really difficult to talk to someone about something so sensitive,&quot; says Ahmed. &quot;I grew up around politics. I can engage but I actively choose not to. That&apos;s a very natural reaction for a second-gen person coming from a political family.&quot; Both him and Mikey agree - and fair enough - that the band&apos;s politics should stay personal. &quot;I don&apos;t agree necessarily with a band being political,&quot; says Ahmed. &quot;There are other platforms to project that. The point of music is to create a visceral energy.&quot; On the second night of their tour, in Munich, Sinkane flood the room with energy. Which is a relief, if only because the set in Utrecht turned out to be something of a damp squib, leaving the Guide wondering if the irresistible groove of singles Runnin&apos;, Jeeper Creeper and album closer Caparundi might have got lost in live translation. That&apos;s not the case over the border. A couple of hours earlier on the same stage, Heems from Das Racist declared his band over, to the German crowd&apos;s massed indifference. By the time Sinkane finish up as the headlining act around 1am, the Munich fans are roaring for an encore, footstomps and whistles obscuring the conversation of the band backstage even though I&apos;m standing three feet away from them. After some to-ing and fro-ing, Ahmed makes a dash back to the mic. &quot;This is really flattering guys,&quot; he tells an audience still emitting high-level whoops, &quot;but that really is it. We don&apos;t have any more songs. Um, thank you so much. Have a great night!&quot; Which, for the next few hours at least, laden down with free booze and a promise that they can relax off the record, they do in rock&apos;n&apos;roll style. No cheese sandwiches in sight.The Guardian&apos;s flight to Holland was paid for by City Slang \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 17 December 2012.

Both, he complains, tend to underplay the suffering the company caused. I would add a third romanticism, occasionally on display in Raffles and the Golden Opportunity, Victoria Glendinning&apos;s new biography of Sir Stamford Raffles, a lad of parts who found his role as company man, the founder of Singapore and of the London Zoo. Raffles was one of thousands of company employees who, with their long suffering wives, pursued riches for the company, the country and themselves. British opinion on the company remains ambivalent: it was frequently excoriated at the time, but it brought great wealth, and for all our 21st-century sensibilities about the evils of empire, there sometimes lingers a hope that the company, or some of its men at least, did good in addition to doing well. Thomas Stamford Raffles, the author tells us, was motivated by three desires: fame, money and the desire to do good. Of the three, his fame today is assured by his role in the creation of one of the world&apos;s most successful city-states. He founded Singapore in an improvised ceremony on a rat-infested foreshore in 1819. (His contemporary and rival, Lt Col William Farquhar, also played a role, but history has been less kind to his contribution.) He could also claim fame as a member of London&apos;s competitive early imperial intellectual circles, collecting artefacts, giving papers, writing on the cultures, flora and fauna of the territories Britain was coming to dominate. He believed that the imperial project was an improving one, without falling into the vice of despising the natives or regarding them as primitive. The money came and went: Raffles died at 45, heavily in debt to the company that not only refused him a pension but clawed back two years of salary. As for doing good, his clearest claim lies in his resolute abhorrence of slavery, a practice he outlawed whenever he could, much to the irritation of his employers. Raffles&apos;s family had neither social position nor money, but he was lucky in his patrons: an uncle bought his first clerical job in the company; the father of a friend recommended him for a post in Penang and Lord Minto, who served as governor, gave him support. He was a perennial optimist and an impulsive and ambitious man who acted first and asked permission afterwards. He organised an invasion of Java, seized by the French from the Dutch in the Napoleonic wars, only to see it handed back to the Dutch on Napoleon&apos;s defeat. Those who disliked him \u2013 and there were many in the company and the military \u2013 sneered at his pretensions and jibed at his inferior birth. Glendinning gives us a fascinating picture of the working life of this world-changing company, though Raffles remains an oddly enigmatic figure. He had many appealing traits: he was sociable and unpretentious; he had great personal charm and diplomatic sensitivity; he married twice for love, the first time to a woman 10 years older who had an illegitimate child. He endured her death, and the painfully tragic deaths in quick succession of four beloved young children from his second marriage. Sudden death \u2013 of friends and enemies, adults and children, stalks these pages. He also lost the bulk of his great collection, along with his personal property and papers, in a shipboard fire as he was returning to England. He never lost his optimism or ambition."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/16/richard-branson-and-british-airways-trade-insults", "sentences": ["A knee in the groin maybe \u2013 I&apos;m sure that would be just as painful for him as me.&quot; Branson, back in Necker \u2013 with details of Delta&apos;s \u00a3224m purchase of Singapore Airlines&apos; 49% stake in Virgin confirmed in transatlantic press conferences \u2013 leapt jubilantly on Walsh&apos;s &quot;rather childish response&quot;, saying: &quot;It seems a very painful and foolish thing for him to propose, but I would be happy to accept.", "Virgin though has not simply \u2013 until now \u2013 kept fiercely clear of alliances, Singapore&apos;s investment notwithstanding, but attempted to derail Walsh&apos;s own plans, including IAG&apos;s takeover of the loss-making bmi."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-16T00:04:12Z", "title": "Virgin Atlantic's Delta deal shows airline mergers are inevitable", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Richard Branson", "Willie Walsh", "Virgin Atlantic", "British Airways", "Travel & leisure", "Business"], "article": "Air travel and global communications promised to bring people together. But what two titans of those industries have shown is that modern technology can also reignite a good business feud across three continents. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic hangars sit beside each other at Heathrow, but the bosses are poles apart. In Mumbai to launch new flights recently, Virgin&apos;s Sir Richard Branson responded to a question about Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA&apos;s parent company International Airlines Group, with a simple &quot;Who?&quot; \u2013 a slight noted instantly at IAG&apos;s head office. By 3am, in the galley of a BA plane flying over central Russia last Sunday, Walsh was sharing a few choice thoughts on rumours that Virgin was set to announce a deal with American carrier Delta Air Lines. A buyout could only signal the end of Branson&apos;s beloved brand, he speculated. Branson, leaving New York for his Necker Island home, was quick to reply to reports of Walsh&apos;s words. &quot;This is wishful thinking and totally misguided. Will BA never learn?&quot; he wrote on his blog, offering a \u00a31m bet that Virgin Atlantic&apos;s name would still be on the planes in five years&apos; time. Walsh, now in the South Korean capital, Seoul, responded that if Branson was saying he would still own the airline in its current form, it was an interesting bet. But he wanted to even the stakes up with the man he called a billionaire banker: &quot;I don&apos;t think a million pounds would hurt him. A knee in the groin maybe \u2013 I&apos;m sure that would be just as painful for him as me.&quot; Branson, back in Necker \u2013 with details of Delta&apos;s \u00a3224m purchase of Singapore Airlines&apos; 49% stake in Virgin confirmed in transatlantic press conferences \u2013 leapt jubilantly on Walsh&apos;s &quot;rather childish response&quot;, saying: &quot;It seems a very painful and foolish thing for him to propose, but I would be happy to accept. We&apos;ve got used to BA hitting below the belt over the years, but I&apos;m confident it would be the other way around on this occasion.&quot; Although he referred to the bet as &quot;this bit of fun&quot;, whoever gets to do the kneeing is likely to apply maximum force. Both men are keenly aware of the value of headlines, but this is not pantomime enmity: it&apos;s born of fierce competition \u2013 and it&apos;s personal. Walsh and Virgin&apos;s departing chief executive, Steve Ridgway, share public platforms and are amicable. But with the Virgin founder, it&apos;s a different matter. Bad blood between the airlines long predates Walsh. In 1993 the &quot;dirty tricks&quot; legal battles culminated in BA paying Virgin more than \u00a33m in damages and costs to settle a libel case. The price-fixing scandal of the mid-2000s, which led to BA being fined \u00a358.5m for colluding on fuel surcharges while Virgin escaped punishment for reporting it to the authorities, still rankles. Beyond these historic wounds, BA has been constantly aggravated by an upstart that took it on and \u2013 although only a fraction of BA&apos;s size \u2013 consistently demanded equal attention, and usually received it. Most think mergers inevitable in a perennially struggling industry hit hard by recession and sky-high fuel prices. Virgin though has not simply \u2013 until now \u2013 kept fiercely clear of alliances, Singapore&apos;s investment notwithstanding, but attempted to derail Walsh&apos;s own plans, including IAG&apos;s takeover of the loss-making bmi. Douglas McNeill, a transport analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, says: &quot;It&apos;s long been acknowledged that the industry would benefit from consolidation. There are simply too many airlines chasing too few passengers. &quot;But talk is cheap \u2013 Walsh got on and made it happen. He&apos;s put together four significant deals in two years: first Iberia-BA, then adding bmi and [Spanish airline] Vueling, with the American Airlines joint venture along the way. And Virgin has lobbied against much of that activity.&quot; In McNeill&apos;s view, Walsh &quot;sees himself as helping to create the future of the industry, and Virgin as an obstacle to progress&quot;. Yet the deal Virgin struck with Delta last week, forming a joint venture on transatlantic routes that will (with competition clearance) see the airlines feeding each other&apos;s passengers into their own network, is a tacit admission that Walsh&apos;s vision of the future is inescapable. Looking ever more the minnow as rivals combined, Virgin needed something to emulate BA&apos;s own effective merger of UK-US routes with American Airlines. Aviation consultant Chris Tarry says the upside is clear: &quot;It gives Delta and Skyteam greater access to Heathrow, and feeds more of its origin traffic to London. And it gives Virgin greater access to the domestic markets in the States.&quot; But he warns that the &quot;synergies&quot; airlines seek in partnerships and alliances don&apos;t automatically follow. Sceptics of the benefits of cross-border consolidation can point to the problems of Air France-KLM \u2013 if not IAG itself. Ownership rules restrict takeovers from outside the EU. Brian Pearce, chief economist at the International Air Transport Association, points out that antiquated bilateral treaties on flying rights between nations also inhibit full mergers, so airlines are finding inventive ways to achieve the same results. Airline alliances, he added, had not resolved issues such as unproductive scheduling clashes: &quot;This is the next step from the alliance. Airlines have found they can plan their businesses much more effectively in a joint venture.&quot; Now both Walsh&apos;s and Branson&apos;s airlines will be buoyed in competition on lucrative transatlantic routes by a major US partner. And as for that knee-in-groin bet? McNeill, like Walsh, thinks there could be a threat to the Virgin brand if Delta gets the chance to buy Branson&apos;s controlling stake, but there are plenty of obstacles. While it doesn&apos;t take a contract lawyer to spot that these two wily operators have left enough wriggle room in the terms of the wager for 11 December 2017 to pass without any testicular nastiness for either, McNeill concluded: &quot;Walsh might be well advised to put a cricket box on his Christmas list.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/16/china-architecture-wang-shu-rowan-moore", "sentences": ["Usually they just copy some model from Japan or Hong Kong or Singapore or United States."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-16T00:05:23Z", "title": "Wang Shu: the architect challenging China's obsession with scale", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "China", "Wang Shu"], "article": "In architecture, or at least construction, China currently has a mesmerising effect. It is the land where developments seem so large, so numerous, so ruthless, so inexorable and indifferent to European scruples of taste, scale or propriety that the latter begin to look like futile luxuries. This is the future, seems to be the message, and, like it or not, you had better get used to it. The architect Wang Shu would like to offer an alternative view. He does not dispute the power and prevalence of huge new building projects in China, but that they are the only or inevitable architectural products his country has to offer. Amateur Architecture Studio, the practice he runs with his wife Lu Wenyu, is concerned with such things as memory, location, craft and identity, for &quot;real feeling between people and construction&quot; and the ways in which they can be recognised in the extraordinary time through which China is now passing. They do this with projects including a history museum in the coastal city of Ningbo, an art academy in his home city of Hangzhou, and the rescue of a historic street, Zhongshan Road, also in Hangzhou. I catch Wang as he is visiting London for the first time, to speak at the Sustaining Identity conference at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum: &quot;People say it&apos;s so big, but really it&apos;s a very cute village&quot;, is his first impression of the city. Of development in his own land he says: &quot;I don&apos;t think the model is good. Usually they just copy some model from Japan or Hong Kong or Singapore or United States. They destroy very large pieces of cities and replace them with closed districts with walls and policemen. It bears no relation to real Chinese life. Maybe we should find the real reality.&quot; In the Ningbo museum this means a massive, severe structure, part ship, part mountain, part castle, enriched with tiles and bricks salvaged from demolished houses. Wang says he met a woman there who told him &quot;she visited four times in half a year. She found many things similar to her original house, which had been demolished. She came to find her memory. Modern Chinese cities don&apos;t have memories, but in their deep heart they need memories. It really moved me.&quot; Wang Shu, now 49, is the most recent winner of the Pritzker prize, the world&apos;s most famous award for architecture. He was one of the jury&apos;s less expected choices, although it was high time they noticed China \u2013 he is the first from that large country to win \u2013 and he does, in fact, fit with a pattern in their choices. They tend to alternate between big stars, such as Rem, Zaha, Rogers and Foster, and thoughtful, dedicated types closely bound to the places where they work, such as Glenn Murcutt in Australia, Paulo Mendes da Rocha in Brazil and Peter Zumthor in Switzerland.     Wang Shu: \u2018I have a very different future in mind.\u2019 Photograph: Zhu Chenzhou/AP    Wang is in the latter category. This doesn&apos;t mean he is simply a folk artist or a traditionalist. He is more bold and robust than that. As the Ningbo museum shows, he&apos;s not afraid of large buildings or of the plain forms of modernism. His Zhongshan Road project includes a chunky wooden roof loosely based on ancient bridges, and some curious, zoomorphic towers in rough concrete. His understanding of &quot;craft&quot; includes the fact that buildings are sometimes roughly and cheaply made. Nor is he concerned only with crafting perfect artefacts in a rustic retreat, but also with the social effects of buildings. He accepted a commission from a developer in Hangzhou to build a housing tower. &quot;Usually I would refuse,&quot; he says, &quot;but this client is a very funny person. He graduated in history, writes poems and novels, and has some idea about culture.&quot; He wanted to &quot;discuss some different way&quot; of building a high rise. Wang wanted to find out how the traditional forms of the Chinese home, where several people might live around a courtyard, might be transposed to vertical living. He came up with &quot;this crazy idea&quot;, where the tower is simply a stack of courtyards, each one of which can be landscaped and planted \u2013 with trees if desired \u2013 by its residents. &quot;Usually, in a high-rise building people, can&apos;t tell which window is their own. Here you can plant a pine tree and say that the flat with a pine tree is mine.&quot; It was a qualified success: whereas many new apartments in China are bought up by investors, this block is 90% occupied by families who own their homes. But it took six months to sell, in a market where blocks can sell out in a week. Wang is not in a great hurry to work with a developer again (and the developer of the courtyard tower, although &quot;proud&quot; of it, is not rushing to work with Wang again). Indeed, Wang is prepared not to work at all, if the conditions aren&apos;t right for him. He tells his staff: &quot;I just want to do the right thing. If I have to stop my work, everyone can go back home. If I want to stop, I can stop. This is why I call my studio Amateur.&quot; He sees himself as almost alone in taking this position, before remembering that his friend Ai Weiwei, artist, architect and dissident, &quot;is, apart from me, a good architect in China&quot;. If, out of a population of more than a billion, this seems like a quixotic\u00a0position, Wang doesn&apos;t believe it&apos;s a hopeless one. &quot;I have a very different future in mind. I believe that eventually these massive projects will collapse. These things are passing. They will not last.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/16/stop-london-supremacy", "sentences": ["&quot;Having been to Singapore,&quot; he said in 2006, &quot;and seen how successful it was I think anything short of a fully independent city state is a lost opportunity, with its own foreign and defence policies thrown in.&quot; Since when, the widening of economic and cultural differences between the capital and the rest of the country would have ensured, even without the Johnson line in PR, that the interests of Londoners looked more and remote to fellow-Britons, and closer and closer to the preoccupations of fellow city-state residents from New York to Rio de Janeiro."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-16T00:06:12Z", "title": "Never has London seemed more like a city state apart | Catherine Bennett", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "Ken Livingstone", "Politics", "London", "UK news"], "article": "Concluding a year of exceptional London triumphalism, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has been swanking, pretty much non stop, about the capital&apos;s superiority to everywhere else, including its host country. Speaking recently at the CBI, he claimed for London, rather than Britain, the success of the jubilee, at which Prince Philip contracted cystitis in the rain. London, not Britain, hosted the Olympics; London, not Britain, is &quot;the world centre of banking and finance&quot;. Given a chance, he will even boast about London&apos;s falling murder rate. Although, to his great credit, Johnson does not use the word &quot;buzz&quot;, that famous but hard-to-pin-down London phenomenon which is apt to have evaporated by the time you reach journey&apos;s end in, say, Edgware, some of his claims to London&apos;s pre-eminence are contested. There are not, possibly because of the high oligarch murder rate, more Michelin-starred restaurants in London than in Paris. But it cannot be denied, as Johnson told the CBI conference, that just as New York is the go-to megacity for cockroaches, London can claim to be the world&apos;s premier venue for rich litigants. No self-respecting foreign gangster or oligarch would think of suing anywhere else. It is just another sign of Johnson&apos;s originality that, where others might see only a minute group of interdependent shysters who shovel money from one hiding place to another, at the same time that they help push London property prices to levels of undreamed-of inaccessibility, Johnson recognises a precious income stream of which some minute fraction cannot but end up as minimum wages for Londoners. Even the meanest A-list litigants, he suspects, do not wash their own underwear. &quot;I have no shame&quot;, Johnson declared, &quot;in saying to the injured spouses of the world&apos;s billionaires if you want to take him to the cleaners, tahlink, take him to the cleaners in London. Because London cleaners will be grateful for your business.&quot; As for libel suits. &quot;I would never encourage anyone to sue,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;but if one oligarch feels defamed by another oligarch, it is London&apos;s lawyers who apply the necessary balm to the ego. And it is those rouble-fuelled refreshers and retainers that find their way into the pockets of chefs and waiters and doormen and janitors and nannies and tutors and actors and aromatherapists \u2013 and keep the wheels of the economy turning, and put bread on the tables of some of the poorest and hardest working families in the city.&quot; We look forward then, to many further London panegyrics in which Johnson shows how the capital&apos;s most despised characteristics can be re-invented as peerless assets. Take London pigeons, and the way these vermin reduce the burden on the health service by giving old bird-women a reason to live. Notice, how, when it snows in London, the streets are left ungritted, saving money and, in this picturesque condition, assisting keen skiers and sledgers. Admire the way London&apos;s abject arrangements for cycling keep all but the bravest off their bikes, thus boosting public transport revenue and helping nervous drivers. Visit its hard-working estate agents, and see how grateful they are for London&apos;s flourishing house prices, which at an average \u00a3444,393 ensure that poorer provincials will never be tempted to add to the colourful rush-hour congestion. Applaud the way lax banking regulation has helped make London great. Actually, he has already done that one: &quot;We can&apos;t solve the banking crisis by imposing more regulations than our rivals in other European jurisdictions.&quot; Even before Boris Johnson became a full-time London supremacist, with a tendency to depict the relationship between the capital and its country as that between a mighty benefactor and his useless family dependents, Ken Livingstone had joked about the case for separatism. &quot;Having been to Singapore,&quot; he said in 2006, &quot;and seen how successful it was I think anything short of a fully independent city state is a lost opportunity, with its own foreign and defence policies thrown in.&quot; Since when, the widening of economic and cultural differences between the capital and the rest of the country would have ensured, even without the Johnson line in PR, that the interests of Londoners looked more and remote to fellow-Britons, and closer and closer to the preoccupations of fellow city-state residents from New York to Rio de Janeiro. The evidence of the new census, showing that white ethnic British are now outnumbered in London, is unlikely to assist understanding. Not necessarily because this is a ratio that would feel unusual in many other regions and outlandish in some: the ostensible London melting pot obscures social divisions which ensure that many privileged Londoners move in circles that are quite as white-British as Budleigh Salterton, and much less so than those in Boston, Lincolnshire. Rather, the census figures provide yet another pretext, along with developments in London education, London housing, London budget cuts, London arts, London policing, for a London-based political and media class to continue to dwell on local, occasionally parochial stories that may be irrelevant to millions of non-Londoners. And these are covered to the exclusion of equally important, possibly more punishing developments in the lives of people who are less likely than ever to disturb the ruling, southern metropolitan class. The strain posed by immigration on London&apos;s social services will appear as far more pressing than the strain on Hartlepool of having no jobs. The loss of one London library will look infinitely more serious, to judge by the national coverage, than the loss of over 30 in Yorkshire. And the more, as they must, most journalists and MPs come from London and the south-east, the more unobjectionable such assessments will seem. Even Londoners, swelling with pride in their prodigiously declining murder rate, know that if they leave the city, they, along with their children, might never afford to come back. And what spiralling rents and the use of internships are not already doing to depress geographical mobility will be completed if ever Osborne decides, by entrenching unequal regional pay, that two cultures should be matched by two economies. Of course, this is fine if you like your political leaders drawn, as they are now, from London (Cameron, Miliband), or for mild variety Buckinghamshire (Clegg). If the BBC&apos;s recent relocations to Salford were, as often alleged, purely a symbolic gesture to appease licence payers, which have required absurd and expensive shuntings back and forth of hyperventilating celebrities, they did at least offer some resistance to the big message of the London Olympics: we rule. Short of moving the government out of London, to somewhere independent of Johnson&apos;s noble bankers, there are still ways the government can show the regions have economic purposes beyond dependency on the gifts of a domineering capital city, and almost any of them would be less disgusting than keeping visiting trophy wives in aromatherapy treatments."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/17/pollution-car-emissions-deaths-china-india", "sentences": ["In Delhi, there are now around 200 cars per 1,000 people compared with 70-100 per 1,000 population in Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-17T16:04:21Z", "title": "Pollution from car emissions killing millions in China and India", "tags": ["Pollution", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Travel and transport", "Environment", "Automotive industry", "Business", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "India", "Health", "Society"], "article": "An explosion of car use has made fast-growing Asian cities the epicentre of global air pollution and become, along with obesity, the world&apos;s fastest growing cause of death according to a major study of global diseases. In 2010, more than 2.1m people in Asia died prematurely from air pollution, mostly from the minute particles of diesel soot and gasses emitted from cars and lorries. Other causes of air pollution include construction and industry. Of these deaths, says the study published in The Lancet, 1.2 million were in east Asia and China, and 712,000 in south Asia, including India. Worldwide, a record 3.2m people a year died from air pollution in 2010, compared with 800,000 in 2000. It now ranks for the first time in the world&apos;s top 10 list of killer diseases, says the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. The unexpected figure has shocked scientists and public health groups. David Pettit, director of the southern California air programme with the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC), said: &quot;That&apos;s a terribly high number \u2013 and much more people than previously thought. Earlier studies were limited to data that was available at the time on coarse particles in urban areas only.&quot; Anumita Roychowdhury, head of air pollution at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a New Delhi-based environmental group, said: &quot;There is hard evidence now to act urgently to reduce the public health risks to all, particularly children, elderly and the poor. No-one can escape toxic air.&quot; The full effects of air pollution on health in Asian cities may not be seen for years, she said. &quot;Toxic effects like cancer surface after a long latency period. Therefore, exposure to air pollution will have to be reduced today to reduce the burden of disease,&quot; she said. According to the report, by a consortium of universities working in conjunction with the UN, 65% of all air pollution deaths are now in Asia, which lost 52m years of healthy life from fine particle air pollution in 2010. Air pollution also contributes to higher rates of cognitive decline, strokes and heart attacks. If the figures for outdoor air pollution are combined with those of indoor air pollution, caused largely by people cooking indoors with wood, dirty air would now rank as the second highest killer in the world, behind only blood pressure. Household air pollution from burning solid fuels such as coal or wood for cooking fell noticeably, but not having clean cooking and heating fuels remains the leading risk in south Asia. Fine particle air pollution in India is far above the legal limits of 100 microgramme per cubic metre. This can rise to nearly 1,000 microgrammes during festivals like Diwali. Improvements in car and fuel technology have been made since 2000 but these are nullified by the sheer increase in car numbers. Nearly 18m are expected to be sold this year alone. In Delhi, there are now around 200 cars per 1,000 people compared with 70-100 per 1,000 population in Hong Kong and Singapore. Rajendra Pachauri, head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and director-general of the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi, this week suggested the need to &quot;demand restraint measures&quot; in Delhi, to put a check on the growing number of cars so that there was a check on pollution."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/17/rbs-negotiating-libor-fine-fsa", "sentences": ["Court documents in Singapore have shown emails by former RBS traders quipping &quot;hahaha&quot; and describing Libor as a cartel.", "The documents have been filed as part of case brought by Tan Chi Min, a senior trader at Singapore who was sacked last year."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-17T18:20:00Z", "title": "RBS still negotiating with FSA over Libor fine", "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Banking", "Business", "Libor", "UBS", "European banks", "Europe", "World news", "UK news", "Banking reform"], "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland is continuing to negotiate with the Financial Services Authority over the scale of its penalty for attempting to rig Libor, amid speculation that Swiss bank UBS is close to agreeing a \u00a31bn fine with global regulators. An announcement from RBS is expected in the coming weeks, as it settles with UK and overseas regulators on the manipulation of the key benchmark interest rate. Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, in which the taxpayer owns a 82% stake, has already made clear that he expects the bank to face a large fine and that he wants an agreement to be reached by the time the bank reports its full year results in February. RBS is thought to be continuing to exchange information with the FSA about the scale of its involvement in Libor amid reports from Switzerland that UBS will admit that 36 of its traders were manipulating the interest rate based on the yen. UBS is said to be prepared to admit to criminal wronging in its Japanese arm and that charges could be filed against a number of former UBS bankers. A former UBS trader \u2013 Tom Hayes \u2013 was among three British men arrested last week in an investigation into Libor rigging by the Serious Fraud Office. The potential UBS fine keeps rising. Last week the Swiss bank had been expected to pay \u00a3630m - more than double the \u00a3290m that Barclays paid to settle allegations that 14 of its traders were involved in manipulating Libor. The FSA fined Barclays a record \u00a359.5m and US regulators fined the bank \u00a3230m and all its traders were granted anonymity in regulatory reports. Estimates for the RBS fine are wide, ranging from \u00a3150m to \u00a3350m and even higher. Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec, had estimated the RBS fine could be \u00a3400m. While the City awaits details of any further Libor fines, the parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of rate-rigging scandal, is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss its recommendations for the implementation of the ringfencing proposals by the independent commission on banking. The banking standards commission, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, had been asked to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny of the banking reform bill which is intended to set out the legislation requiring banks to ringfence their high street banking operations from investment banking arms by 2019. During evidence taken by Tyrie and his commission members it has become apparent that they are considering whether the legislation should include a backstop that allows the government to demand banks are broken up completely if they do not erect a strict ringfence. When Sir John Vickers, the architect of the ringfence as chairman of the ICB, was asked whether full break-up should be kept in reserve, he said he could not &quot;resist&quot; the idea. Its decision could be published around the same time that fresh evidence of the extent of Libor rigging is exposed in documents which are expected to be released with any UBS fine. The regulatory reports into Barclays exposed for the first time the rigging of the key interest rate in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis and highlighted concerns that during the crisis banks were inserting submissions into Libor that were deliberately too low in an effort to avoid any suggestion they were experiencing financial difficulty. Libor \u2013 which is now being reformed \u2013 required members to submit the price they expected to be charged by other banks to borrow over a number of time periods and in a number of currencies. UBS has already had a major change of its top management in the wake of the jailing of Kweku Adoboli for incurring \u00a31.5bn of trading losses, unlike Barclays whose chairman Marcus Agius, chief executive Bob Diamond and chief operating officer Jerry del Missier all quit in the days after the fine was announced in June. The regulators published documents alongside the Barclays fine showing traders offering bottles of Bollinger for setting Libor and quips such as &quot;done for you big boy&quot;. Court documents in Singapore have shown emails by former RBS traders quipping &quot;hahaha&quot; and describing Libor as a cartel. The documents have been filed as part of case brought by Tan Chi Min, a senior trader at Singapore who was sacked last year. UBS was hit with a \u00a330m fine by the FSA last month for the systems failures which allowed Adoboli to rack up the losses in the biggest fraud in UK history. It has also had a number of run-ins with US regulators and was served with a deferred prosecution agreement in 2009 on charges of helping customers avoid tax in the US. The banks declined to comment as did the FSA."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/17/david-cameron-eurozone", "sentences": ["In the same way, Cameron is able to come back and say: &quot;Look, I got us a free trade agreement with Singapore!&quot; And: &quot;Gosh everyone, I changed the rules on patent registration!&quot; Nobody in Brussels notices, but it pleases him."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-17T19:46:03Z", "title": "David Cameron's eurozone mix gets the party started", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Politics", "House of Commons", "UK news"], "article": "You know it&apos;s Christmas because things get silly.

Given this widely-reported statement by Lance Armstrong&apos;s lawyer and the acceptance of polygraph evidence by the Court of Arbitration for Sport for the first time in the case of the Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador (1), the use of lie detectors in sport has come under increased scrutiny. Could polygraph testing offer a solution for sport&apos;s doping and integrity issues? A polygraph measures and records a stress response automatically generated by a person when questioned. Following an analysis of results, an expert delivers an opinion on whether the individual is telling the truth. A comprehensive and independent report into the issue was published by the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2003 (2). It presents a number of conclusions to support the theory that polygraph results are inaccurate and unreliable. The report found that the accuracy of polygraph testing stands between 81 and 91% and concluded: &quot;We have reviewed the scientific evidence on the polygraph with the goal of assessing its validity for security uses, especially those involving the screening of substantial numbers of government employees. Overall, the evidence is scanty and scientifically weak \u2026 Almost a century of research in scientific psychology and physiology provides little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy.&quot; Even polygraph experts limit their claims of accuracy to at best 90% (3) or 95% (4). Polygraph evidence has been ruled inadmissible in a number of common law jurisdictions including Canada (5), New Zealand (6) and Jamaica (7). As yet, there is no English authority on the subject (8). The use of polygraph testing is likely to become more common in criminal proceedings in this country following the introduction of the Offender Management Act 2007 relating to registered sex offenders (9). The legislation will give the probation service in England and Wales new powers to polygraph test convicted, high-risk sex offenders on a mandatory basis. It is important to note that polygraph evidence obtained from such tests will not admissible in court (10). The only sports in which polygraph testing appears to be widely used are deep-sea angling (11) and natural bodybuilding (12). There have been a number of calls to introduce polygraph testing into cricket. In 2000 the King commission, a body set up to investigate match-fixing in South African cricket, suggested that lie-detectors be used to investigate allegations of corruption following Hansie Cronje&apos;s confession. Although Lord MacLaurin, then chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, came out very much against this proposal (13), the idea was not without its supporters. In 2001, Malcolm Speed, then the chief executive of the International Cricket Council suggested that lie detector tests should be conducted every six months for leading players, administrators and officials (14). Following more recent allegations of spot-fixing made against three Pakistan cricketers in December 2010, the MCC cricket committee put forward a proposal regarding the introduction of polygraph tests for players who are suspected of being involved in match-fixing (15). This proposal was supported by Rahul Dravid, the former captain of India, who stated: &quot;Even if it means giving up a little bit of freedom of movement and privacy, if it means undergoing dope tests, let us never say no \u2026 If it means undergoing lie detector tests, let us understand the technology, what purpose it serves and accept it.&quot; (16) Polygraph testing has appeared in football. It was introduced by the Singapore FA in 2001 on a random spot-testing basis. Winston Lee, the general secretary of the Singapore FA, is of the view that lie detector tests are a key deterrent to match-fixing and corruption. He said: &quot;All players are tested for fitness and so on, and now they have to have a random polygraph test as well \u2026 We have taken a very strong stand against match-fixing and we are quite happy that it is working. You can never totally eradicate the problem but it is realistic to try to reduce it and this is one way we have done this.&quot; (17) The actions of the Singapore FA were supported by Asia&apos;s Fifa vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan, who said: &quot;It is one method and it is working, so we welcome it \u2026 We can all learn from each other and I think in time it may become more widespread, we shall see.&quot; (18) In September this year, the Bulgarian club Lokomotiv Plovdiv ordered their players and coaches to take polygraph tests following allegations of match\u2013fixing. This decision was heavily criticised by Wil van Megen, a FIFPro lawyer, who noted that &quot;many scientists have criticised the use of the lie detector. They are not convinced that this tool is the most accurate to determine whether someone is telling the truth or lying&quot;. (19) Cas jurisprudence &quot;A lie detector test presents a margin of error, however small, and this impairs its reliability as a &apos;detector of lies&apos;.&quot; (20) Cas panel in 2000 The Cas code is silent as to the admissibility of polygraph evidence, although such evidence is inadmissible on a constitutional basis under Swiss law (21). Before Contador, the admissibility of polygraph evidence has been considered in at least three Cas cases (22). In each, the polygraph results were rejected as evidence per se. Most recently, the admissibility of polygraph evidence was considered before Cas during the International Cycling Union and World Anti-doping Agency cases against Contador following a positive test for clenbuterol during a rest day on the 2010 Tour de France (23). Contador sought to voluntarily admit expert evidence on the results of a polygraph test in an attempt to prove that he had not ingested the substance intentionally. Contador, of his own accord, underwent a polygraph examination, the results of which were analysed by Dr Louis Rovner, an experienced polygraph examiner who claimed accuracy levels of 95% (24). Dr Rovner&apos;s analysis concluded that Contador was telling the truth when stating he did not undergo a transfusion in order to benefit from clenbuterol. Importantly, Dr Rovner&apos;s conclusion was then verified by Dr John Palmatier, an independent polygraph credibility consultant. Regarding the admissibility of the evidence, Contador drew the panel&apos;s attention to article 3.2 of the Wada code: &quot;Facts related to anti-doping rule violations may be established by any reliable means, including admissions.&quot; He further underlined that the admissibility of a polygraph test in arbitration &quot;is far less stringent than in courts&quot;. Contador argued the polygraph examination was a reliable method and should therefore be admitted. Somewhat surprisingly, the admissibility of the polygraph examination as evidence per se was not disputed by the UCI or Wada. The two bodies did, however, refer to the previous Cas rulings on polygraph evidence and argued that the results should be given no greater evidentiary weight than a personal statement. Contador is notable as the first Cas decision to accept polygraph results as per se evidence with the panel finding that the polygraph results &quot;add some force to Contador&apos;s declaration of innocence&quot;, albeit then adding that the results &quot;do not, by nature, trump other elements of evidence&quot;. (25) The panel weighed the polygraph results in light of the other evidence presented and Contador was found guilty and stripped of his 2010 Tour de France title. A future for lie detectors in sport? The crux of the problem is that polygraph testing, even expertly administered, is unreliable. Lie detectors make mistakes and, rather fundamentally, this &quot;impairs its reliability as a &quot;detector of lies&quot;. (26) A 95% success rate means 5% false positives, 5% of athletes whose good names would be unfairly tainted and whose careers could be endangered. It is our view, therefore, that polygraph testing has no role to play in prosecuting integrity or doping offences in sport. The admissibility of polygraph evidence in Contador could be read to indicate a future for polygraphs in defence of integrity and doping charges. There is no certainty, however, that future Cas panels will follow Contador in accepting polygraph results as per se evidence. Even if they do, the very limited evidentiary weight given to the results in Contador indicates that polygraphs will be of limited value in this regard. The unfortunate truth for Herman is that even if Armstrong was to take and pass a polygraph test, neither the courts (nor the public) would be likely to pay much attention. \u2022 Ian Lynam is a partner and Hannah Haynes a trainee at Charles Russell LLP.

The return to &quot;east of Suez&quot; was signalled by General Sir David Richards in the chief of defence staff&apos;s annual Christmas lecture at the Royal United Services Institute in London on Monday evening. His speech was highly significant. It follows from what the Obama administration has been telling the Europeans \u2014 they have got to take more responsibility looking after the security interests not only of their own continent but those in the Middle East and Gulf. And it reflects David Cameron&apos;s view that British interests \u2014 not least commercial ones, and arms sales in particular \u2014 lie among the emirates, sultanates, and kingdoms, of the Gulf. These states are concerned about Iran, and will be for the forseeable future whatever that country&apos;s nuclear ambitions. This is how Richards put it: &quot;Though more conceptual work is needed, given the importance of the region and clear prime ministerial intent, I envisage two or more adaptable brigades forming close tactical level relationships with particular countries in the Gulf and Jordan, for example, allowing for better cooperation with their forces&quot;. Richards added: &quot;Should the need arise for another Libya-style operation, we will be prepared. This would greatly enhance our ability to support allies as they contain and deter threats and, with our naval presence in Bahrain, air elements in the UAE and Qatar, and traditional but potentially enhanced roles in Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, would make us a regional ally across the spectrum&quot;. British defence chiefs are holding out the prospects of British barracks in Bahrain (already a Royal Navy as well as US navy base) quarters in Qatar, and Typhoon hangars on the air bases of the UAE (which are toying with the idea of buy some Typhoons for themselves). The Gulf was not the only region Richards mentioned. In Africa, he said, British army brigades &quot;would be tasked to support key allies in the east, west and south whilst another might be given an Indian Ocean and SE Asian focus, allowing for much greater involvement in the FPDA (Five Power Defence Arrangements between the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore) for example&quot;. Against the background of America&apos;s &quot;pivot&quot; to the Pacific, this all sounds like another step towards the end of Nato, an alliance based on an area, the North Atlantic, which no longer has anything like the strategic significance it once did. In his wide-ranging speech, Richards talked about deterrence, Britain&apos;s new Joint Expeditionary Force, cyber attacks, the dangers of divorcing soft and hard power, and How We Will Fight, which will be a kind of mission statement for Britain&apos;s armed forces. He went through the inventory of kit available to the navy, army, and airforce.  He praised the potential of Britain&apos;s two new aircraft carriers \u2014 about which there is still much private scepticism in military circles \u2014 but made it clear, as he has done before, that the navy needs &quot;more vessels tailored to discrete but important tasks, to be deployed on a range of routine non-warfighting duties&quot;.  This was a thinly-disguised reference to anti-piracy and other operations against &quot;unconventional&quot; or &quot;non-state&quot; enemies. Noticeable by its absence of any mention was Britain&apos;s fleet of Trident ballistic missile submarines armed with nuclear weapons. It is Britain&apos;s most powerful weapon, a product of the cold war. It should also be Britain&apos;s most controversial weapon. The Conservatives want to replace it with a &quot;like for like&quot; system. There is widespread but suppressed opposition among defence chiefs to its replacement. But they say it is an entirely &quot;political&quot; decision. Therefore they cannot even mention it in public."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/18/motorbikes-indonesia-economy-consumer-goods", "sentences": ["Asean has long been dominated by the stronger economies of Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand, but with Vietnam&apos;s stability troubled by local corruption and global meltdowns, Indonesia is proving itself a potential leader for long-term growth."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-18T19:43:27Z", "title": "Motorbike sellers roar into town as Indonesians earn money to burn", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "L'Or\u00e9al", "Consumer spending"], "article": "The heavy throttle of a 1967 Chevy Impala echoes through the conference hall as crowds of men and women sporting 1950s hairdos, skinny jeans and tattoos gather round to ooh. It is day one of Indonesia&apos;s first Kustomfest and thousands are milling about along rows of hot rods, vintage Beetles, slicked-up Triumphs and pared-down Harley-Davidsons \u2013 some of which boast price tags of $20,000 (\u00a312,000) and higher. On the margins, buyers wander among stalls displaying coffin-shaped upright basses and punk baby clothes, a tattoo parlour and a stage for a metal band called Death Vomit. Ten years ago such an event would have been impossible. But as Indonesia&apos;s economy arcs into becoming what some analysts believe could be the world&apos;s seventh largest by 2030, a growing number of consumers are looking to spend their cash in ways they might not previously have imagined. &quot;A few years ago there were custom bikes and choppers, but there were just a few in every town,&quot; says the Kustomfest organiser, Lulut Wahyudi, a tattooed Yogyakartan who runs one of Indonesia&apos;s most popular custom-bike shops. &quot;But this culture is growing. Now everyone wants to be part of it.&quot; Vincent Lutiarso bought his first bike at 18 and has accumulated many more. &quot;This is an expensive hobby for us, but it&apos;s an escape from our daily lives,&quot; said the 35-year-old as he and members of his local motorcycle club took a break from touring under the hot sun. &quot;Back in the day, it was so cheap \u2013 now the demand is so high. I bought my first bike for $450 and now it&apos;s $4,500.&quot; Demand is so high, in fact, Lutiarso left his 18-year career in hospitality to start his own import business. &quot;My sales have increased about 500% in just the last two years. The market is going crazy. Next week I&apos;ve got five bikes coming from the US [retailing for] $75,000 each.&quot; Unlike many of its neighbouring Asian tiger economies, Indonesia has been growing steadily over the past decade, thanks mostly to increases in domestic consumption rather than to exports or manufacturing \u2013 both of which are prone to global fluctuations. Its GDP per capita has almost doubled in the past 10 years, with few signs of the boom and bust that have plagued richer countries, according to analysts at McKinsey, the research and consulting firm, which has forecast that Indonesia&apos;s economy will surpass Germany and the UK by 2030. &quot;The key thing is the growth [here] has been stable,&quot; said Raoul Oberman, from McKinsey. &quot;If you grow too fast you get overheating, you get delivery problems, you get even more inequality or people going overboard \u2026 In the last 10 years [in Indonesia], it&apos;s been 5% every year and the volatility around that [growth] has been the lowest of all the Brics [Brazil, Russia, India and China] and even of the OECD countries.&quot; Increases in labour productivity may have driven the bulk of Indonesia&apos;s economic growth in the past 20 years (GDP is expected to rise by 6% this year), but low inflation rates, strong investment and rising purchasing power have helped maintain it. Labour groups have become vocal, demanding better job protection, higher wages, more benefits. Jakarta&apos;s governor, Joko Widodo, has responded by increasing the capital&apos;s minimum monthly pay by 40% to 2.2m rupiah (\u00a3143), a move expected to trickle across the nation as local authorities set wages for their own regions. While it may yet have issues to iron out Indonesia&apos;s development is remarkable because it can be seen everywhere and at every social level \u2013 from the new villas sprouting up in Jakarta&apos;s suburbs to the number of farmers in the vast archipelago now able to buy electronic goods such as mobile phones, washing machines and motorbikes. Yet it is in Indonesia&apos;s second- and third-tier cities where the growth is highest, says McKinsey: places such as Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Medan, where there are, perhaps surprisingly, a growing number of &quot;biker brotherhoods&quot;. Lutiarso says his &quot;bros&quot; work mostly as waiters, cafe supervisors and four-star hotel managers. Most average salaries of about 4-5m rupiah a month (\u00a3260 to \u00a3325). But their low earnings do not stop them from saving and buying big. &quot;My own bike cost me $35,000 [\u00a322,000] so far and it&apos;s not even done yet \u2013 it still has to be gold-plated.&quot; This consumption phenomenon has not been lost on local and international businesses \u2013 whether they&apos;re Yogyakartan bike shops or global corporations \u2013 each regarding this 240\u00a0million-strong nation with new eyes. Last month L&apos;Or\u00e9al opened its largest plant in the world, a sprawling \u00a380m factory, on the edge of Jakarta, to accommodate ever-increasing regional sales in what the cosmetics and beauty company calls &quot;the new frontier of growth&quot;. Indonesia will be one of the top three markets in the Asia-Pacific region within a decade, the company says, with Indonesian sales of L&apos;Or\u00e9al products having increased 30% each year over the past four years. Executives are hoping to increase their target sales to 60 million people over the next 15 years. For any other nation such figures might seem a tall order. But in Indonesia analysts expect 90 million new consumers to emerge within the next 10 to 15 years. If the country maintains its stable economy it will prove an even more significant player in the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean), a 10-nation regional bloc with a total population of 600 million and a $2tn economy. Asean has long been dominated by the stronger economies of Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand, but with Vietnam&apos;s stability troubled by local corruption and global meltdowns, Indonesia is proving itself a potential leader for long-term growth. The nation recently won an Asean skills competition, beating Vietnam and Thailand, winning medals in fields such as IT, motor technology, industrial automation and mechanical engineering design. It was the first time Indonesia had won since the contest started in 1993. Indonesia&apos;s poverty levels are still high \u2013 nearly half of the country lives on less than \u00a31.25 a day \u2013 but government-affiliated researchers underline administrative attempts to correct that. A new &quot;economic corridors&quot; plan, with regions focusing on strengths such as mining, agriculture and energy, should spread the wealth more evenly, said Zakir Machmud, of the Institute for Economic and Social Research. &quot;We have a young population, which means potential for workforce and for income. If we can do the right thing with this human capital, we can realise that potential.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/dec/19/a-year-public-sector-procurement", "sentences": ["While Singapore may be one of the most fraud-free countries in the world \u2013 though it has had its fair share of scandals in the past 18 months \u2013 some other countries are not so fortunate."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-19T08:00:01Z", "title": "2012: a year in public sector procurement", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Procurement", "Finance"], "article": "A year with several trips to south-east Asia, the Middle East and Africa to run workshops and chair conferences has provided some interesting experiences and some new perspectives on procurement. One problem I have never before encountered is what one should do if a group of people have forced a warehouseman to steal from a warehouse by the threat of black magic. Another problem faced by a delegate was how to tell a national ruler that a major prestige project will not be delivered on time. Asked what happened, he said: &quot;We got thrown out&quot;. It turned out that an extra \u00a350m was found to finish the infrastructure project on time, but people were working 17 hours a day \u2013 a very stressful time for all, he said. Several of the workshop programmes addressed procurement fraud. While Singapore may be one of the most fraud-free countries in the world \u2013 though it has had its fair share of scandals in the past 18 months \u2013 some other countries are not so fortunate. Delegates were very open about the issue and there was some lively discussion on how to address it. Much interest was generated by the West Coast mainline contract debacle in the UK. No one went as far as to suggest that an attempt at corruption had occurred. However, there was a view that if one wanted to bias the process in favour of one supplier, with little or no evidence of wrongdoing, some apparent flaws in the process were the obvious things to do. The Laidlaw report has left open the possibility of corruption (paragraph 2.9) and this is something the Department for Transport will have to consider. This brings me to the much-maligned EU procurement directives. They are being renegotiated and the expectation is that there will be a less stringent approach. However, it is worth bearing in mind that had it not been for the EU procurement directives, it is doubtful whether Virgin could have appealed successfully to have the West Coast contract award set aside. Many procurement officers in local government will be grateful to the directives to have given them the clout to introduce greater rigour in tendering and procurement. Despite some pretty robust approaches to procurement in many of the organisations represented on my overseas conferences and workshops, introducing a set of procedures along the lines of the EU procurement directives would be of much benefit to many public sector ones. Let&apos;s hope the renegotiations don&apos;t throw out the baby with the bathwater. My assessment is that the EU procurement directives will gradually become the standard for public sector organisations worldwide.

Their inspiration was Singapore, with its ambitious building projects, skyscrapers, bridges and ringroads. Dar is already one of Africa&apos;s boomtowns \u2013 it is the second-fastest-growing city in Africa after Lagos, forecast to double in size to more than 7 million people by 2025. And it contributes around 40% of Tanzania&apos;s GDP, which is growing by more than 7% each year. Yet while Dar es Salaam might aspire to be the next Singapore, the differences between the two cities are starkly apparent when it comes to the number of people who die on their roads. At least 480 people were killed on the streets of Tanzania&apos;s commercial capital last year. In Singapore, 195 lost their lives, even though Singapore has a population of about 5 million, compared with Dar&apos;s 3.5 million. Unless something changes, the number of deaths and injuries on Dar es Salaam&apos;s roads will increase as the city grows. Dar&apos;s city centre is a riot of cranes and construction sites. Road-building projects are under way all around the city \u2013 to the north, south and west \u2013 and a bridge will soon link the existing urban area to the massively underdeveloped Kigamboni to the east. But for those planning, designing and constructing the roads, it seems that vehicles are their top priority, rather than people. Perhaps it is because these people are part of the small but growing middle class who can afford cars \u2013 they are thinking about ease of access for a minority, but not of the vast majority of people who will never have a means of transport other than to walk, cycle or use the overcrowded, dirty and dangerous public transport system. Narrow dirt roads, which wind through sprawling unplanned residential areas, are being paved \u2013 the tarmac squeezing out pedestrians and leaving no room for footpaths. People have little choice other than to walk on the roads, with cars flying past on one side, and deep, dangerous storm drains on the other. These new roads are deathtraps, especially after dark when the congestion has eased, the traffic police have gone home and the drink-drivers treat the streets as their own. Elsewhere in the city, roads are being widened with no traffic management systems, parked cars block footpaths, traffic lights function intermittently due to frequent power cuts, and an increasing number of motorcycle taxis are being driven by unlicensed, untrained young men. People in Dar want safe roads. The dirt road outside my house was upgraded last week, transforming it from potholes and craters, where cars could barely go faster than 5mph, to a smooth, compacted surface used as a rat-run by speeding taxis, 4x4s and cheap Chinese motorbikes. Within a day, the local community had dug up parts of the road to create informal speed bumps, and had scattered rocks and disused tyres to slow the movement of traffic in an attempt to keep themselves and their children safe. I have seen riots at schools after a pupil has been killed or injured. It is becoming increasingly common for children to lie down in the roads, forcing traffic to stop until the police and local MP arrive, promising speed bumps. But doing this after the event is too late. The government and donor partners have many admirable plans to improve road safety. A national road safety strategy (pdf) and a road safety and traffic bill have been drafted. A national road safety agency is being established. But while these initiatives are being discussed in the conference rooms of five-star hotels, out on the roads people continue to die every day. Change is needed, and fast; it need not be grand or expensive. Children need to get to school safely, and through our work on road safety in the city we have found that even small steps, such as projects to develop low-cost road safety infrastructure around schools and distribute reflector-enhanced school bags, make a difference. The growth of Dar es Salaam is inevitable, but why lives should be put at risk in the name of development? The planning and development of the city needs to consider everyone \u2013 not only the small proportion of people who own cars. Road infrastructure needs to provide for all types of user, including the majority: pedestrians and cyclists, children and elderly people. Let&apos;s not throw away lives and threaten the safety, health and quality of life of millions of ordinary people in our race towards skyscrapers and ringroads. Let&apos;s build cities for people.  \u2022 Tom Bishop is Africa director for Amend"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/20/kim-jong-un-cult-icon", "sentences": ["This, then, may be the truth behind Kim Jong-un&apos;s new image in the west: emboldened by the success of authoritarian capitalism in places like China and Singapore, dictatorships have started to go looking for development, dialogue and investment, without having to bring democracy along for the ride."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-20T16:35:23Z", "title": "Kim Jong-un as cult icon?

Together they hinted at the strengthening of a new elite infrastructure and projected a sense of economic optimism more outward-looking and business-focused than ever. This, then, may be the truth behind Kim Jong-un&apos;s new image in the west: emboldened by the success of authoritarian capitalism in places like China and Singapore, dictatorships have started to go looking for development, dialogue and investment, without having to bring democracy along for the ride. All this engagement is new to them, so the deployment is clumsy, which provides us with the sources of our ultimately ineffectual lampooning. But just as corruption stable-mate Burma is opening up to foreign dollars while keeping a military grip on all the key assets, so too is North Korea &quot;opening up&quot; while finding ways to keep the good times rolling for those at the top of the pile. Laughing at the absurdities of North Korea is a decades-old pastime. But now our socio-economic uncertainty now adds a nervousness to our smirk: horse-riding Kim Jong-un may not be a hero in real terms, but he&apos;s a useful proxy for understanding the peculiar rise of what&apos;s been euphemistically referred to as &quot;capitalism with Asian values&quot;, and the west&apos;s own secret displeasure for not being cut in on the deal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/dec/24/women-burma-human-trafficking", "sentences": ["According to the Burmese government&apos;s most recent plan of action, around 80% of Burma&apos;s trafficking victims end up in China, with the rest primarily going to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-24T07:00:08Z", "title": "Duped women fight back as Burma gets to grips with human trafficking | Kate Hodal", "tags": ["Global development", "Employment", "Human trafficking", "Law", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Myanmar"], "article": "The tiny drinks stall Chit Htet had been running for the past few years in Rangoon was doing so poorly that when the 35-year-old&apos;s sister-in-law promised her a job in Burma&apos;s southern province, Chit Htet didn&apos;t think twice. But she had been duped. After taking food and drink offered to her by the sister-in-law, Chit Htet fell asleep \u2013 and woke up to discover she had been smuggled into Thailand, where, her sister-in-law said, she would now be working to &quot;pay off her job-placement debts&quot; in a pineapple factory. &quot;I was given 300 baht [\u00a36] every 15 days as salary but had to pay for my own water, electricity and rent, which meant that I could only afford to eat one egg a day \u2013 half at breakfast and half at dinner,&quot; says Chit Htet. Working in the factory with thousands of others \u2013 at least 1,000 of whom she estimated to be Burmese nationals like herself, and many of whom she says had been trafficked by her own sister-in-law \u2013 Chit Htet plotted her escape. Guards patrolled the compound and workers were only allowed out in escorted minivans to the local market. But one day she found a Thai colleague&apos;s mobile lying around and made the call to police that freed her. Burma has been fighting trafficking within its borders for the past eight years \u2013 it signed the 2004 UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and in 2007 established its own anti-trafficking taskforce \u2013 with more than 1,700 victims rescued to date. But rights groups say it still lacks the teeth to prosecute and prevent cases from reoccurring \u2013 meaning that repeat offenders like Chit Htet&apos;s sister-in-law often walk free. However in a landmark agreement between the Burmese government and the Australian anti-trafficking NGO Walk Free in December, the Burmese government committed to working with local businesses to eradicate all trafficking within its private sector. This would mean that in Burma&apos;s nascent economy, businesses would be required to identify, eradicate and prevent forced labour in their operations and supply chains \u2013 preventing situations like Chit Htet&apos;s from occurring on Burmese soil. &quot;This chance to work with Walk Free is a great opportunity to persuade the domestic private sector to work with us on this initiative and, together, I am sure we will end human trafficking in Myanmar,&quot; Police Brigadier General Khin Maung Si told the Guardian. Although slavery is illegal in every country in the world, the International Labour Organisation estimates that nearly 21 million people around the world can be considered modern-day slaves \u2013 defined as those working under threat of violence, abuse and harsh penalties \u2013 in a market generating roughly $32bn (\u00a319.7bn) profit every year. More than half of those people are in Asia, and more than a quarter are women and children. Burmese women are trafficked out of the country every year \u2013 the majority of whom are sold into forced marriages, prostitution or forced labour. According to the Burmese government&apos;s most recent plan of action, around 80% of Burma&apos;s trafficking victims end up in China, with the rest primarily going to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Burma&apos;s female workforce has been migrating for decades now, says Ma Mar of the Burmese charity FATE (Fight Against Trafficking and Exploitation of Women), seeking greater economic opportunities abroad to send money back home. &quot;Before it was just women who were poor,&quot; she says. &quot;Now it&apos;s women who are educated \u2013 lawyers, teachers, graduates \u2013 because their education has no value. They don&apos;t get a decent income to provide for their family but feel they are the ones responsible for providing food and [so they] take the risk of going to places like Saudi Arabia, China, Thailand.&quot; Whether they go abroad or move within Burma, many end up particularly vulnerable to human traffickers because they don&apos;t know how to protect themselves, says Ohnmar Ei Ei Chaw, national project director of the UN&apos;s anti-trafficking unit in Burma. In many cases, this is because victims often fall prey to family members, like Chit Htet, or to neighbours working on behalf of agents. Walk Free aims to change that by making businesses a safer place for employees. Founded by mining tycoon Andrew Forrest, the charity is calling on the world&apos;s largest companies to pledge zero tolerance of slavery. As one of the partners of MTV Exit (End Exploitation and Trafficking), the NGO organised a concert in Rangoon on 16 December in partnership with USAid, Ausaid, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Burmese government to raise awareness about human trafficking. Videos reenacting trafficking situations were played on large-screen TVs, and speakers, including the US ambassador to Burma Derek Mitchell, asked the crowd to &quot;promise never to trust anyone who promises you an offer that sounds too good to be true&quot;. &quot;Business has always been a key driver of social change, shaping modern life through innovation and new technology,&quot; Walk Free says. &quot;If corporate giants \u2013 25 of the world&apos;s top businesses whose net worth makes up $5 trillion \u2013 prioritise the abolition of modern slavery as their next major innovation, we could quickly deal a major blow to the slavery industry in this generation.&quot; Those targeted by the group include Google, Apple, Microsoft, HSBC and Coca-Cola. While Walk Free and the Burmese government are still in the initial phases of the agreement, the NGO is calling on the experiences of victims like Chit Htet to help raise awareness about trafficking \u2013 by identifying where to place posters, billboards and hotlines in trafficking hotspots in Burma and surrounding countries. &quot;We [survivors] should be going to communities where there is trafficking and talking about our experiences,&quot; Chit Htet and a group of other survivors recently told Forrest. &quot;So we can show them we are not different \u2013 we are just like them.&quot; Some details have been changed to protect identity"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/dec/24/travel-news-art-milan-hotels-flights", "sentences": ["Macalister Mansion (Singapore +1 800 3746 8357, designhotels.com/macalister_mansion) comprises eight rooms in a revamped century-old mansion, and has an amazing white restaurant, pictured, with a pastel-coloured woodland scene of sculptures, from \u00a3160 a night including breakfast."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-24T08:00:02Z", "title": "Travel news roundup: interactive art in Milan, stylish new hotels, and long-haul flights", "tags": ["Day trips", "Hotels", "Travel", "Flights", "Christmas and New Year holidays", "Family holidays"], "article": "Escapism Visitors to On Space Time Foam look like spiders in a giant web as they stagger about on sheets of transparent PVC stretched 24 metres above the floor of a massive former industrial unit, Hangar Bicocca in Milan.

J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, 60, who is leading efforts by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to cut the French deficit and streamline the budget, has repeatedly denied reports by the investigative website Mediapart that he held an undisclosed account at the Swiss bank UBS for 20 years until 2010. He is suing the website for defamation. &quot;I don&apos;t have, I never have had, accounts abroad,&quot; Cahuzac told the French parliament before the end of its December session when the story first ran. He dismissed Mediapart&apos;s assertion that he had travelled to Switzerland to close the Geneva-based account and transfer money to Singapore just before he was made head of the parliamentary finance commission in February 2010. Cahuzac, a former MP and surgeon specialising in plastic surgery and hair transplants, has become one of the government&apos;s big-hitters as Paris struggles to redress its crisis-hit economy. After the Mediapart allegations, he received the backing of the prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, who said he had &quot;full confidence&quot; in him. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e has also stood by him. But over the Christmas period the Cahuzac story has continued to dominate headlines as some newspapers suggested Hollande might have a cabinet reshuffle both to detract from the Mediapart allegations and to draw a line under government disagreements over the handling of France&apos;s crisis-hit steel industry. Several political analysts have since dismissed the idea of a reshuffle a mere seven months after Hollande took office. The Socialist MP Olivier Faure told France 2 TV there was no concrete proof of the existence of a Swiss account of Cahuzac and that for now the &quot;empty&quot; allegations against the minister were &quot;not very credible&quot;. He said if any irrefutable proof were ever produced then Cahuzac would be in difficulty and &quot;would have to quit government&quot;, but for the moment nothing suggested the claims were true. In 2010 Mediapart, which is run by veteran French newspaper and agency journalists, broke the story of an alleged party funding scandal around Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s UMP party and the L&apos;Or\u00e9al heiress Liliane Bettencourt. The website stood by its Cahuzac story, which it said was a question of &quot;public morality&quot; and the &quot;exemplarity of a minister&quot;. It has called for an inquiry led by an independent judge. The allegation against Cahuzac comes at a particularly sensitive time, as the government has increased income tax on the richest and criticised wealthy individuals, such as the actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu, who have sought to shift their tax base abroad. Mediapart published a recording in which Cahuzac is alleged to be talking to his wealth manager about his embarrassment over the Swiss bank account in 2000. In the recording, a voice said to be Cahuzac&apos;s says: &quot;What bothers me is that I still have an account open with UBS \u2026 UBS is not necessarily the most hidden of banks.&quot; The conversation was said to have been taped inadvertently by Michel Gonelle, a barrister and one-time political opponent of Cahuzac in his south-western constituency. Gonelle has since called the \u00c9lys\u00e9e to say the recording is authentic. Mediapart said Cahuzac had not issued legal proceedings over the recording, but the budget minister had told French radio journalists that it was not his voice. Cahuzac remains in his government post and there is no sign of him moving. The finance ministry denied another recent Mediapart report that its tax inspectors were investigating Cahuzac&apos;s French assets. In a statement, the ministry said the public finances directorate was examining the tax situation of all government members as a matter of &quot;routine&quot;, with the aim of &quot;ensuring that the position of every government member is irreproachable&quot;. The finance ministry added: &quot;No inspection or investigation is in progress with regard to any government member.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/28/isolation-europe-not-splendid-uk-eu", "sentences": ["It also holds for a vast swath of the world from the Gulf to New Delhi, from Cairo to Singapore, for which European influence is historically identical with the British presence."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-28T08:00:00Z", "title": "Isolation from Europe wouldn't be splendid for the UK | Alain Minc", "tags": ["European Union", "Europe", "UK news", "France", "Germany", "Politics", "World news"], "article": "For a passionate Anglophile like me, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU is a disaster. A disaster for Europe, but also for Britain itself. In a world in which our continent is being slowly marginalised, a union without Britain would be paralysed down one side. This certainly holds for the Americans, because even though the &quot;special relationship&quot; may no longer exist, London isn&apos;t a European capital like any other. It also holds for a vast swath of the world from the Gulf to New Delhi, from Cairo to Singapore, for which European influence is historically identical with the British presence. And it holds for the Chinese, who are counting &quot;economic divisions&quot; the way Stalin once counted military ones, and for whom a Europe amputated in this way is seriously weakened. But it&apos;s not just about Britain&apos;s global strategic presence. The EU needs the UK as a tireless advocate of the free market, and of competition with member states \u2013 France first and foremost \u2013 that have less of a market culture while remaining subject to protectionist and mercantilist temptations. And last, in a world where the values of freedom and democracy are the order of the day, for Europe even more than for the US, the absence of &quot;the land of habeas corpus&quot; would be an unfortunate symbol. However, even without the UK, Europe will keep on going. Without Europe, on the other hand, the UK will be at a dead end. Since joining the EU Britain has pursued a very skilful policy towards Brussels: it has benefited from the single market, reduced its budgetary contribution without having convincingly explained why, and perfected the art of the opt-out. In terms of European policy, these are the equivalent of &quot;warrants&quot; on the financial markets \u2013 the chance of profiting from an opportunity without paying the full price. Why would the leaders of Britain, so famed for its tradition of common sense and empiricism, abandon a strategy that suits them so well in favour of a more ideology-based approach. How can they imagine that a UK, liberal and open to globalisation, would be to Europe what Hong Kong is to China? Continental Europeans aren&apos;t altar boys. Can anybody really imagine they&apos;re going to let the most profitable activities stay solely within London, and allow the City to remain the financial capital of the euro without Britain sharing the rights and duties of the EU? Today, ambiguity is the mainstay of the City: the continentals might well put up with the capital of the euro being outside the eurozone but still in the EU. They won&apos;t \u2013 politically, economically or financially \u2013 accept it being outside the EU. There&apos;s no point even trying to imagine the UK being treated like Norway or Switzerland, keeping all the advantages of the single market. You grant advantages to countries you hope will one day join the gang, not to a country that&apos;s just slammed the door in your face. Let the British be under no illusions. It&apos;s not the French who will be most aggressive about this, but the Germans. The French will still be attached to the idea of maintaining a little counterbalance with regard to Berlin; the Germans will continue to follow their well-trodden path of reason and power, albeit somewhat tempered. Without the UK \u2013 a traditional brake on the strengthening of European institutions \u2013 the onward march will resume more easily, and the eurozone, soon to be widened to include Poland, will integrate more quickly and become de facto Europe, aside from two or three member states. With a &quot;continental blockade&quot; across the Channel, commercial agreements between London and Brussels won&apos;t be easy to negotiate \u2013 which way will the UK look? Towards the US? But Barack Obama sees the Europeans, the British included, the way we Europeans see the Swiss: slightly weary rich friends who don&apos;t create any problems for you but don&apos;t bring you any solutions either. What&apos;s the point of a UK back in splendid isolation when its preoccupations are Chinese, Asian and Pakistani? And what weight will an isolated country of 65 million people carry in the eyes of the Chinese, or even the Indians? The wager of the British Eurosceptics is based on a double premise: taking advantage of the single market and the euro while remaining outside it; and being a &quot;hub&quot; of a globalised economic space. The first premise relies on the continentals being conciliatory, when in fact they&apos;ll be acrimonious. The second confuses London and the UK. Even if London maintains the extraordinary status it has invented for itself, which makes it the capital of the non-American world today, that&apos;s not going to be enough to ensure a decent standard of living in the Midlands, Wales or Scotland. What can we call a fatal error in history? An irreversible decision based on a mistaken diagnosis with incalculable consequences. To leave would be one. \u2022 Translated by Shaun Whiteside"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/28/india-name-shame-sex-offenders", "sentences": ["The victim of the hour-long attack, who suffered serious internal injuries, has now been moved to a specialist hospital in Singapore where her condition remains critical."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-28T09:44:01Z", "title": "India to name and shame sex offenders as rape protests grow", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Rape and sexual assault"], "article": "The Indian government is to publish the names, photographs and addresses of thousands of convicted sex offenders in a bid to tackle a wave of sexual violence against women, and head off growing anger at what has been seen as an inadequate and tardy response by older political leaders out of touch with a rapidly changing society. The controversial measure, announced by the minister of state for home affairs, RPN Singh, is to start in Delhi, where angry protests continue over the gang rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student 10 days ago. The victim of the hour-long attack, who suffered serious internal injuries, has now been moved to a specialist hospital in Singapore where her condition remains critical. Police chiefs and officials are to meet activists and experts on Friday to discuss implementation of the scheme. &quot;We are planning to start the process [of identification] in Delhi. Photographs, names and addresses of the rapists will be uploaded on the Delhi police website also,&quot; Singh told reporters. There are fears that identifying convicted rapists will lead to vigilante attacks. Others point out that, with a national average conviction rate of 25% for rape cases, and with many charges taking several years to reach court and enormous numbers of incidents going unreported, the measure can only have a limited effect. Women&apos;s rights campaigners have, however, backed the idea. &quot;It is true that there is a risk of such attacks but at the moment it is the victim who has to suffer the shame and social ostracism,&quot; said Ranjana Kumari, director of Delhi&apos;s Centre for Social Research. &quot;She can&apos;t get married, for example. This will make sure the rapist is shamed. He won&apos;t get a job, or somewhere to live and will be cut off from society. This is a powerful deterrent,&quot; Kumari, who is also a member of the national commission for empowerment of women, told the Guardian. Authorities, already under fire for their failure to prevent the original attack, which took place on a Sunday evening in a bus travelling on busy public roads, are now under pressure over their mishandling of the protests around India. Images of riot police beating back demonstrators carrying placards with slogans against violence who have attempted to reach parliament, the president&apos;s official residence and the official homes of top officials in the centre of the capital, have reinforced the impression of an uncaring, out-of-touch government. Earlier this week, Abhijit Mukherjee, the president&apos;s son and an MP with the ruling Congress party, was forced to apologise after calling protesters &quot;painted women&quot; who &quot;have little connection with ground reality&quot; and &quot;have nothing better to do&quot;. The incident has revealed deep fissures within Indian society. Described as &quot;eve teasing&quot;, sexual harassment is endemic and rape systematically blamed on irresponsible women behaving in &quot;un-Indian&quot; ways. Police routinely ignore complaints of sexual violence; senior officers have even suggested women should fight back by hurling chilli powder at rapists. Bollywood films typically feature an initially distant girl who finally gives in to her determined, and often physically aggressive, suitor. &quot;India is currently in a twilight zone, when the traditional social norms have lost their resonance while modern values based on individual liberty have not yet gained acceptance,&quot; said the financial newspaper Mint, in an editorial. The six men responsible for the incident in Delhi included a driver of an unlicensed private bus, a vegetable seller and a gym assistant. Most had grown up in deeply conservative parts of rural India before moving to the capital. One consequence of the media&apos;s recent focus on sexual violence against women has been coverage of incidents that normally would be either relegated to local editions of newspapers or not covered at all. A second alleged gang rape, this time of a 42-year-old woman, in a moving vehicle in Delhi made headlines. All major TV channels on Thursday reported the suicide of an 18-year-old woman near Patiala, a town in the north-western Punjab province two weeks after a serious sexual assault. When she told police she had been raped by three men from her village, their response was to jeer, relatives said. Officials have admitted a case was only registered \u2013 the first step in a criminal investigation in India \u2013 after her suicide last month. In Bhopal, a 21-year-old has told police she was raped in the office of a senior politician six weeks ago. Among the demands of protesters are more severe punishments for rapists, including the death penalty. However laws protecting women are already on Indian statute books, the problem is haphazard implementation. Kumari, one of those who suggested the public sex offenders&apos; register, said she was pleased with the government&apos;s move but disappointed that finances devoted to women&apos;s schemes had been cut at a meeting earlier this week. &quot;How are they going to make all these ideas to protect women work if they are not going to fund them?

Her family and officials from the High Commission of India were by her side,&quot; Kelvin Loh, chief executive of the Mount Elizabeth hospital, said in a statement. &quot;Despite all efforts by a team of eight specialists to keep her stable, her condition continued to deteriorate over these two days. She had suffered from severe organ failure following serious injuries to her body and brain. &quot;She was courageous in fighting for her life for so long against the odds but the trauma to her body was too severe for her to overcome.&quot; Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh said he was deeply saddened by the death and pledged to channel emotions surrounding the case into concrete action, saying: &quot;It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channel these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action.&quot; The woman and a male friend, who have not been identified, were travelling in a public bus after watching a film when they were attacked by six men who took turns to rape her. The brutality of the assault provoked widespread anger and demonstrations across India, focused largely on the police, politicians and senior officials, by protesters demanding better policing and harsher punishment for rapists. Indian police have arrested six people in connection with the attack. Women&apos;s rights campaigners claim many rapes and other sexual crimes in India go unreported with offenders rarely punished, and have called on the government to offer better protection for women. The Indian government announced on Friday it is to publish the names, photographs and addresses of thousands of convicted sex offenders in an attempt to head off growing anger at what has been seen as a inadequate response by leaders to the problem of sexual violence. The controversial measure, announced by the minister of state for home affairs, RPN Singh, is to start in Delhi, which has been the focus of the protests following the attack. Concerns have been raised that identifying convicted rapists will lead to vigilante attacks, but many women&apos;s rights campaigners have backed the move. &quot;It is true that there is a risk of such attacks but at the moment it is the victim who has to suffer the shame and social ostracism,&quot; said Ranjana Kumari, director of Delhi&apos;s Centre for Social Research. &quot;She can&apos;t get married, for example. &quot;This will make sure the rapist is shamed. He won&apos;t get a job, or somewhere to live and will be cut off from society. This is a powerful deterrent.&quot; However, there are now fears the woman&apos;s death could trigger new protests and confrontations with the police, especially in the Indian capital. Delhi has been on edge since the clashes last weekend. Hundreds of policemen have been deployed in the capital, and streets leading to the main protest site, the India Gate war memorial, have been shut for long periods, causing commuter chaos in the city of 16 million people."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/29/india-gang-rape-six-men-charged-murder", "sentences": ["Indian police have charged six men with murder, hours after a woman who was gang-raped and thrown from a moving bus in Delhi nearly two weeks ago died in a Singapore hospital.", "She died late on Friday in the Singapore hospital where she was being treated.", "She was flown to Singapore from India two days ago as her condition worsened."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-29T15:23:00Z", "title": "India gang rape: six men charged with murder", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Rape and sexual assault", "Law", "Society"], "article": "Indian police have charged six men with murder, hours after a woman who was gang-raped and thrown from a moving bus in Delhi nearly two weeks ago died in a Singapore hospital. Police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said the men could face the death penalty if convicted. Officials said that authorities would press for the harshest possible punishment. The announcement came as thousands of Indians gathered to mourn and protest the death of the 23-year-old medical student. The woman, who has not been named, sustained serious internal injuries after being violated with an iron bar during the attack, which took place on 16 December and triggered mass demonstrations calling for better protection for women against sexual violence. She died late on Friday in the Singapore hospital where she was being treated. Her family had been keeping a bedside vigil after she suffered severe organ failure. She was flown to Singapore from India two days ago as her condition worsened. Authorities in India reacted with statements of grief, calls for calm and a huge security operation. Large numbers of police were deployed in Delhi to prevent demonstrators reaching parliament, the president&apos;s residence and the India Gate war memorial. The official residences of ministers, top officials and Sonia Gandhi, the president of the ruling Congress party, were also heavily guarded and metro stations were shut. President Pranab Mukherjee said the victim was &quot;a true hero and symbolises the best in Indian youth and women&quot;. He called on &quot;everyone to maintain peace&quot;. Gandhi made a rare televised address saying she spoke as &quot;a mother and a woman&quot;. &quot;To all of you who have expressed your anger publicly, I want to assure you that your voice has been heard. Today all Indians feel they have lost their own beloved daughter, their cherished sister, a young woman of 23 whose life was full of hope, dreams and promise,&quot; she said. Demonstrations were under way in most major cities of India, where the media have dubbed the woman &quot;braveheart&quot; after her lengthy battle to survive. &quot;I just want to be here to say how much she meant to all of us and how much we want nothing of this to ever happen again to any lady. Attitudes in this country must change now. There should be security,&quot; said Beena Subramaniam, a 24-year-old student who had travelled to Delhi&apos;s Janta Mantar observatory, where protests were being permitted. Crowds in Delhi remained relatively small, with large numbers of men and vociferous calls for the execution of the rapists. Demonstrations were also being held in the commercial capital of Mumbai and in Bangalore, the southern city known for its information technology business. Smaller commemorations were being held elsewhere, including in the victim&apos;s home village in the north of the country. The huge deployment of security forces in Delhi reinforced the impression of many that the government was out of touch with public emotion. &quot;They are not joining with us, they are keeping us away,&quot; said Neeraj Kumar, 28, a businessman on his way to the demonstration. Protests last weekend turned violent with police using water cannons, teargas and baton charges to disperse demonstrators close to parliament. The government has set up a commission to recommend new measures to combat sexual violence against women. One is likely to be the publication on the internet of a registry of sex offenders. Others include fast-track courts and a higher proportion of female police officers. &quot;We have already seen the emotions and energies this incident has generated. These are perfectly understandable reactions from a young India and an India that genuinely desires change,&quot; the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said. Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi, said she felt ashamed &quot;not just as [chief minister], but as a citizen of India&quot;. She was booed when she tried to visit one of the protests in Delhi. The case has provoked an unprecedented debate on sexual violence towards women in India. Sexual harassment \u2013 known as &quot;Eve-teasing&quot; \u2013 is endemic and often accepted. A series of rapes in rural areas in the state of Haryana, adjacent to Delhi, earlier this year provoked suggestions from politicians and community leaders that much sexual violence was consensual and that the age of marriage should be lowered. Women who report rapes are repeatedly ignored or harassed by the police themselves. The belief that women are responsible for sexual assault is widespread. In the wake of the most recent incident, dozens of other rapes, often by multiple assailants, have been reported by media across India. Many feature minors. &quot;These are not isolated incidents. The outrage now should lead to reforms in both system and attitude, so that victims are not blamed, humiliated or suffering silently,&quot; said Meenakshi Ganguly, the regional director of Human Rights Watch. In one incident reported this week, the family of a 17-year-old in the north-western state of Punjab said police humiliated her when she attempted to report a gang rape. She later took her own life. Two officers have now been sacked and one suspended. The victim in the Delhi case is from a modest family who sold their ancestral land to fund her medical training. She was returning from watching a film at 9pm when she and her 28-year-old male friend accepted a lift in the bus. Public transport in Delhi is grossly inadequate and though the wealthy can afford cars, usually chauffeur-driven, few others can. She was assaulted for more than an hour as the bus drove on crowded public roads, and was then dumped with her friend, severely injured, by the road near the international airport. A crowd gathered but help was only called after 40 minutes. Police had to borrow sheets from a nearby hotel to cover the injured pair before rushing them to hospital. &quot;Rape and sexual assault are the fasting growing crimes in India. Women&apos;s organisations have been raising this issue for so long and no one has acted,&quot; Brinda Karat, a veteran member of parliament, told NDTV. Karat said the right response was not &quot;patriarchal, patronising assurances that we will make you safe by [having you] stay in your own homes&quot;, but a concerted campaign to &quot;ensure that women have equal rights in every public space, the workspace, cinemas, malls, the metro, buses, the street \u2013 everywhere&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/dec/30/diller-scofidio-renfro-high-line", "sentences": ["There are wannabe High Lines mooted for Calabria, Singapore, Jerusalem and Shenzhen, and in any number of American cities."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-30T00:05:00Z", "title": "Liz Diller: 'We thought we would have been fired a long time ago'", "tags": ["Architecture", "New York", "Design", "US news", "World news", "Art and design", "Culture", "Cities"], "article": "The High Line, the mile-long park created on an old elevated railway in Manhattan, is one of those once-in-a-decade projects that, like the 1990s Guggenheim in Bilbao, both captures the imagination of the world and offers limitless inspiration to plagiarists. There are wannabe High Lines mooted for Calabria, Singapore, Jerusalem and Shenzhen, and in any number of American cities. Any developer in possession of a meagre strip of green is apt to declare it a High Line. People changing planes at JFK airport have been known to nip over in taxis to get a glimpse before nipping back in time for their next flight, which somewhat negates the concept of a leisurely stroll in the park. One of the few people not completely mesmerised by it and ready to move on from it \u2013 who, indeed, believes it is not replicable \u2013 is one of its principal creators, Elizabeth Diller. Her practice, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, together with landscape architect James Corner and garden designer Piet Oudolf, designed the High Line. &quot;On the joyous side,&quot; she says, &quot;I am still totally amazed by how many New Yorkers are really thankful and love to go; the part that gives thought is that it&apos;s almost too popular for its own good. It could easily consume itself.&quot; She has other things on her mind, such as the ongoing, 10-year, billion-dollar project to make over New York&apos;s Lincoln Centre, about which a large book has just been published in America. A 1960s cultural complex, the Lincoln Centre is, like the South Bank and Barbican centres in London, based on the theory that it&apos;s a good idea to group several venues in one place, and had similar problems of awkward circulation and hard-to-use public spaces. Here, Diller Scofidio + Renfro&apos;s aim was to &quot;open up the Lincoln Centre in a very democratic way&quot; so that its &quot;buzziness&quot; could be enjoyed even by those not holding expensive tickets for opera or ballet. Techniques include digitised lighting displays, a pavilion roof that is also a large sloping lawn, and a recently completed bridge that takes people across one of the moat-like roads that bound the complex.     The Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Centre, New York, renovated by Diller Scofidio + Renfro. Photograph: Luay Bahoora/Alamy    Diller and her partners are taking on the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC, a hovering, forbidding, concrete doughnut whose form and material could not be more hostile to alteration or addition. They&apos;re going to inflate a giant balloon that will bulge upwards from the hole at its centre and squirm out underneath it. They are also working on an opera \u2013 not just designing its setting but also conceiving it, commissioning a writer and composer and putting it on. These projects have certain qualities in common. They are all concerned with engaging the public. They like to play with new technology, such as the lighting at the Lincoln Centre, not for its own sake but for its ability to alter perception and experience. They combine conceptual sophistication with simple direct pleasures: the Hirshhorn balloon, the tilted lawn, the moment on the High Line when the deck suddenly drops, to make a mini-theatre for viewing the traffic streaming up Tenth Avenue underneath. The great British architectural thinker Cedric Price was fond of saying that &quot;maybe the answer is not a building&quot;. Other architects recall this line from time to time before deciding that, actually, in the particular case where they&apos;ve been commissioned and paid to design something, the answer is a building after all. Diller Scofidio + Renfro mean it. On the High Line their task was &quot;how not to screw up&quot; the &quot;otherworldly beauty&quot; of the weed-strewn viaduct, and the main contribution was the design of a paving system that would unify the park&apos;s multiple incidents. With the much criticised original buildings of the Lincoln Centre they decided that &quot;they are part of the iconography of New York, so we just accept them&quot;. They&apos;ve left plenty of it alone, including a somewhat pompous fountain that nonetheless attracted and soothed the crowds. They like to use mobile and elusive substances as much as the hard, fixed matter of building: electricity, light, air pressure in the case of the Hirshhorn, and with their memorable 2002 Blur Building \u2013 a structure that created a walk-through artificial cloud above Lake Neuchatel in Switzerland \u2013 water vapour. Their works are more like events than objects.     The artificial cloud of the Blur Building at Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland. Photograph: Paul Raftery/Rex Features    They like performance, hence buildings that move and change, and hence the opera. They have a freedom that comes from a willingness, earlier in their career, not to build anything at all. &quot;When I was studying architecture in the 1970s it was intellectually bankrupt,&quot; says Diller, whom I catch while she&apos;s in London to give a talk for the Architecture Foundation. So it was a mark of honour for her and her partner and husband, Ricardo Scofidio, not to go along with the &quot;conventional client-architect relationship&quot;. &quot;We didn&apos;t want things handed down to us,&quot; she says. They made their name with installations, exhibitions and performances, in galleries and in found spaces, in which tables and chairs might hang from the ceiling, or a room might be filled with 50 open suitcases, one for each state of America, displaying postcards and other mementoes. Their themes included the problematic nature of the domestic, the definition of gender and, in the suitcase exhibit, tourism. These works looked like art but, says Diller, they were &quot;always about space-making; we always thought it was the activity of an architect&quot;. Even if, as she also says, &quot;the early audiences were esoteric and academic&quot;. But then came an astonishingly rapid shift, from ephemeral pieces well thought of by the cognoscenti to the popular hit of the Blur Building, to projects in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars, such as the High Line and the Lincoln Centre. &quot;We thought it was a case of mistaken identity,&quot; she says of her appointment to the latter. &quot;We thought that for sure we&apos;d have been fired a long time ago.&quot; But they weren&apos;t, and although Diller is now 58 and Scofidio is 77, it feels as if their practice is still in the process of taking off. Their success has brought criticisms; the former architecture critic of the New York Times discerned clumsiness when it came to the craft of actually designing buildings, and the High Line has been accused of being a gentrifying force. They have the problems common to intellectuals who go mainstream, of looking less rigorous, more easy-listening, although they still seem pretty smart to me. For Diller it&apos;s a case of &quot;broadening the audiences&quot; and also finding something to enjoy in the extraordinarily complex networks of people and organisations that goes with a project such as the Lincoln Centre. She seems to have made the business of negotiating, navigating and collaborating with such networks an art project in itself."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/30/india-gang-rape-un-call-action", "sentences": ["The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and Sonia Gandhi, the president of the ruling Congress party, met the plane carrying her body from Singapore, where doctors had tried to save her life after 10 days of treatment in India."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-30T15:35:35Z", "title": "India gang-rape victim cremated as UN chief calls for action to protect women", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Rape and sexual assault", "Law", "Society"], "article": "The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has urged the Indian government to take action to protect women after a 23-year-old student died of injuries sustained during a gang rape in Delhi. &quot;Every girl and woman has the right to be respected, valued and protected,&quot; Ban said in a statement in which he welcomed efforts by the government but called for &quot;further steps and reforms to deter such crimes and bring perpetrators to justice&quot;. The intervention of the UN takes the fallout from the incident two weeks ago to a new level and underlines the damage it has done to India&apos;s international image, already battered by corruption scandals, a huge power failure earlier this year, and slowing economic growth. The body of the still unnamed victim was cremated according to Hindu rites in Delhi shortly after dawn on Sunday. More details have emerged about her: the eldest of three children, she was reportedly a bright and funny, independent woman from a humble background who impressed her tutors at medical college and taught schoolchildren in the family home, a one-bedroom flat, to help with finances. Her father is reported to be a loader at Delhi&apos;s airport. Friends quoted by local media said she had been planning to marry the 28-year-old male friend she was with when the attack took place. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and Sonia Gandhi, the president of the ruling Congress party, met the plane carrying her body from Singapore, where doctors had tried to save her life after 10 days of treatment in India. Singh and Gandhi, with other senior Indian politicians, have been heavily criticised for their slow and high-handed response to the incident, which has generated outrage, grief and anger across the country. &quot;It&apos;s been a huge challenge to all of them. They have seen the whole affair as basically a law and order problem. There has been no conversation,&quot; said Swapan Dasgupta, a Delhi-based analyst. &quot;But that style of top-down politics is not going to work any more, particularly with young, aspirational urban people.&quot; Figures published on Sunday revealed that despite 635 reported cases of rape and 745 arrests in Delhi this year, there had been only one conviction. A total of 572 rapes were reported to Delhi police in 2011, up from 507 in 2010, 469 in 2009 and 466 in 2008. The government has said it will bring in fast-track courts to accelerate the legal process. The funeral was conducted in secrecy and under heavy police guard, with the media abiding by a collective decision to stay away. Demonstrations calling for reforms and the execution of the six men detained for the attack continued in Delhi and other major cities, as they have done every day for nearly two weeks. Despite a major security operation that kept mourners and protesters away from the centre of the capital, there were some clashes on Sunday afternoon. Local newspapers said more than 18,000 police had been deployed, nearly a quarter of the Delhi force&apos;s total strength. India has been plunged into an extraordinary bout of self-analysis following the woman&apos;s death. The media have provided blanket coverage of the attack, which took place on a moving bus in south Delhi on 16 December. All of Sunday&apos;s front pages and news bulletins were devoted to the incident and its aftermath. High profile new year parties in the capital and elsewhere have been cancelled. Bollywood stars have expressed their shame and anger. One of the biggest, Shahrukh Khan, posted on Twitter: &quot;Rape embodies sexuality as our culture and society has defined it. I am so sorry that I am a part of this society and culture.&quot; Bollywood itself has been under fire. One columnist spoke of how plots of often classic films &quot;sanctify pestering and stalking of women&quot;. The new interest in sexual crimes has led to reports that would have struggled to make it on air or into newspapers in the normal frenzied Indian news cycle, where often sensationalist TV channels compete ruthlessly. One major newspaper ran a list of sexual crimes against women that have taken place during the ongoing battle between security forces and Maoist guerillas in the centre of the country. Headlined &quot;Women suffer big in India&apos;s state vs rebels war&quot;, it held both sides responsible. Over the past 24 hours, other reported incidents have included women attempting to take their own lives after being gang raped, the attempted murder of a rape victim in Rajasthan and an infant dying after a rape in Gujarat. In West Bengal, a woman was reportedly raped by three hospital workers after seeking treatment for her baby. A woman was also allegedly assaulted on a bus in Delhi. One man was arrested. India&apos;s courts have a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases, which would take decades to clear if all were heard. Facilities for forensic analysis are few and poorly equipped. Healthcare in many of the rural areas where assaults are endemic is often rudimentary. The UN has offered to help India &quot;strengthen critical services for rape victims&quot; with &quot;technical expertise and other support as required,&quot; Ban said. The problem is, however, enormously complex. For example, women in rural India are rendered more vulnerable because a lack of sanitation facilities forces them to defecate in woods or fields after dark. Dasgupta said the affair had laid bare the gulf between India&apos;s political elite and younger voters. &quot;There&apos;s a big demographic factor that we are beginning to see. How parties react to it will determine their political future,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/dec/31/janice-charette-diversity-canada-civil-service", "sentences": ["As part of the Guardian&apos;s global public leaders series, and in response to a speech in November by Peter Ong, head of the Singapore civil service, about his country&apos;s civil service, Charette said diversity was a very big part of how her country thinks about recruitment and talent development for its public services."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-31T08:00:01Z", "title": "Janice Charette: diversity is integral to Canada's civil service", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network"], "article": "Canada&apos;s associate secretary to the cabinet, Janice Charette, has emphasised the importance of having public bodies that are diverse and representational.

Being gang-raped and eviscerated on privatised and poorly regulated mass transport is not how she would have envisaged the end of an evening with a friend at the cinema. As she lay dying, however, she became a rallying point for protests that have erupted across urban India and generated undeniably powerful collective outrage. Thousands of people, including young men, have taken to the streets to demand gender justice and equality from a state that is all too often experienced as indifferent to or even complicit in misogynist violence. While the president&apos;s son, MP Abhijit Mukherjee, did not help matters by describing women protesters as &quot;dented-painted&quot;, a poem circulated by feminist campaigners asks trenchantly: &quot;What clothes \u2013 pulled from what rack / Will prevent an attack?&quot; After all, many of us have been molested on Delhi buses while in saris. Even as residents of Delhi and other cities have come together in an unusual show of collective will to demand a political response, the protests \u2013 gratuitously compared by some to Tahrir Square \u2013 have raised difficult questions which Indian feminists and democratic rights activists will have to engage with in coming weeks. Some note that beyond holding the state and police to account, Indians have to confront deeply entrenched patriarchal views as well as a popular culture which, as in western countries, continues to objectify female sexuality, creating an environment where harassment and violence are regularised as part of the sexual game. Global misogyny invites global feminist solidarity without turning women&apos;s rights into a contest for cultural superiority. Without pandering to the predictable and false accusation that women&apos;s rights are an elite issue, any long-term movement arising from this tragedy will also have to think seriously about how the outrage that was galvanised by a brutal assault on a victim thought of as young and middle-class can also be directed at making more visible, and equally unacceptable, a wider spectrum of sexual violence. It encompasses domestic violence, the rape of poor women, &quot;tribals&quot; and Dalits, and sexual assault deployed by policemen and soldiers in conflicts in the Indian north-east, Kashmir and Chhattisgarh. In 2011, medical examinations indicated that Soni Sori, a schoolteacher accused of abetting Maoists, had had stones inserted into her vagina and rectum while in state custody. The public response to such reports has been largely muted but the current moment may yet foster a more widespread spirit of agitation against sexual violence everywhere. While citizens of diverse affiliations have coalesced around the issue of women&apos;s safety, significant fissures have also emerged. One comes out of the demand, made even before the case turned into one of murder, that the rapists be given the death penalty, which is reserved in India for the rarest of rare cases. Progressive voices have been quick to distance themselves from a lynch mob mentality. But the division itself speaks to the appeal, for much of the Indian middle class, of strong leadership and, more selectively, for speedy justice that could involve riding roughshod over legal safeguards. In this light, the recent electoral triumph in Gujarat of the iconic strongman with prime ministerial aspirations, Narendra Modi, who stands accused of presiding over murderous religious violence that involved the mass rape of Muslim women, is sobering. So is the revelation that several wealthy elected politicians in Gujarat face criminal charges that include rape. The frantic obsession with wealth accumulation in India, often euphemised as &quot;development&quot;, Modi&apos;s selling point, has also widened a dangerous economic gap between the middle and working classes. It is not remotely to justify the recent brutality, in which the accused come from the ranks of the working poor, to suggest that any analysis of &quot;rape culture&quot; should include consideration of the ways in which growing class rage can get tragically displaced on to the bodies of women. Regarded as one the most dangerous places in the world for women, even as rape culture pervades the globe, India is also home to a strong tradition of democratic struggles for women&apos;s rights resulting in both progressive legislation and gradual social change in relation to dowry, criminal law, inheritance, health and workplace rights. Such struggles \u2013 and social justice \u2013 must now prevail."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/31/delhi-rape-india-damini", "sentences": ["I watched the news as &quot;Braveheart&quot;, as the victim is nauseatingly called, was flown to Singapore.", "Damini&apos;s body was brought back from Singapore and cremated at night, surrounded by huge security to avoid more protests."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-31T12:33:10Z", "title": "Delhi gang-rape: in India, anger is overtaking fear | Suzanne Moore", "tags": ["Protest", "India", "Rape and sexual assault", "Gender", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Women", "Life and style"], "article": "When I first went to Delhi some 30 years ago I stayed in some flophouse.

These beautiful people are here to party, to drink strawberry mojitos, to dance. But I can&apos;t stop watching the news. Something is happening here that is more important than the latest trance mix. The outpouring of anger about &quot;Damini&quot;, the young woman who died after being gang-raped on a bus by six men, is something I have never seen before in India. This anger has been a long time coming and the protests and vigils are not just in central Delhi but all over from Kolkata to Panjim. North and south are for once united. Kashmiri rappers are producing music to support the women of Delhi. The statistics are not new but they are as visible as the families, men, women and children at the protests. More than 635 reported rapes in Delhi last year, one conviction. In places like Karnataka it&apos;s worse, but Delhi, remember, prides itself on being modern India. As the Guardian&apos;s correspondent Jason Burke rightly said, what is happening in this peculiarly Indian mix of anger, sentimentality and denial is a clash between the new and the old. The new, modern, techno India, the image this country wants to sell, is tainted by its attitudes to women. I watched the news as &quot;Braveheart&quot;, as the victim is nauseatingly called, was flown to Singapore. Why? Out of sight, out of mind? India has some of the best hospitals in the world. You cannot move in places like Chennai for Europeans coming for hip and knee replacements. Who moves a patient with organ failure, brain injury, infection, who has already had a cardiac arrest? Young men were calling up news stations to offer their own intestines as hers had been removed as the result of the damage done to her with an iron bar. This is the crux of it and not yet a discussion that many are prepared to have here. Rape is not about sex. It is about power. It is about torture. It is about brutality. Yesterday, another girl was assaulted on a bus. Last week a two-year-old girl was raped to death in Gujarat while the victim of another gang rape committed suicide. Her choice was to drop the charges or marry one of her attackers. Arundhati Roy has spoken about how the army uses rape as a weapon in Kashmir and Manipur. As do the police and the upper caste. Surprise has been registered that Damini was not even a dalit. For untouchables rape is everyday; where there are no toilets, women are raped in the woods. Yet what is emerging is that middle-class women are not safe. They do not go out after sunset. One told me India is worse than Saudi Arabia. No one trusts the police. A raped woman may have to undergo &quot;a finger test&quot;, where a doctor determines whether the woman&apos;s vagina is &quot;habituated to sexual intercourse&quot;. Ordinary women here are angry. They carry placards saying &quot;Kill the cruels&quot; or &quot;Torture them to death&quot;, but it is heartening to see young articulate women on TV having a long overdue conversation. The political response has been appalling. Sonia Gandhi&apos;s address to the nation was totally inadequate. Some female politicians blame rape victims for their &quot;adventurous spirit&quot;. The president&apos;s son spoke of women protesters as &quot;highly dented&quot; and &quot;painted&quot;. The statements of the political class have been slammed as inane and meaningless. Damini&apos;s body was brought back from Singapore and cremated at night, surrounded by huge security to avoid more protests. She was not taken to her village as is the custom. Her mother collapsed. Damini is not her name. She remains unidentified. To be raped, after all, is a shameful thing. Damini is a word from Sanskrit. It means lightning. It is also the name of the heroine in a famous Indian movie who refused to let a rapist escape justice, and several big Bollywood stars have expressed their outrage. Nonetheless, Bollywood continues to churn out movies in which women are harassed into submission in the name of romance. What some politicians fear most is that this young, educated population reminds them of the Arab spring and they are demanding change. They fear what they call &quot;the pink revolution&quot;. When people say, as they so often do, that feminism is the preoccupation of a few white middle-class women in the west agonising over whether to wear lipstick or not, I wish they could see these angry men and women out at night demanding that women be safe, who say rape is always a weapon used to keep women in fear. For something is happening here, anger is overtaking fear. The dam has burst. The debate the politicians want is one of law and order, but the radical one is about how to change the culture itself. And because this is India we are taking about a myriad of cultures. Somehow, though, through the shock and the trauma, this country is examining itself and its much-vaunted modernity does not look so modern. The new India can only be birthed through the rights of women to be free, safe and equal. Maybe some always knew that. All I know now is that so many more Indians do. The political talk is of the &quot;supreme sacrifice of that young brave daughter&quot; of India. This woman did not choose to die. She was murdered. It disgusts those who sit at night holding vigils. It disgusts me. It cannot be airlifted out, hushed up, burned to ashes. It is alight. And it will keep burning. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 December 2012. It originally stated that the Bollywood film character Damini fought back against her own rapist \u2013 in fact she took up the case of another woman who had been raped. This has now been corrected."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/31/delhi-slum-home-rape-accused", "sentences": ["Nearly two weeks later, she died of her injuries in the Singapore hospital where she had been sent for treatment."], "publicationDate": "2012-12-31T18:19:08Z", "title": "In the Delhi slum home of gang-rape accused: 'We are good people'", "tags": ["India", "Rape and sexual assault", "Law", "Society", "World news"], "article": "The sun slides away behind the dome of a medieval tomb and, as the shadows fall across the cluttered homes of Ravi Das colony, the temperature drops. Winter in Delhi is short but here, in this slum colony in the south of the city, the cold bites hard while it lasts. The new year will bring little cheer. Most of the men work on the booming city&apos;s many construction sites. Others drive rickshaws, one of the Indian capital&apos;s most distinctive sights. The women sell vegetables or sew, earning enough to put a chicken in the pot a couple of times a month. At around 11 o&apos;clock on a Sunday night just over two weeks ago, Ram Singh, a 33-year-old school bus driver known as a troublesome drunkard, and his younger brother Mukesh headed back down the narrow lanes to the squalid one-bedroom brick home where they had spent the afternoon drinking. They cooked some dinner, argued briefly, according to neighbours who heard them, then all went quiet. The people of Ravi Das colony, named after a 15th-century saint, had little warning that they were about to be at the centre of a news story that has led bulletins for two weeks in India and across much of the world. That night, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student had been gang-raped on a bus in the capital. Nearly two weeks later, she died of her injuries in the Singapore hospital where she had been sent for treatment. On Monday, the Indian government said compensation of \u00a319,000 would be paid to the family of the still anonymous victim as dozens of high-profile new year celebrations were cancelled in Delhi and elsewhere. The police came for the Singh brothers 36 hours after the attack. They also wanted two others, Pawan Gupta, a 19-year-old student who helped his parents out on their fruit stand, and Vinay Sharma, a cleaner in a local gym. The men, once arrested, reportedly confessed quickly. They had, it is alleged, gone out with two others in Ram Singh&apos;s unlicensed school bus on a &quot;joyride&quot;. Cruising Delhi&apos;s streets they had picked up a woman and her male friend. As the bus continued along busy roads, they had battered the man into unconsciousness and repeatedly raped the woman, causing massive internal injuries with an iron rod, before dumping them near the city&apos;s airport. The police have now finalised a 1,000-page charge sheet for the suspects&apos; first court appearance, which is scheduled for Thursday. The death of the victim on Friday night led to an outpouring of outrage, anger and, often, shame across India. &quot;For what they have done, they deserve the worst,&quot; said Ram Devi, a neighbour of the Singh brothers, on Monday. In the often emotional debate in India over recent days many factors have been cited for the attack, only the most egregious among hundreds, if not thousands, of similar incidents that occur every year across the country. Poor policing, lax laws, embedded misogyny, even Bollywood film stereotypes have been blamed. Many have spoken of &quot;monsters&quot; or &quot;beasts&quot;. One newspaper described Ravi Das colony as &quot;the den of the rapists&quot;, &quot;Delhi&apos;s underbelly&quot; and &quot;a fertile breeding ground for criminals&quot;. Ram and Mukesh Singh grew up in the colony, neighbours say. Their parents were from Karauli, a remote and lawless part of Rajasthan, the vast western Indian state which, despite the romantic facade it presents to millions of tourists, is one of the country&apos;s poorest. Back in the early 1990s, as India started slowly booming, the parents had come to Delhi to find work and squatted what was then derelict land. They had three children, all boys. Like so many poor Indians, the family shuttled between their ancestral village and the city, where work and better educational facilities were to be found. Ram and Mukesh, unlike their parents, were literate. Both were in school until their mid-teens. Mukesh, about 30, was quiet, nondescript, a follower, according to neighbours. &quot;We had no trouble with him \u2026 But he&apos;d do anything to impress his older brother,&quot; said one teenage boy. It was Mukesh, a part-time taxi driver fired recently for indiscipline, who allegedly drove the bus during the assault. However, Ram was a drinker and a brawler whom other men in the colony frequently had to keep in line. Asha, his sister-in-law, told the Guardian Ram had recently fought with her husband. Ram Singh&apos;s wife died three years ago and a complicated affair with a neighbour made for tension locally. But Ram Singh did not harass local girls. &quot;He knew what trouble he&apos;d get if he tried it on with them,&quot; said Asha. &quot;This is a nice, clean neighbourhood with nice people living here,&quot; said Ram Devi. &quot;If there&apos;s a problem with someone or something we get together and sort it out.&quot; Out on the streets however, in the anonymity of a seething, overcrowded city, things were different. Two other men allegedly involved also come from the colony. Pawan Gupta, a relative said, had grown up in a temple in the remote rural town of Basti in north-eastern Uttar Pradesh, again one of the poorest parts of India. He had given up further education to came to Delhi to help his parents run their fruit stall but, still only 20, was hoping to go to college. He had &quot;fallen in with the wrong sort&quot;, the relative explained. Vinay Sharma, the son of an airport cleaner, was doing a distance college course in communications while working at the gym. The final pair accused in the case are an as yet unidentified 17-year-old and Aksay Kumar Thakur, a 26-year-old also from a remote, poor part of India, a village in the deep south of Bihar, an area known for brutal violence between castes, Maoist guerrillas and government forces, and against women. He and the teenager were recent arrivals in the city and had found work as helpers on Ram Singh&apos;s bus. &quot;They must have just got caught up in it. Or maybe being all together they went mad,&quot; said Asha. &quot;But we are very different people, good people.&quot; Certainly, Ravi Das colony is far from the pit of inequity and squalor portrayed by some local media. The narrow lanes are swept clean, the walls of the brick houses painted bright yellow, pink and blue. Plastic flowers decorate doors. There is, said one young woman proudly, drinking water twice a day, for an hour at a time. Clusters of electricity wires cling to posts, bringing enough power for a weak lamp or two and televisions on which the people of the colony watched news reports of the rape and its aftermath. As night gathers, the lanes are full of smoke from the wood-fired clay stoves cooking rice and lentils for dinner. Halfway between the seething city around it and the villages where almost all its inhabitants, including the alleged rapists, grew up, life may be tough and unpredictable in the colony but there is a chance of something better. Next door to the Singh brothers, now facing a possible death sentence for murder, lives 18-year-old Pana Anuraji. A cobbler&apos;s daughter, she is studying fashion. &quot;I&apos;m going to be a famous dress designer,&quot; she says brightly, as her mother stirs a smoke-blackened pot."}]}
